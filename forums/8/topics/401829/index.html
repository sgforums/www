              point of view</em></span></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">ALARM 
              CLOCK RING RING...7:30AM NOW.. alamak, yawnz, time to wake up go to school. So 
              sleepy, wish I could sleep more. Oh no, going to be late if I dun hurry. Ok go 
              toilet, take off my old school teeshirt n fbt shorts, step into shower. Bathing 
              time lo. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Then I blow dry my hair... n look into my big wardrobe, wonder 
              what to wear today? So many clothes sia... I choose a black mango racer back 
              tank top, n denim minishorts...hehe, my typical wardrobe. I like wearing 
              minishorts, chiu noe, sengkapor weather so hot...must wear sexy what. Also, got 
              nice legs n body must flaunt in sexy clothes, hehe, I hope some cute guys look 
              at me. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">I put on a cute cartoon printed panties, n pushup padded bra. 
              Aiyo, like most asian girls, our frontal ish like changi airpork runway.... dun 
              wear extra padding how can? Look like airport ish so unglam chiu noe? Hehehe XD. 
              Then I put on makeup...some face powder, pink eyeshadow n eyeliner, fake 
              eyelashes, some lipstick n perfume to make me smell good.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Now 8am 
              plus liao, I quickly run down the stairs to my big luxuriously furnished dining 
              room of my 3 storey house for breakfast. My pinoy maid, greet me, n wah, got 
              tasty breakfast all prepared. Papa n mama oreddy started to eat. I eat toast 
              with english blueberry jam n imported air flown french butter, scrambled organic 
              eggs, german sausage n bacon, yoghurt, strawberries n honeydew. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Yummy, 
              must need nice breakfast to start my day. After I say bye bye to my golden 
              retriver doggy, daddy send me to school, SIM, in his BEE EM DABALIU 7.30Li, on 
              his way to work. Short ride from our house at bukit timah...</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">reach 
              school just in time for lecture. Today ish principles of talkcockology, listen 
              to lecturer talk talk, so boring, so I sms n whisper to my girlfriends next to 
              me. We discuss later after school go where shopping. Maybe later want to go nail 
              spa n do manicure n make nail art n do pedicure to pamper my 
              toes.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">After lecture finish, ish lunch time. Later got one more 
              lecture, but we heck care, we dont want to go, hehe, I already asked those guy 
              friends help me take down notes... hehe guys will do all they can to please us, 
              just becoz we r beautiful n we sa jiao. We act cute n pitiful in front of them, 
              they will be at ur beck n call. Eee but sometimes guy can be too eager, they 
              take the wrong hint. I feel bad for rejecting so many guys who want to date 
              me... sorry I already taken, no chance, u poor dude. I only go for guys who got 
              fat wallet n drive n look handsome n tall.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">So me, angela n bernice decided to 
              go to Vivocity today for shopping. Everytime shop in orchard ion, taka, 313, 
              FEP, raffles city sian liao...so today go there.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">We take 
              taxi, n asked taxi driver keep the change coz we cant be bothered to keep the 
              coins in our COACH/PRADA/MIUMIU handbag...so heavy u know?</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Hmmm...today eat what? Aha...eat at crystal jade fine dining. We 
              go there, as usual, pretty ladies like us get good service, restaurant captain 
              attend to us n stand there patiently while we slowly decide what to 
              order.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Wa so many good food, all also want to eat, so order many many 
              lor. Got har gow, siew mai dimsum, steam garoupa fish, pork ribs, crabmeat fried 
              rice, stir fried asparagus with scallops.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">As usual, because we r ladies, 
              can't eat so much, so got many food left uneaten lor. But its ok, we can afford. 
              Today I treat, so I use the amex card which my papa give me to pay the bill of 
              $211 lor.</span><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">$211 for 3 person meal very 
              affordable right? N got many leftovers, many scallops, ¾ of the fish...maybe the 
              hungry restaurant staffs will keep for themselves eat. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">After 
              that, we go toilet n touch up makeup n lipstick...must look good 
              mah.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Now shopping time, so we walk walk. Many guys look at us because 
              we dress sexy n look beautiful n carry branded bag n look like a typical girl 
              which they want but cant get...haha pathetic guys, u poor chaps, can see but not 
              touch.... u have to earn a 5 figure salary first then come n talk 
              lah.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">go to many shops, like Forever21, Mango, riverisland, topshop, 
              ZARA, MPHOSIS, Pull &amp; Bear, GAP etc. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">as usual we like to browse through 
              n try on clothes, go inside fitting take wear n take picture. But most of them 
              time we dun buy, maybe out of 6 pieces, only buy 1. the poor sales staff have to 
              keep back the clothes we try on. Well, they r paid to do that arent they? Its 
              not wrong to try on but dun buy,....coz will only buy if the clothes fit n look 
              good on us. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Also went to look n buy some high heels n sandals from charles 
              keith, aldo.... n oooh... we went la senza to pick up a few pieces of 
              lingerie... must wear sexy lingerie inside us to boost our confidence n mood. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Sian, now 
              4pm plus liao... shop until so tired, have to carry our shopping bags ourselves. 
              Today my boyfriend working, I think he must be doing some major financial 
              transactions on the stock market, too busy to come n pick me up. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">We then 
              take taxi to a nearby spa saloon, which also serve nice coffee n pastries. So we 
              can eat n drink while they do our nails n toes. </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">After 
              that, I take taxi go home. Wah, tiring day. Its fun being a golden chiobu. 
              Tomorrow go shopping n walk around the mall again I guess. Fun leh. Papa always 
              give me too much money to spend, hehe. So many nice clothes n accessories to 
              buy. By the way, cant wait to pass my driving lesson becoz papa already bought a 
              Benz C180 in the garage for me... woohoo. Cant wait to ride that german 
              baby.</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;">Thanks for reading.</span></p>
