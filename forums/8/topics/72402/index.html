            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The Straits Times, 10 March 2004:<br><br>Carrots alone won't work; it's time for the stick, say several MPs, who want pressure put on married couples who don't want babies<br><br>By Tee Hun Ching<br><br>HAVING babies is a duty. Make that a duty to self, society and country.<br><br>Alarmed? You should be, if you are married and have no desire to procreate.<br><br>MPs like Dr Ong Seh Hong (Aljunied GRC) want to pump up the social pressure on such people whom he described as 'irresponsible'.<br><br>Yesterday, even as their counterparts continued pushing for carrots such as a five-day work week and cash incentives, Dr Ong and several MPs suggested it was also time to use the stick.<br><br>Indeed, the MPs argued passionately that procreation was a responsibility that people should fulfil regardless of sweeteners.<br><br>Adopting the most hardline stance among them all, Dr Ong emphasised traditional Asian values as he dismissed the common refrain that family planning is a personal decision.<br><br>Declared the father of three: 'Procreation is not only the duty of everyone, but also the responsibility of every citizen towards his family, parents, society and country.'<br><br>Those 'irresponsible' people who shun the stork, he said, should realise they would become a liability to the society in future.<br><br>To prevent this, he suggested making this group bear the costs of their old age by having them contribute to an account he called the 'Preventive Eldercare Account'.<br><br>The money in this account would then provide for their needs when they are old.<br><br>He said he believed that Chinese philosopher Mencius' words on filial piety - 'bu xiao you san, wu hou wei da' - still has relevance today. Translated, it means that 'of the three instances of unfilial behaviour, not having descendants is the worst'.<br><br>Mr Gan Kim Yong (Holland-Bukit Panjang GRC) also held out a Chinese phrase for those naysayers against children to ponder over - ai qing the jie jing. It means a baby is the product of love.<br><br>Marriage and having children came naturally to people of his generation without too much cost-benefit analysis, noted the 45-year-old father of two.<br><br>'Sure, there were problems and difficulties, but they add colour and richness to life. If you ask parents today, few of them would regret having babies despite all the difficulties,' he said.<br><br>He suggested an annual Love Campaign to add spark to the lives of young couples and help them appreciate the joy and fulfilment of having a family.<br><br>'It is like driving a car. We have the best engine, the lubricant is new and the tank is full. But when we turn the key, the engine does not come on because there is no spark in the chamber,' he said.<br><br>Dr Ong went a step further and proposed an all-out media blitz to promote family values.<br><br>Such messages, he said, could be transmitted through TV dramas 'highlighting the sorry plight of a childless old couple and the great problems faced by an ageing society'.<br><br>Joining in the chorus of MPs who lamented the erosion of values that led to having children being viewed less as a duty than a personal choice was Ms Penny Low (Pasir Ris-Punggol), who is single.<br><br>She said while children were a status symbol of sorts in the past, the reverse is true today.<br><br>The MP, who admitted she faced pressures to get married especially during Chinese New Year from well-meaning relatives, said: 'In the not-so-distant past, we had less to eat and wear, but we had more children to show. Today, we analyse and analyse the cost until we become paralysed by it.'<br></blockquote>Mr MP, what makes you think that your children will support you when you are old? You should be happy if your kids don't aim your CPF money when you are 55.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, again, this issue haha; i think like what they've just discovered, previously the govt gave too much carrots and too little education; i think besides just telling ppl abt their responsibility, the govt can show ppl <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">the beauty </span></strong>of having children...the love campaign sounds sensible; maybe they can help in teaching ppl how to prepare for the commitment of having children too; well, can have more commercials, instilling the "seed" directly or even subconsciously...<br><br>anyway, expecting yr children to take care of u seems ludicrous in today's society alrite; to change this, it's tough but it can be done. it all starts w the parents; if they're able to <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>mould their children in the right way right from the start</strong></span>, then it can be done. but even if they dun take care of u when u're old, the process of bringing up children can be quite enriching itself, compared to just living for oneself (or w one's spouse) alone... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
