His 300,000 baht bail which was placed by his mother will also be forfeited.<br><br>“I don’t know why he would run away as he had a fighting chance.”<br><br>Lim has his passport and it is not known if he has left Thailand.<br><br>He was arrested at about 2.30pm on April 24, shortly after arriving in Bangkok.<br><br>Thai police officers from the Crime Suppression Division said that the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agents had been monitoring Lim.<br><br>Lim had allegedly posted notices on the Internet offering US$200 for sex with a boy aged between 12 and 16.<br><br>The US officers had found Lim while they were trawling the Internet for paedophiles.<br><br>The Crime Suppression Division’s Lt Kitti said: “They contacted us and told us about the case. One of them acted as the pimp and we met him and the three boys at the hotel lobby.”<br><br>Lim is said to have chosen the boy – a 17-year-old student – paid 8,000 baht and taken him to his hotel room on the eighth floor of the Grand Hotel.<br><br>Lt Kitti said: “About five minutes later, we knocked on the door. He opened the door and looked shocked. The boy was sitting on the bed.”<br><br>Thai police Lt-Col Pol said: “The US authorities also told us Lim had also asked for sex with a young girl for another day.”<br><br>Two micro-cassette tapes – alleged recordings of Lim’s conversation while buying sex – have been submitted as evidence by an US Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer to the Thai police.<br><br>Lt Kitti said the tapes are now with the Thai Criminal Court. – The Straits Times/ANN</div>
