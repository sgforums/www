            <div class='col-md body'>wow,<br>someone could admit this online.<br><br>but what are the chances of "authorities" looking into this.<br><br>Raves...  ah well.. i think eeriegirl's point is right.<br><br>Raves are also places where you could profit by selling tickets. My fren bought a ticket at $25 and sold it at $175. Look at the profit.<br><br>I am very surprised that raves in Vancouver are so "high-tech". The ticketing is computerised and your ticket is actually a plastic card just like a normal credit card and info have been encoded on the tickets.<br><br>As for raves in Singapore. they might call it a Rave but wun be what it would mean in N. America. Just like a legal rave that happened in Vancouver 2 weeks ago. It was legal, but ppl who came brought illegal stuff, e.g. Vitamin E and Alcohol.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it's not about the drugz man, it's about the music...for a rave scene to really take of here we're going to need a bigger following of the electronic music scene before we venture into stuff like trance, hardcore, techno, DnB or jungle. at the moment singapore is just retro retro retro all the way, so i don't see that happening in the near future at all. and yeah, the government is this other really big issue too..sighz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sylph...that's my point...i would evnture to say that only about a very small percentile actually rave because of the music...the overwhelming majority rave to do drugs...<br><br>because when ur high like fuck everythign sounds the same...you play calssical you also will dance like siaow...<br><br>So it' very difficult to convince anyone of the value for raves anywhere except that the majoirty population likes to drug up...<br><br>Like i said, a praty is a party i definitely dun need the drugs to make me have fun..it's all internal man..<br><br>ride the cosmic waves baby...like Norrin Radd the Silver Surfer...<br><br>Besides raves are such anti-social events anyway....even when you go with a lot of people ro close freidns...you dope up and it really doesn't matter anymore...you basically are just partying with yourself and you just dance by yourself...noone is bothering with you anyway...so just becasue you are around a lot of people doing the same thing you might as well stay at home and still have excatly the same effect when u dope up.<br><br>ha-if ur not careful also u can take some seriously fucked up mix of drugs and get yourself into serious serious trouble....I took this really shitty concotion that was supposed to be acid once and i just hiot the floor and couldn't move for 6 or something hours...all i could manage to do was roll my head and shoulders left and right a bit...finally got up and could barley move my limbs...that was the last time i took anything...<br><br>just make sure u people dun have so bad luck....but then again i'm 25 and u all are a lot younger..so i have a lot of years that i've expereinced already..kekeke..so u onli will know youself when u experience it....everythign i write here will be be disregarded anyway as being an old fuddy duddy....<br><br>heh...just wait first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well ... if the whole point of going to raves is to get wasted, like firewire has pointed out, that can easily be done at home a) with your own music of choice (yay!) b) free of cover charges &amp; c) free of legal troubles. personally, i'm all for sensible, responsible &amp; moderated recreational dr*g use under the right circumstances, given that i don't have to deal with authorities telling me what to do, what to take and what THEY think is right or wrong for me. HOWEVER, as long as i'm in singapore, i'm willing to do whatever the hell they say because the consequences here are just too much to have to deal with. that's fine with me. i don't HAVE to do dr*gs here to have a fun night out. what -would- be nice is getting to listen to the music i like &amp; being able to party to it whenever i want. i mean no offense, not to direct this at anyone here who also likes dr*gs or whatever, but if i can't enjoy myself at a rave here it's because of all the people who go to one simply because they wanna get high, and not cause of the music. you think the government has any problem with people enjoying music? hell no...it's the people who listen it to simply because they wanna trip &amp; have fun..and pop pill after pill after pill just to enjoy themselves. at the end of the day; even if raves are allowed here, they will never be around for long because of the junkie scene that they'll<br>attract, which in turn will attract the legal troubles associated with dr*gs &amp; the way the party generation is now using them. moral of the story is, s*ngapore is NOT the place for dr*gs...&amp; if you wanna party, do it responsibly &amp; have the common sense to educate yourself about whatever you choose to use. i've been on the end of bad trips myself...heh...&amp; as firewire also said, it's not exactly something you look back on as one of the best memories of your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>firewire...that's a creepy story man. i've never had a bad experience smoking up, thankfully ... besides getting impure stuff that's been laced ... &amp; getting ripped off from your $$ is certainly bad enuff! to the best of my experience tho', the real danger lies with chemicals ... coz @ least with organic stuff ... you can actually check thru the packaging or whatever to see that it hasn't been tampered with. it's MUCH harder however to tell what chemicals go into pills or little tabs of paper ... always more of a risk there &amp; unfortunately testing kits aren't always reliable nor are they easy at all to buy from here. thank God for e-shopping &amp; the age of personal computing ... heheheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
