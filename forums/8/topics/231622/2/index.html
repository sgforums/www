IMO i feel those lectures where teacher call your names and need to tap card those must go. as for those lectures which just require you to tap card, just pass your friend the card and go.<br><br>hmmmm as for warning letters they will have to go through your mentor as well to see whether he wants to issue u the warning letter or not. its 2 warning letters before debarment. but after your 2 warning letters u cfm scared till come for every lecture already trust me.<br><br>you said you hate to study. i mean i believe 90% prolly don't like to study either. we're all in this together  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  try using some form of motivation like coming to school for your friends or smth. don't always think of it as coming to school for your diploma cert. if its attendance that you're really worried about, just give your friend (someone you trust to always go lectures) your admin card and let him/her keep it till u need it again. poly is really a time for freedom. do treasure your time here  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stop working if you can. If you only working for the extra money and not to support your school fees, I suggest you stop before you get burn out.<br><br>I was like you, working nights on weekdays and also working on weekends sometimes up to 15-16 hours without much rest, end up drinking about 3 cups of coffee to keep me awake everyday.  Work took up more time than my studies. Although I don't skip class, I end up sleeping through them.<br><br>I was working for my school fees and pocket money, so no choice lah. But going final year liao, my parents also want me to concentrate on my final year project and also I see that should have enough to support myself through the last year and so I quitted my job.<br><br>Now, I got more spare time to do my own things(go out with friends, etc) and  concentrate on my studies.<br><br>It's really not worth it to let work drag down your school performance, what for work so hard and earn so little and yet have to sacrifice your studies? For me, I feel that it is better to faster get my diploma and work in what I like (if possible) rather than work like a bull and earn not even $600 per month.</div>

This is not what a tutor is paid to do. As a professional he IS TO mark all scripts regardless of relevance or what and his work ethic is questionable. If he can do this to you, he definately can do it to anyone else.</div>
