            <div class='col-md body'>hahaha!! Finally you smokers will have to pay the price. I hate smokers and feel they are the low life of society. Orbi good! Hope the price increase more!! I believe the increase in price is because :<br><br>1. increase in public maintainence. because a collection of idiot smokers ( not saying every smoker but maybe just a handful ) are inconsiderate and take their cig and burn public places and litter their ash and cig butt all over the place. So our gov increase the duties on cig to compensate the poor Ah Soh doing the area cleaning. When i do area cleaning in camp at smoking point i always knn see cig butts all over the place and most smokers in my camp are either dumb and brainless or simply super lazy to keep their smoking areas clean. These are the idiots who spoil the market so blame them! I know, not all smokers are like that but still, the problem is there and the more considerate smokers must also pay the price.<br><br>2. discourage ppl from taking up the habit, espically little Ah Bengs. The 16 year old ban doesnt seem to be working. I see youngsters getting their hands on cig packs. Increase in price would be more painful to them compared to adults because with $1 lesser, either they dont smoke or dont eat. The discipline master in many schools are tired of catching students smoking in the toliet and would surely welcome the increase.Although some of u ppl might say the increase doesnt curb the problem, but it stills brings it down and that's good enough!<br><br>3. public complains from non-smokers. You know singaporeans very complaining one. Some ppl complain the smell get on their clothes while others just cant stand see little Ah Bengs act like they are king and set bad example to their children. Goverment have to give them an answer. I heard it is actually illegal to smoke in public place under any shelter. eg. bus stops and sheds. Most people also close 1 eye about this law. But YOU  smokers must understand that if you wanna f***ing smoke, please please please PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be considerate and do it away from non-smokers! I have asthma and is very very sensitive to smoke.<br><br>4. Health hazard to the smoker and people around him/her. As above, I have asthma and is very very sensitive to smoke. I gotta suffer while you enjoy your bloody cigrette. Unreasonable right? Often I would just move away but i think the smoker should take the initiative to move first. Smokers please, if u wanna burn your own bloody lungs, dont burn mine! Get lung cancer and heart disease. DIE EARLY!!  I DONT CARE!!! Just dont drag me down with you damm it! To more considerate smokers : THANK YOU!!<br><br>5. Fire Hazard. Hey, this is understood. You gotta pay the firemen some money for your selfish acts right?<br><br>There are many many more reasons but these are the top few. Come'on smokers, i would like to heard your side of the story and argue against these points. Let's keep the argument civilized shall we?</div>

I hate smokers and feel they are the low life of society. Orbi good! Hope the price increase more!! I believe the increase in price is because :<br><br>1. increase in public maintainence. because a collection of idiot smokers ( not saying every smoker but maybe just a handful ) are inconsiderate and take their cig and burn public places and litter their ash and cig butt all over the place. So our gov increase the duties on cig to compensate the poor Ah Soh doing the area cleaning. When i do area cleaning in camp at smoking point i always knn see cig butts all over the place and most smokers in my camp are either dumb and brainless or simply super lazy to keep their smoking areas clean. These are the idiots who spoil the market so blame them! I know, not all smokers are like that but still, the problem is there and the more considerate smokers must also pay the price.<br><br>2. discourage ppl from taking up the habit, espically little Ah Bengs. The 16 year old ban doesnt seem to be working. I see youngsters getting their hands on cig packs. Increase in price would be more painful to them compared to adults because with $1 lesser, either they dont smoke or dont eat. The discipline master in many schools are tired of catching students smoking in the toliet and would surely welcome the increase.Although some of u ppl might say the increase doesnt curb the problem, but it stills brings it down and that's good enough!<br><br>3. public complains from non-smokers. You know singaporeans very complaining one. Some ppl complain the smell get on their clothes while others just cant stand see little Ah Bengs act like they are king and set bad example to their children. Goverment have to give them an answer. I heard it is actually illegal to smoke in public place under any shelter. eg. bus stops and sheds. Most people also close 1 eye about this law. But YOU  smokers must understand that if you wanna f***ing smoke, please please please PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be considerate and do it away from non-smokers! I have asthma and is very very sensitive to smoke.<br><br>4. Health hazard to the smoker and people around him/her. As above, I have asthma and is very very sensitive to smoke. I gotta suffer while you enjoy your bloody cigrette. Unreasonable right? Often I would just move away but i think the smoker should take the initiative to move first. Smokers please, if u wanna burn your own bloody lungs, dont burn mine! Get lung cancer and heart disease. DIE EARLY!!  I DONT CARE!!! Just dont drag me down with you damm it! To more considerate smokers : THANK YOU!!<br><br>5. Fire Hazard. Hey, this is understood. You gotta pay the firemen some money for your selfish acts right?<br><br>There are many many more reasons but these are the top few. Come'on smokers, i would like to heard your side of the story and argue against these points. Let's keep the argument civilized shall we?</div></blockquote>seems impressive...<br><br>maybe you have a Cambridge masters in literature<br>with the mentality of a soggy cabbage..<br><br>i am a smoker myself... but there's no need to rejoice<br>in other people's fall.<br><br>Basically the way you put it is as if from your own biased<br>point of view...<br><br>I dont litter, I dont blow smoke in other people's face..<br>I'm of legal age..<br>is smoking wrong?<br><br>try sending your petition to the government to ban smoking..<br>watch your income tax ...GST..etc.. increase..</div>
