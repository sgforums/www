            <div class='col-md body'>More money for the civil servants also means a bigger tax at the end of the financial year.<br><br>For those in the private sector, we (the civil servants) pay the same for COE, income tax, road tax, GST, tv licence, utilities bills, phone bills too. Even there is no discount in interest rate for housing loans or car loans.<br><br>So if our employer chose to pay us a bit more pittance for our daily toil, it is just a matter of how much extra YOUR employer is willing to fork out for your annual contribution.</div>

Those who voiced out about the bonuses probably know how bad in comparsion the private sectors are.</div>

The perfomance bonus payout and promotion exercise for 2005 will be my litmus test for whether staying on is viable. I do not want to end up like those that gripe about their lack of recognition by management, lack of advancement etc etc but still squat in the CS spreading negativity, indirectly demoralising those around them etc. I have the misfortune to work with a few of these types. Sometimes I wish they'd put their money where their mouth is and just leave.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Some civil jus need to sit at their desks and type abit here and there....and get  tat kinda of bonus.<br>Dun tell me a regular in the army is working HARD in the camp. Talk Cock, planning, eye power, walk abit ( who the hell never walk b4 &amp; who the hell never chiong sua b4), jump here and there, Overtime is just to camp outside for days ( who never camp or doesnt bathe for days). They should get their bonus according to their ind performances. IF like tat, i think alot of sure cry, cos too many idle one inside .

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha.... that's all I can do as I sit here looking at all the posts.<br><br>I'm not one to say that all civil servants are i.d.i.o.t.s and are undeserving of their bonuses. Fine... Some of them slack away, but I think these are the minority.<br><br>It's really easy to complain. Why do we pay tax... why pay the $2 bank surcharge and give bank directors multi-million dollar bonuses? It'll never end!<br><br>Instead of complaining why others are getting somewhere... why don't these complain kings/queens just do something more constructive? Like WORK HARDER!!!</div>

Even civil servants have a sensed that the economy is not as rosy as reported. Even in the SAF, retirement ages have fallen, contract terms have shortened, entry salaries are lower and renewals of contracts are lesser.<br><br>If you want rosy promises, just keep listening to what the govt says. But I give you the reality --- all businesses are still cutting costs. The Civil Service escaped relatively unscathed through the economic crisis --- wage cuts for senior civil servants, entry salaries lowered only this year.<br><br>In reality, the govt is also cutting costs. And the easiest way to cut costs is to kick out older and expensive workers and replace them with cheaper, younger and more qualified people (those on new salary scales). Therefore you see all sorts of schemes coming out --- performance reviews, new initiatives, etc. together with headcount freeze /cuts. They do not want to pay huge retrenchment benefits, so they are using soft tactics to kick out those disgruntled people.<br><br>I read some naÃ¯ve post that one believe that one can transfer from civil service to SIA. That is certainly possible if you are some bigshot like Chief of Army. Else please join into the fray --- once you leave the Civil Service, you will come to know what the big issue foreign talent is about.<br><br>So while the govt is saying it will not leave behind the old and poor, you see quiet  retrenchment in the Civil Service --- people resigning due to workload, contracts not being renewed, etc.<br><br>To be sure, silent retrenchment happened to one of the power companies in Singapore under Temasek Holdings (know who is its CEO?), heard that 200+ people were offered good payment to leave --- they were THAT desperate to cut costs. Why no report and so hushed-up???

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe most people still get this wrong impression regarding the bonus and pay rise in the saf. i am a regular with the army as an officer. we definitely have performance bonus and it is based on your performance for that work year. fyi, there are some that do not get a single bonus cos they f*&amp;k up their job.<br>as for their annual pay rise, it is based on your performance too. if you performed well, your increment will be the highest in your formation, likewise, if you fail to perform, the increment will be minimal.<br>saf senior commanders have no qualms to terminate regular contract if they did not deserve to wear the rank/fail to do their job. so saying that ppl in the saf always eat snake, that is not true.</div>
