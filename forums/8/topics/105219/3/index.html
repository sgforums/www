            <div class='col-md body'>Having worked as a civil servant and now in the private sector, let me say something in fairness that the amount of bonus offered for govt sector is not much. Bare in mind that they cannot claim OT. Although civil servants' starting pay are a bit higher, private sector can claim OT sometimes up to double their basic pay, and that is not including allowances. That said, working OT also means sacrificing alot of personal time. its a case of u having the life to earn but not the life to spend the money u earned. Bonus wise, its normal for certain industries (aerospace and petrol chemical) to get 6-12 months bonuses during good times. Highest i have seen civil servants get is 3 months. Those that lament their pay or bonus low should ask are they prepared to work for their money? I went for many interviews recently and was told in one interview that i can make 4-5k a month but i still turn it down. Why? they say i have to work from 8am-11pm everyday mon-sun. And the rest of the time on standby if anything happens to my production line, activate to go back. So Private sector or civil servant u choose lor.</div>
