            <div class='col-md body'>Can students fall in love anymore?<br>Let me rephrase that question again, can students, most notably the male species, complete for love in this vast changing climate of globalisation? Look at the students in Singapore, unless their papas sit in the DBS directorÂ’s meeting, most of them are struggling to make do with their vocations and hurry out to meet their destiny with the virile green dollar and the kinky yen.<br><br>Marx decreed that society revolve around class structures. I couldnÂ’t agree more, but itÂ’s not the working class against the capitalist, but in my case, the students against the working class! And what are they competing for? ItÂ’s the golden 4 letter words, LOVE<br><br>I am speaking on behalf of my fellow poor male students. As part of our vocation, we canÂ’t support ourselves full time, (the burden of academia pursue) let alone go on a dutchless date! My fellow brothers in pen, how can we pursue love when we cannot even pay a decent meal for 2? Love letters and fanciful prose? I say, this can all go down the gutter when the word Visa and Mastercard appear!<br><br>I welcome fair competition among my peers with their fanciful blue BMW and the sleek silver Porshe. But darn, these are not my honourable brothers in pen but working class people driving those vehicles and chasing the gals in our school! I cry foul and those gals flick their beautiful hair at me and tell me pants are much sexier than jeans! I say, is love doom for us students? I do not even wish to go into foreign talents and their (male) impact on our (love) society! This is oppression and an infringement into our human rights (to love, on the male student part anyway)<br><br>Again, the great guru M mentioned the evil cycle of capitalism and I say the old man canÂ’t be truer! I am so bitterly exposed to this oppressive (depressive) phenomenon such that it had an adverse effect on my psyche. I endeavour to become part of the working class (rich jerk) so that I can repeat the trauma afforded to me during the heady days of school. And this, my fellow brothers in pen, is the evil cycle that we (male) students for generations are doomed to.<br><br>Revolution is in the calling! We must eradicate this evil and establish a classless (level) society (playing field). No longer must we suffer this indignity! The government wants more babies? I say, they must look into this problem promptly for if not, there will be no more willingly participants (male students) in their grandiose social project. WhatÂ’s the point of building more halls? Give us dating welfare (money)!  Arise I say! The time is ripe for us to revolt against this unfair system! No welfare (money) will more than not results in us not making more babies (sex). Thus, I say,<br><br>Male students of the world, Unite!<br><br>------------------<br>The heartless and souless fool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically,we are all animals who subscribe to Darwin's theory of evolution where the fittest survive.In today's context in Singapore,the female of the species select the male who they think will be able to provide a stable environment to procreate and pass down the family line so as to ensure their dynastic line is continued.The signs the female of the species look out for are signs of financial security eg car,condo,cash in wallet etc etc as these provide a sign that the male is able to provide for the female.This is akin to the peacock who preens himself to look his best to captures a peahen's attention.As students seldom are able to exhibit the signs of security that the females in Singapore are looking out for,it is ineveitable that they are destined to be extinct unless they do something to attract the females attention by garnering themselves a car,cash in wallet etc which can most probably come through entering the working world.That's life,a constant struggle to survive in this world<br><br>ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with you on that,Bochup.When i was still young and naive,i used to harbour dreams and believe in those things such a "love will conquer everything" etc etc.But as i grew older and experience life more and got to know more people.I realised that i was having the proverbial wool pulled over my eyes all along and i should have seen the world for what it is actually.A place where love does not exist in a vacuum,but must be able to co exist with other more  important factors.<br><br>There was a recent report where it was report that girls prefer to marry up instead of down.This shows that love i dependent on what kinda qualifications a person has.This is a true fact of life.How many degree holding ladies who are high fliers in their own line of work want to go with a guy who is an O level holder and who can't support a car and depends on the LTA for his transportation needs.This supports my previous post where the female will tend to go with the male of the species whom the females thinks is able to provide more security.This is just how society and evolution works,ehehe   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by moose (edited 27 November 2000).]</div>

The whole context of this thread can split up into 3 simple questions :<br><br>1)What do women want?<br>2)What do men want?<br>3)Age vs Wealth factor.<br><br>Let me tackle this point by point.<br><br>On point (1), I will assume the basis that there is an increasing equality between both sexes. Some critics might not agree, but it does not matter whether feminism is an issue. What matters, is that now, women have more say in what they want, as compare to many decades when they have to listen to their parents. They become more educated and decide to have increasing demands. However, these demands will change as time goes.<br><br>For a 17-21 year old gal, she does not really know what she want. For guys, it is always a risk to have a r/s with women of this age, because the gals are changing at this age. They would not want to bound themselves to anyone, and they would want to have fun, and on that level, they will prefer the so-called "jerks" than the "nice guys". The point is that someday this gal will mature into a 24 year old, and she stops having fun, and been introduced to the rites of life, she would want the security and the wealth, and hence it is not strange to see the kind of reply given by Tet, which is based on pragmatism. I was asking a few American Caucasian gals (all are postgraduates between 22-25) in the bar, why they don't go to club these days. They told me that it is a trend in US that after college school days, they stopped their days of being crazy and really settling down. Of course, they also conceded that some people still go to clubs even if they are 30s, but that significantly decreases.<br><br>On point (2), the situation becomes reversed for guys. The guys know what they want at a younger age. However, they have to juggle between career and women. When they have the women, and they have no career, the r/s will not last, because reality steps in. When they have career, but no woman, eventually, the r/s will last if they found one, because crudely in my own humble opinion, the wealth factor has dominated the r/s. Gone are those days with passionate love letters and romantic whims like kissing on the lift in Effiel Tower at Paris.<br><br>Finally on point (3), I recall about a point which I once trying to make in Tet's earlier thread about women being materialistic and pursuing wealth. The irony of the day is that when the man in her story become the rich guy, his values had changed, because he had grown bitter due to the circumstances. Perhaps, I am still a romantic on some level, I can sympathize with that, because I find myself growing towards that more and more. So, in the end, is it really money and power which will determine the gal you get? I urge you to think about this, guys. Well, my personal opinion is no. I will conjure a hypothetical scenario and ask myself what I want to do if I have that kind of power and money. So what if you can get her body and make her succumb to your will, there will always exist the day where u fall, and she ran away with another man. Romantic love will fade as age increases.<br><br>In an article entitled "Have you found your IT yet?" by Sumiko Tan even though I don't agree with her at times. She mentioned that there exist 4 kinds of people when it comes to a r/s. The first finds a soulmate early in life. She marries him, they set up a home, have kids, and their life's pretty settled from then on. I always envy this kind of r/s and found a lot in some of my ex-classmates. The second type moves from one relationship onto another, and the relationships are more often than not fraught with woes. Life is one roller-coaster ride as she soars with joy and plunges into misery. The third sort doesn't care for relationships, for she can be perfectly happy without a beloved by her side. Then, there is the fourth type, who dearly wishes to be involved with someone, but can't find the right partner. I belong to the fourth type...<br><br>Just my opinions which are of 2 pennies worth.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br>Passing by..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm..<br><br>I agree with moose...but...i feel that..a good career will be just a bonus to us..at least thats how i feel..<br><br>Frankly speaking, who doesn't want a good life? You can't blame the girls for being realistic...but...like what i've said..its just a bonus...do you guys honestly think that a girl will choose a jerk just becos he is rich ? The ans is most of them wouldn't...although i have to admit that there are some naive girls who think that they will be able to change them..<br><br>Personally i believe that a guy with a good career is someone who has goals and ambitions..he knows what he wants in life..therefore he will work hard and strive to achieve them...this type of man are attractive...i admire them..<br><br>But when it comes to choosing your husband..this is not the prority,i go for man whom i enjoy their company, trustworthy,honest..and most importantly..he loves me..i guess i'm still naive in the sense that i feel believe that...there is nothing love can't do...if he truely loves me, he will work hard to ensure that i'll lead a good life..love is the prority..i've asked myself this question before..what if a guy with a better career comes along...will i break up with my current bf...this question has been troubling me for quite some time..but i finally got my ans...he may be better than my current bf in every aspect..but one thing...he cannot compare with him..and that is the time we had spend together and the memories we share..the feeling of happiness when i am with him,the way i love everything about him,our understanding for each other...and the trust we have for each other...love and trust both needs time to nurture...this is something that is so precious that any amount of money wouldn't be able to buy..<br><br>As for what bochup had said...i guess after you have been in a relationship for too long...you will get so used to each other that you no longer feel the sparks becos you have taken her for granted..you believe that she will always be there..but what you have forgotten is that..she has become part of you already...try to imagine life without her by your side...try to think back to the times where you felt so strongly for her..i don't believe that love between the two of you has faded...it is still there...waiting for you to discover its existence again...alrite.. i am those who believe in ever-lasting love..just my opinion.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>what prodigal had mentioned...girls of the age range of 17-21, They would not want to bound themselves to anyone, and they would want to have fun, and on that level, they will prefer the so-called "jerks" than the "nice guys". I don't agree with that...personally i'm 19 years old...and i do know what i am in life..i go for long-lasting relationship , you have underestimated girls of our age...</div>
