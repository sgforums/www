            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i am a new guy here and i guess i found what was discussed very interesting so i just want to find out from people what they think about my opinions. Well sadly speaking from experience, I have come to the conclusion that its very dangerous to let your GF be friends with guys who approach them as things tend to happen.<br>When i controlled my GF she left me for a guy who was after her and nice to her. She told me that she would not have done so if i had given her the freedom to talk to others, My next GF did the same thing cause i gave her the freedom to do it. I trusted her but i ended end on the losing end. Sometimes i wonder if it is me, the gals i'm with or just gals in general. (i know alot of gals are going to say that this is not true but i'm sure the guys will agree that it happens and sadly quite often, esp when the guy is in the army.<br>For people curiosity, i am not a mean person, i do not treat my GF's badly and i am not very ugly either. My GFs always say that i make them dependent on me but honestly i never do (maybe its just the excuse)<br>Anyway, My second Question is that, does anyone think that if your other half is unfaithful to u once, the person will not do it again despite being sorry? I guess its like how a person will never change.<br>I'm sure gals also have such problems with their BF's but it seems that when a Gal does such a thing, she is desirable and the BF is wrong but when a guy does it, he is a bastard. Double standards will always exist and whether i like it or not, i think it is true (what do u think?)<br>Ok thats about what i have to say, I hope i did not offend anyone with this and i'm sorry if i did but please forgive me cause this is my first time and i'm not sure of the protocols. Thanks for reading this.<br><br></div>

After going out for 3 months, out comes a guy with very nice personality, who is financially stable and extremely nice to u...Ur bf is afraid that U will be "snatched away" by this new contender.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well in this new millennium, people tend to have higher expectation expecially gals. A guy must first try to know what his gf wants and likes. Giving  gf freedom is like flying a kite, must know when to let loose a bit so they wouldn't say you try to control them too much. There must also be time where you control them a bit, if not they will say that you don't bother to concern them at all. Well all that need observation and experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no, unless the guy I'm attached with is not nice to me.  i know many think that getting attached isn't marriage yet so what's the big deal if a mr right come bouncing along and a girl leaves her bf for him.  but commitment is commitment and getting attached should involved some of it.  if you still want to have second, third thoughts and alight the relationship bus anytime, maybe you should consider calling the relationship what it really is, just dating, or going out with each other....<br><br>and i do think that once a guy has been unfaithful to you, he's more likely to be unfaithful next time.  The stakes haven't changed, it's still me he stands to lose and he could risk it once, why not again?<br><br>------------------<br>Chase me, I'll catch you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yo Kr|sAnDrO, take a look at what naive and maya wrote. althought they might be acting like siblings or not as loving as u think they should be, that doesnt mean they will jump to the good and avaliable guy...and i  admire girls who show committment, they can put most guys to shame with their attitude.<br>i can sympathise with ur situations...hey, i have been in ur shoes before. Can only say wait for them to end their "destiny" before making urself known. Until then, no one can fault u for "losing" as churra have mentioned.<br><br>cheers<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i am a new guy here and i guess i found what was discussed very interesting so i just want to find out from people what they think about my opinions. Well sadly speaking from experience, I have come to the conclusion that its very dangerous to let your GF be friends with guys who approach them as things tend to happen.<br>When i controlled my GF she left me for a guy who was after her and nice to her. She told me that she would not have done so if i had given her the freedom to talk to others, My next GF did the same thing cause i gave her the freedom to do it. I trusted her but i ended end on the losing end. Sometimes i wonder if it is me, the gals i'm with or just gals in general. (i know alot of gals are going to say that this is not true but i'm sure the guys will agree that it happens and sadly quite often, esp when the guy is in the army.<br>For people curiosity, i am not a mean person, i do not treat my GF's badly and i am not very ugly either. My GFs always say that i make them dependent on me but honestly i never do (maybe its just the excuse)<br>Anyway, My second Question is that, does anyone think that if your other half is unfaithful to u once, the person will not do it again despite being sorry? I guess its like how a person will never change.<br>I'm sure gals also have such problems with their BF's but it seems that when a Gal does such a thing, she is desirable and the BF is wrong but when a guy does it, he is a bastard. Double standards will always exist and whether i like it or not, i think it is true (what do u think?)<br>Ok thats about what i have to say, I hope i did not offend anyone with this and i'm sorry if i did but please forgive me cause this is my first time and i'm not sure of the protocols. Thanks for reading this.<br><br>L-square: to ur first ex-galfren...i think u got suckered by her...even if u did control her and restricted her freedom, she should be the first to tell u abt so u two can tok it out...to give that excuse and leave u is just that - an excuse. she most prob did't like u anymore...<br><br>to ur second..i think u're a classic extremist...not wanting to repeat the smae mistake, u ended up being too liberal...so ur ex ended up with someone else...<br><br>yes..gals sometimes seem unreasonable and two-timing...u just have to be sensitive to their needs and ways...best is to observe someone and be their fren first...then get to know the person...when u're satisfied with her character, then u pop the question...no need to rush...coz if u jump into something like this, it'll never work out anyway<br></div>
