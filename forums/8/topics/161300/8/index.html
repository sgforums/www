            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Northwind:<strong><br>I agree with most of what you say. Even the bit about the other two books not being quite as good.<br>And I agree that certain facts were incorrect, such as the number of windows. He ALSO states in his book that there may be mistakes in research and he aplogizes - He uses the standard phrasing ALL research-based novels use for this.<br></strong></blockquote>Thanks... this is a great step forward from the <span style="font-style: italic;">"Wrong. You're taking things out of context and mixing and matching so that it agrees with your accusation of the man. "</span> statement you made previously.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Two things about the windows bit....<br>Simply because there are inaccuracies in some minute details, that does not mean you can throw it all out...And second...I am pretty sure that he had intentionally used the number as it reinforced the theme of the work...The information about venus, occult, etc...as portrayed in the book, as well as the information about the "female" aspect was also correct.<br>This is just my guess, however once again - it is a good NOVEL with good research, albeit errors.<br><br>And let me ask you this....<br>What if he did not put in the "FACT" page, and what if he did not make any errors, and what if the storyline used the whole mary/grail thing as a "theory" someone had in the story, but the feeling was that the person with this theory was crazy and wrong....?<br></strong></blockquote>Here's is the crux of the matter. If he had not put the fact page and did not purposely highlight the "facts", he would not have his book scrutinized this way.<br>You are obviously quite well informed, but most people are not. And most people do not even question what they read as long as someone says "it's a fact". The moment fact and fiction gets intertwined in this manner, it takes more than normal reading to splice these two aspects. So as we go to the book and read the 666 pieces of glass, an uninformed/misinformed individual will jump at the satanic conspiracy theory. It goes downhill the moment Brown does not specifically state which is fact and which is fiction.... and it goes through the entire book where such blurred lines occured.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Do you think the book would have sold so well?<br>And again - he states often enough the same thing I am always on about:<br>Learn more about your religion!<br></strong></blockquote>Of course not.... but then it depends.  Harry Potter has not such "factual" disclaimer. It still sells. So is it about the sales or is it about the research? Probably only Brown knows.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Let me pose another question.<br>How many people in the world would have knowledge about general symbolism, and its use in spiritual paths, art, etc. without the dvc? Definitely not as much....So the guy did what he set out to do. And if he was as interested in all his FACTS being FACTS, I somehow think he'd have written "speculative fiction", "alternative history" or just plain "history". But he didn't. He wrote a novel, with nice gems inside for those who care enough to do their own research.......[/</strong></blockquote>Exactly. This is what I meant in one of my above paragraphs, in that many people are uninformed. Having said that, Brown is not helping because of errors in research, and sometimes error in translation of symbolism. All this presented in the guise of factual research (which you too, have admitted, can be error in some instances)<br><br>Going back about learning about my religion. I do that constantly and I have some views about Christianity that differs greatly from some of my more traditional brethens. That does not hide the fact that Brown is either sensationalizing or misleading or both, issues of religious and cultural history.<br>Please note that I am not one of the go-by-the-book Christian. I read quite widely into comparative religion, history of religion, history of culture and all these from the non-Christian viewpoint.</div>
