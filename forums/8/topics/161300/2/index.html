            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, the Jesus character in the Bible sounds like a composite character. At certain times, he teaches people to be meek, kind, non-judging, give ALL your wealth to the poor..etc..and to treat others as they would want to be treated (something that religions way before christianity and 'jesus' taught), other times, he supports slavery, sexism, and exhibits other traits that were so extreme that they were unpublised the modern bible. I believe a person named Jesus probably existed, however the bible is never a good source of historical fact, given that it was written at a time where superstitions, ignorance and irrationality was prevalent. A time where scientific thinking and skepticism was non-existant.<br><br>More importantly I think all of us have to be critical and rational in our thinking no matter what's our believe. Fundimentalism is dangerous no matter what the religion we're in. I do believe in God, and I admit that the believe is irrational (cannot be explained or reconciled with logic). But I just simply have faith that a GOOD God exists; one that does not unjustly and sadistically send people to hell simply for their disbelieve. Sometimes I like to think of him as a Personal (i.e. with a personality) Entity. Other times, I'm more of a Pantheist. <a href="http://www.pantheism.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantheism.net/</a><br><br>This, is scary: <a href="http://www.reandev.com/taliban/" rel="nofollow">http://www.reandev.com/taliban/</a>.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you research on the basis of Dan Brown's "research" he supposedly conducts while writing the Da Vinci Code, you'll notice that he uses the Conspiracy Theory of a Frenchman named Pierre Plantard, who is a confidence trickster. Plantard was the one who came up with the "Priory of Sion" hoax, and he publicly admitted before a court that the Priory was a hoax he perpetrated because he was "bored" and wanted to be famous Frenchman. All this happened long before Brown ever set work to his book.<br><br>So whether or not you believe in Jesus, the Bible et al; the fact remains that the Priory of Sion is a hoax, so anything that latches claim onto it is obviously false as well.</div>

Although it was hard having to give up all that emotional security, especially after years of indoctrination.<br><br>It has to be either he is fully human or fully god. Since one of the attribute assigned to 'human' is mortality, whereas God is immortal. However if he is mortal, he can NOT be God, that which is immortal. If Jesus was immortal, his sacrifice would thus be meaningless. Since I believe in the rational concept of "non-contradiction", hence I could not believe in the notion of Trinity. If not then ANYTHING would thus be just as 'justisfible' without the laws of non-contradiction, and the world would then most certainly be a much sillier place than it is already.  Also since the laws of sins were supposely dictated by God, I don't see why he need to sacrifice himself to himself for the very purpose of circumventing that rule which he himselve made in the first place. But I still remain a Theist; or at the very least agnostic, and have learnt to accept that my believe is irrational. That's what faith is all about anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I don't wish to butcher the most valuable discovery ever made by mankind (which is, logic and scientific reasoning); like what those unethical Intelligent Design people are doing right now in the US. Fundamentalists always give religion a bad name.<br><br>Also, if anyone wishes to discuss religion, please try to be respectful towards the other person's personal believes. Present your reasons and arguments, not innane insults that is not even worthy of a 5 year old. Thanks.</div>
