However, they do not lead one to writing history books based merely on their assumptions, because they would be laughed out of everywhere... If you have interest on a subject, and you have some ideas - it's probably best to go and actually learn about it before claiming certain "truths"<br><br>The origin of the knights is very clearly documented in history as protectors of certain types of monks, akin to Cistern tradition. Soon after, the founding members of the knights become involved before, during, and after the "Crusades," and took on many activities other than demanding that non-christians "convert or die".<br><br></div>

Even the bit about the other two books not being quite as good.<br>And I agree that certain facts were incorrect, such as the number of windows. He ALSO states in his book that there may be mistakes in research and he aplogizes - He uses the standard phrasing ALL research-based novels use for this.<br><br>Two things about the windows bit....<br>Simply because there are inaccuracies in some minute details, that does not mean you can throw it all out...And second...I am pretty sure that he had intentionally used the number as it reinforced the theme of the work...The information about venus, occult, etc...as portrayed in the book, as well as the information about the "female" aspect was also correct.<br>This is just my guess, however once again - it is a good NOVEL with good research, albeit errors.<br><br>And let me ask you this....<br>What if he did not put in the "FACT" page, and what if he did not make any errors, and what if the storyline used the whole mary/grail thing as a "theory" someone had in the story, but the feeling was that the person with this theory was crazy and wrong....?<br><br>Do you think the book would have sold so well?<br><br>And again - he states often enough the same thing I am always on about:<br>Learn more about your religion!<br><br>Let me pose another question.<br>How many people in the world would have knowledge about general symbolism, and its use in spiritual paths, art, etc. without the dvc? Definitely not as much....So the guy did what he set out to do. And if he was as interested in all his FACTS being FACTS, I somehow think he'd have written "speculative fiction", "alternative history" or just plain "history". But he didn't. He wrote a novel, with nice gems inside for those who care enough to do their own research.......[/quote]</div>
