Plantard was the one who came up with the "Priory of Sion" hoax, and he publicly admitted before a court that the Priory was a hoax he perpetrated because he was "bored" and wanted to be famous Frenchman. All this happened long before Brown ever set work to his book.<br><br>So whether or not you believe in Jesus, the Bible et al; the fact remains that the Priory of Sion is a hoax, so anything that latches claim onto it is obviously false as well. </div></blockquote>I'm glad I wasn't the only one who read about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gablurr:</div><div class="quote_body">The same can be said of Buddhists who irrationally believes in reincarnation when they could not possibly have knowledge of that with a reasonable level of certainty. No religious believes can be rational. But religion is one of the way which we humans evolved to deal with the unknowns like our innate fear of a permenant 'death'. Though it is also important not to loose sight of that fact me thinks.</div></blockquote>I'd have to say that Buddhism is actually one of the most rational systems.<br>"Irrationally believes in..." There is a very logical and rational argument behind what the original sakyamuni and his fellows spoke of. I am not saying it is the truth. In the same way that you say religion is merely a way to deal with the unknown... It can easily be said that "permanent death" is also an unknown. No one has had a "permanent death" and then come back to say - it's really just black empty nothing forever, or it's for sure the pearly gates, etc. (I am not talking of 'near-death experiences' here, but merely playing with your argument).<br><br>And I'd also like to point out that religion and spirituality were the grandfathers to modern day science and medicine.<br><br>Religion and spirituality have brought out specialized operations of elite intelligence agencies around the world.<br><br>Religion and spirituality have brought out some of the world's best art.<br><br>Religion and spirituality have brough about a great many things...Besides just "dealing with fear of permanent death"</div>
