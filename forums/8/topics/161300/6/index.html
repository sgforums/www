            <div class='col-md body'>If indeed Jesus had a daughter then it had to be conceived after he was crucified. The logic is simple, his sacred duty was to shed blood to wash away all we human sins. By that it means to perform that task he cannot contaminate his blood with any human cuz they are now labelled sinful. If he violate that he would have defeated G*d purpose in sending his only Son to die for our sins.<br><br>However after he resurrected and completed his task, he can by all means copulate and have babies which I believe is possible. About Mary Magdalene being his wife it is possible also assume they do not copulate until the sacred task is completed. I read some say at point of cruxifixion, she is already pregnant? That is impossible cuz it will violate the reason in the above paragraph  or it is only possible but the father of her baby is not Jesus himself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know, actually, we won't know the truth. Maybe, the truth is that the Bible might be wrong.(no offence) Maybe the book was right? Somehow Jesus had a daughter, Mary Mangdalene was his wife, Knight of Templars existed? Who knows for sure.That's what make History fun. =D<br><br>The world surrounding us is a mystery. I actually like having these kinds of topic, as it shows you different opinions by other individualist. That's what a forums is for. To socialise, share opinons about certain topics etc etc. (im getting out of topic i know.)<br><br>Well, i might not be a Christian, but i somehow am fascinated by the book.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chin Eng:</div><div class="quote_body">actually it's implied very strongly in each book, in the preface. It goes something like: the events are fictious but the premises behind the events are real.... otherwise why would the Catholic church responded, protestant writers wrote tons of stuffs, plus people here in EH keep posting the "facts" behind the books. Not to mention his TV appearances and his refusal to back down from his claims.... His claims are a lot stronger that the typical "Base on a true story" claim that we might find in some movies.</div></blockquote>Wrong. You're taking things out of context and mixing and matching so that it agrees with your accusation of the man.<br><br>He clearly states it is a work of fiction. It is a novel. There are certain undisputable "facts" that he uses in the novel, and twists them around, becuase....it's a novel....There are zero "claims".....<br>He has talent, because it's best-selling. Not to mention he did much more research about the various topics than most people here will ever do...<br><br>In all his public appearances he states what I've said above. His comment about the "outcry" was that it hopefully pushed more people to embrace their faith by futher study.</div>
