Although it was hard having to give up all that emotional security, especially after years of indoctrination.<br><br>It has to be either he is fully human or fully god. Since one of the attribute assigned to 'human' is mortality, whereas God is immortal. However if he is mortal, he can NOT be God, that which is immortal. If Jesus was immortal, his sacrifice would thus be meaningless. Since I believe in the rational concept of "non-contradiction", hence I could not believe in the notion of Trinity. If not then ANYTHING would thus be just as 'justisfible' without the laws of non-contradiction, and the world would then most certainly be a much sillier place than it is already.  Also since the laws of sins were supposely dictated by God, I don't see why he need to sacrifice himself to himself for the very purpose of circumventing that rule which he himselve made in the first place. But I still remain a Theist; or at the very least agnostic, and have learnt to accept that my believe is irrational. That's what faith is all about anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I don't wish to butcher the most valuable discovery ever made by mankind (which is, logic and scientific reasoning); like what those unethical Intelligent Design people are doing right now in the US. Fundamentalists always give religion a bad name.<br><br>Also, if anyone wishes to discuss religion, please try to be respectful towards the other person's personal believes. Present your reasons and arguments, not innane insults that is not even worthy of a 5 year old. Thanks.</div></blockquote>o please when I said that maybe I should state something clearer here I should said "he was human" and now he is god.Jesus came down and suffer for our sins as human and return to kingdom of heaven after he did and became god.</div>
