            <div class='col-md body'>Wow so many constructive comments.... just a few more questions...<br><br>1) For the MEN not "gentlement" which should cover the majority. You guys comment about time, in a sense "if you are ready". However aren't you scared of the thought of not being able to find a wife at all and settling down at the ripe age of say 45 and having your first kid at an aging 46-47 and having him attend college/university when you are 65 or so... your retirement years spent working for collge fees.... thats where I am getting at. Financial worries of getting married too late. Nor being able to see grandkids and such... well the notion sounds kinda stupid huh... even I am still trying to escape the pondering.<br><br>2) Well for the ladies out there. Gals since I am not a female and will not try to predict what the other sex might think instinctively. By gut feeling and what other females groupies say; Do females really get more desperate as they age and then to a certain point in their life totally give up the instinct of getting hitched?<br>So when would be a good time to get hitched and the lastest time.....<br><br>Sorry about the specifics...I am currently conducting a sociological analysis for a class.</div>
