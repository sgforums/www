She follows the sweet mystery in life and this spiritual path never cease to amaze even the closest to her.<br><br>What carries Sunflower through life is her own special belief that all will be taken care of. Her determination and will power is a rare show of faith and belief. Having escaped from her first Lebanese husband from Abu Dhabi, armed with nothing but her 2 children, she returned to Singapore and with tears written a poem "Let me enhance Worldwide Unity with share, care and love by understanding people's need"<br><br><strong>Let Me Enhance Worldwide Unity With Share, Care And<br>Love By Understanding People's Needs. </strong><br><br>God I am not, but an expression,<br>And a gift of God.<br>Saint I am not,<br>Nor a Saint would I try to be.<br><br>An ordinary being I am,<br>Born with qualities true,<br>To work for my country's needs,<br>And the aspirations of its people.<br><br>At times I am not what you see or what I am,<br>With time I hope you will understand me.<br>Though I like not its sham, drudgery and broken dreams,<br>This world still is a beauty shining with Â‘welcome beams.<br><br>In fact I am contended and very happy,<br>I am still alive and free,<br>Especially on my return to Singapore,<br>Where many duties await me.<br><br>My devotion and loyalty are strong and even mighty,<br>That I may contribute fully to our lost society.<br>Let us not lose another twenty-five years,<br>If you can lend me your ears,<br><br>My special task is help us to achieve an identity,<br>To foster the peopleÂ’s happiness and unity.<br>This great mission that I shoulder, will it be too big for me I wonder?<br>Am I ready, to take on such a great responsibility?<br><br>To achieve what I feel God wants of me,<br>The peopleÂ’s support and understanding I seek.<br>The only answer to counter I believe,<br>Is the fostering of Universal LOVE as our Belief?<br><br>Religion is pure and good,<br>If there is only ONE to believe.<br>It can be mean and nasty,<br>When different sects contend to lead,<br><br>Please listen carefully to me,<br>Lend me your ears if you are not too busy,<br>Your full attention I need,<br>To understand all my yearnings and beliefs.<br><br>To reach our goal of unity,<br>LetÂ’s build with one identity,<br>Preached goodness, give kindness,<br>Conducted in fairness, strive for Inner Happiness.<br><br>-<span style="font-style: italic;">To grow strong roots of true unity;<br>Act in them is our first necessity</span> - Sunflower 1983<br><br>(To Continue in Section 3...)<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

I know that my high ideology to create a spiritual renaissance city with a Church, Mosque, Chinese Temple, Hindu Temple and a Synagogue standing side by side each other will be too far fetch or close to impossible to realize therefore, I just settle for the smaller dream and this make me very happy. The MM website can also help me achieve my end objective and that is to bring across the understanding that Lee Kuan Yew whole life is about fostering a harmonious society.<br><br>As a people and nation we need to bridge the great divide and MM website is an ideal place to do so. We are a free country and as you have notice a lot of other forums had said many unkind things about him, so this website is for people who want to say some good words to him. I would appreciate very much if all of you can allow me to have my little dream come true. I sincerely hope all of you could support me and if you share the same feeling with me that MM did really contribute in the betterment of our society please invite them to sign in to show our appreciation as a people and nation. With all your support I am confident that we could compile a small book of good wishes to present it on his birthday.<br><br><a href="http://happybirthdaymmlee.com/guestbook.php" rel="nofollow">http://happybirthdaymmlee.com/guestbook.php</a><br><br>Thank you very much.<br><br>Love, light, peace and harmony<br>Sunflower<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------</div>
