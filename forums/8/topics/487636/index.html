              <p>Hi All</p>
              <p>I was reading an article in yahoo about the world's oldest man (source - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/the-worlds-oldest-man-just-turned-112-whats-his-110168236777.html"> https://www.yahoo.com/health/the-worlds-oldest-man-just-turned-112-whats-his-110168236777.html</a>)</p>
              <p>One of the posts in the article claims that longevity can be achieve through TCM, anyone here have any information on this claim?</p>
              <p>edit: dont seem to be able to post the image so <a href="http://i929.photobucket.com/albums/ad135/itakeitupmyass/Untitled.jpg">link</a> insteadÂ </p>
              <p>Full text of the post below:</p>
              <p>According to TMC (Traditional Chinese Medicine) which the Japanese and Korean also practice, the main cause of aging in men is the male essence.<br><br> To have a healthy and long life, the male essence must be suck out of the "male root" and ingested by a female (who fulfill certain requirements) on a daily basis.<br><br> the requirements for the female are<br> 1. the female must still retain her "blossom" (American equivalent of a "cherry"). this is an "elixir" (hormonal) issue as females who have had their "blossom" plucked ("cherry" popped) will develop a certain "elixir" (hormone) in their body and thus be not able to suck out the male essence from the "male root"<br><br> 2. due to this "elixir" (hormone) problem, the selected females must also be as young as possible as females who have reach their "developmental" age (puberty) will start to secrete this "elixir" (hormone) in their body. For best effectiveness, females under the age of 10 (9 in western years as Chinese starts at age 1 at birth) is recommended. Having more than 1 female who have reach their "developmental" age (puberty) involve in the treatment per "new moon cycle" (month - 35 days) will drastically reduce the efficiency of the treatment.<br><br> 3. after ingesting the male essence, the female must rest for a period of one "new moon cycle" (month - 35 days) before performing the treatment again. This is to allow the ingested male essence to be slowly absorb and removed from the female. If the female is to perform the treatment before resting for one "new moon cycle", the treatment for that entire "new moon cycle" is considered to be "wasted effort" for the male patient. There is no known effect for the female.<br><br> Even though the text above is known to eastern medical practitioners for thousand of years, it is very difficult to put it into actual practice due to the costs involve for long term treatment,<br> 1. acquiring large number of preteen virgin females (min of 35 a month)<br> 2. clothing and feeding said females<br> 3. keeping the females in a virginal state<br><br> Only the ancient Chinese kings/emperors have come close to applying this treatment as they have the resources of the entire nation to put the treatment into practice<br><br> They were still ultimately unsuccessful due to<br> 1. while they have thousands of wives and concubines, there is no way of confirming their virginity and age as the females come from all over the world.<br> 2. while the public is restricted from entering the palace and all male servants in the palace are castrated, there are still instances whereby government officials working in the palace have affairs with the females</p>
