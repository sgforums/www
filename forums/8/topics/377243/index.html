              <p><strong>Monday, 28 September 2009 </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Source <a href="http://yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/2817-we-deserve-better-thoughts-of-a-technician">: http://yoursdp.org/index.php/perspective/vantage/2817-we-deserve-better-thoughts-of-a-technician</a></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My name is Amin. I am a technician in my early forties, married with
                                  three school-going children. I tied the knot with my beloved Fatimah at
                                  the age of 28. My wife used to work as a clerk in a statutory board but
                                  is now my minister for domestic affairs.<br> <br> <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>We live in a four-room flat which we bought some years ago in the
                                  northern part of Singapore. I am servicing my flat installments through
                                  my CPF.</strong></span></p>
              <p><br> Two of our older children are in secondary school while the youngest is
                                  in primary four. <span style="color: #339966;"><strong>I travel to my work place by motor bike to escape the
                                  hassle of travelling by feeder bus and the MRT.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>I am often told, not too subtly by government and union leaders, that I
                                  should consider myself fortunate because I am still gainfully employed.</strong></span> <strong>Although my monthly income is about $2,000 my take home amount is less
                                  than $1,700. </strong><br> <br> Besides putting food on the table <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>I also have to take care of other
                                  expenses</strong>,</span> which include my c<strong>hildren’s school expenses, utilities,
                                  transportation, etc. Occasionally we have to cope with the unexpected
                                  such as when the children fall sick. </strong><br> <br> <strong>At the end of each month we can barely make ends meet. </strong><br> <br> Life in Singapore is becoming <strong>more and more expensive</strong>. It is really<strong> tough to raise a family</strong>. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>My wife and I also make it a point to keep in
                                  touch with our elderly parents and chip in whatever we can to make
                                  their retirement less painful. </strong></span> <strong>We pray very hard that we never have to
                                  be hospitalized because we cannot afford the expenses. </strong><br> <br> I am nonetheless supposed to be "fortunate". <strong>The frightening thing is
                                  that there are other ordinary workers who earn even less but have
                                  financial obligations no less daunting than mine. </strong><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>But are we not supposed to be living in the First World and enjoying
                                  the Swiss standard of living?</strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">Every now and then we are told that
                                  Singapore is number one in something or other. Our port is the world’s
                                  busiest, SIA is the number one airline, our so-called sovereign fund is
                                  among the biggest in the world etc, etc. </span><br></strong> <br> <strong>I used to feel proud of these achievements</strong>. But over the last couple of
                                  years I have begun to have second thoughts. I ask myself <strong>what have
                                  these achievements got to do with me? <br><span style="color: #008000;"><br> The fact that Changi is number one really has nothing to do with me.
                                  The fact that our reserves amount to a few hundred billions has done
                                  nothing for the average Singaporean like me.</span></strong> <strong>We are still ourselves and
                                  still toiling away day in and day out for an income that is not
                                  commensurate with the amount of work we put in.    </strong><br> <br> <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>On the other hand, our ministers are the most highly paid in the world
                                  as their salaries are pegged to the country’s top earners. </strong></span><br> <br> Worse, <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>we now have to compete with foreign workers who threaten our
                                  livelihood. </strong></span>We also have the largest number of foreign immigrants
                                  percentage wise. No ordinary worker – at least the people I know –
                                  feels secure with his or her job. <strong>Any talk of increased wages will
                                  inevitably be countered by the threat of being retrenched. </strong><br> <br> <strong>The temptation for employers to hire cheaper foreign labour is too
                                  attractive to resist. There is absolutely no job security for us. </strong><br> <br> Should we lose our jobs we are expected to downgrade. This is what I
                                  don't understand,<span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong> we are supposed to be No. 1 in this and that but we
                                  constantly face the propsect of having to downgrade.  </strong></span><br> <br> Worse many have to resort to begging and queueing for free food. This
                                  is our country. <strong>We have served our country in many ways. Our parents
                                  too have done their share in making Singapore what it is today. <span style="color: #008000;">Surely
                                  we deserve better. But alas this is the real situation that exists in
                                  Singapore today. </span></strong><span style="color: #008000;"><br></span> <br> A Government leader tried to make us believe that I as a Malay enjoy
                                  special privileges under the constitution.<strong> In fact we Malays have not
                                  received any special treatment.<span style="color: #ff6600;"> We identify ourselves with Singaporeans
                                  of other races and share the same hardship as all other citizens</span></strong>. <br> <br> Unfortunately, o<strong>ur loyalty to Singapore has always been questioned to
                                  the extent that we have been deprived of many opportunities to serve
                                  our nation.</strong> But despite this we will join our fellow Singaporeans and
                                  put our shoulders to the wheel to build a better nation for all. <br> <br> <strong>We see little hope for a better life in Singapore unless there is a
                                  drastic change in the way this country is being run. What good can our
                                  country’s multi-billion reserves do for ordinary people like us?</strong> <strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">We are
                                  beginning to feel that the Singapore of today is only meant for the
                                  rich and powerful – many of whom are not Singaporeans.Ordinary
                                  Singaporeans like myself exist only to serve their interests. </span></strong><br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">We truly long for change</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Ordinary Singaporeans deserve to be treated better in our own country.<br></span></strong> <br> <em>This piece written by Mr Jufrie Mahmood is an amalgamation of several discussions with ordinary Singaporeans.</em> </p>

              <p>Yeah i feel for you as a worker mate. It sucks.</p>
              <p><br>I hate the idea of working for below minimum wage (hell there is no minimum wage here) and i dislike the idea of ministers eating all the pie, million dollar salaries and spending money in france for cooking lessons! ANd not being made accountable to the electorate; i.e. You people.</p>
              <p>But i think the majority of you are satisfied and good, otherwise things would change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So my only advice to our technician friend; is to suck it up, love it or leave it.<br>Or petition and await for things to change.</p>
              <p><br>If you want higher wages and a minimum wage, you must have corporatized wage bargaining with free unions. From what i understand there are no free unions in singapore yes?</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you're only hope is to get your children into the "elite" category through education and merit.</p>
              <p>Peace.</p>
