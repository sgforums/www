            <div class='col-md body'>I am never doing business with Yxxx Txx Mxxx of P** N** T** Pte Ltd.<br><br>I am utterly furious and apalled at his sales ethics. A year ago, my friend purchase 5 copies of Trend Micro PC-cilin on behalf on her company from P*** N*** T*** Pte Ltd.<br><br>Now, the software needs updating. Lo and behold, Yxxx Txx Mxxx from P*** N*** T*** Pte Ltd calls her up, says that from his records, their anti-virus license has expired, and would she like to renew?<br><br>So she said yes.<br><br>He sent her a quotation for $69 per license. Now, she's a noob at this kind of thing. She trusted him when he said its for 'renewal'. She thought 'renewal' meant that she would have to get the 2007 version and re-install.<br><br>But he sends her the same 2006 version she already bought! And then when she questioned him, he hesitated then said that when she buys this 2006 version, there's a free upgrade, just have to go online. BUT SHE ALREADY HAS THE 2006 version with free upgrade! She bought it from them a year ago! Its IN his records!<br><br>And when she questioned him that since he called her based on his records, then he would know she already has the same products, so why sell it to her again?<br><br>He just kept quiet. Didn't want to talk to her anymore.<br><br>Argh! The injustice of it all!!!</div>

Lo and behold, Yxxx Txx Mxxx from P*** N*** T*** Pte Ltd calls her up, says that from his records, their anti-virus license has expired, and would she like to renew?<br><br>So she said yes</blockquote>First part - antivirus license expired.

That's an upgrade. So it's totally wrong.<br><br><blockquote>But he sends her the same 2006 version she already bought!

Its IN his records!<br><br>And when she questioned him that since he called her based on his records, then he would know she already has the same products, so why sell it to her again?</blockquote>According to Trend Micro's website, they have to buy the product as part of the renewal.<br><br><a href="http://esupport.trendmicro.com/support/viewxml.do?ContentID=EN-1033874&amp;id=EN-1033874" rel="nofollow">http://esupport.trendmicro.com/support/viewxml.do?ContentID=EN-1033874&amp;id=EN-1033874</a><br><br>So in all, nothing was wrong throughout the whole sale. Nothing was unethical, it's just the users.<br><br>When I use the word "throw", I know pretty well I could stir up feelings. There's no siding with anybody, facts will be facts.<br><br>Neither did I say you are against Trend Micro. Why are you so fast to defend against that?<br><br>Either way, take it as a lesson learnt. In this world where money controls, if you don't read, you will lose. Even if it's a trusted product. Your friend's case is already a live sample for us.</div>
