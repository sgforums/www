If it's for those small hanky panky things then u can forget about it. if lets say for something that have caused u a lot more than that, then u should be teaching him a lesson rather than u becoming him!<br>All this fictional stories can be seen on TV's if u happened to follow the dramas.<br><br></div>

I didn't expect him to laugh at me at times like this so i told myself that I must laugh at him real loud when it's his turn. I waited patiently and indeed this day arrived. However, I can't bring myself to laugh at him. I felt that he is pitiful and he doesn't deserves to be treated the way he treated me.
