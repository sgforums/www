I think your fren mistook the Tag Heuer Calibre 36 with Omega. The Tag Heuer Calibre 36 is essentially a Zenith El Primero 400 movement. The fastest beat movement to date in 36,600 bps. Most watches beat at 28,800 which are the ETA based modules. The Zenith El Primero  were used in other big brands like the Rolex Daytona Comosgraph series, Panerai Luminor Chornographs<br><br>I attached some URL links for u ppl to read up abt the Omeage Speedmaster, the first watch on the moon.<br><br><a href="http://www.speedmaster-mission.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedmaster-mission.net/</a></div></blockquote>Not far off the mark, one-niner, but just a couple of things:<br><br>- I do believe that Omega's movements are not exclusively from Lemania - for example, the Seamaster's cal. 1120 movement is a reworked ETA 2892/A2<br>- ETA movements are not the only ones with a 28.8 kbph beat - Rolex's in-house 313x movement, which powers most of their range, also runs at the same speed.<br><br>I've just had a quick glance through, and while I've seen mention of PP and JLC, I'm quite surprised that nobody's mentioned Vacheron Constantin or A.Lange &amp; Sohne yet.<br><br>The dress watches that these houses tend to produce are a bit fragile for my liking, since I tend to be somewhat careless.  For the moment, my Rolex Sea Dweller does the job just fine - it goes with anything from suits to cargo pants, and the 3135 movement, not to mention the case, is easily one of the toughest around.  I've got a Datejust as well, but the gold parts scratch very easily, so I usually reserve it for occasions like weddings.<br><br>TAGs and Omegas are admittedly nice watches, but within that cheaper-than-Rolex-but-more-expensive-than-Seiko range, IMHO brands such as Zenith and Oris represent better value for money.

Sure, you can browse watch sites such as TimeZone to check out watches, but nothing, I mean nothing, can substitute for actually trying them on.  Case in point: watches like Panerais, Breitlings and some Omegas (e.g. Planet Ocean) all look great in photos, but it's not until you strap one of those bad boys on your wrist that you'll see if it's too big for your wrist, or if it's too bulky to wear with your long-sleeved shirts.  Do your initial research on the net, but at some point head down to the shop and try it on.<br><br>Anyway, here's a shot of my daily wearer.

The Panerai craze been heating up and the prices ain't go down for sure. The only thing holding me back from commiting the purchase of a Panerai is the metal itself. I'm a pretty rough person, beating up my watches, i can't bare to see my PAM being scared by all theknocks i can subject it to.The alternative is the titanium version which retails for $2,000 extra (madness) And if u been following timezone.com, quite a number of ppl are pretty dissed with the service and the way Panerai is being run after being bought over.<br><br>Well how the coporation wish to milk their cashcows, we consumers don't really have a say right in this every changing world *sigh*...<br><br>Hey why didn't u consider a JLC Memovox ? they make gd travelling watches as well.</div>

Their product development moves at glacial speeds, and some days you have to wonder what's going on in their designers' heads.  The Green Sub is a pathetic attempt at celebrating a 50th anniversary.  Putting a Triplock  crown on the 50th anniversary edition GMT was a good idea, but they've chosen to make it only in 18K, not SS or a mix.  Personally, I'd love to see them bring white dials back on the GMTs.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by one-niner:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey why didn't u consider a JLC Memovox ? they make gd travelling watches as well.</div></blockquote>Yeah, I did take a look at it, but the GMT II's lines are cleaner.  It's a matter of personal preference, I suppose.</div>
