He along with Mr Parmigiani are independent makers. Frank Muller watches scream loud and has made quite a nice fashion statement especially among the ladies. Their Crazy Hours been copied by quite number of other manufactuers including their one of the fav. models Banker series.<br><br>If u like rectangle faced pieces, u can consider Parmigiani Fluerier. A master watch maker back in swiss, most famous for  restoring Breguet's sympathique clock. His movements are designed inhouse and Chopard LUC range have some of his watch movements in them.<br><br>With regards to the Omega and TAG Heuer movements,which model watch does your parents own ?

I heard there is a limited number available. SO exclusive that you arent allowed any personal phtos of it.</div></blockquote>For starters, the Tourbillion was invented 200 odd yrs back by A.L Breguet. The main problems with mechnical watches was the effects of gravity affecting the accuracy of the movement in the vertical and horizontal planes meaning when the watch is not always lying flat on the table but being worn in a position ever changing.<br><br>So in an effort to maintain accuracy along these planes, Bregeut invented the tourbillion,where the escapement movement actually sits in this little cage called the tourbillion cage and its tuned to rotate once every 3 mins ( not very sure of the time diff) to cancel out the effects.the invention was patented and not very well used in watches due to the craftsmanship invovled in shaping the small cage and placing the entire escapment on the cage. therefore its almost the peak of a master watch maker to be able to create a tourbillion movement.<br><br>Back in 2003, Frank Muller stunned the world by releasing the Revolution 2 during the 2003 Basel Fair in Swiss.It was the 21st century tourbillion with 2 rotating axis both on the vertical and horizontal axis.<br><br>But since then ..almost every watch manfacturer claims a tourbillion watch as their crown jewels. Well for many of these companies, it certainly is a new age in horology, but many ppl in the industries are pretty sore at the piece of the tourbillion pie fasico.<br><br></div>

Being a military junkie back then ..Sincere displayed their Panerai Luminor Series in a small corner, i recalled it was beside TAG Heuer then..i was reading abt the history behind the watches being used by the Italian Frogmen of WW2 ..from that momment..it sort of drilled in.<br><br>Well during the yrs ..i yearned to own another watch other than my TAG Heuer 2000 Series.Being a fan of products made in germany, i read upon this german tool watch company called Sinn ...and then researching further, i fell in love with one of the watch they offered, a Sinn 756 Series 1.Full of technolgy.ice harded steel casing, lube free pushers and gaskets. its interesting dial layout ...i didn't hesistate and took the plunge.<br><br>currently still studing overseas,once i secured my job this comingwks,i hope to see a deja vu of my Panerai on my wrist ..hehe</div>
