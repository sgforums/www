            <div class='col-md body'>He probably is interested in you lah... If he continued being friends with you it might just bring him more heartaches... Like you but you can't return the feelings coz you are attached. So probably he gets out before he's in too deep.<br><br>Of course if you treasure him as a friend then perhaps you can call him up and clarify matters with him.<br><br>------------------<br>Why?

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree. I think it shows the diff bet how girls and guys see things.....u probably couldnt see that he wanted more than being frens.<br><br>i think that guys wouldnt spend 85% of their time 'chasing' girls they are not interested in</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JuzMe, I assume you're a girl...so I will give my point of view as a guy.<br><br>It's true about the fact that the guy likes the girl and so does not want to associate too much with her. It would give him too much heartache when he knows that he cannot "chase" her as she is already attached. Rather than hurt himself further, he distances himself from her.<br><br>This has happened to me before, and I have kept in touch with the girl in question, but not close enough to talk over the phone or meet in school and chat. I guess it's that same old feeling bubbling up again when I see her ? Not sure...<br><br>Anyway, hope this is helpful ! Cheers !</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Also, it has to do with the fact that some guys respect the GF BF thing.  Personally I, and a few friends&lt; won't bother with girls with BFs when we find out.  The main reason being that usually the guys will get angry that she's talking with other guys and we get into trouble or worse get her into trouble...<br><br>That's the main reason...just to state a fact...Most guys and girls are very jealous.  Guys also tend to act very rashly and irrationally when they get jealous...so either we will sufer or the Gf will suffer.  So we stay away.  As simple as that..<br><br>..but of course there are those who stay away because they can't get game from her...  and yes, we would definately be friends with thee girl if she shows that she's sincere and willing to be friends and make moves in that direction even tho she has bf.  It makes us feel more comfortable that the girl is ok with it and doesn't really mind about what the BF may think because of it...<br><br>Just a thought.  AS Atraxia said, Smile...make friends..</div>
