It takes less then a second for love to sparkle and of course it takes as fast to disappear.<br><br>Pure / True love is like wat many from this forum said, the willingness to sacrifice. The thought of putting everything about your partner in the first place even more important then you yourself, that is love, true love. And of course it needs to be a two way affair, not one whereby you love your gf, yet she only treat you as a fling.<br><br></div>
