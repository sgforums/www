            <div class='col-md body'>Of cos everyone has the right to end their own lives. It is your right but it may not always be right to exercise your right.<br><br>A present given to you is yours, yes. But just take one simple example. The NDP tix are given free every year. So some receipents just sell it blatantly for a high price. People kao peh say this is so not ethical and i believe most people believe it is not ethical too.Of cos the sellers say hey i spend time collecting the tix etc, it is given to me so i decide what to do with it...true! It is within your every right but as i said, your rights does not it is right.<br><br>Sure, take your life. It is your right. But if you think thats the right way to appreciate the people who love you and gave birth to you, go ahead!</div>
