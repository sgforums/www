Yes, life is getting harder.  Higher and higher cost of living, GST increase, dunno wat kind of budget coming up, but, lower end of a few thousand dollars a month is not impossible for the vast majority of singaporean in due time.<br><br>I do feel sorry for some of the lower income people, the old folks with no education and who are sick, but my sympathy for them is not relevant to the acknowledgement of the general income group in singapore.  They are 2 seperate issues.  Hopefully in time to come, their next generation gets the required education and put in the hard work, their living standard can be improved.  Meanwhile, hopefully garment will provide them with the much needed help and welfare.</div>

People have less kids.  Honestly, i will be worried if i want to have kids.

            <div class='col-md body'>I come from an average income family... my parents are only educated till secondary school.... family income is about $4000 now... So if you are willing to work hard and imprive yourself in Singapore, you will be able to live quite comfortably....<br><br>I dunno why you people like to complain so much... Is it because only the "poor" people are complaining and the "rich" can't be bothered to say anything at all? So what do you guys want actually? Everyone in singapore earning exactly $5000 each? Then everyone will feel rich? There are bound to be rich and poor people in a country... it cant be helped...<br><br>The government may be trying real hard to lower the income gap between the rich and the poor but what do you want them to do? Pay the hardworking and highly educated $4000 and pay a low-educated bad working attitude person $4000 as well? There has got to be a limit and the only thing you "poor" people can do is to self-improve.... and not whine over here....<br><br>Another thing i noted from the replies is that once the sons and daughters get married, they will take away a portion of the family income... this is okay wat... the parents will have savings of their own and their sons and daughters should be providing for them as well.... As for the sons and daughters themselves, it doesnt matter if their family income is low because their new family only consists of 2 members wat... furthermore, if the 2 of them are working, then they should have a strong family income for just the 2 of them....</div>
