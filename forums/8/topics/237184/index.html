Now that the economy is doing very well, many of them, especially housewives, have rejoined the workforce and find gainful employment. That is good news. But I think the pay they get is relatively low."<br><br>Higher-income households saw faster income growth, reflecting higher wage increases for skilled workers.<br><br>But this was also causing the gap between the high and low income groups to continue.<br><br>Professor Chew said: "High-income executives in Singapore, their pay is determined by the pay of high-income executives in developed countries. The pay of low-income workers in Singapore is determined by the pay of similar workers in the developing countries.

They are there.  i have seen one family drawing only $800 and the wife refused to work and they are going to have th 3rd child too.  And i had a neighbour who is in his 70s, his only nephew whom he took care of just got married and refused to stay with him, and he has to work as kopitiam asst, earning a meagre few hundreds a month, still have to pay rent.<br><br>But the majority of the people are not so poor.  Or are you saying majority of the families  belong to your said categories?</div>
