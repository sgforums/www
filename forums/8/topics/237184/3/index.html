So if you are willing to work hard and imprive yourself in Singapore, you will be able to live quite comfortably....<br><br>I dunno why you people like to complain so much... Is it because only the "poor" people are complaining and the "rich" can't be bothered to say anything at all? So what do you guys want actually? Everyone in singapore earning exactly $5000 each? Then everyone will feel rich? There are bound to be rich and poor people in a country... it cant be helped...<br><br>The government may be trying real hard to lower the income gap between the rich and the poor but what do you want them to do? Pay the hardworking and highly educated $4000 and pay a low-educated bad working attitude person $4000 as well? There has got to be a limit and the only thing you "poor" people can do is to self-improve.... and not whine over here....<br><br>Another thing i noted from the replies is that once the sons and daughters get married, they will take away a portion of the family income... this is okay wat... the parents will have savings of their own and their sons and daughters should be providing for them as well.... As for the sons and daughters themselves, it doesnt matter if their family income is low because their new family only consists of 2 members wat... furthermore, if the 2 of them are working, then they should have a strong family income for just the 2 of them.... </div></blockquote>What we are asking is for the government not to paint such a rosy picture.

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I wonder whether life is too harsh in Singapore as well.... But seriously if you want to have a relaxing life where money is not really a problem then you should be looking at the developing countries... life is carefree over at those countries... but if you want an urban life with modern luxuries, the cost that comes with it is the high costs of living.... And this is exactly the case for Singapore... This is how we are able to survive and outshine the bigger neighbouring countries all these years.... There is absolutely no way we are going to survive if we were to back out from the competition just for lower costs of living... So think about it.... It's improve yourself constantly and increase your employability or suffer in silence... It's do or die....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No, my family doesn't earn that much now.  We did earn a few times more than that figure before the 90's, but not now.<br><br>The "average household income", I feel, is a very poor indication of our quality of life.  It doesn't tell you how many people in the family are actually working in order to achieve that sum.  How do we even know if the figures aren't horrenously skewed by the big earners?  <span style="color: darkblue;">The govt should stop throwing us meaningless numbers and give us a breakdown of the facts &amp; figures.  Or are they afraid of being pressed for answers they're not ready to give?</span><br><br>Yes, the real situation... allow me to digress for a moment here - things don't look so good at the moment - we have elderly folks cleaning our toilets &amp; foodcourts and that's supposed to be normal?  I think it's downright shameful.  Is this the fate that's waiting for the many young people who hold non-executive jobs?<br><br>Then there's middle-aged workers who're retrenched, forced to retire before they can receive gratuity bonus.. The govt talks of skill upgrading as if it's "the" answer, but <strong>how many</strong> people have already done so, are willing to accept below-market salaries, but are repeatedly turned away on the mere basis of age.. or worse.. "over-qualification"?<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Yes, globalisation may well be the reason why ex-managers are forced to settle for jobs as taxi drivers or clerks, but have we conveniently forgotten or ignored the fact that these ex-managers were drawing salaries similar to that of managers in other <strong>developed</strong> countries, while taxi drivers/clerks' salaries are pegged to <strong>developing</strong> countries' market rates?  </span>Isn't it the least disturbing that our govt is so quick to brand them whining sore losers without first trying to comprehend the ground situation from their perspective in order to come up with the solutions we pay them millions - highest in the world - for?<br><br>Back on the topic.... So, so what if a family earns $6k a month, if they can never stop to spare the time &amp; energy... to enjoy the fruits of their hard labour to the fullest?  So what if they earn $6k a month today, if they have an axe constantly hanging over their heads, with no pro-worker laws or strong unions to provide them the minimum protection from the fate as described above?  How much quality of life must a regular Singaporean family sacrifice in order to attain, and maintain, this "6k a month" average?</div>
