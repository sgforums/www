So if you are willing to work hard and imprive yourself in Singapore, you will be able to live quite comfortably....<br><br>I dunno why you people like to complain so much... Is it because only the "poor" people are complaining and the "rich" can't be bothered to say anything at all? So what do you guys want actually? Everyone in singapore earning exactly $5000 each? Then everyone will feel rich? There are bound to be rich and poor people in a country... it cant be helped...<br><br>The government may be trying real hard to lower the income gap between the rich and the poor but what do you want them to do? Pay the hardworking and highly educated $4000 and pay a low-educated bad working attitude person $4000 as well? There has got to be a limit and the only thing you "poor" people can do is to self-improve.... and not whine over here....<br><br>Another thing i noted from the replies is that once the sons and daughters get married, they will take away a portion of the family income... this is okay wat... the parents will have savings of their own and their sons and daughters should be providing for them as well.... As for the sons and daughters themselves, it doesnt matter if their family income is low because their new family only consists of 2 members wat... furthermore, if the 2 of them are working, then they should have a strong family income for just the 2 of them.... </div></blockquote>I would think one of the ways to narrow it will be taxes, i do not mean GST.  GST is penalisng the lower income, for they have to pay taxes (GST) even for necessities.  The higher income, what will they think?  "Well, you increase the tax, i'll just shop overseas!"<br><br>Who gets hurt most badly?</div>
