            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah... All you could probably be right. MAYBE NUS will take over ANU, MAYBE the professor really just does not want to break my heart, MAYBE ANU is not as good as NUS in some sectors, MAYBE some things I said may not be true in the future... But what you cant deny is that:<br><br>1: They have a guide (cut off point) of those applying (ALL STUDENTS including their own local students) and I am qualified to enter about half of the courses there but for courses like law and medicine or pharmacy, their required grades are at least AAB and ABB correspondently. Hence its not about being easier to enter due to the 10% statistics. You have to meet the requirements. Their 10% could well be those who meet the cut off of the australians have to compete to enter and at the 10% mark, the rest will be cut off. If the requirements are not met, the numbers could well be less than 10%. And being higher rank because it has longer history is not in the calculations in the THES system I presumed you used as a guide.<br><br>2: This year is really competitive even if the officials thinks otherwise. There is something wrong that Singaporeans who are offered a place in law in UK university not allowed even in Accountancy in Singapore. Lets take her results to be ABB since her mother says she got A's and B's. She cant even get into accountancy? But is able to get in law in UK university? No matter how flexible the system of the university is, there should not be a university in UK that allows people with crap or even ordinary results to get into a highly sought after course like Law, but she was offered a place.<br><br>By the way, curryman, your friend cant get into engineering with 3A's and 1B for engineering course? What engineering course did he apply for? Local universities only calculate the admission score with 3 GCE 'A' levels, but with another one is only an advantage with 'S' paper is an even added advantage. Means your friend has a perfect score?</div>

But all of them are rejected.<br><br>I chose these courses in NTU --- Arts design media, materials science, computer science... But all are rejected as well.<br><br>I didnt apply to SMU because I was sure I wouldnt be able to get in due to the high demand in its business courses (and I was right - My friend with ABC couldnt get in either).<br><br>...</div></blockquote>er... Ur grades.. definately cant go into Arts media and design.. Btw, ur grades are as good as a BCC, which is not veri good btw..<br><br>may i noe ur GP btw?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mewlove:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah... All you could probably be right. MAYBE NUS will take over ANU, MAYBE the professor really just does not want to break my heart, MAYBE ANU is not as good as NUS in some sectors, MAYBE some things I said may not be true in the future... But what you cant deny is that:<br><br>1: They have a guide (cut off point) of those applying (ALL STUDENTS including their own local students) and I am qualified to enter about half of the courses there but for courses like law and medicine or pharmacy, their required grades are at least AAB and ABB correspondently. Hence its not about being easier to enter due to the 10% statistics. You have to meet the requirements. Their 10% could well be those who meet the cut off of the australians have to compete to enter and at the 10% mark, the rest will be cut off. If the requirements are not met, the numbers could well be less than 10%. And being higher rank because it has longer history is not in the calculations in the THES system I presumed you used as a guide.<br><br>2: This year is really competitive even if the officials thinks otherwise. There is something wrong that Singaporeans who are offered a place in law in UK university not allowed even in Accountancy in Singapore. Lets take her results to be ABB since her mother says she got A's and B's. She cant even get into accountancy? But is able to get in law in UK university? No matter how flexible the system of the university is, there should not be a university in UK that allows people with crap or even ordinary results to get into a highly sought after course like Law, but she was offered a place.<br><br>By the way, curryman, your friend cant get into engineering with 3A's and 1B for engineering course? What engineering course did he apply for? Local universities only calculate the admission score with 3 GCE 'A' levels, but with another one is only an advantage with 'S' paper is an even added advantage. Means your friend has a perfect score? </div></blockquote>dude cool down,<br><br>a) i said ANU had a longer history(time) to develop its uni comapred to the infant NUS which in the 1960s was still MU(university of malaya)<br><br>b)my fren is malaysian. so am I. its not easy to get a place in NUS for us. coz PRCs are the priority now. my fren had 3A and 1B STPM(malaysian A level) im not sure which engineering he applied but surely more than 2 engineerings.<br><br>c)so what if ur results can get into foreign Uni but not local Uni. do u know that most UK and US universities are rubbish with the exception of the ivy leagues and the OXbridge. My malaysian fren didnt even secure an interview with law NUS and he got into law London School of Economics..the fact that he is not that bright explains it all. Foreign unis lowered the admission requirement for foreigners to get tuition fees....the case is different in singapore. most pple would want to apply to local uni coz its cheap and can withdraw CPF to fund it...foreigeners get loans easily too...more demand therefore hard to get a place compared to UK /US uni. alot of my freens get IVY leagues but stayed in NUS coz no money.</div>

Med school accepts students with 3As as well. The fact is almost all the students accepted into Med school have 3As at least. Prolly the same for those shortlisted for interviews. NUS Med school will not reveal why we didnt make it into med school. Simply put, it is more likely that he didnt do well for his essay and interview.</div>
