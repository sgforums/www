            <div class='col-md body'>i read the article in the straits times today... the writer is a HE... and his daughter applied to arts and social science in all three unis..... and all of them rejected her...<br><br>an E is a lousy grade.. one more grade down and its a 'O'... meaning u passed the A level subject with only a 'o' level standard understanding of it and is not considered an A level pass...<br><br>i think what contributed to her not getting a place in uni is probably her gp grade.... for gp.... the subject is taken at AO level... meaning the grading is the same as that for any o level subject.. hence a C is juz a pass... any lower would be fail... meaning D7<br><br>and she applied for humanities course... which requires good liguistic skills... which she clearly lacked... hence of cos she got rejected... but if she applied for enigine... then things might have been diff....<br><br>anyways ABE C5/C6 is not an avg grade... it is below the avg... but not entirely at the extreme either....  if that was an avg grade...anybody juz below the avg would have failed one subject...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you guys are assuming that the daughter applied for those good course such as law and medicine which requires good grades. The actual fact may be that she applied for perhaps courses like arts which has lower requirements and yet got rejected despite scoring ABE. This prompted her mother to write in to the papers.<br><br>And before we throw criticism at the mother, we should understand her point of view.<br><br>First I believe she had use her son as an example because she believes that the daughter achieve a similar grade as her son. ABC. She believes her daughter's GP result should be taken into consideration and since they had the same result, her daughter should be able to admit into university. Therefore, I feel that you guys are pouring criticism on her without understanding from her point of view.<br><br>Secondly, did the university raise their requirements due to the larger number of applicants such that an ABE is now unable to gain admission to the university? If that is so, then she has a case for complaint as her daughter is eligible for studies but yet unable to do so due to logistic issue. Imagine the anguish that one would feel when he is denied of undertaking a project despite knowing that he has the capability to do so. Moreover, this is a social problem where we are unable to provide education to our youth even though they had the capability to achieve higher education.<br><br>Thirdly, I believe the mother is thinking about NUI or NUC (university of india and university of china). Our local university had quite a number of foreign students who came here on MOE scholarship. That is, Singapore sponsoring them part of or their full tertiary education in Singapore. This is an expense of local students who are unable to gain admission to university despite their ability to do so. If local university are not taking in local students, then who will?<br><br>Honestly, I am surprised to see so much criticism against the mother. I am waiting for the response from our universities and I want to learn the reasons for her rejection. Because it would be a sad day if her daughter was rejected due to limited places and yet our universities are taking in foreign students!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>uni admission is all about...well theorectically, demand and supply.<br><br>There are so limited places in the unis, and now with the dragon year there are more applicants trying to fill the uni. Remember each year would have some places reserved for returning NS man. So the figures given 15,000 for example is admission for a whole cohort, poly and JC students, both boys and girls.<br><br>And so all unis, given limited vacancies, will want the best to fill in their places. You can consider this a selfish move, but if all unis take in every Singaporean, regardless of grades.. and these people at the end of the 4 years still fail to do well, it won't reflect well on the university.<br><br>Having saif that, I agree the system should try to take in more local students... but all unis are trying to be internationally renowed... and that means trying to attract foreign students in too.... not an easy balance i assume... and so leads to such 'loyalty' problems.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by matleep:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you guys are assuming that the daughter applied for those good course such as law and medicine which requires good grades. The actual fact may be that she applied for perhaps courses like arts which has lower requirements and yet got rejected despite scoring ABE. This prompted her mother to write in to the papers.<br><br>And before we throw criticism at the mother, we should understand her point of view.<br><br>First I believe she had use her son as an example because she believes that the daughter achieve a similar grade as her son. ABC. She believes her daughter's GP result should be taken into consideration and since they had the same result, her daughter should be able to admit into university. Therefore, I feel that you guys are pouring criticism on her without understanding from her point of view.<br><br>Secondly, did the university raise their requirements due to the larger number of applicants such that an ABE is now unable to gain admission to the university? If that is so, then she has a case for complaint as her daughter is eligible for studies but yet unable to do so due to logistic issue. Imagine the anguish that one would feel when he is denied of undertaking a project despite knowing that he has the capability to do so. Moreover, this is a social problem where we are unable to provide education to our youth even though they had the capability to achieve higher education.<br><br>Thirdly, I believe the mother is thinking about NUI or NUC (university of india and university of china). Our local university had quite a number of foreign students who came here on MOE scholarship. That is, Singapore sponsoring them part of or their full tertiary education in Singapore. This is an expense of local students who are unable to gain admission to university despite their ability to do so. If local university are not taking in local students, then who will?<br><br>Honestly, I am surprised to see so much criticism against the mother. I am waiting for the response from our universities and I want to learn the reasons for her rejection. Because it would be a sad day if her daughter was rejected due to limited places and yet our universities are taking in foreign students!</div></blockquote>Obviously you did not read the post just above yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All parents love their kids, you have to forgive the mother. She won't rest till she tried all avenues of 'appeal' which may (or may not) help her daughter.<br><br>To get a A, and a B, the daughter must've been a hardworking (perhaps not too talented, in studying) student, at the very least. Just too bad she has that E, and a poor GP grade. Try SIM instead. Singapore does try to provide all willing students with good education.
