            <div class='col-md body'>Its the dragon year lol. So what if she qualifies for uni? Tonnes of people are qualified for uni as well. Get EEE can go apply already what. Universities are not obliged to accept everyone, of course they will accept the best available. Whats the point of a uni if they accept everyone who meets EEE ? Then might as well dont call it uni anymore. We all just continue an extra 4 years from the JC we come from. Things are so different now compared to her son. When her son enter uni so many years ago, the standard is prolly lower, and its not even as competitive cos it wasnt even a dragon year. Cant blame it on the universities. This kinda thing can only blame yourself for not trying hard enough to get better grades.<br><br>I got friends with the same kind of grades, but they dont blame it on the uni. They know it themselves that they are at fault. They are going to retake A levels.<br><br>And im curious about one thing. Did she decide to write to the straits times herself, or did her daughter ask her to do that? Im pretty sure the daughter is smart enough to know that its not the uni's fault at all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's quite sad really and sort of unfair because in every other year BCDs get in easily, so many of my friends with mediocre grades expected to get into FASS.<br>It came as quite a shock to them that their BBD c5(2 quality grades),  BCC, was not good enough for both NUS and NTU. Not everyones parents can afford to send them abroad or  to a private school. So now theyre in a fix - resit? NIE? Wait and hope they get in next year? Further compounding the problem was the fact that they got their rejection letters very very late - some got theirs only yesterday.<br><br>BTW, i believe those who wish to resit for their exams this year can sign up for the old syllabus, as those in institutes like MI will be doing the old syllabus this year as well, but not sure if the deadline for registration is over.<br><br>As for A in Lit and C in GP - i know of a couple of cases! I know of people with excellent English who get Cs as well, whilst those with less-than-perfect grammar go on to get B3s. The skills required in GP and Lit are arguably different. I also think its horrible that people who were getting consistent Bs in GP during their college years came out with D7! Perhaps some JCs GP teachers are inept, or teach their students the wrong skills - obviously its not entirely the students fault then??<br><br></div>
