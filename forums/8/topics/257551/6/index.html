            <div class='col-md body'>Yup you are right. So this year, students from JCs like Serangoon Yishun and Jurong could suffer large numbers of people not getting into university.  People who get my results in previous years could probably find themselves relieved but in this year you'll be crying (like me). I didnt get into university probably due to my gp grades... I got D7 --- Which I do not understand. I got grades like B4 in my JC and got A2 for English in O levels... My gp is not horrible. Unless I seriously wrote out of point which is highly likely seeing the grade if not I shouldnt be getting that but...<br><br>However, the MOE did say that they will use Mother Tongue or GP which ever grade is higher... But this does not seem to help much... I got A2 for Chinese by the way...<br><br>Quote from http://www.moe.gov.sg/forum/2004/04032004.htm<br><br>8. University applicants will henceforth have a choice to include their MTL grades for admission.  NUS and NTU will use the better of the two admission scores, one with and one without MTL grades, to determine a studentÂ’s final score. Those with good MTL grades can still benefit.<br><br>My friend with the same score - BCC got B4 for gp did not manage to enter as well... Another friend who practically chose most of the course similar to mine whose grades are ABC got rejected as well by NUS... This is which I do not understand.<br><br>By the way, curryman, your stats says NUS ranked high in technology but ANU was low. You are absolutely right. However this cannot be used to rank the university. Harvard university of US is just ranked one rank higher than ANU... and even NTU is higher in technology than Harvard...<br><br>Btw I find this a good place to voice opinions.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Gp grades are used in the calculation in the admission score which is one of the things that help in one's entrance. A D7 in Gp is not a pass but its not a fail either. That is why we are allowed to apply. But E8/F is definitely a fail and that grade does not allow the student to apply. But a D7 in gp means we are incompetent in English and we need to take a QET before entering the University and if we fail we need to take English lessons in that university.

            <div class='col-md body'>That is the problem with Singapore education. For an example, an AAA student can get into law in UK but only at most accountancy in Singapore. If they go study law in UK they earn like mad there after they graduate but in Singapore you graduate with Accountancy degree but only get a small portion of the amount you get if you work as a lawyer in UK. So isnt it better to go to UK study if you had the funds? Also the fees are also sky high and the money is earned by UK instead of Singapore. pretty dumb...</div>
