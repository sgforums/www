            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i feel that the A's are getting easier than b4. The statistics show that more ppl are getting straight A's than b4. During my time in SA, only about 10 percent of the cohort gets straight A's. I guess the dragon year 30-40 percent? This leaves those who have Bs and Es quite a disadvantage to enter local U.<br><br>Secondly, i feel that the A's is not a good judgement of one's academic ability. A few days of exam for 2 years of hard work is a real gamble. For instance, if one student has consistently been getting As and Bs for GP, but during the A level writes an argument the examiner doesn't agree with and gets a D7; compare this with a student who gets C6 during internal exams, but get A1 during the A's. I reckon the former deserve a place in uni more than the latter assuming they have equal grades in the other subjects. There should be consistency in grades for one to be judged upon.<br><br>Just a personal opionion.

Its the people are getting better. But i agree with the gamble part. If uni admission was based on a system that takes results from the whole 2 academic years, then that would have been better.
