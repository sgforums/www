Probably will attend b-school there. Have gone on vacations to Korea, Japan, China, US, Canada etc... Yet everytime on the flight back to Singapore, I'm excited to get back, especially during the holidays. The closest friends, the places you know, the family you love... they're all here. When the plane touches down in Changi after the last leg from Incheon or Narita, I can't help but let a silly grin spread on my face. Whine and complain all you want, but Singapore's my home and I love it. And I'm a PR at that.<br></div>
