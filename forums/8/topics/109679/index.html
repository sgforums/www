And S$700,000 (about USD$400,000) would buy an average sized single family house here in the states, of course we aren't as crowded as Singapore is.<br><br>Another thing I noticed about Singapore is Singaporeans seem to love to shop.  At noon on a sunday orchard road was packed!!  Also during my brief time in Singapore I must have visited 8 malls.</div></blockquote>I suppose its a whole unit with the land included...<br>At the rate 700 K, we can only get private apartments. Still its pigeon holes in your context.<br>You want to own the land, its in millions.  You want to build the house on the land, its another couple of mil..  Anyways, land is scarce.<br><br>Maybe there was a sale... but then, there's not many place to go or activities to do... so its shopping...<br></div>
