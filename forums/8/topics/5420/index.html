We get a lto of visitors and even though he knoes that he hasn't made any attempt to make a profit off the site. in fact he has been losing money lately in trying to maintain a site this popular. Please even if you think he is a big fat liar consider it a plea on my behalf to help maintain the site by clicking on the adbanners. we are afterall only students and our resources goes only so far. Click on the adbanners and help us make more money so as to help serve you lot better by providing faster servers, better equipment and get prettier models.<br><br>Regards,<br>Madzzie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How to organise the prefect outing<br><br>Fristly let's take a look at what went wrong<br><br>1)A lot of ppl were "interested" but there<br>was no clear indictation of the numbers<br>who would turn up<br><br>2)There were a lot of misunderstanding and<br>miscommunication<br><br>Basically u can attribute the failure of that outing to poor organization<br><br>However let's not cry over spilled milk. Instead we should learn from our mistakes<br><br>ways to rectify the problem<br><br>Next time when u organize a large scale outing remember one thing....get the pagers/handphone/contact numbers of the people who are interested (or if they dun feel comfortable to give it to u at least have the decency to leave your pager or handphone number)<br><br>Confirm with those people who are interested way b4 hand and at least one day b4 the outing so u would know who can make it who cant and get a general idea of the number of people going<br><br>Organisers.....just remember to turn up ( this time i think everyone forgives u cos clearly when everything is so messy well u cant put the blame on anyone)<br><br>remember when things go wrong it is too easy for everyone to start putting the blame on everyone else Let's just stop and put ourselves in others' shoes..<br><br>firewire i can understand your anger<br>I waited for someone to switch over from a "double line" for one hour and she didnt..<br>I thot I just wanted to say goodnite so i paged and ask her to switch back as i was still waiting on the other line but she didnt<br>I cant really blame her cos well..i was the one who wanted to wait..<br><br>okie to round up lets hope everyone just try and forget about this unpleasant incident learn from the mistakes we make and try to be better people...<br><br>------------------<br>"If YoU fAiL tO lOoK bEyOnD lOoKs,<br>YoU fAiL tO aPpReCiAtE tRuE bEaUtY"<br>Â© Copyright 1999 FriesÂ® All rights reserved.<br></div>

People don't like things which they are ignorant of. They've not visited the site and didn't know of this newsgroup thus all those criticism. They don't know what is it all about. THEY ARE AFRAID TO KNOW!<br><br>About that cocked-up meeting, though I wasn't there and can't say anything (or even comment on it) about it. But I feel that MADZZIE has his own reasons not to go for that gathering. Also I am sure that there are some form of miscommunication between u guys. WHY DON'T YOU GUYS EXCHANGE E-MAIL/ICQ # SO THAT YOU ALL CAN COMMUNICATE EVEN BETTER?<br><br>Also, Mr Firewire, I know that it's extremely fustrating to wait and wait for a gathering that never took place (I've been in such a situation and I've waited for 3 hours on the end b4 leaving). But don't you feel that your language and words are TOO strong?? They kinda upsetted me too, not with the fuck word but the extremely strong emotions which you present.</div>
