            <div class='col-md body'>Recently,there have been views on whether to make Literature a purely optional subject as some students don't seem to scored well and dropped it less it affect their other grades.Literature to me is not a subject to be studied,but to be felt with the heart of what the words and stories are telling us.After all,what is literature if you do not fully understand what the author is trying to convey.It is a subject of feelings and of opening our senses to things that are just as important as how to make $$$(which i guess more people are interested,ehehe).With all my mindless ramblings,you can probably infer that i still suggest that Literature be studied as in the stauts quo and not made a purely optional subject as Literature is a subject for the soul and what's the use of making lotsa $$$ if you do not nourish your soul from young?Any comments?Anyone,eheeh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup Literature should be purely optional, though schools should at least OFFER the subject! There are schools that dieliberately refuse to offer Literature because students generally don't score well for it. I am one of the lucky ones that had a chance to take Literature  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> [or should I say unlucky coz I studied the hardest 4 it but scored the worst  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">] A good understanding depends a lot on the teacher in charge, my Lit teacher was from England and she's really good at it!<br><br>Well, with schools mainly concerned about their rankings and stuff so I guess its bye bye literature .. even my secondary skool only had half a classs left</div>
