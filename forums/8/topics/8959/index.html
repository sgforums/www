            <div class='col-md body'>Let me attempt a reply here...<br>Personally I think some guys prefer long haired and skirt wearing girls cos such girls do project a so called "more" feminine since traditionally pple have been brought up with "guys short hair and pants while girls long hair and skirt kind of indetification". A guy is restricted to wearing pants and jeans thus they may prefer their partner to wear something else rather than "infringe" their set of available clothing? the same things holds for long hair although it is more acceptable nowadays for guys with long hair too.<br><br>In my personal opinion, what a girl wears must fit her image, height, and size to bring out the best in her. The selection of the right clothes or hairstyle fitting the person is v impt. No one fixed way to look good and what may be good for one may not be so for another.</div>
