And this is how the Police break cases on Doc's reviews. Remember the famous Doc whom gave many valuable information to the Police ( whats his name, fat fat guy whom had pass away ) If a person die of unnatural death, investigation will start, as such the body will cut.<br><br><blockquote>Commonsense will tell you that decomposing organics will produce smell and change in appearence.

No1 except a doctor can pronounce a person dead by law. The singapore goverment does not take any1's word tt it's a natural death, even if it's an obvious accident case. They perform chemical tests and check the body for abnormalities tt veers from death by natural causes.<br>When the body is sent to the funeral home, they will set about to embalm the body by draining the blood, removing the organs and injecting the body with chemicals to delay the decomposition. (in the past the bodies were stuffed with herbs). This is mandatory in singapore, where wakes can last up to 7 days.<br>I belive tt what u have stated is just another misinterpretation by grapevine gossiping tt gone really wrong.</div>
