            <div class='col-md body'>SPEECH BY MR TEO CHEE HEAN,MINISTER FOR DEFENCE, AT DEBATE ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS<br><br>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to thank the many members for their words of support and encouragement for the work of the men and women of the SAF, the SCDF and the Police Force in the aftermath of the tsunamis.<br><br>Their work has been part of SingaporeÂ’s efforts to bring relief to the victims of the tsunamis. The outpouring of compassion and generosity from Singaporeans was truly unprecedented. This was a demonstration of a strong and caring Singapore spirit.<br><br>For the SAF, this was the largest operational deployment we have ever undertaken. More than 1,200 SAF personnel were deployed Â– to Phuket in Thailand, and to 3 locations in Indonesia: Medan, Banda Aceh and Meulaboh. RSAF aircraft also flew supply and support missions between Jakarta, Singapore and Aceh, and around the Indian Ocean rim to Phuket, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Mauritius.<br><br>Apart from those deployed to the disaster-stricken areas, there were many more SAF servicemen and women, technology and support personnel in Mindef, and our industry partners, who also worked very hard, often round the clock, to get the aircraft, ships, equipment and men ready to go at short notice, and to support our men and women in the field. Our Operationally Ready National Servicemen and volunteers, and our civil resource partners were also called upon, along with the Regular Servicemen and Full-time National Servicemen in our units.<br><br>The SAF responded swiftly, within hours, planning preparing and putting together an effective combination of forces, supplies and equipment over the Christmas/New Year week to form our humanitarian assistance support group. This Group carried out its urgent mission with initiative and tenacity, and with compassion and sensitivity. They brought critically needed medical care, food, water and other essential supplies to tens of thousands of people who had been completely cut off by the terrible destruction particularly in Aceh.<br><br>Over the last 3 weeks, SAF Chinook and Super Puma helicopters, and C-130 and F-50 aircraft flew some 250 missions carrying more than 1,000,000 pounds of cargo and 4000 people. They carried water and food to isolated survivors and transported a mobile control tower to Banda Aceh. Our medical teams treated 4000 people in Banda Aceh and Meulaboh.<br><br>Whether it was a quiet word of comfort in Bahasa Indonesia, or flying the Secretary General of the United Nations around the Indian Ocean rim, our people displayed commitment, compassion and competence.<br><br>As Col Geerhan Lantara, the TNI commander in Meulaboh said: Â“When your people arrived, it lifted our spirits. We knew that we were no longer alone.Â”<br><br>The SAF was able to respond swiftly and carry out this mission effectively because it had over the years developed a flexible set of capabilities and trained its people to respond to unexpected circumstances.<br><br>The SAF was also able to provide useful and effective relief assistance because it coordinated its work closely with its counterparts in the Indonesian armed forces Â– the Tentera Nasional Indonesia or TNI. We could have this close coordination because both the TNI and SAF have invested in building a close relationship over a period of some 30 years. Through our extensive interactions and cooperation, in exercises, personnel exchanges, and attending each otherÂ’s training courses, TNI and SAF officers developed mutual respect and understanding, and got to know one another well. These people-to-people relationships, developed over many years, made it possible for the SAF to carry out our humanitarian mission smoothly and in a way that was useful for the relief operations.<br><br>In the same way, cooperation in relief work with our friends in Thailand proceeded smoothly also because we had built up close working relations with the Royal Thai Armed Forces over many decades.<br><br>In the coming years, the SAF will be developing into a more capable and flexible force. The 3G SAF will be able to respond to a wider spectrum of threats and challenges to respond even more swiftly and more capably to deal with the unexpected. At the same time, Mindef and the SAF will continue to strengthen our ties with our friends and neighbours so that we will be able to work closely and smoothly together in overcoming common challenges.<br><br>Sir, I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the House about the relief situation in Aceh, and SingaporeÂ’s humanitarian assistance plans for the coming weeks.<br><br>We have been coordinating very closely with the Indonesian authorities from the very beginning, so that we understand their needs and know how best we can assist them. I have met with and spoken several times to Menko Polhukam Widodo and my counterpart Defence Minister Juwono Sudarsono, most recently at the end of last week. Senior SAF commanders have also kept in close touch with their counterparts, both in personal meetings and over the phone.<br><br>Sir, the emergency relief phase is drawing to a close. The Indonesian authorities are now transitioning to the next phase of relief operations Â– the recovery phase. Their priority in this phase is to build 24 centres to house more than 400,000 internally displaced persons who have lost their homes. The assistance that Singapore is providing will therefore transition in tandem with the priorities and needs of our Indonesian counterparts. The SAF humanitarian assistance support group which was designed to assist in the first phase, the emergency relief phase, is completing its mission after some three weeks in Indonesia. They have helped to stabilise the situation and open the way for other relief agencies more suited to this next phase of humanitarian work to come in. They will be redeployed in the coming days back to Singapore.<br><br>At the request of Indonesia, Singapore will continue to provide a substantial deployment of 3 Chinook helicopters to support the critical needs of the Indonesian authorities and the TNI in this recovery phase. The helicopters will remain deployed in Aceh for the next two to three weeks, after which we will review the need together with our Indonesian counterparts.<br><br>The bulk of SingaporeÂ’s assistance will now be undertaken by our civilian volunteer groups, such as the Singapore Red Cross and Mercy Relief. Last Friday, 60 volunteers sailed with our third helicopter landing ship RSS Endeavour and arrived at Meulaboh on Sunday. For the past few days they have been helping to set up centres for the internally displaced persons, and to provide them with the basic necessities that will help to restore some semblance of normalcy to their lives until they can be permanently rehoused. RSS Endeavour and our Singapore volunteers delivered tents to house 10,000 people, sleeping bags, blankets, food for 500 families for a week, and 1,000 school kits for students so that they have the basic stationery to return to school.<br><br>The Red Cross and Mercy Relief will be taking over the medical services that were being provided by the SAF medical teams in Meulaboh and Banda Aceh.<br><br>Sir, I applaud the compassion and spirit of voluntarism in our fellow Singaporeans.<br><br>Singapore is also committed to helping in the reconstruction efforts in Aceh, and in other countries devastated by the tsunamis. As the Indonesian authorities and the authorities in other countries work out their plans for reconstruction in the coming months, Singapore will work closely with them to see how best we can assist in a meaningful way.<br><br>I shall be going to Aceh again tomorrow to assess the situation, and to ensure that the transition process takes place smoothly.<br><br>Sir, the response to the destruction wreaked by the tsunamis brought out the best in Singaporeans. The SAF has been privileged to play a part in SingaporeÂ’s response to this crisis.<br><br>Sir, I would also like to thank the governments, armed forces and people of Indonesia and Thailand for supporting our troops as they go about their humanitarian mission. I was truly inspired by their indomitable spirit and resilience in the face of adversity.<br><br>Sir, let me thank honourable members once again for their kind words of support for the SCDF, SAF and our police force. I look forward to their continuing support for the objectives and programmes that have been spelt out in my ministryÂ’s Addendum to the PresidentÂ’s Address.<br><br>Sir, I support the motion.</div>
