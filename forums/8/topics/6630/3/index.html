In fact, they brought their act together, and created quite a few reasonable chances together, of which Cole ballooned quite a number. West Ham is one team, Real is another. In fact, it has been proven that ManU does not necessarily perform better in Old Trafford than in away games. View through the past European stats for ManU against the tough teams at Old Trafford, and you will see what I mean.<br></div></blockquote>No need mah...Barca just needs a 2-0 victory at Nou Camp, which they are more than capable of getting.

            <div class='col-md body'>That was what I was saying. Barcelona only requires only a 2-0 at Nou Camp, a 3-1 will bring it to penalty, and at least a 5-2 for a win.<br>Well, for the Real vs ManU, bare in mind that all Real needs is a draw to advance (+away goal lah), so what tactics are going to played?? Would be an interesting match. This will however not discount the fact that ManU is still the favourites, as indicated by my earlier post. Not that I agree with those stats, I think Bayern is over-rated too, but oh well, this invites more discussion.<br>Leeds is dropping form, and I think my earlier prediction for the top 6 will still hold quite well, maybe not no.6 though.</div>

Real doesn't have Liverpool's kind of defence and i won't be putting my money on them succeeding in soaking up the pressure. the smartest way to defend against Becks' crosses is to keep him busy doing something else in the first place. which Real did fine in the first leg. Becks was really more of Gary's first line of defense against Carlos. while Carlos is arguably faster than Becks, i won't put my money on him stopping Becks from crossing.<br><br>anyway, what is impt to Man U now is to beat Boro.

            <div class='col-md body'>finally....my fave team Manchester United showed some semblance of their famous fighting spirit and worked out a 4-3 win over Boro.<br><br>great quality goals from Man U, esp the rare right-foot shot from Giggs. that's the way to go, Red Devils.<br><br>but as Bryan Robson rightly hinted, Man U's greatness this season, like Barca, is through a superior strike force. while there has never been a successful side which can't play flowing attacking soccer, defence is still impt.<br><br>i won't go so far as to say that it's Bossie's fault for Man U's defensive probs. it's more of a good partner to Stam. Berg is good, but lacks speed and can be forced off the ball. u need someone like Chelsea's Desailly with Stam. Someone who's tigerish, fights for the ball and marks tightly. ideally, i would say that they need a libero. someone who can launch an attack from the back with an incisive pass like Beckanbauer in his heyday. pity...i can't think of anyone with the class in that position today.<br><br>Man U's real strength is in raw speed. Man U is probably the fastest overall attacking side i've ever seen. other teams merely have some fast players like Owen, but Man U's entire frontline and many supporting players are all very fast. Think Cole, Yorke, Solsjkaer, Giggs and Scholes. however, the fragility of Man U's attack is the inability to hold up the ball. since Cantona left, who can hold up the ball and create room for the rest? Sheringham maybe, but while he's elegant, he hasn't the kind of control Cantona had.<br><br>if u look at all the last 8 in the Champions League, u'll find that there's no real outstanding side today. Man U had some claim to being outstanding last season by outfighting Inter Milan and Juventus, but look at this season.<br><br>Valencia lacks flair, so does Porto. Lazio is a good side, dunno what happened to them. Chelsea is very good and so is Bayern Munich. However, both show weaknesses in their own leagues. Real plays well, but hasn't showed me something outstanding yet.<br><br>Barca is terribly lop-sided. Granted, they are probably the best attacking side now. with so much flair that Man U pales in comparision. but look at their league record. 17-5-10. what does this tell u? they can win, but they can't avoid a loss. not the hall mark of a champion. indeed, the moment they lose the spark in attack, they lose. it's a certainty. i really wondered how come no one noticed before they got whacked by Chelsea.<br><br>The EPL is a foregone conclusion. I seriously can't think of how Man U can fail to get 8 pts from the remaining games. against Southampton and Watford, that should be six pts. just draw against Sunderland and Spurs and you can even lose against Villa and Chelsea. and i seriously don't believe that Man U won't be able to beat at least 2 of the above-stated last 4 teams.<br><br>the interesting thing now is the Champions League....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I tend the agree with Altrex, but with all that stats, it still does not mean ManU will get the European Champ so easily. League and cup form are different. The Cup is such that it only depends on the performance on the day itself. Look at Barcelona and Chelsea, who would have thought Chelsea could beat Barca, at 3-1 somemore. And Valencia 5-2 to Lazio. And that is why the andreneline in the Champions League</div>
