            <div class='col-md body'>Nah, Chelsea vs Real for finals is more likely.<br>And I agree Liverpool is really the team to watch out for, with all the young talents now like Gerrard, Owen, Thompson, Matteo. Just like what ManU was a few years back with Beckham, Butt, and the Nevilles, what kept ManU up last few times was Peter Schmeichel, this season, it is excellent midfield work by Keane and on-form attacking play by Cole, Yorke and Solsjaer. But next season, look out for Liverpool. They are established in defence already, and with Fowler fit for next season, Houllier will  have loads to choose from, from Fowler, Owen, Heskey, Camara, Meijer (maybe sometime we might see all on the field, who knows)......one thing for sure, ManU will not last as long as Liverpool did on the top</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I beg to differ. I think a Man U - Chelsea final is very, very possible. As much as Real did superbly to contain Man U in Madrid, let's not forget that Madrid is supposed to be Real's fortress and they failed to score any goals. So can they be expected to outplay Man U at OT. I seriously doubt so. Good as they are, I think no teams in the world right now can hope to come to OT and outplay them. Especially in a match that Man U is supposed to win. Do not forget that Man U is well known for grinding out results when they are backed into a corner. Remember Valencia after that Fiorentina defeat? Or the semi-final against Juventus last season when they drew 1-1 at OT? The most Real can hope for is a scored draw and I dun think they will get it.<br>I think Chelsea can easily dispose Valencia in the semi-final (assumptions apply based on results thus far). But what I fear most is if Man U advance to the semis to face Bayern. They will be definitely out for revenge, and it wun be easy for Man U then. That's why I am hoping that Porto will upset Bayern. All said, I am still rooting for a Man U - Chelsea final, where Man U can repay Chelsea the 5-0 drubbing, with interest....hehehe<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Although the match was close fought, Real actually had more of the chances and should have won if not for the heroics of Mark Bosnich. Where were all the defenders??

The fact is, given all the chances, Real failed to score at HOME. So can they be expected to score at OT??? I seriously doubt so. Let's also not forget that Man U is an awesome attacking force at OT. Forget about Madrid, we all know that Man U are bad travellers, and I suspect that a 0-0 result suits them just nice, becoz they are expected to rock at OT. Ask urself, if the kind of chances fallen to Real at Madrid had gone to Man U at OT, will u bet against them getting at least a couple? I wun. And those are just the kind of chances they will create at OT. I predict Man U to beat Real 3-1 at OT. And I think it will be a Man U, Barcelona, Bayern and Lazio semi final. Yes, I do believe both Barca and Lazio can overturn their deficits.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe that Lazio and Barcelona have the ability to turn the table, they have afterall managed to score the vital away goals to make things slightly (not much) easier for them.<br>How Chelsea managed to win against Barcelona is a measure of tactics. Barcelona underated Chelsea and went for all out attack, therefore, Chelsea's breakaways were always a threat and they managed to get those goals in. Don't forget, Chelsea boasts one of the best defence in Europe, with Frank Lebouef available, and Desailly and Ferrer, and of course, Babayaro......Barcelona must put 2 goals pass that wall, and hope that Chelsea doesn't score 1, which is alright, 2, it means Barcelona has to 5-2 (possible??)<br>Valencia and Lazio, if you saw the way these two teams were playing, man......you will know why I think it is not likely Lazio will manage to turn the table.<br>I think the likeliest upset would be Porto vs Bayern, Bayern did not play as well as we thought they could, and with the run of form, well, this will certainly be the most likely of upsets.<br>ManU vs Real......Real had their fair chances, and I didn't mention that ManU didn't have theirs either. In fact, they brought their act together, and created quite a few reasonable chances together, of which Cole ballooned quite a number. West Ham is one team, Real is another. In fact, it has been proven that ManU does not necessarily perform better in Old Trafford than in away games. View through the past European stats for ManU against the tough teams at Old Trafford, and you will see what I mean.<br>Anyway, here is the official odds, which unfortunately ManU tops.<br>ManU: 11-4<br>Bayern: 5-2<br>Chelsea: 4-1<br>Valencia: 5-1<br>Barcelona: 9-1<br>Real: 10-1<br>Lazio: 25-1 (ouch!!!)<br>Porto: 40-1<br>Anyone disagrees with the latest odds figures??</div>
