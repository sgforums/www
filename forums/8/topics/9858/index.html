            <div class='col-md body'>Jake, Johnny, and Billy Bob went to the rodeo. Unfortunately, a big bull<br>jumped the fence into the spectators and they were trampled to death.<br>Being good God-fearing men, they ascended to Heaven where they<br>were met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter. He said, "Welcome to<br>Heaven, gentlemen. I'm sure you'll be quite comfortable here, but I<br>must warn you that we do have our rules in Heaven. If you break them,<br>you'll be punished. One rule is, never step on a duck. If you step on a<br>duck, the duck quacks, then they all quack, and it just goes on and<br>on."<br>That sounded simple enough. They passed through the Pearly Gates<br>and were surprised to find there were ducks everywhere! In no time at<br>all, Jake stepped on one. The duck quacked, then they all quacked,<br>they made a terrible racket and it just went on and on. Pretty soon<br>along came St. Peter with a terribly homely woman in tow. "I warned<br>you that if you broke the duck rule you'd be punished." He chained the<br>homely woman to Jake and said, "You will be together forever," and<br>walked away.<br>Sometime later, despite his best efforts, Johnny accidentally stepped<br>on a duck. The duck quacked, then they all quacked and made a<br>terrible commotion that just went on and on. Sure enough, along came<br>St. Peter with an even homelier woman. "I warned you that if you broke<br>the duck rule you'd be punished." With that, he chained the woman to<br>Johnny and said, "The two of you will be together for all eternity," and<br>walked away.<br>Well, Billy Bob was very careful not to step on a duck. One day St.<br>Peter came along with a drop dead gorgeous blonde. He chained her to<br>Billy Bob and said, "You will be together now and forever more," and<br>walked away.<br>Billy Bob exclaimed, "Wow, I wonder what I did to deserve this?"<br>"I don't know about you," said the beautiful woman, "But I stepped on a<br>duck."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Having been raised on a farm, this young guy had always been<br>fascinated by tractors. He knew every make, every kind, all the<br>attachments, had all the books and catalogues, all the scale models,<br>and by the time he'd reached his teens he had become a total expert<br>on the subject. So when his sixteenth birthday came around, his folks<br>naturally bought him his very own... motorcycle.<br>At first he was terribly disappointed, but as time went by he became<br>more and more fond of the bike. He maintained it, polished it, kept it<br>immaculate and became a skilled rider.<br>A couple of years went by and he was returning to the farm in a<br>friend's car after an evening out, when to his horror he saw that the<br>barn was on fire and the fire department was tackling the blaze. "Oh,<br>Jesus," he cried, "my bike's in there!"<br>He tried to get in to rescue his precious bike, but the fire chief stopped<br>him for his own safety. In desperation he grabbed a ladder, climbed on<br>top of the barn and took one huge hissing deep breath. The fire went<br>out at once.<br>"That's incredible!" the fire chief exclaimed when he came down from<br>the ladder. "How the hell did you manage to do that?"<br>"It's simple," the guy replied. "I'm an ex-tractor fan."</div>

I won't be<br>long.I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"<br>"You want hors d'oeuvres, poochi pooh?"
