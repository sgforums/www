              <p>25 Million USD. I am the richest?</p>
              <pre>Re: mutual investment<br>Attn:  Chairman/Ceo.<br> <br>I am Dr. CHRIS OHARA the chairman of contract award and review committee set<br>up by the federal government of Nigeria under the new civilian dispensation <br>to award new contracts and review existing ones. I came to know of you in my <br>search for areliable and Reputable person to handle a very confidential <br>transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign <br>account. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of <br>multinationals in the oil industry in favour of N.N.P.C. the original value <br>of these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of <br>Usd$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars). This amount<br>has now been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the <br>companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid and <br>the projects officially commissioned.<br> <br>Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount <br>to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are <br>prohibited by the code of conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating <br>and/or opening foreign accounts in our names. Needless to say, the trust <br>reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in return, we have agreed to <br>offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for <br>Incidental expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the <br>course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the balance to<br>other accounts in due course.<br> <br>Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of <br>finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the <br>funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above <br>stated terms. our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord <br>this transaction the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the <br>funds the whole approval procedures will officially and legally<br>processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the<br>bonafide beneficiary. Once more I want you to understand that having put in <br>over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am averse to <br>having<br>my image and career dented.<br> <br>This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it <br>deserves. Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a <br>mail on my confidential e-mail address ( dr_chrisohara@yahoo.com) so that I <br>can brief you further. I want to assure you that this business proposal is <br>100% risk free as we have done our homework properly. I quite believe that <br>you will protect our interest by taking this deal strictly confidential, as <br>we are still in government service, which we intend to retire from. Kindly <br>expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this<br>transfer in the first batch which would constitute the third quarter <br>payments for the 2006 financial year.Thanks and God bless.<br>Dr.Chris Ohara.<br>Email:dr_chrisohara@yahoo.com</pre>
