Everyone, whether they did well or not, deserves a break from being stressed out over exams. Whats done is done, so no point stressing yourself further over it. If u want to be stressed, do so AFTER u've gotten your Os results, before that, go relax.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMPORTANT! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Time management! If the paper have 2 parts, make sure you divide your time equally to half. If the paper have 3 parts, divide your time (i.e. 2 hrs or what into 3 parts).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>If you are unable to do a question, DO NOT BE OBSESSED! dun keep staring at the question, GO to NEXT question and do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Skim through all questions during the 3-4 mins before the paper starts! Use pen or pencil MARK OUT the easy questions or those you think you can DO confidently. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Therefore, in worse case situation, you won't waste time on difficult questions which dun get you large amounts of marks, but go to those easier questions which can get you the equal amount of marks or less, but by doing them you AT LEAST secure quite some marks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>For now, braze yourself for the other examinations! Do not waste time on feeling sad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Time could be spent on better practice.<br><br>And Sleep early before the EXAMS! so that you have a CLEAR mind to think the next day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Finally, pray just before the exams to calm yourself and improve your luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
