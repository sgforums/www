            <div class='col-md body'>Two nuns went out of the convent to sell cookies. One of them is known as Sister Mathematical (SM) and the other one is known as Sister Logical (SL).<br><br>It is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent.<br><br>SL: Have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past half-hour?<br><br>SM: Yes, I wonder what he wants.<br><br>SL: It's logical. He wants to rape us.<br><br>SM: Oh, no! At this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most. What can we do?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do of course is that we have to start walking faster.<br><br>SM: It is not working.<br><br>SL: Of course it is not working. The man did the only obvious thing to do. He started to walk faster too.<br><br>SM: So, what shall we do? At this rate he will reach us in one minute.<br><br>SL: The only logical thing we can do is split. You go that way and I'll go this way. He cannot follow both of us.<br><br>So the man decided to go after Sister Logical.<br><br>Sister Mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried because Sister Logical has not yet arrived. Finally, Sister Logical arrives.<br><br>SM: Sister Logical! Thank God you are here! Tell us what happened!<br><br>SL: The only logical thing happened. The man could not follow both of us, so he followed me.<br><br>SM: So, what happened? Please tell us.<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to happen. I started to run as fast as I could.<br><br>SM: So what happened?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to happen. The man also started to run as fast as he could.<br><br>SM: And what else?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to happen. He reached me.<br><br>SM: Oh, no! What did you do then?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do. I lifted my dress up.<br><br>SM: Oh, Sister. What did the man do?<br><br>SL: The only logical thing to do. He pulled down his pants.<br><br>SM: Oh, no! What happened then?<br><br>SL: Isn't it logical, Sister? A nun with her dress up can run faster than a man with his pants down.<br><br>Gotcha! And you thought it was dirty.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
