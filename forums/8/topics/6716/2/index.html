            <div class='col-md body'>light,<br>i don't think there are many here who employ bombast. if by bombast you mean 'high' sounding language with little meaning then you'll have to point out exmples to me because i haven't seen much of it. however, if by bombast you mean big words and complex sentence structure, i do not see a problem when a person displays a wider vocabulary. in fact i(and i may be in the minority)  prefer to read these posts than those which consist only of singlish one-liners, the latter of which not requiring much thought at all to produce. go look around and you'll see the same people spitting out millions of posts a day but with zero substance. and surely the accusation of audience selectivity may be hurled at those who write like this, alienating those who actually think before they write.<br><br>Quisling,<br>the refuge some people find in singlish may be less noble than you think. i think its an excuse for not engaging in anything they find intimating or 'intellectual'. singlish reifies arguments and offers an escape clause for those unwilling, or unable, to hold their own.<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>It is true that liberty is precious - so precious it must be carefully rationed.<br><br>V.

You are able to express you feelings exactly as it is and its very satisfying. How constricting and uncomfortable (er... cant think of better words) it could be if english had only 300 words. Ever had one of those memory lapse situations where you speak halfway and suddenly struggle to remember a certain word you were just too familiar with?<br><br>Like english mastery is an art (uh...), singlish can be no less intricate too. By singlish i mean our local slightly mutated, broken version of english. But that is secondary because in language, the tone carries the ultimate meaning. Language is merely a medium. In a conversation, as far as casual conversing in singapore is concerned, sometimes broken or singlish expressions are the more adequate rather, than let slightly lengthier 'proper substitutes' dullify it. But sometimes probably tone was not brought out enough which some may find uh... ugly looking? Heh. We are not sitting for an examination here, no risk of our language being judged by some caffeine-addicted cambridge examiner, so what the heck... just post lar!<br><br>Quisling:<br>Whats wrong with people writing singlish when they like to? We try to bring the color of spoken conversations back online albeit distasteful results sometimes.

You may accuse me of insufferable pedantry for this, but I know some thing are just... wrong. Isn't it disrespectful and tardy to make others sift through your haphazard abuse of language just to find out what you mean when you are perfectly capable of writing in standard English?<br><br>It may be acceptable in some limited situations. You mentioned "casual conversing", and I agree. But Singlish has no place in a serious discussion.<br><br>"Just words can spite you?"<br>Obviously I was referring to their intention. My reaction is irrelevant. To find out what I'm referring to, read some of the earlier postings in this very thread.<br><br>"Why do you judge their words more than their intentions? And why do you judge them from their words?"<br>What are their intentions? I thought in a forum like this the intent is encapsulated in the words. If Singlish expresses those views better, well and good. But you'll have to show me an example of that in this forum, because I can't find any.<br><br>In response to your final statement, if we're writing for the lowest common denominator, then I challenge you to rephrase your entire posting using your simpler, happy-pappy Singlish, for greater ease of understanding, without missing a single nuance.</div>
