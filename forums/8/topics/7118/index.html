            <div class='col-md body'>Hi this is up for discussion. No rite or wrong answers... just ur own personal views.<br><br>Having serve in NS, I was quite disappointed to hear ppl esp gals saying that we stand no chance. Having put in the effort and suffered so much to be trained to protect my country and ppl like them, I felt really sad to hear that from them.<br><br>To a certain extent, they are rite to feel that way. Being a small country, we do not have a big armed forces. But we compensate them by having high tech weapons that need fewer man to operate. I strongly believe that we do stand a chance againist any invasion and the most important thing is whether we are believe in ourself and be willing to try our best. I mean if country like Irseal can manage to win the war last time where their neighbouring countries combined to attack them, we have a chance too. I am not saying we will confirm win but if we believe in that Singapore can be defended, we will put in the effort.<br><br>Another thing is whether U thing that defending Spore is worth it or not. One saying is "If you cannot protect what you have, U do not deserve to have them" I agree with that.<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>One last thing, I not from Mindef.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The truth is that singapore has seen war in the early years. Now we do stand a chance to withstand a war for a minimum of lets say maybe a few weeks, But definetly not WIN a war. If you have been updating yourself with the latest Defence news from our Neighbouring countries - we can find that All the 3 neighbouring countries are having more sophisticated weapons.<br>Well there are a lot of Internal secrets which I don't think is safe in here to discuss about.<br>My point is that SINGAPORE can withstand a WAR for atleast few Weeks.<br>Any other views???????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm i think at the moment now ,SAF is doing fine. But they sure need some fine-tuning in many aspects. They seem to be heading in the right direction, ie the ISO 9002 and the army 21 thing. However its difficult lah for an organisation like the SAF to strive for this kind of things.They are NOT MNCs or whatever.<br><br>They should be concentrating on the training instead on admin.They want welfare which is definitely not tough training in these days now.I was an instructor in BMTC where i had a hand in taking recruits n training them. Nowadays they have policies that advocate canteen breaks , more rest time and stuffs like that, which seriously make me laugh.Its more like a holiday resort than an army camp.<br><br>Welfare, i was taught in commanders' school, was tough training.Obviously this has changed. To my horror, SAF is more concerned about the external factors, ie parental intervention and objections.From my observation, our future soldiers will be less tough n rugged, and with that our security in future stays uncertain too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Glad to have so many replies... I had always wonder at the motive why Spore let US use our new Changi Naval base. One reason I can think of is other countries who want to attack us will have to think twice as they will like hit the Americans too and US in order to save their ppl will speed up their reinforcements plans.<br><br>I agree that NS now is too welfare. When I was in NS, life was tough, not so much breaks or things like by wat time must sleep. Not like now so welfare liao.<br><br>Defending for at least a few weeks is no problem and if we are able to inflict heavy damage to the enemies, they may be forced to stop their attacks.<br><br></div>

What happens if our enemies are our own neighboring countries?<br>I heard someone mention about the Army. well the enemies can even destroy singapore even b4 they land on this island. This is a fact.<br>As of my opinion, Singapore only can withstand war for about 1 week... the most 1.5 weeks. Winning is out of the question.<br>The reason why I say this is because we are not trained for a war. And further more singapore is a defensive country not an offensive country........<br>Even at peace there have been a lot of Kokups happening.. Do we stil have the hope of winning a war.....<br><br>Open for views</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On paper, our Armed Forces really are little more than a minor inconvenience. Someone like Saddam might have a bit of a harder time with Singapore than he did with Kuwait, but we would still fall eventually.<br><br>In fact, I wouldn't even classify SAF as a "defence force". Japan has a defence force. Thailand has a defence force. At best, SAF is a deterrent force. It is the job of the SAF to make taking over Singapore so costly that no one would consider it. SAF isn't about winning wars, it's about preventing Singapore from becoming another Kuwait. Thankfully, we don't have vast fields of oil or mineral-rich mines to make us as tempting a target as Kuwait was. Dropping a nuke on Singapore would like-wise be foolish, as you would end up with a pile of rock in the middle of the sea. Not worth much more than the bomb itself.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a toe-to-toe, standard military confrontation, I think the SAF is fooling nobody but itself if it thinks it can beat any decent sized armed forces. Most other nations' armed forces also have the benefit of actual combat experience... nothing truly tests the mettle of a soldier like bullets flying overhead.<br><br>In fact, I would say some countries have police forces with more combat experience than the SAF...  :p<br><br>But, on the other hand, SAF may in fact already have "won" many wars; simply by being here, they prevent wars from happening. In other words, they are a deterrent. Just like the nuclear arsenal of the Cold War-era US and Russia, they aren't meant to be used, but to let the enemy know that they CAN be used if the need arose.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>
