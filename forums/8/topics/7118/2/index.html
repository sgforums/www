            <div class='col-md body'>Hearing our own guys saying that we are going to fall in a week scares me utterly. (U) having been through NS, I expected you to be more confident of our defence capabilities. But if you are not better informed than the average man, I wont blame you as defence is not about letting people know what you can do, but letting people know abt SOME of the things you can do and hopefully that will deter them. Otherwise we show them the TRUE colours when we go into war. Obviously all that NS brainwashing is not thorough enough  :p<br><br>Think abt today's concept of war. We are no longer fighting *people* wars, but inclined towards technology based warfare. Our government seems to be gearing up in certain aspects, which is going to put second thoughts into our possible invaders. Werent we talking abt submarines on moose's thread??<br><br>Think about where you train, besides P. Tekong and the other offshore islands. Does Australia, Brunei, Canada, US sound familiar? We are not alone on this globe. Allies are a strong force too.. if we are to be terrorised unreasonably, world forces are bound to intervene. But before then, you may have to defend yourself for a week or two, mebbe a month or two.. are you up to it?<br><br>After all these, hmm shame on those for not having confidence in defending your own nation. These are all well known facts, it is your confidence in your nation that will paint a different picture using these facts.<br><br>maestro and millenium... dangerous grounds...<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is weird, well i know every citizen will always ask this question. Same here in Malaysia. But does anyone here think there will actually be a war between Asean countries? maybe yes, maybe no. But i think not any in the very near future.<br><br>I personally dont see any reason why Malaysia would attack SG or Thailand attacking Indonesia.<br><br>I think most or maybe all the present Government of Asean understand the word peace. Even if there is any conflics, i believe round table discussion will be the way to get it sortted out. Just like all the border, island dispute...<br><br>Even if theres a war, i think we in Asean will work as a team. I must congragulate SG navy being the first(i think) to own subs in this region. Subs came into Malaysian Navy's mind sometime ago, but those crisis and budget constrain shut the idea out for another few years i think.<br><br>But at the end of the day, those fancy subs, Migs, or F15 may not be the key to win a war. The smart and inteligent way to walk out of the round table may be the case. But ofcause this should not stop everyone from upgrading.<br><br>------------------<br>Just my point of view<br>ndrewÂ™<br>im shit, your shit, we are all shit, serious shit!<br>NitrogenÂ™ Â© 2000 utopia Plc</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To me Singapore is capable of holding off<br>attacks for 3 to 4 weeks. But with this new<br>bunch of NS men I have a lot of doubt!!!!<br>Army is getting too welfare, the soldiers<br>nowadays are weak not physically, BUT MENTALLY.. A bit of hardship and they start<br>to complain!!<br><br>For me I will stay and fight for the country<br>if I was call a upon to do so. I'm not saying that I am a fucking MACHO MAN or GUNHO<br>soldier. I will be definitely more scare them anyone of u outhere if things like this happen... But just think of your family and friend. You can say packup every thing and run BUT DO U REALLY THING U CAN RUN ALWAY..<br>At least u stay and fight u still stand a chance in holding or even pushing back enemies attacks..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well... so glad to get so many responses since I first put up the topic. At least U guys bother to put in ur comments and that is a first step.<br><br>No matter what the outcome of the war will be, I still prefer to lose knowing that at least I tried my best to protect Singapore then to lose the war with the knowledge that I did nothing to prevent it.<br><br>If U have not confidence in urself and is not willing to even try, then U will never succeed as it is always easier to sit there doing nothing and telling urself not to bother as it will be useless than to put in the effort to at least try doing something.<br><br>And I remembered asking this " Where can U go if U do not fight?" Who are willing to accept refugees nowadays unless U super Rich.<br><br>Well, unlikely ppl will use nuclear warfare on us as most of us knows that those who use nuclear will be despised by many ppl. And remember if they use nuclear, our nearby neighbours like Malaysia and Indonesia will also be affected and it does cover a wide area affecting not the land but also the nearby sea. And like I ask b4, do U want to sit there waiting for the bomb to drop on U or do U at least want to do something to prevent it? If U prefer to wait for the bomb to drop on U, then I must say U really deserve the bomb.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Anyway, these are just my comments and like I said b4, there are no rite or wrong answers.<br>Thanks once again to those who took time to put in the comments to this topic.</div>

We are not talking abt self-confidence issues.. Let me ask you a simple q? If a stranger approaches you at a public place pointing a weapon at you. what would be your reaction. Do you have time to think of your self-confidence or do you react to the situation...<br>The eg: which I reffered to can be applied on a battle field. But you need more tactics and more exposure to these enviornments.. Does Singapore Soilders have any combat experience in the past? NONE. Most of the soilders you see nowadays are just book worms(including me). We learn what is written in the books!!!We donot have any exposure.(Not that exposure we get in Mandai or in Tekong}! ahahaha.......<br><strong>And I remembered asking this " Where can U go if U do not fight?"

Our Airforce,Is not a Nursury school for Kids, it's an striking force capable of lots more things than anyone could imagine. Well I do not intend to proceed further into this topic as they more classified matters.<br><br>Open for your comments and views....
