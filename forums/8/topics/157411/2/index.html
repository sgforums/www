I was a good 6 stops away from my stop when I felt someone running their fingers through my hair!<br><br>I can't tell if it was 1 of those "harassment-suite-waiting-to-happen" touches because I reacted immediately to it by letting out a Â“littleÂ” yelp (at least I believed it was a Â“littleÂ” yelp heheÂ…<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">) shifting away from e hand &amp; turning around to look at e person it belonged to (knocking into some ppl crammed beside me in e process).<br><br>But I was pretty certain e touch was made deliberately.<br><br>I found where e hands led toÂ….it belonged to this office-attired Caucasian man who was very apologetic. He kept explaining that he saw a bug in my hair in a fluster while seemingly searching around the cabin floor for e bug that Â“got awayÂ”.<br><br>I wasnÂ’t in a right frame of mind to judge (IÂ’m terrified of bugs  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) so I just thanked him while nervously screening e floor (in case e Â“bugÂ” decides to Â“come back homeÂ”), trying desperately to hide my embarrassment &amp; containing my fear at e same time!<br><br>This small commotion turned everyoneÂ’s eyes on us. e cabin was cramped so there was no place for me to turn away from him. So we exchanged some casual and very subdued small-talk (I was still in a fluster because of e Â“bugÂ”). When I finally got to alight (I heaved a huge sigh of relief here Â– u wonÂ’t know how fast I tried to get out of there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">), he followed me &amp; asked me to wait.<br><br>I turned to face him with a feeling of inner dread (I was hoping for e embarrassing to end A.S.A.P!) when he produced his name card &amp; asked for mine in return! My mind drew a blank so we exchanged name cards (actuallyÂ…IÂ’m kinda regretting it now).<br><br>I got to office &amp; started pondering. I shared e episode with my closer colleagues who asked &amp; they feel strongly that this is a Â“ployÂ” by that guy save for 1 or 2 who thought otherwise (hmmÂ…do guys really stoop that low to get numbers?)<br><br>So my morning drama ends hereÂ….any inputs ladies?  What would u have done faced with e scenario? Or any advises for me now? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote>You should have shouted at him "WTF do you think you are doing???<br><br>Bugs... heh.. that's a lame excuse anyway, i really can't believe that you actually believed him. if there's really a bug in your hair, shouldn't he at least let you know first? before running thru his fingers in your hair?<br><br>and OMG.. u gave him your name card....haha.. thats it..  god bless you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
