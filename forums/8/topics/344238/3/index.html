              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="/users/183231">ChoCoChips</a>, then why state girls can get free sex easily in the first place. u make it seem as if girls do that ya know. and i didnt know u're a guy. but since u're a guy, would u want a girl who has a clean record and be loyal to u alone? or a slut who got fucked countless times?(rocky involvements)</p>

              <p>uh no.</p>
              <p>1. Uhh why would it not be okay for one to have mood swings. let me guess guys dont ever have mood swings? i'm saying that at least when girls have mood swings, we are entitled to blaming our tempers on nature, what do guys have? not the same old "school/work/life is stressing me out" again...</p>
              <p>2. Girls are not OBLIGED to marry OR to change our names to that of our husbands. many females still keep their maiden names after marriages. And just because you're following someone else's surname, it doenst mean that they own you. it's like saying, that once you change your name, the guy's great grandfather owns you too? since they all would have the same surname.</p>
              <p>wtf.</p>
              <p>3. Ever wondered why there is such a sharply increasing rate in lesbian couples?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(rest assured it positively has nothing to do with the increasing number of guys like you flooding the already over taxed earth.)</p>

              <p><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/248127">stuffedbears</a> well said. but as a girl, would u want to do that? do u actually enjoy having this kind of definite mood swings and then hitting on us guys? yes we guys have mood swings only bcoz of? maybe a hard day or something didn't go too well during the day? but we don't have blood coming out every month and having to deal with the same shit over again.</p>
              <p>well yes true as well. but it does sound like he owns you doesnt it? why would the fact of changing ur sir name come in the first place? why not guys changing their sir name ever settled in as a tradition in the first of many earlier years?</p>
              <p>lesbians? yeah true. i guess the girl can say she has met the girl of her life.</p>
