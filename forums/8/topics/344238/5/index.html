              <p>thanks for waiting =) another point to show?</p>
              <p>1.girls have to suffer period every month. i mean like, guys
              don't even have to. we just enjoy with nothing to worry on. girls
              have to keep track and swing their moods, have headaches and
              cramps.</p>
              <p>2.another point. pregnancy. girls, havent u ever imagined urself
              giving birth? the pain? the size of the baby's head fitting through
              ur tight pussy? i feel for u. having to walk around with the baby
              in the tummy is dangerous. how restricted u are?</p>
              <p>3.another. girls have to put up with perverts staring at u and u
              cant do nothing about it? girls, haven't u ever thought of being on
              the other side of the world as a guy and doing those things. as
              guys, u would have nothing much to worry on. if u're a girl, being
              stalked and all =  rape so be careful.</p>
              <p>and please for those who have nothing else better to say, don't.
              i want the girls to prove me wrong.</p>

              <p>its not sad to be a girl.</p>
              <p>girls get all the attention they want.</p>
              <p>they get approach by men all the time but they dun haf to give the men SEX. they can still win favours.</p>
              <p>girls who get attention assumes a high level of status. means she is socially connected and can easily get favours.</p>
              <p>if they wear miniskirts, means they're comfortable with it and dun haf a problem wearing it. in fact they are flaunting it. to get attention and win favours. otherwise they can wear jeans also if they jus want to dress comfortably. they haf a CHOICE.</p>
              <p>if u go to clubs, girls who are naturally attractive get preferential treatment. in fact girls have more power than guys in the club scene. cuz they bring the crowd in. cuz attractive girls attract boys and other girls which is good for business. this is just an example. girls who have it and want to flaunt it are in actuality in control. they haf a higher status and its not sad at all.</p>
              <p>they cant be bothered if u see underneath their skirt or watever. they know if u notice them they already have you in their little game. and u think its a victory. cuz ur living in ur own bubble. the big picture is they are already winning and they dun have to give in to sex all the time to win them favours.</p>
              <p>the sad ones are the banglas or chikopeks who cud only dream to be with this kind of gals and resort to watching porn or rub themselves in the bus lol</p>

              me? openness? well it's the openess that does not shock which
              contributes to the news such as these. to those who don't realize.
              to those who think that owh, it's like this accept it the way it is
              and as well as the impacts. if they realize the openess then they
              would be conservative(on the point of girls getting more sex
              easily) and nation leaders around the world wont have to battle
              with this shit. only by feeling this shockness will they(if u're a
              girl,then you) be more careful with the way these effects have on
              them. do the right things(bcoz anyway they're are at a
              disadvantage) so do the right things to reduce it. don't come
              talking to me on what u don't know. pointing out what u reli

              OF YOU! in this topic, some have stated girls can get sex
              easier(the idea is already wrong)</div>

              <div>i have to go now. what i am actually really trying to
              say is for the girls. you girls already should know ur
              disadvantages in terms of law, and as a human. so do the right
              things like ur decency, ur attitude, ur way of thinking towards sex
              as prize then u girls are being smarter towards it rather than

              <div>i have to go now. what i am actually really trying to say is for the girls. you girls already should know ur disadvantages in terms of law, and as a human. so do the right things like ur decency, ur attitude, ur way of thinking towards sex as prize then u girls are being smarter towards it rather than selling urself and all. chaoz.</div>

              <p><br>wah, you really make people want to beat you up. Girls are having disadvantages in terms of law, and as a human?? PUI !!!! Telling the whole world that girls are under the ownership of guys?? PUI !!!! Do you know that guys would willing to do anything for the girls just to win their hearts. I remember that one of your post says that you would cherish the girl of your life. You don't bother finding a girlfriend lah. It's much more like you would end up killing her/beating her to death. There is nothing to compare girls and guys. If you got a hatred towards for girls, then get lost here lah, full of nonsense sia from of your post. Brat pig</p>

              <p><br>What's with you?? So what if a girl has been fcuked by countless guys. If the guy truly love the girl, the guy won't even mind of her past. You think that girls who have lost their virginity would not be wanted by other guys anymore?? Sad case sia you, you are living in the world of your imagination. I don't even think you know what is love. And I don't even think that you ever deserve a girlfriend. Any girl who falls for you I really pity her. Wasted sia she</p>

              <p>its not sad to be a girl.</p>
              <p>girls get all the attention they want.</p>
              <p>they get approach by men all the time but they dun haf to give
              the men SEX. they can still win favours.</p>
              <p>girls who get attention assumes a high level of status. means
              she is socially connected and can easily get favours.</p>
              <p>if they wear miniskirts, means they're comfortable with it and
              dun haf a problem wearing it. in fact they are flaunting it. to get
              attention and win favours. otherwise they can wear jeans also if
              they jus want to dress comfortably. they haf a CHOICE.</p>
              <p>if u go to clubs, girls who are naturally attractive get
              preferential treatment. in fact girls have more power than guys in
              the club scene. cuz they bring the crowd in. cuz attractive girls
              attract boys and other girls which is good for business. this is
              just an example. girls who have it and want to flaunt it are in
              actuality in control. they haf a higher status and its not sad at
              all.</p>
              <p>they cant be bothered if u see underneath their skirt or
              watever. they know if u notice them they already have you in their
              little game. and u think its a victory. cuz ur living in ur own
              bubble. the big picture is they are already winning and they dun
              have to give in to sex all the time to win them favours.</p>
              <p>the sad ones are the banglas or chikopeks who cud only dream to
              be with this kind of gals and resort to watching porn or rub
              themselves in the bus lol</p>
