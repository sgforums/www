We accept girls for who and what they are. In fact, i do prefer to talk and hang out with the friends of mine, in many ways, they are much more mature compared guys.

              <div class="name"><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/108189">burndog85</a> i know u should hang out here and see what happens when u restate that sentence.</div>
              <div class="name"><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/244942">xstryker</a> i'm not a sexist or anything. indeed i am more than meets the eye. i just want girls to realize the openess and think of the right things coz from what i read from ALL OF YOU! in this topic, some have stated girls can get sex easier(the idea is already wrong)</div>
              <div class="name"><a href="http://sgforums.com/users/239595">pewpew</a> what bout the bye bye?</div>
              <div class="name">i have to go now. what i am actually really trying to say is for the girls. you girls already should know ur disadvantages in terms of law, and as a human. so do the right things like ur decency, ur attitude, ur way of thinking towards sex as prize then u girls are being smarter towards it rather than selling urself and all. chaoz.</div>
