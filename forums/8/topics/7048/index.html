            <div class='col-md body'>Changi is not a lighthouse. I'm sorry if you misunderstood me.<br>Sakijiang Beacon might be a RACON beacon, but i wouldn't call it a lighthouse. well...it's depends on how u look at it, but from the 5 lighthouse pt of view, it is. Though it looks radically different from the tower structure of Sultan Shoal, Raffles and Horsburgh.<br><br>gigolo, Amber Light is a T-shaped structure from the sea. Bedok is very obviously reddish-orange (depends on how u look at it). Oh yes...Amber light is on the beach, not on the tallest building in S'pore.<br><br>Amber, Bedok and Changi are the fave 3 nav marks to take fixs the moment u pass Kallang Basin. I've looked at them so many times I won't have a problem distinguishing them.<br><br>Well, I suppose from mainland, the best lighthouse to snap a photo of is Sultan Shoal. If you know where to look, u can just see it and I suppose it would look a lot better from Jurong Island (if the anchored ships don't get in your way that is)<br><br>tranquilice, if i were u, i would just snap a photo privately from a boat. Getting to Raffles and Sultan Shoal is very easy. Getting your fren in the RSN is a risky business. If his CO finds out...well, let's hope he's not on Fearless. I'll pray for him if he is and gets caught.<br><br></div>
