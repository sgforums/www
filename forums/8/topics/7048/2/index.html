            <div class='col-md body'>Altrex,i read your thread on the Selection Criteria Of SAF Officers,it would seem to me that your tone is very harsh as though you got up on thw wrong side of the bed(not literally)and as what Millenium has said,your view seems to be only shared by Chromeheart,i wonder why is this so,if the majority of the threads disagreed with you and is representative of the views hold by those who have served in the SAF or are serving in the SAF,it seems that majority agree that there is some biaseness involved,but which system is perfect?None.But i still seem that your harsh tone is uncalled for,as Littleman has said,this forum is to share your views,not to flame other,call others kids even if some are,not to engage in some mudslinging or be condescending,i hope the purpose of this forum is just to share views and get to see other points of view, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))<br><br>P.S I am sure that are ways of getting your point across without resorting to calling people names  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>
