            <div class='col-md body'><p>Alright, so the other day I was shopping for stationery. I was feeling a bit tired, so I accidentally dropped a few items, including a paint marker. When I picked the items up, I absent-mindedly put the marker in my pocket. After browsing a bit more, I forgot that I had the marker in my pocket and grabbed a new one. I checked out and paid for the items, including the new marker. One hour later, I realised that I still had the extra marker I hadn't paid for in my pocket, so I hurried back to the store and paid for it. I explained that I forgot to check the item out and showed the receipt with the payment for the other items, so I paid for the extra marker even though I didn't really need the extra.<br><br>My worry is that, would I get into trouble for this? Would the store call the police much later and I suddenly get dragged to the station for questioning?</p></div>

              <p>Actually my main worry is that the clerk didn't understand what I was saying. I was really, really nervous -- not about getting shamed, but about the shop suddenly accusing me of shoplifting. The marker was in my pocket for 1 hour plus, so I started to assume that they might have contacted the authorities. So I kind of stuttered. I also didn't show the rest of the items I had paid for (which includes the other marker I paid for), so the clerk might not have understood my situation perfectly. She didn't give me a receipt for the extra marker too.</p>
              <p>Of course, they didn't accuse me of shoplifting or anything, but I'm still worried. Seriously, I'm pretty much screwed if they make this a case.</p>

              <p>Not sure if I understand the "other people" part... What do you mean by "if it was other people then it's not very good"?<br><br>Thanks for the replies up till now, everyone. I'm probably going to sleep a bit more soundly now that I'm less worried. Still really worried, but a bit better :)</p>

              <p>I doubt they would do anything about it. Some people are lazy and filing  for such things is way more trouble to them. Besides it seemed like an honest mistake.</p>
              <p>Regarding shop lifting....they have the rights to complain to the authorities because you walked out of the shops perimeters with the item in your pocket. If you had that item in your pocket but still within the shop perimeters, they have no case aganst you.</p>
              <p>Next time check you pocket for anything first before you walk out of the store..</p>

              <p><br>My case is when I bought my daily dose of coffee at $1.20. While walking after drinking the whole pack, I realised the my pocket got extra 10 cents coins. Then I realised the uncle charged me $1.10. So the next day when I returned to get my daily dose, I pay $1.20 + give back the $0.10 they under charge me.</p>
