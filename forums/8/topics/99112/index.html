Of course i am not talking about movies or chips in the head... which btw "there's already chips in the hand personal identification system in this world." Maybe i dint phrase correctly. I meant to say  - that with the kind of intelligence, communication and of course gadgets and equipments to trace DNA, it is kind of hard to totally lose contact of a person in a developed .. or advance developing country. I mean look we all have I/C number .. and for foreginers, they also have their id numbers ... i just can't see how we can juse lose contact of a person like this.</div>

Workers at the centre said it was not unusual to see them together.<br><br>Madam Huang said Mr Took told her he had seen Huang Na on the day she disappeared and had told her to go home.<br><br>Huang Na was last seen at about 1pm on Oct 10 after she went barefoot to the food court 500m from her home to make a long-distance call to her mother, who was then in China.<br><br>A worker at the stall where Mr Took is employed, who declined to be named, said he failed to turn up for work on Wednesday after being quizzed by police on Tuesday.<br><br>But she said this was not 'unusual' as he had been absent several times before without informing the boss.<br><br>For full report, see Saturday's edition of The Straits Times.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prodigy:</div><div class="quote_body">wah...wat happened? care to share?</div></blockquote>I was in Pri School.  I usually took a school bus home.  But cuz that year was close to PSLE.  There were a lot of remediel lessons in the afternoon.  So I missed the school bus and had to take a public bus.<br><br>That time, my flat was quite a distance from the bus stop.  The distance is about 15 minutes walk.  I was usually a careful person and avoid quiet lanes and alleys.<br><br>That day, at about 3 pm, I took the usual path from bus stop to my flat.  It was a HDB estate.  A man came to me and spoke in Hokkien.  I didn't understand the dialect (and to date, I never do).  But I managed to catch a few words here and there... words like "your father" "bring you to..." .  So I figured that he was telling me that my father instructed him to bring me to somewhere.  He was a total stranger so something was definitely wrong.  So I ran as quickly as I could to my block.<br><br>As I ran, I looked around for help.  But that afternoon, the stupid FUK UP neighbourhood was unusually quiet that afternoon!!! (nobody walking, no kids at the playground etc).  The man got hold of me and threatened to beat me up if I ran away again.  I was scared and didn't know what to do cuz even if I screamed, no one would come to my rescue.  The neighbourhood was like a ghost town!!!!  (it was a HDB neighbourhood somemore!! )   So I walked with him for a couple of minutes and looked around for any adults that might pass by.<br><br>I saw a 30 plus year old auntie walking.  I quickly ran to her and told her what happened.  She turned around and so did I.  The man quickly hid behind the pillar but was still peeping (probably he was hoping that the woman would shake me off and he could catch me again).<br><br>The auntie walked me to my block.  But she didn't took a lift up with me nor walked me to my door steps.  She literally told me that she was in a hurry to fetch her son from school**.  She handed me to an old lady and explained to her what happened.  The old lady was very kind.  She took a lift up with me and walked me to my door.  She comforted me and told me to drink some warm water to calm myself down.<br><br>After I reached home, I was still shivering.  My parents didn't bring me to the police station as they didn't want me to go thru all the trauma and stuff.  But if this ever happened to my children next time (choy!  touch wood!), I would probably insist on reporting to police.  Who knows... the kidnapper might target another kid, after the failed attempt.<br><br>(**That time I didn't understand why she was so unhelpful.  But now I understand.  Cuz she was worried same bad thing might happen to her child who was still hanging around the school waiting for her.)</div>
