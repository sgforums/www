She was smiling and seemed happy.<br><br>Then, the 9-year-old girl, who came to Singapore from China with her mother about 18 months ago, vanished.<br><br>The police are intensifying their search for the girl, and the Criminal Investigation Department has joined the Clementi Police Division to work on the case.<br><br>Her mother, Madam Huang Shu Ying, has been frantically combing various areas - Sentosa, HDB estates, Bukit Timah hill, Mount Faber - to find the Primary 2 girl.<br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-10-21/dxwhat-225108.jpg"><br>FAMILY PROBLEMS?<br><br>Private investigator (PI) Harmon Singh said interviews have to be done with the girl's relatives (even those in China), classmates, teachers, neighbours and even the school cleaners because 'you never know who'll point you in the right direction'.<br><br>Mr Lionel de Souza, who was a police officer for about 26 years before starting his own PI firm, said it's crucial to find out what the relationship between the parents is like.<br><br>'We have to establish whether the parents are estranged, and if the child is trapped between them,' he said.<br><br>Madam Huang declined to give us her husband's contact number in China, as she does not want to 'further worry him'.<br><br>But she said there are no problems with her husband or relatives.<br><br>The police have taken away the girl's passport as part of their investigations.<br><br>A Chinese Embassy official told The New Paper that they have asked Xiamen officials to process a visa for Huang Na's father.<br><br>Mr Wang Yong Li said: 'We met Madam Huang on Monday, and she expressed her wish to have her husband here with her, so we're helping to expedite the visa application. We're also keeping in touch with her every day, to assist in any way.'<br><br>HELD BY A CRIMINAL?<br><br>Mr Singh, who was also with the police force for 21 years, doesn't rule out the possibility that Huang Na may be held by a sex offender or a mentally ill person.<br><br>He said: 'Checks have to be done on people who have been in the girl's company - whether they have a mental record or have been convicted sex offenders.'<br><br>Huang Na has been described by those who know her as 'cute, childish and clever'.<br><br>She was a familiar figure in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre as she would wander around alone while her mother helped out at one of the vegetable stalls.<br><br>Private investigators say it's unlikely that she has been abducted for ransom, as there have been no demands from any kidnappers.<br><br>$10,000 REWARD<br><br>Retired businessman Yeo Aik Seng, 60, is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone with information which can help find the girl.<br><br>He told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'I'm not related to them in any way, but my wife and I... feel very sorry for the mother.'<br><br>Anyone with information can contact senior investigation officer Loong Yew Jeong on 6774-0000 or 6872-7902.<br><br></div>

We need volunteers we need their legs, their hands, their time, their efforts and their hearts to actually reach out to more shops and designated areas to create more awareness for these missing people."<br><br>His efforts have not gone unnoticed - he received a call today from a mother who said her 14-year-old daughter Sophia Sim has been missing for 8 days.<br><br>About 100 concerned members of the public registered to be part of future search efforts and with this new pool of volunteers, organisers are hoping to conduct yet another search effort for these missing persons next weekend.<br><br>Those interested in joining the search effort can phone the organisers at 6293 5250. - CNA<br></div>

She was smiling and seemed happy.<br><br>Then, the 9-year-old girl, who came to Singapore from China with her mother about 18 months ago, vanished.<br><br>The police are intensifying their search for the girl, and the Criminal Investigation Department has joined the Clementi Police Division to work on the case.<br><br>Her mother, Madam Huang Shu Ying, has been frantically combing various areas - Sentosa, HDB estates, Bukit Timah hill, Mount Faber - to find the Primary 2 girl.<br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-10-21/dxwhat-225108.jpg"><br>FAMILY PROBLEMS?<br><br>Private investigator (PI) Harmon Singh said interviews have to be done with the girl's relatives (even those in China), classmates, teachers, neighbours and even the school cleaners because 'you never know who'll point you in the right direction'.<br><br>Mr Lionel de Souza, who was a police officer for about 26 years before starting his own PI firm, said it's crucial to find out what the relationship between the parents is like.<br><br>'We have to establish whether the parents are estranged, and if the child is trapped between them,' he said.<br><br>Madam Huang declined to give us her husband's contact number in China, as she does not want to 'further worry him'.<br><br>But she said there are no problems with her husband or relatives.<br><br>The police have taken away the girl's passport as part of their investigations.<br><br>A Chinese Embassy official told The New Paper that they have asked Xiamen officials to process a visa for Huang Na's father.<br><br>Mr Wang Yong Li said: 'We met Madam Huang on Monday, and she expressed her wish to have her husband here with her, so we're helping to expedite the visa application. We're also keeping in touch with her every day, to assist in any way.'<br><br>HELD BY A CRIMINAL?<br><br>Mr Singh, who was also with the police force for 21 years, doesn't rule out the possibility that Huang Na may be held by a sex offender or a mentally ill person.<br><br>He said: 'Checks have to be done on people who have been in the girl's company - whether they have a mental record or have been convicted sex offenders.'<br><br>Huang Na has been described by those who know her as 'cute, childish and clever'.<br><br>She was a familiar figure in the Pasir Panjang Wholesale Centre as she would wander around alone while her mother helped out at one of the vegetable stalls.<br><br>Private investigators say it's unlikely that she has been abducted for ransom, as there have been no demands from any kidnappers.<br><br>$10,000 REWARD<br><br>Retired businessman Yeo Aik Seng, 60, is offering a $10,000 reward to anyone with information which can help find the girl.<br><br>He told The New Paper in Mandarin: 'I'm not related to them in any way, but my wife and I... feel very sorry for the mother.'<br><br>Anyone with information can contact senior investigation officer Loong Yew Jeong on 6774-0000 or 6872-7902.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Who knows, pardon me but maybe her mum ill- treated her. The news is always one sided, it's the reporters and the victim's ideals but what abt the whole big picture? We won't know if there was an ill blood between all parties involved.<br><br>EDIT: Spelling mistake.</div>
