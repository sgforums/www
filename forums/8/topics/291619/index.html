            <div class='col-md body'>hi<br>i am a student in NUS,<br>i purchased a K800i set from a shop  in Sim Lim square,<br>at the time of purchase the shopkeeper didnt tell me that it has no warranty as it was an export set. he said it will work fine in singapore.<br>but i found out that it has a peculiar problem - if i do not make or receive any calls or sms for about 2 hours then my phone becomes unreachable to anyone trying to call me.<br>when i told that to the shop, they told me to go to the service center. the sony service center people told me that this set had no warranty and it is the software of the phone that is causing the network problem, since it is made to work for Vodafone Germany. if they try to change the software (of course at a cost), the phone may not switch on at all.<br>i told this to the shop, and they washed their hands off it, they said they cant do anything about it.<br>i went to the CASE, and had some negotiations with the shop, but now they claim that i was quoted 2 prices - for a set with warranty and for a set without it, and i chose the set without warranty, because it was cheap.<br>that day at another shop i was getting a set for 480 with warranty, while from this shop i got it for 425.<br>i want to know whether i should go to the Small Claims tribunal, whether my case has any weight?<br>since now they claim that they quoted me 2 prices, and i have no evidence to show what really happened that day.<br>i wish i had a spy camera on me that day.<br>so please reply soon<br>thanks,<br>coolme07</div>
