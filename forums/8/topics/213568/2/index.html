In fact, everytime I slept anywhere else other than my bed, I'd miraculously walk back to my bed in my sleep, up the stairs and avoiding any obstacles in my way. Haven't done that in ages...but I thought it was just some kind of passing phase and didn't think too much into it.<br><br>A funny incident happen when my sister was really young though. She sleepwalked downstairs, went into the kitchen thinking it was the toilet, and pulled her pants down and squatted on the kitchen floor. Me and my dad were wondering what the hell she was doing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
