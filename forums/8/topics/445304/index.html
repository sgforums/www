              <p>The reason why this particular law should be repealed......or at least the thinking behind it......is the same with the thinking about repealing the law banning same-gender relation.</p>
              <p>It is for equality and progression.</p>

              <p>If this law exists, that means there wont be true equality and there wont be real animal welfare.</p>
              <p>Animal welfare must first of all, first and foremost, comes from mental equality.</p>
              <p>If human and animal relation is deemed as "wrong" , then it is a form of discrimination and second-classing of a whole bunch of species and people.</p>
              <p>I always see that we as humans are blessed with reason, compassion, ability to think, ability to contantly build on our civilization, and yet we are still enslaving many other species who are sharing this earth with us and we think they are second class than us.</p>
              <p>Lately, we have come forward and made many progress, but, there are also many other areas where we as people are quite barbaric, such as, subjugating animals for food, enslavement for work labour (doesnt exist much in Singapore admitedly), and lastly I think for real true progression and improving the last civil rights frontiers, we as humans must understand that animals are sentient beings, capable of thinking, emotion, perception, pain, pleasure, and personality.</p>
              <p>If we recognize them as beings,</p>
              <p>It is immoral to place a mental segregation like that.</p>
              <p>I hope you understand now where I come from and what I mean by this.</p>
              <p>If I can explain a bit and use the logic behind the gay-rights movement.......Think about it, nobody say now that some NMP who argue for repeal of law forbidding same-gender relation is a homosexual person himself / herself, and nobody now say homosexuals should "go see a shrink" , but why is there so much prejudice, malice, bigotry, and revulsion towards human beings who happen to have a loving relations with another living creature who happen to be of a different species...?</p>
              <p>I think this law should be removed to achieve mental emancipation.</p>
              <p>Why do we see sometimes on STOMP, people who chain their dogs to their front door for hours...?</p>
              <p>Why do we see on STOMP, people who torture cats ?</p>
              <p>The reason if we think deeper about it, is because in our minds and in our mentality, we still have not reached real true understanding and appreciation of animals as our fellow sentient beings.</p>
              <p>I think some people just see them as "talking objects" , almost.</p>
              <p>So it is like "talking chair" , or "talking table" , I mean they place them as some kind of worthless or second-class conception. Their lives and welfare is not important as humans'</p>
              <p>This law forbidding human-animal relation is a form of discrimination and stigma and it further strengthens the distance and the dichotomy between humans and animals. It promotes mental segregation which results in mental excesses such as seeing them as second-class non-feeling objects for subjugation and mistreatment.</p>

              <p>The reason people are against things like incest or gay marriages is because of the problems it caused. Incest cause a higher risk of prematured baby deaths or a baby born with retardation, for example.</p>

              <p>I used to be opposed to repeal of section 377A because I am a conservative and I have never met or known any gay people.</p>
              <p>I just dont understand all those things.</p>
              <p>But after now I grow up a bit and gotten older a bit, my mind expand a little and I try to understand various things in this world.</p>
              <p>To me, I think only crimes and wrong deeds should be outlawed, and so yes I agree with those campaigners who say, if the law explicitly write that it is prohibited, then it is a form of discrimination, criminalization, stigmatization, and dictating what is or is not acceptable private behaviour.</p>
              <p>Lately, I was surprised to read about the recent announcement by the Law Minister Shanmugam, he said he wanted to repeal the old English law saying that rape victims can be asked for her past record to determine whether she is a "good girl" or not. Now I am not sure what is the status of this. I think maybe that law is repealed already.</p>
              <p>But I remember reading his comments saying that the old law is hideous and outdated, archaic, and need to be removed for todays modern world.</p>
              <p>I believe that other similar old English laws forbidding other types of behaviour should also be removed because they also relfect the old archaic outdated English norms during that time.</p>
              <p>So laws against same-gender relation, human-animal relation, and inner-family relation, all should be repealed.</p>
              <p>I do not understand why the Law Minister Shanmugam only choose the "good girl test" law to be repealed but not the other ones.</p>
              <p>If we think deeper about it, they are all the same.</p>

              <p>I see........</p>
              <p>So you are asking me a deep philosophical question.....in terms of human life and animal life, if you must choose one, which one will you sacrifice ?</p>
              <p>Actually this type of question has been asked in some schools overseas as part of project of promoting animal welfare by some animal rights groups.</p>

              <p>First, human are animal, just that they are civilised thru a system, a rules and a laws to govern them, otherwise, they can be worst then animals, and unfortunately, human are blessed with a good brain, the most intelligent animals that kill others and also their own for the sake of power, glory and self interest.</p>
              <p>Even as civilise as they are, they can be worst than animals</p>
              <p>Human throws their babies, kill each other for space, commit suicides, use other animals to work and eat, destroy other animal inhabitant and some more can act as caring and nature lover, so hypocratic indeed. Human is unequal but proclaim themselves to be equal, all men are equal, but some men are higher</p>
              <p>Animals dun kill themselves, they dun throw their babies, they live with the nature and life goes on thru an ecological system, all are equal living on each other existence, but human make use of them, take this and that from them, eat their meat, kill their youngs, burnt and crash their house and use got the gut to do animinated show out of them.</p>

Even if you don't wish to marry your pet, this pet-human marriage site is a very interesting sight. Here you will find examples of scores of people happily married to their pets. You can also read moving animal-human love stories. Of course, you are not permitted to have sex with your pet; no, not even to see what the kids look like. Your pet is entitled to half your house and your entire income. The site is happy to marry you to your pet but shakes off all responsibility for what happens afterwards. If, for example, you have a disagreement with Foo-foo or Dido, it is your funeral and you can't go whining to the party that married you. And you definitely can't mistreat your pet just because he or she is now your spouse. Your marriage is recognized neither by the church nor by the state. It is just your personal bond of love with your furry or feathery darling. Animal welfare activists can breathe a sigh of relief and rest assured that no animal has been harmed so far due to these weddings. On the contrary, a few enthusiastic animal brides or bridegrooms have bitten or pecked their human partners' fingers.</p>

              <p>I agree with some of that.</p>
              <p>I think, most people are actually good people.</p>
              <p>We are fundamentally good, and want to be good.</p>
              <p>But it is a question of mentality, of perception.</p>
              <p>If 
              people can have a better understanding of other species and can have a 
              better appreciation, then the better treatment would flow naturally.</p>
              <p>So it is all a question of mentality and philosophy.</p>
              <p>I
               think other than this law, which I admit is probably a niche issue 
              which most people dont think and dont care about, I think the bigger 
              issue is food.......we are still subjugating animals for food 
              harvesting......How can we have a true animal welfare if in a corner of 
              our minds, we think it is acceptable to kill lives for food 
              harvesting.....that it is acceptable to keep chicken in those chicken 
              factories to be butchered.</p>
              <p>No wonder we see cat torturers.</p>
              <p>Because
               in our minds we say that it is acceptable to subjugate and enslave them
               completely and finally take their lives and eat their bodies. So as long as we have this dichotomy, we cannot reconcile them.</p>
              <p>As we advance, finally one day in future I think it will be illegal to kill animals to eat them.</p>
              <p>Just
               imagine, in the past during barbarian days, ancient tribes sometimes 
              kill other humans and eat them. This is called cannibalism. Just a few 
              decades ago some tribes in PapuaNewGuinea still practice this 
              cannibalism. But nowadays it is unacceptable and is considered barbaric.</p>
