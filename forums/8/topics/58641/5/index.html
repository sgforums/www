In fact, most of us here are saying about the suing of Rayson which is the wrong that she did, and Andrea is definitely at fault. However, vanity is indeed a personal choice. In the example you quoted, it is same case as Andrea just that no Rayson. Must blame the person himself or herself, and the importers or manufacturers. It's both parties fault.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, Andrea has to be responsible for this too. She's vain and think that she's fat and  (which she's not) insisted on buying the pills to consume.<br><br>I sympathise when she has to undergo liver transplant when her liver fail. After the operation, she decided to sue the importer and TV media but I don't understand why she has to sue Rayson Tan. When the verdict is being shown on TV, Rayson did say that he will be careful when come to making friends.<br><br>It's actually uncalled for. All this has caused him to lose trust in ppl and worst of all, he and Andrea are colleagues and they have to face each other in future unless Andrea go back to Channel 5. She said that Rayson is also being sued as he sold the pills to her.<br><br>But I don't think she can get the 1 million as Semon Liu might file for bankruptcy. Aigh! The World has changed!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>many, if not all of the public, felt that rayson tan is the innocent party involved...i see andrea's suing him as an act of betrayal of friendship...what's worse is the fact that she herself said that they "were merely colleagues, not friends". what a B!TCH! remember the show where the 2 acted as a couple? hard to imagine one can be just "colleagues" after working together in a drama series...<br><br>serves her right that she has to pay the bulk of rayson tan's court fees...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Schwing,<br><br>I agree with what you said. Andrea twisted her words by saying that she and Rayson are just colleagues and not friends. It's very hurting for Rayson as he treat Andrea as a very close friend.<br><br>I can say that Andrea brought all this problems upon herself. If she has not been vain, all these trouble will not surface. After this incident, she don't have the face the TCS colleagues of hers.<br><br>It's human nature to twist your words when come to this situation. All humans want to protect themselves and they never think of anyone. That's selfish!</div>
