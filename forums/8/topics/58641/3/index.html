            <div class='col-md body'>Some people actually mentioned before this Slim 10 saga happened, Pierre Png and Andrea actually still not up till the stage that want to marry, but because of all this publicity and media coverage they got from the case, they are 'pressurised' to marry.<br><br>Honestly, no offence to Andrea's supporters, I feel Pierre loves Andrea so much (blinded or real, is another matter), but Andrea does not seem to show any reciprocation of his love. Note that throughout this ordeal, Andrea did not say or do much for him in return. It's more of a one-sided thing.<br><br>Also, her wedding seemingly going to be a very grand affair. $$$ again. Branded Vera Wang gown costing around $10K, and that is only the gown. Wedding got much more to that, then just this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think people overlook the fact that with the liver problems she has, Andrea's life will never be the same again.<br><br>She may have gotten close to a million,but really,only $250 k was awarded for general pain and suffering.The rest were for medical bills,operation costs,and loss in income.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And to add, I personally don't think its her fault to turn to slimming pills.Afterall,who would have expected that the pills on the shelves contained harmful chemicals?<br><br>Surely,the company that brought in the pills has to be at fault for that?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what justdoit had posted  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>My last post on Ah ma's thread<br><br>Ok even if she wins the case.<br><br>She may not get the amount of claims she had expected.<br>And on top of that...the judge have the right to rule to make her pay for all the costs of law and court expenditures.<br><br>So in this case...in the eyes of the Law....she won.<br>But in other sense. She didn't<br><br>i call this LPPL.<br>_________________________________<br><br>I think the judge made a right decision on this case.<br><br>Onto passing the verdict on Andrea De Cruz who will win the case.<br><br>some points to ponder :<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> If Andrea De Cruz was asking for 1.4 million compensation.<br>She won $900.000, would she have gotten more if truly it's not her fault?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If Andrea De Cruz is right all along and that healthbiz has been doing dirty business. The money she would have gotten might have shot up to 2 million or more. Seriously, cases which are obviously one sided will end up a win lose situation.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <strong>But this case is a Win-win, lose-lose Situation.</strong><br><br>She won the case, all because she claims to be victim of Slim10. Which of course thru much media attention. It does affect the rule of verdict.<br>But did she win victoriously? I guess she won, but to lose a few friends and reputation.<br>She brought justice on her case. But the judge didn't actually allow the other party to lose much either.<br><br>So the credit should go to Judge!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
