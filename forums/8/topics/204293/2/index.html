            <div class='col-md body'>If ppl have been taking note of the news like 2 month ago the reason for creative failure had been highlighted. The reason for failure is marketing which many others have mention but many ppl forgot that Creative was the first company to produce the hardick player instead of flash. Sim chose the path of focusing on durability instead of marketing of product. As a result Zen is unable to differentiate itself from other players. Just ask anyone who heard of creative dicsman like hardisk player before? I think many ppl still remember the ipod funky dancing ad. This show apple mkting power. Apple learnt her lesson well.

Creative final trump card against Apple. Creative forgot one thing though, Apple has a group of commercial lawyer to defend her. Throughout Apple recent history, her defenders have never really let her down.<br><br>ps: i will not reccomand buying creative stock now. I believe that her earnings will drop in the next financial quarter due to the lawsuit and the removal of tax rebates.</div>

Read a newspaper article just now, about the UK's airport red alert against the planned terrorism which was being discovered. The reporter wrote "Devices like laptop, cameras, cellphones, iPod etc are banned from the plane, together with all other types of handheld bags." See, instead of writing mp3 players, its iPod. This article reminded me of many similiar ones i had seen</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wait a minute, wait a minute. Im not familiar with all these stuff. You guys mean to say the chairman, Mr. Sim Wong Hoo, actually signed, like, autographed on the MP3 players? Really? So the MP3 player bears his signature? WTF man. He thinks he is cool????

He giving out useless graffitis while iPod's offering U2 special and personal lazer image. My friend paid $15 to get his own name and signature engraved onto his Nano. Looks cool</div>

With this kind of situation, you tell bank to loan you money, bank probably thinking if Creative don't win it, they are going to get a hell time getting back their money.<br><br>Not that I'm defending Creative, one has to look from a logical side and why they are doing certain things certain way.</div>
