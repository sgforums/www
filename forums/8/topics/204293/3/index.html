            <div class='col-md body'>well, first of all, i've to say that i'm a creative supporter. i have to agree that there's some marketing problems with creative that resulted in its today state. from a consumer view, when choosing a product between 2 rivals, i'll consider namely the brand, features, design and price, of course other little factors.<br><br>what many dun realise is creative mp3 players are much better in quality compared to ipod players. in terms of sound quality, creative wins hands down. and for ur info, iriver is the best with the sound quality. many complained about the reliability of creative players but apple has its own shares of problems too. ipod nano is scratched easily, one down and chances are ur nano is heading to hell. therefore, the problem lies with the users, not the players. i own 2 creative players, 1 cd player and 1 zen neeon. cd player was bought 3 yrs ago and still working. 2nd hand neeon hardly any problems except hdd sometimes hang.<br><br>i think creative will not win the battle until the consumers acquire the knowledge of mp3 players. many have the thinking that ipod is the better player and creative sucks. why? oh, that's what's everyone says. i bet the image of ipod is "cool and trendy" came about when almost everyone is holding one and advocating apple. what the majority agrees on = cool and trendy. ipod's design isnt that great imo. and creative design also comparable to apple's what. why the negative comments of creative?<br><br>so i appeal to all pls give creative a chance. dont dismiss it just because it's creative and apple's rival. and stop thinking that apple's mp3 is always the best. do some research before coming into the conclusion. thx</div>
