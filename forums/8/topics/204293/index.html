When I first read the article about Creative sueing iPod, its like : Why? I though Creative was very confident about winning iPod's market? A bit like a sore loser now.<br><br>Btw, the article I saw is a short one. Is the case about Creative claiming that iPod is using their firmware design?</div>

Financial markets in Singapore were closed Wednesday for a public holiday. - AFP/ir [/b]</blockquote>I don't support Creative especially after they are suing Apple for their iPod.  On the other hand, Apple signed deal with various car manufacturer to add iPod to their cars audio system, leaving Creative in the dust.  Way to go Apple!</div>
