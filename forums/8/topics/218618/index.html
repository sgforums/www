            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about the FTs in our local soccer leagues.<br><br>But generally, these FTs would work here for some time before going back to their countries to spend the big money they earned here in their homeland. The PRCs, Malaysians, and the Taiwanese are very good examples.<br><br>The sad truth is, Singaporeans are generally fussy in choosing their jobs. This one cannot, that one also cannot. But having a job is better than no job.<br><br>However, another problem lies with the society also. The cost of living here is high and no job = no pay. No pay = no life; no future. And the competition is super competitive. Additionally, some ugly ungracious Singaporeans would appear every now and then making our lives harder.<br><br>Sometimes I think the government has their faults. But don't forget, some Singaporeans are at fault too. It's something in their mentality, which I can't figure out what it is.<br><br>Then again, I'm kinda fed up about the government giving scholarship opportunities to foreigners instead. Talking about protecting and loving Singapore during national day... all loads of bull crap!</div>

WHICH WE WON!!!... but these days, mention s-league...and u'll see a big 'DUH-HUH?!' look on most people's faces...<br><br>also i wun want my kids to aspire to be one of the PRC reps for sgp...they come for self glory and money.. c'mon we're not kids...anyone can recite the pledge in from of a million dollars!<br><br>worse.. i heard we have PRC-born in SAF now... gosh...are we turning to PRC army? maybe tmr we got PRC in police also, PRC already in the earth's oldest profession...PRC as teachers, PRC as masseurs, PRC as hawkers, PRC as con artists... and of course not forgetting the many PRC-related gruesome murders in recent history. GOD Bless our country...then came along JER...our most 'friendly' neighbours...whom our ministers just visited during hari... now they are telling they people to exterminate us... what good such neighbours.</div>
