Don't blemish the board with this kind of thing...making fun of people is one thing, but I think attacking someone is another...<br><br>11  Since ur new i will forgive u your trapasses...:-)<br>12  BUT!!!...I don't take kindly to any kind of attack...if u really do have a problem with me then settle it with me! take it anyway u want.<br><br>13  I can be any age and go anywhere i want to go...u are a facist!u know what that means right?:-)<br><br>14  How I look? Don't really care what u think...and it seems that u seem to think that I posted my picture up because Loletta posted hers.....u really don't know so I won't say anything more than that...except that u should go to my website...that same picture is plastered all over it...Where's urs????  hmm???  I posted my picture at SG boys to support Chief and the rest of the Administration...they do have to start somewhere.:-)<br><br>15  If we EVER got into a conversation I VERY seriously doubt that u can handle yourself against me...:-)<br><br>16  my nick is definately cooler than "KAISER"...do u see the connection between kaiser and Facist...?  do u know what it means yet?<br><br>17  if u think I'm idiotic looking(and I may think I do also), then let us forumites see ur picture...<br><br>18  obviously u must be trying for Loletta's panties...or else why so jealous...Just to calm ur jealously a bit...I'm there to support here effort against people who are blasting the hell out of her...Just because a lot of people are coming to her defence doesn't mean I can't...or maybe everyone should just wait for everyone else before taking action...If u read...u will see that i am one of the first people to support her...altho my messages are a bit juvenile...i think that people know I'm just joking.<br><br>19  Not every girl I support or think is pretty or cute is a target for fornication.<br><br>20  I won't be waiting for ur apology...u said what u said and after I write this, i will forget u said it...read my posts...all of them!!!  and then tell me whether u still think I'm an idiot...<br><br>---------------------------------------<br><br>Anyways, I hope that u won't go and say things to others before knowing them and what they are about...u would be missing on a lot of good things ya know...<br><br>So have a good time surfing here, and I hope that when next we post, we can be on better terms...:-):-):-)<br><br>Cheers...:-) surf and be friendly to others:-)</div>

It's really great to see people speaking up for themselves or for others. To all others who wish to/do the same: Don't ever let shallow idiots, who must be plagued by their own inferiority/jealousy/insecurity, discourage u from voicing urselves. Just do urselves justice, let it out of ur systems and to hell with what the assholes think.

            <div class='col-md body'>If Kaiser u are reading this,<br>A week ago, I am just a newcomer like u.As new as I am, I know what it is to be in a forum.Yes!A place to speak your views and opinions and share the plight of ppl who feel in justice.As far as ur first posting is concerned, it never occur to me that u want to feel welcomed in this family.Maybe making enemies and receving hatemails are one of your fortes and favourite past-time.But, just want to let u know that fire is not what u think though I dunno him personally, but from all his postings so far in my thread, he has proven not to be so shallow as u claimed to be. Though, he is sometimes vulgar and uncouth to u, but he did apologise for his rashness and try to make peace. To his comments of Loletta, he is just trying to support and he is not that immature or desperate if u think he is. To me, he just like to put on some fun and laughter to ppl in this forum with no offence to anyone whatsoever. I am just trying to be objective cos u are new here.<br><br>Maybe fire's way of expressing himself may not appeal to u.And I think everyone in this forum can share what they think but at the same time be considerate and always put yourself into other ppl's predicament.If someone were to do the same thing as u did to fire, how would u feel?<br><br>Just a note, if you still want your name to appear in this forum, try to be objective and not cynical.<br><br>And fire, he is not worth for u to spend so much attention to!Score well for your project and show it to him.And thanks for wishing me goos luck for my test! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa: to get some inkling on just how shallow firewire is, I suggest u take a look at the thread "A little tongue in cheek". "he has proven not to be so shallow"..haha wow this is such a joke! and oooh u don't know him personally but u say he is not what i think he is. so what is this? farting thru ur mouth? it's like giving directions to the driver when u don't know the directions urself.<br><br>(in response to firewire's long msg)<br>firewire: hey u actually have some respect for yourself?? wow that sure is new! and "give me some friendly advice" haha!! i see u haven't realise that no one needs advice from a lamer like yourself.<br><br>Oh u can talk anyway u decide to eh? well since when did i say u can't? duh!<br><br>yes u are allowed to be an idiot...did i say u aren't? duh!<br><br>oh u are still a student eh? haha MBA or MSc? or err....how about some pathetic academic program for academic low-achievers like yourself?<br><br>did someone say he's gonna take my money when he has a career etc etc? oh dear, this is coming from a 25 yr old!! bet u guys thought it was some 3 year old eh? heehee oh and did he say "friendly" advice before this? wow...his breath stinks like fart. don't ur words mean anything at all firewire? guess they're as worthless as ur pathetic self.<br><br>wow didn't know being into technology and design means one has to hang around in SGgirls all the time.<br><br>hehe i don't seem very smart cuz i blast someone who's been around here longer? oh dear....question is "WHAT can u do to me?" I am so scared...i have offended the great ol'firewire...heehee<br><br>u see the sad thing about u firewire is that u are such a loser. Whoever said i was attacking u personally? Oh dear...STILL can't accept someone is attacking ur ideas and putting them down eh? Everyone MUST subscribe to your dumb views or else they MUST be going personal. interesting....<br><br>erm "trapasses"? wow that's a new word that exists only in ur pathetic vocab firewire. think perhaps u might wanna take up some english classes.<br><br>Oh so u do not take kindly to ANY kinds of attack eh? Well guess u've said it! Can't take attacks on your ideas etc. yeah....losers are like this i know...no need to tell me.<br><br>wow doubt i can handle myself against u in a conversation eh? haha yeah i guess i can't hold a candle to u...someone who still can't get his tenses and grammer right at this age...haha truly unbeatable! your parents must be real proud of their son speaking at the english level of a primary 4 kid.<br><br>oohh looks like someone just learnt the meaning of "facist" eh? *clap clap* but hey psst, i knew the meaning of that eons ago.<br><br>"17 if u think I'm idiotic looking(and I may think I do also), then let us forumites see ur picture..." hhmm think i have explained this before, that putting up ur own photo gives others the prerogative to comment as they wish without necessarily having to put up their own pic. But i guess that was just a little too much for your lame brains to digest eh?<br><br>and jealous?? haha of what? some lamer trying hard to impress? oh gimme a break! u might as well say einstein will be jealous of u if he was still around cuz u are so smart....heehee<br><br>and yeah i have read more of ur postings and I think u are an idiot more than ever. but i can't finish reading all of ur postings cuz u really do not have much of a life...posted too many of your low-iq views on too many topics.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To take a quote from Kaiser :"and oooh u don't know him personally but u say he is not what i think he is. so what is this? farting thru ur mouth? it's like giving directions to the driver when u don't know the directions urself."<br><br>Well Kaiser, I assume you don't know firewire personally either. So how can you claim that he is shallow? So are you farting thru your mouth too?<br><br>to quote again : "Next, what you post on the forum is for all to read and to comment on and debate over. Can't take criticisms? Take a hike then."<br><br>Now I agree with you on this, but are you practising what you are preaching? To comment and debate over? Over the post or over the person posting? If you are criticising or debating the view or comments made by the postee, its fine.<br><br>But to make personal attacks and criticisms on a person over the posts he/she made... is that what the forum is for? To make personal attacks or criticisms on a person's character or integrity based on the views or comments made on a forum are uncalled for.<br><br>So were all those bad comments on firewire and farting thru ur mouth comment to Rinoa called for?<br><br>They have been friendly to you so far so I guess the basic courtesy would be to show some respect back to them. And Oh, why didn't you put up your e-mail address? So you can just pat your backside and leave should things get "too hot" for you?<br><br>Till then, happy reading and posting<br><br>Cheers<br><br>------------------<br>Why? Why me?<br><br></div>

Not surprising...<br><br>AS for my life...I think that I have more of a life than you do Kaiser.  plain fact there...I don't even need to know you to know that.  You must be one anti-social guy. I seriously doubt you would ever say this to people in real life...if you do, then your a dork already...I'm sure you're pretty lonely, hence the need for attention...this reminds me of how spoiled brats get attention...break things, scream and shout, attack other people...<br><br>and will you look at that...I mention the word 'facist' to him and he thinks that he taught me the word...like, duhh? who's dumb here?...<br><br>Well now, at least some people here are clever enough to come up with words of our own...so ...uh...what dictionary did you use when you decided to write that post against me...?  It must have been really difficult to write and search for the words all the time......Oh, it must have been extremely time consuming trying to find most of the words from your dictionary right?....no wonder you've only posted a few messages...we wouldn't want to have grammar mistakes here right?...just in case we decide to blast other people for grammar right?...then they cannot blast back right?....<br><br>I wonder how many vibrators are shoved up your ass at this moment...However many there are, they must be causing quite a stir because your shit seems diluted like hell...no wonder it comes out so easily from you. I hope you change your undies often because you're really beginning to stink...<br><br>I guess guys who can joke about sex and things related must be shallow...well that's me then.  guilty as charged. and i've got a thousand more things related to sex that would hurt your delicate eyes and ears...but I'll wait until you don't need diapers anymore before I tell you such things...<br><br>Whatever qualifications you may have kaiser, it's obvious you aren't doing anything constructive with it (talk about posting low IQ views)....sorry that you think I don't have a career but chances are (if you're in Singapore or Indonesia), you've already seen my work or been inside one of them...that's if you get out often, which I seriously doubt.  and uhh...I graduated...so what! Even if i showed you my work, you would just look at it with a blank look on your face..."blur lah...huh huh..:-p"<br><br>just because I'm here often doesn't mean that I don't have time for other things.  The fact that you think so must mean that you can't handle such time constraints well...*tsk* grow up boy.<br><br>Kaiser, i'm disappointed...how in heaven's name did you manage an internet connection?...accidentally pressed the "on" button on your modem while you opened your browser issit? (YOU MUST BE DAMNED CHARMED  to have two accidents that somehow ended up with you logging on...)  From what you say, it seems that you think that SGGirls is the only place I surf to...never heard of windows and multitasking issit? *tsk*  *tsk*...and I thought we were dealing with intelligent life here. so sad...<br><br>"facist"...ha ha ha:-)  I bet you were struggling with that dictionary next to you when you saw the word huh? ha ha ha:-) I can pratically see you sitting there frantically sifting through the pages trying to get to the word and sweating from your brow while you were thinking, " He's not going to get the upper hand on me! I have a dictionary!)...Just a late hint...you should have gone to the "F" section in the dictionary...You would have found it a lot faster...Small consolation, but hey, don't say I didn't help you out ok...<br><br>personally, I truely believe you idolise me...noone's had so much interest in me in this forum except you...:-)</div>

MY WORK!, is being researched and documented by DR.Kay mohlmann from NUS Sociology department...(you can call her and check it out!)<br><br>She is documenting MY Home/House project( a real house which we built with OUR OWN HANDS) which is a project that attempts to define the theoretical idea of what a home and a house is...What are the differences and the similarities?  and how do the ideas of a house translate into the ideas of a home...How does a person interact with his space...How does he/she interact with a house and how does he/she interact with a home...?<br><br>the project begs people to ask questions about our domesticity and the elements that make up the very fabric of our personal space in Singapore.  What is a kitchen?  What is a bathroom?  What is a living room?  What is an entrance?  What is a bedroom?  What is a reading space?  What is a look-out space?<br><br>you might think you have the answer, but you don't....It's never just a place for you to do activities there...There are always a miriad  of meanings imbue upon such spaces that goes beyond the functional and into the realm of the pshyche...a tangible space transformed by human emotions and the sedimentation of time into an intangible place of meanings that offers insight into the immaterial aspects of the home.<br><br>That was a really short version for you...didn't understand it?  That was the easiest way of saying it...read harder!!!<br><br>I have a book that was produced and should be selling at Basheers Bookstore right now...you want to read it, give me an email, you can read it for free...but then again...oh no...you have no idea what the hell's going on right? I seemed to have lost you already...<br><br>so who's not doing things with their lives huh? And you are such an idiot to imply that people above a certain age shouldn't go to school anymore...no wonder you seem so uneducated...I know you're trying very hard not to sound as such, so I have to admire you for standing up for yourself...or at least trying...although noone was even knocking you down in the first place...<br><br>and what is with this idea that people still studying haven't done anything with their lives...?<br><br>What have you ever accompished?...managed to splash toilet water on your ass with the copious amounts of dump you manage to spew from your mouth huh?...Boy, that's a real feat in life...maybe you should join a circus...I don't think the average Joe can do such a thing...<br><br>*tsk* you talk so much yet you comprehend even less than your words are trying to imply...<br><br>***am i showing off with this post here...YOU BET I AM!!!NOONE AND I MEAN NOONE HAS DONE WHAT I HAVE...so....you can blast me anyway you want, but I stand supreme because i've got facts to back me up...unlike some people whose  arguments are based purely on circumstancial POV...and no willingness to back up their words with action...<br><br>What have you done with your life bub?  If the highlight of your life is coming here to flame me...then boy, what a life you lead.  I'm literally shaking with excitement for you...<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 30-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey yeah i didn't understand what u were saying there. "miriad"??? "pshyche"??? or how about "sedimentation of time"??? wow u sure enjoy making up new words and phrases that make as much sense as greek is to u eh? haha ooh not to forget "great command of english"!!! HAHAHAHAHA<br><br>so is that all there is to your life? wow what a feat! u can even squeeze it all into one pathetic article or should i spell it the way u do, "artical" like this? heh heh and gosh dirts like u actually wanna start examining the ideas of a home etc? someone who was brought up to be a desperate loser like urself?<br><br>and who was that from nus?? oh dear...hey i am doing research under Dr Bob Goldshmidt, visiting Honorary Fellow from Princeton this semester...erm so what did u say that pathetic unknown lecturer from NUS was? gosh firewire, i didn't know u were THIS stupid to actually wanna start comparing yourself with me. losers like u should have known better by now than to pit themselves against me. talk about making a fool of urself. but i guess low iq creatures like u never learn....still keep coming back for more. and what have i accomplished? or should i spell it the way u do like "accompished"? ....fancy a person ur age bragging to someone younger than urself. shame on u. gosh that is so lame...why don't u go brag to some 3 yr old kid about ur "impressive" achievements at 25 yrs old. i am sure he will be in AWE of u...heehee. u wanna talk about accomplishments? well for starters how about straight distinctions for PSLE, O and A lvls? and i didn't even have to work hard for that....sorry man i know life ain't fair especially when morons like u try so hard. or how about scholarship? damn that happens only in ur dreams. so erm mr 25 yr old loser....still feeling proud about having some unknown lecturer interested in ur lame work? gosh this kinda stuff.......and u actually wanna bring it out here to talk about it....HAHA. well i understand lah. to some people, even being able to just bathe themselves give them an immense sense of pride.<br><br>and owing to ur being educationally subnormal, u thought i meant people above a certain age shouldn't attend school. Oh dear...what i meant was at ur age i'd be doing my MBA already instead of whatever pathetic course u are doing now and spending all your time here trying hard to get into someone's pants or dishing out "advice".<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey kaiser, why do you have so much anger towards firewire?  everyone who reads your personal endeavor in tarnishing his name are wondering why you are such a bitter person?<br>firewire apologized to you...you claim to be an intelligent and civilized person, but judging from what you have posted so far, surely you jest.  this forum was designed for people to express their mind, not as a medium to vent anger and to please childish forumites who are more interested in engaging in a non-productive, and not to mention attacking, discussions.<br>and before you go off criticizing other people's inability in expressing themselves concisely and in the correct syntax, you should read your own postings, they're littered with mistakes...what's that i hear?, where is the evidence to substantiate my claim?  here's one from your earlier posting on this thread "...someone who still can't get his tenses and grammer right at this age..."  i do hope you have enough guts in not editing that mistake, so that everyone can see that even the great Kaiser can make a mistake in his spelling, too!!<br>if you are as civilized as you claim to be, then you could have at least show some decency and some common courtesy towards not only fire, but also others.<br>but i suppose i'm way over the line, i mean, i'm asking for far too much from a person who can't even spell "G-R-A-M-M-A-R" the right way...<br>to make things short for you, grow up!  wake up to yourself, see who's the real idiot here...i'm not meddling in your squabble, but i'm merely expressing what other forumites want to say, and that is for you to stop this non-sense.<br>knowing your penchant for blowing things into a cinematic proportion, i will probably receive some form of repercussion from this, but go ahead, do your worst.<br><br>ps.  and do forgive me for any grammatical or spelling mistakes here...<br><br>------------------<br>Underneath the Southern Cross I stand...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok Kaiser yr attitude is damn arrogant in this whole matter, i wouldnt really wnna write anything abt this normally, but i just CANT STAND for the manner in which you just blast others for their lack of ACADEMIC qualifications...<br><br>academic qualifications are just that...academic in value to the correct person, ie yr boss or superiors next time...<br><br>Its true that some pple can "study" more effectively than others...but different pple excel at different areas...y're good at studies in the singaporean studies...but are you good at EVRYTHING in yr life??<br><br>didnt think so, my boy...<br><br>So just becos u got a higher education u have the right to JUDGE and INSULT others?? c'mon...u may be intelligent but u sure aint CULTURED nor even able to pass off for a semblance of CIVILITY...<br><br>maybe u have done some soul-searching before and have come to such conclusions as yr POV and way of talking back to others suggest...but if so i really feel sorry for you cos for all yr "HIGH" IQ and Education OBVIOUSLY havnt done much in ways of yr personality nor moral upbringing...<br><br>So what if you're doing research with this Dr Bob fella? you didnt even say what type of research...maybe its just the science type? hmm...at least firewire's work is abt life and PHILOSOPHICAL in nature...some day u may wake up and realise that hard core science education isnt as impt as u think...and humanities have a much greater impact on the inner souls of us all...(btw i'm from science stream all my life so far)<br><br>Scholarship? SO WHAT...straight distinctions for PSLE, Os and As SO WHAT...lemme tell you that i'm past my PSLE, Os and As, and at all lvls, i got 80% of my subjs distinctions and btw, according to the s'pore educational system which u seem to like to brag that u're great in...i'm eligible to be counted as top 1% of my year, so i dont really lose much out to you in educational standards...IQ wise i really dont think so...just that i chose a different life and my testimonial sux big time, and i cant get a scholarship like you, goody-2-shoes...<br><br>I respect firewire's views, while i do not agree with 'em all the time i do read and think abt it before commenting in an over-the-top arrogant tone...<br><br>P.S. if you still wnna compare abt education with me, list yr schs that you went to...i can 100% confidently say that for primary and secondary schs u can ONLY EQUAL my schs in prestige IF you came from 'em...as for JC i used to be in a top 5 JC...<br><br>P.S.2. firewire, i'm interested in yr book and articles as well...anyway of sending 'em to me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you to JcBoy and Pluckaduck for being the voice of reason in this heated exchange.<br><br>JCBOY, I agree with you about the educational levels and pertinent knowledge thingee...I know someone really close who scored in the top 99 percentile in the whole of the United States for the Aptitude tests(Comparing to University Seniors taking the same tests)...his IQ is really above average and he used to berate me until i couldn't tahun anymore...but basically that was all he was good for...he aced everything  and still managed to find time to just sit around and look down on his fellow friends...of course we didn't mind that much, but the thing was that when he hit university he couldn't stand the stress and had to drop out and attend a community college which is usually reserved for people who couldn't make it to full uni because of academic qualifications...Still, even with all that IQ and Knowledge, he didn't know what to do with it...in fact he couldn't do much...with all his Iq and academic achievements, he could barely compare to another one of my friends who almost failed everything...but that same  failure friend  was just voted by MTV as the hottest new underground band in California...<br><br>That's why i stated somewhere that I knew an idiot who had a masters from MIT somewhere in another post(the HATRED post I think)...Academic qualification and high IQ doesn't mean squat...it's what you decide to do with that knowledge you do have that's important....We can look at Michael Dell as an example...he dropped out of uni and became a billionaire almost overnight...a lot of famous artists and musicians can't put 2 + 2 together properly, but they contribute a lot to our society...I love science...I do know a bit about it, especially astrology and theoretical physics....but it's just something I discover myself as a hobby...Science is important, but to discount other fields basically makes science itself pretty much useless anyway...In the end, it must be applied and who applies it but the normal guy...not the genius...<br><br>And Kaiser is true to a certain extent that I am an academic underachiever...every class or course I attend I will barely pass with the marks I get...but that doesn't mean I'm not good...In fact, i find studying boring, and the whole process of learning and doing for results a bit insulting...so I don't put much effort into it...but when I work and when I paint for other people, It's fantastic. I put my heart and soul into it...maybe i can't get good marks, but I definately make up for it in other areas...areas that science and pure logic can't touch.  so it's an even divide...Hey, who has everything?  not me man...but get me talking about subjects that are interesting to me and you will see me utilise what little knowledge I do have to great effects...What's the point of knowing everything when you can't use it for anything....pretty pointless.<br><br>What I do, I do for the improvement of the human condition...I study and work in a field that tries to adress these social issues directly because they have a very real and immediate impact on peoples' lives from my interior/architecture... and a very immaterial but qualitative effect on people's spirits/souls/lives from my artworks. ...Even my Graphic Designing is about social issues...It's about the psychology of modern, and not so modern trends, and an effort to influence those trends for a purpose that affects lifestyles and social habits....<br><br>If what i apsire to is seen as useless to the eyes of the "academically superior" of this forum, then I need not say more on that except that science alone doesn't address these "problems"<br><br>...My goal is to become a part of this society...to contribute to it...make it grow...improve it's condition...improve the quality of life...and I cannot do that from a field that distances itself from the general populace...and I don't need academic qualifications to know or do this...the qualification is there only because Singapore society requires it...as we know that Singapore prides itself on paper qualifications above all else...sad but true...<br><br>and I have never heard of Dr. Bob Goldfingers either...so where does that leave us...nowhere...Kaiser, if you are so superior in intelligence, then why can't you just accept a peace agreement and quit blasting people while you're at it...even your attacks don't say anything substantial...you just keep repeating the same old tired lines over and over again...let's look at it this way, even with my "low IQ" and "low, substandard academic qualification" I can still manage to come up with more creative insults than you can...without resorting to profanity..<br><br>so why don't you show us that you have the graciousness that should come with the responsibility of being in a position more advanced than ours......Quit this futile argument and we can share a beer and you can tell me all about what it is you do in the your field...science right?<br><br></div>

Basically...that means you really HAVEN'T done anything with your life at all yet...Wah liaow!!!

I feel so ashamed for you...aspiring just to get a piece of paper and not knowing what it all means...<br><br>And as I had already surmised, you didn't understand a word of what I was saying in my posts...all those words and sentences that you couldn't understand because the structure was too advanced and creatively constructed...well, like I said...you're just one big poseur...and in the end...a peon....some highly advanced intellectual just waiting for everything and everyone to show or tell him what to do and how to do it.<br><br>pathetic really...<br><br>BURN BABY!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kaiser, i read with interest abt wat u had posted. Yes, u might be able to score straight As and distinction for all ye studies, however i can see that u score a big fat F for your inter-personal relationship. I bet u dun have much friends. And even if u have, i assume they are superficial one. Those who might run and leave u alone when u get into problems (which i think u sill say u ill never get into). I seriously think u need to see a shrink abt your condition cos u seem to look down on everyone. So when one day u finally meet ye match (which u will think u will never meet), u won't be able to handle the defeat. This is how some berseker came about. Hope u take my advice seriously.<br><br>BTW, the reasons y we wan to knoe ye email is not to mail bomb u but to take this arguement between ourselves so as we will not disturb other forum users will our boring arguement.<br><br>Jerrick<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thank you to everyone who has supported me and for those who are acting as the voice of reason here...<br><br>i just wanted to post one final thing in this thread...<br><br>i find that i don't want to keep blasting anyone out of the water...although I can keep it up indefinately, it's really making me feel physically sick...I don't enjoy bragging about myself just to make the other guy feel inferior( I feel sick just reading my own posts in this thread)...It's quite obvious that he feels it already and I think that I may have gone overboard with my insult...<br><br>negativity is really bad for the soul man...so kaiser if you have anything more to say to me just say it...if you want me to say I concede, then i concede...as long as we can just stop this...<br><br>Peace to everyone and thank you for your support...oh god, I sound like a religious zealot trying to run for office...:-)</div>
