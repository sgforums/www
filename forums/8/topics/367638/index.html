              <p>Within certain limits of course. If you bring a baby into a disease-ridden, war-torn third-world country, it's going to be very tough for him/her to live, let alone do good, obviously. Or for an even simpler example, compare the poor and the rich in Singapore. That's not to say that it's impossible though.</p>
              <p>I agree with the rest of the answers so far. 'Good' and 'bad' are entirely subjective terms.</p>
              <p>To answer the last question, no, since I don't believe in a nature of mankind (apart from procreating like every other animal). It would be kind of like resigning to fate, which I don't agree with. It's up to each individual to live their life and I just happen to prefer creating my own path instead of taking the already-paved road. If I do something well, I can take satisfaction in the fact that it was by my own sweat, blood and tears. If I screw up, then I'll take responsibility for it.</p>

              <p>At certain seasons of the year great turtles come in<br>from the sea to deposit their eggs on tropical beaches.<br>They return to the sea immediately, leaving their eggs to<br>hatch in due time from the heat of the sun. Eventually the<br>little turtles emerge from their shells, push up through the<br>warm sand, and head for the sea. There, guided by a sure<br>instinct and without any need for instruction or learning,<br>they take care of themselves, seeking food where it may be<br>found and avoiding the dangers which are everywhere.<br>Enough survive to maturity to maintain this species of turtle<br>in existence.</p>
              <p><br>The ability of this species of turtle to survive depends<br>upon two factors: (1) so many eggs are hatched each year<br>that, even with heavy losses of the young, a sufficient number<br>reach maturity; (2) these turtles are able to grow up<br>without learning or instruction because their nervous systems<br>are connected up and functioning as soon as they<br>emerge from their shells. The newly hatched turtle is not<br>so much an immature turtle as a small turtle. With the<br>exception of his reproductive instincts, a newly hatched<br>turtle is as fully equipped with a functioning muscular and<br>nervous system as is an adult turtle.</p>
              <p>Living things that can care for themselves in this way and<br>for this reason are not unfamiliar. Insects do so and so too<br>do such animals as chicks and ducklings. But man is constructed<br>on an entirely different plan. When a baby is born,<br>it is quite incapable of taking care of itself, and remains<br>relatively helpless for years. Indeed, it would seem that<br>twenty or more years are necessary before a human being<br>reaches maturity.</p>
              <p>The helpless condition of the newborn human arises<br>from the fact that his neurological and muscular systems are<br>largely undeveloped and uncoordinated. His nervous system<br>in particular is like the telephone system of a great city in<br>which almost none of the connections from phone to phone<br>or from phone to switchboard are closed. Of course, this<br>comparison is by no means perfect, for the human nervous<br>system is much more complicated, much more adaptable,<br>and much faster than any telephone system. The human<br>brain alone, as a kind of central switchboard, has millions<br>of neural connections. Other millions are distributed<br>throughout the body.</p>
              <p>The way in which these are connected<br>up, or even the fact that they come to be connected up at<br>all, depends on what happens to the child, how he is trained,<br>and how he grows. The things he is capable of becoming<br>originally we can speak of as his potentialities; the things<br>he does become, as the result of experience and training, we<br>can speak of as actualities. The sum of his potentialities<br>we call human nature, while the sum total of his actualities<br>we call human personality. It is quite clear that human nature<br>(potential qualities) is very much wider than human<br>personality (actually developed qualities). Indeed, we might<br>assume that everyone, at birth (or even at conception) has<br>the potentiality for being aggressive or submissive, selfish or</p>
              <p>generous, cowardly or brave, masculine or feminine, pugnacious<br>or peaceful, violent or gentle, and so forth, and that<br>which of these potential qualities becomes actual (or to<br>what degree it does so) depends, very largely, on the way<br>in which each person is trained or on the experiences he<br>encounters as he grows up.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> The fact that there are societies<br>or tribes in which almost everyone is aggressive (like the<br>Apaches) and that there are other closely related tribes in<br>which almost everyone is submissive (like the Zufii), and<br>the fact that infants, taken from one such tribe and reared<br>in the other, grow up to have in full measure the typical<br>characteristics of their adopted tribe would seem to indicate<br>both that all such people are potentially about the same at<br>conception and that their personalities are largely a consequence<br>of the way in which they are reared. If this is so, it is<br>clear that the way in which people are brought up is very<br>important. </strong></span></span>This is, of course, evident from the consideration<br>already mentioned; namely, that humans are helpless at<br>birth and must be cared for and trained during a period of<br>many years. The way in which they are cared for and trained<br>depends very largely on the personalities of the people<br>whom they encounter as they are growing up, but these<br>personalities again depend on the way in which these adults<br>were reared. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thus there appear in any society certain patterns<br>of action, of belief, and of thought that are passed on<br>from generation to generation, always slightly different both<br>from generation to generation and from person to person in<br>any single generation, but possessing a recognizable pattern.</strong></span></span><br>This pattern depends not only on the way people are<br>trained to act, to feel, and to think but also on the more concrete<br>manifestations of their social environment, such as<br>the kind of clothes they wear, the kind of shelters in which</p>
              <p>they live, the kind of tools they have for making a living, the<br>kind of food they eat and how they eat it, the kind of toys<br>they have to amuse themselves, as well as the kind of<br>weapons they have to defend themselves. All of these things,<br>patterns of action, feeling, and thought, as well as concrete<br>objects used in these activities, are known in the social<br>sciences as culture. This culture forms the environment in<br>which a child grows up as the natural environment surrounds<br>the baby turtle as it grows up in the sea. Man is<br>surrounded by natural environment, to be sure; but it is<br>much more remote from him than from the turtle, for, in<br>man's case, culture intervenes as a kind of insulation between<br>him and his natural environment. In fact, the surrounding<br>environment of culture penetrates both into him<br>as a person and into his natural environment, changing<br>both. His neurological reactions in behavior, in feeling, and<br>in thought are largely determined by his cultural environment,<br>and at the same time this cultural environment modifies<br>his natural environment by such activities as heating his<br>home, cooking his food, cutting down forests, draining<br>swamps, killing off animals, and generally modifying the<br>face of the earth.<br>We have said that the individual's reactions in behavior,<br>in feeling, and in thought (what we call his personality) are<br>largely determined by his cultural environment. At the same<br>time, his personality is part of the cultural environment of<br>those people whom he meets. And, as already said, only by<br>such relationships is his personality developed from his human<br>nature. All this makes a human being so different from<br>a turtle that nothing very relevant to human behavior can<br>be learned from the study of turtle behavior. With the turtle<br>we are dealing with a twofold situation: the turtle and his</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>environment. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With the human being we are dealing with a<br>threefold situation: the human being surrounded by his<br>culture and both together surrounded by the natural environment—<br>and by other cultures.</strong></span></span> Where a turtle lays<br>dozens of eggs and hopes that some turtles from those eggs<br>can be carried to maturity by obedience to fairly rigid instincts,<br>the human has almost no rigid instincts, and adapts<br>his personality to his culture. The culture in turn must adapt<br>itself to the natural environment. Thus, if the natural environment<br>changes, the turtle must change his nature, while<br>man merely changes his culture (and thus his personality).<br>But this beautifully flexible relationship requires such a<br>long period of training and learning during which human<br>nature becomes a human personality and the individual becomes<br>able to care for himself, that humans are dependent<br>upon their parents for many years. Accordingly, humans<br>have few offspring, and each offspring is very valuable, since<br>the survival of the species does not depend (as with turtles)<br>on the more or less accidental survival of a very few out of<br>the many reproduced, but depends instead on the ability to<br>bring up almost all who were born and to train them so<br>that they can take care of themselves, have the intelligence<br>to modify their culture (including their personalities) when<br>it becomes necessary to adapt to the environment, and at the<br>same time develop the capacity to use the freedom to change<br>their behavior (which this whole situation assumes) in such<br>a way that it will be beneficial to themselves and to the group<br>on which they depend for the continuation of their culture.<br>All this leads us to certain tentative assumptions about<br>human nature, about the nature of culture, and about the</p>
              <p>nature of human society. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In regard to human nature, it</strong></span></span></p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>At certain seasons of the year great turtles come in<br> from the sea to deposit their eggs on tropical beaches.<br> They return to the sea immediately, leaving their eggs to<br> hatch in due time from the heat of the sun. Eventually the<br> little turtles emerge from their shells, push up through the<br> warm sand, and head for the sea. There, guided by a sure<br> instinct and without any need for instruction or learning,<br> they take care of themselves, seeking food where it may be<br> found and avoiding the dangers which are everywhere.<br> Enough survive to maturity to maintain this species of turtle<br> in existence.</p>
              <p><br> The ability of this species of turtle to survive depends<br> upon two factors: (1) so many eggs are hatched each year<br> that, even with heavy losses of the young, a sufficient
              number<br> reach maturity; (2) these turtles are able to grow up<br> without learning or instruction because their nervous systems<br> are connected up and functioning as soon as they<br> emerge from their shells. The newly hatched turtle is not<br> so much an immature turtle as a small turtle. With the<br> exception of his reproductive instincts, a newly hatched<br> turtle is as fully equipped with a functioning muscular and<br> nervous system as is an adult turtle.</p>
              <p>Living things that can care for themselves in this way and<br> for this reason are not unfamiliar. Insects do so and so too<br> do such animals as chicks and ducklings. But man is
              constructed<br> on an entirely different plan. When a baby is born,<br> it is quite incapable of taking care of itself, and remains<br> relatively helpless for years. Indeed, it would seem that<br> twenty or more years are necessary before a human being<br> reaches maturity.</p>
              <p>The helpless condition of the newborn human arises<br> from the fact that his neurological and muscular systems are<br> largely undeveloped and uncoordinated. His nervous system<br> in particular is like the telephone system of a great city in<br> which almost none of the connections from phone to phone<br> or from phone to switchboard are closed. Of course, this<br> comparison is by no means perfect, for the human nervous<br> system is much more complicated, much more adaptable,<br> and much faster than any telephone system. The human<br> brain alone, as a kind of central switchboard, has millions<br> of neural connections. Other millions are distributed<br> throughout the body.</p>
              <p>The way in which these are connected<br> up, or even the fact that they come to be connected up at<br> all, depends on what happens to the child, how he is trained,<br> and how he grows. The things he is capable of becoming<br> originally we can speak of as his potentialities; the things<br> he does become, as the result of experience and training, we<br> can speak of as actualities. The sum of his potentialities<br> we call human nature, while the sum total of his actualities<br> we call human personality. It is quite clear that human
              nature<br> (potential qualities) is very much wider than human<br> personality (actually developed qualities). Indeed, we might<br> assume that everyone, at birth (or even at conception) has<br> the potentiality for being aggressive or submissive, selfish or</p>
              <p>generous, cowardly or brave, masculine or feminine,
              pugnacious<br> or peaceful, violent or gentle, and so forth, and that<br> which of these potential qualities becomes actual (or to<br> what degree it does so) depends, very largely, on the way<br> in which each person is trained or on the experiences he<br> encounters as he grows up. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The fact that there are
              societies<br> or tribes in which almost everyone is aggressive (like the<br> Apaches) and that there are other closely related tribes in<br> which almost everyone is submissive (like the Zufii), and<br> the fact that infants, taken from one such tribe and reared<br> in the other, grow up to have in full measure the typical<br> characteristics of their adopted tribe would seem to indicate<br> both that all such people are potentially about the same at<br> conception and that their personalities are largely a
              consequence<br> of the way in which they are reared. If this is so, it is<br> clear that the way in which people are brought up is very<br> important.</strong></span></span> This is, of course, evident from
              the consideration<br> already mentioned; namely, that humans are helpless at<br> birth and must be cared for and trained during a period of<br> many years. The way in which they are cared for and trained<br> depends very largely on the personalities of the people<br> whom they encounter as they are growing up, but these<br> personalities again depend on the way in which these adults<br> were reared. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thus there appear in any
              society certain patterns<br> of action, of belief, and of thought that are passed on<br> from generation to generation, always slightly different both<br> from generation to generation and from person to person in<br> any single generation, but possessing a recognizable
              pattern.</strong></span></span><br> This pattern depends not only on the way people are<br> trained to act, to feel, and to think but also on the more
              concrete<br> manifestations of their social environment, such as<br> the kind of clothes they wear, the kind of shelters in which</p>
              <p>they live, the kind of tools they have for making a living,
              the<br> kind of food they eat and how they eat it, the kind of toys<br> they have to amuse themselves, as well as the kind of<br> weapons they have to defend themselves. All of these things,<br> patterns of action, feeling, and thought, as well as concrete<br> objects used in these activities, are known in the social<br> sciences as culture. This culture forms the environment in<br> which a child grows up as the natural environment surrounds<br> the baby turtle as it grows up in the sea. Man is<br> surrounded by natural environment, to be sure; but it is<br> much more remote from him than from the turtle, for, in<br> man's case, culture intervenes as a kind of insulation
              between<br> him and his natural environment. In fact, the surrounding<br> environment of culture penetrates both into him<br> as a person and into his natural environment, changing<br> both. His neurological reactions in behavior, in feeling, and<br> in thought are largely determined by his cultural
              environment,<br> and at the same time this cultural environment modifies<br> his natural environment by such activities as heating his<br> home, cooking his food, cutting down forests, draining<br> swamps, killing off animals, and generally modifying the<br> face of the earth.<br> We have said that the individual's reactions in behavior,<br> in feeling, and in thought (what we call his personality) are<br> largely determined by his cultural environment. At the same<br> time, his personality is part of the cultural environment of<br> those people whom he meets. And, as already said, only by<br> such relationships is his personality developed from his
              human<br> nature. All this makes a human being so different from<br> a turtle that nothing very relevant to human behavior can<br> be learned from the study of turtle behavior. With the turtle<br> we are dealing with a twofold situation: the turtle and his</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>environment. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With the human being we are
              dealing with a<br> threefold situation: the human being surrounded by his<br> culture and both together surrounded by the natural
              environment—<br> and by other cultures.</strong></span></span> Where a turtle
              lays<br> dozens of eggs and hopes that some turtles from those eggs<br> can be carried to maturity by obedience to fairly rigid
              instincts,<br> the human has almost no rigid instincts, and adapts<br> his personality to his culture. The culture in turn must
              adapt<br> itself to the natural environment. Thus, if the natural
              environment<br> changes, the turtle must change his nature, while<br> man merely changes his culture (and thus his personality).<br> But this beautifully flexible relationship requires such a<br> long period of training and learning during which human<br> nature becomes a human personality and the individual becomes<br> able to care for himself, that humans are dependent<br> upon their parents for many years. Accordingly, humans<br> have few offspring, and each offspring is very valuable,
              since<br> the survival of the species does not depend (as with turtles)<br> on the more or less accidental survival of a very few out of<br> the many reproduced, but depends instead on the ability to<br> bring up almost all who were born and to train them so<br> that they can take care of themselves, have the intelligence<br> to modify their culture (including their personalities) when<br> it becomes necessary to adapt to the environment, and at the<br> same time develop the capacity to use the freedom to change<br> their behavior (which this whole situation assumes) in such<br> a way that it will be beneficial to themselves and to the
              group<br> on which they depend for the continuation of their culture.<br> All this leads us to certain tentative assumptions about<br> human nature, about the nature of culture, and about the</p>
              <p>nature of human society. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In regard to human nature,

              <p>An elaboration on this point. </p>
              <p>I see selfish as an extension of greed, both of which I classify as evil. It is necessary for this classification because 'evil' is an merely a subjective concept. I've hence defined my ideaof 'evil'. You might agree, that greed and selfishness are commonly regarded as evil traits, which lead to hate, violence and suffering.</p>

              <p><br><strong>What do you think is the true nature of man?<br></strong>true nature of all living things is to procreate and spread their genes as much as possible</p>
              <p><strong>Are we born good or evil?<br></strong>ask a taoist, they will say people are born good but are tempted to commit evil acts in life</p>
              <p>ask a buddhist, they will say good is evil and evil is good hence to be born is the same as not to be born</p>
              <p>ask a christian, they will say people are born evil (sinful) and it is through the grace of god that our evils (sins) are atoned</p>
              <p>ask a muslim, they will say all people, good or evil are suppose to believe in their 'religion of peace', if you dont believe in their religion, they will make sure you rest in peace. They think strapping a bomb to themselves and blowing themselves up in crowded places is good</p>
              <p><strong>If you believe we are born good, why?<br></strong>i believe we are born evil</p>
              <p><strong>If you believe we are born evil, why?<br></strong>cos i always have evil thoughts and i need to put in alot of effort to suppress those evil thoughts</p>
              <p>Example<br>1 - i see someone walking down the road, i have the urge to stick a knife into him<br>2 - i see a crowded area, i get the urge to strap a bomb to myself and blow everybody up<br>3 - i see a little girl alone, i get the urge to hug her</p>
