            <div class='col-md body'>Have you heard of <strong>California Fitness</strong>, the famous gym network in Singapore?<br><br>I am here to say somethings about them from my experience with them. If you are considering joining that club by any chance, please, please read the whole post and think three hundred times before signing any contract with them. Trust me. It's worth it.<br><br>I joined this club in Bugis even before it started. It was the prelaunch 'promotion' period and they told me the deals that I would get then will never happen again.<br><br>So I joined. SGD 110 Per Month. Plus the GST ofcourse. Setup the GIRO account. Everything is smooth. I had plans to remain in the club for 1 year. And the minimum commitment in my contract was one year. Ofcourse the sales consultant did mention to me that I have to pay the last two months in advance, which is the minimum notice period I have to serve. This he said after I signed the contract.<br><br>I have joined fitness clubs before, and they were just like any other memberships, use it and pay for your usage.<br><br>Third day of my visit to the club, I met someone who joined recently as well. I casually happened to ask him, how much do you pay monthly? He said he got an offer for 70 bucks a month. I was shocked, coz the sales consultant who handled me insisted that my deal was the best deal they ever offered to anyone!<br><br>Stupid me, I thought the California fitness being a reputed club would say the truth.<br><br>I spoke to the sales guy, whom I managed to get after a few tries over the phone, he said he was allowed to sell only for that much minimum and that deal could be a one off thing. And ofcourse that I cannot change anything or cancel my contract for a year unless I wanted to pay huge sums of money. Already dissapointed, I didn't want to loose out on everything, so I decided to work out for an year and then close the stuff.<br><br>Oh yeah, their machines are ok, some are relatively new. Finally I thought, since I am using the facilities well, it could be worth it after all!<br><br>Bad Bad Mistake.<br><br>Finally the 12 month expired and I noticed that they had actually charged my card for the 11th and 12th month. Thinking that this is an error and my membership is due for renewal, I went to the counter. The sweet smiling cunning lady at the counter says, the membership is not cancelled automatically even after the contract period unless you give a 2 month notice.<br><br>I had got an offer from another club for much lesser amount monthly and I had already joined that club in between presuming that my membership with California is expiring. I asked the lady to consider the notice period from then on and cancel my membership.<br><br>I filled up the cancellation form. Another form for my shoe locker. I got an acknowledgement for my shoe locker. But for the membership they said they will forward a letter later on to my mail address.<br><br>Just when I was about to leave, the friendly service officer came running and said I have to make another payment of SGD 110+GST since I was supposed to give notice 5 working days prior to my billing date.<br><br>It was another three days before my billing date. I had no clue of this. NO ONE EVER TOLD THIS AT THE TIME OF JOINING. Thinking that I have to give notice before the billing date, I went to the club before three days of my billing date. I said no way I will pay anything more since I am already losing the money for two month notice. I was not going to use the gym since I had joined in the other club. Technically they increased the notice period from Two Months to Two Months and Five Working DAYS and just because I am two working days late (REMEMBER THERE IS STILL THREE MORE working days and ofcourse the two whole months!) I have to pay another 110 + GST!!!! I felt like cheated and I said I will never pay.<br><br>They said if I dont pay, it would be trouble for me later on.<br><br>AND INDEED IT WAS TROUBLE.<br><br>In December 2007. Almost 14 Months after the notice period incident, without no communication whatsoever in between that time. They send me a final payment letter. Amount DUE: SGD 1500/-<br><br>Imagine my shock. I contacted the person at the club. After continious calling and following up, they said they can reduce it to 75%, Still need to pay over 1000 dollars! I am in a battle with them now. And they are threatening me with legal actions.<br><br>I searched these blogs and have found several such incidents related to CALIFORNIA FITNESS CENTER in Singapore.<br><br>NEVER JOIN THIS CLUB. I PLEAD TO YOU. Join Fitness First instead or Fitness Plus or even Planet Fitness. Atleast they are true to you. They dont try to cheat you.<br><br>I am going to the Consumer Association of Singapore and after that to the Small Claims Tribunal of Singapore. I am sure I can find justice. I hope so atleast.<br><br>Please spread this message. That is the least I can do, going through this shock treatement from California fitness for being a prompt paying member for over 14 months!<br><br>California Fitness is a horrible horrible place. Never go there, they will cheat you of your money and will hang on your neck through out your life. Perhaps after 3 years or so, they will come back to you saying that you owe them SGD 10,000/-<br><br>Please dont join California fitness. I beg you.<br><br>You can contact me to find out more details through the comments.<br><strong></strong></div>
