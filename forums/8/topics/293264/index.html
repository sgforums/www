Working but no CPF still can contribute to housing loan.  Does the guy have CPF ? If got not so bad, go for smaller flat or even HDB rental ( very cheap provided you qualify).  Socially, don't see an issue when you move into HDB flat.  Most people do not mind and will even help out ..  afterall, they know that the foreigner may not be accustom to our culture ..  of course there are those who simple hate FT for certain reason ..  so suay suay got this type of people as neighbour then good luck lor ...</div>

I totally agree with you that is about meeting the right person in sg. Some are bias against foreigners while some not. Most impt of all must teach her our culture in sg and ask them to stop practising their undesirable habits. Side track abit, dun u  guys think that we will have more options and opportunities if we have a foreign wife? We can have some connection aboard so we wont have to retire in expensive sg in future.</div>

Best is to convert her to PR safer.</div>
