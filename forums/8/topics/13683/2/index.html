In Genesis 1:25-27 states that animals/birds were made first. That is correct and true.<br><br>Genesis 2:18-19 states that humans were made first. This is not true because the sentence said, "Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man....".<br>The sentence never say "Now the Lord start to form..." or any thing suggesting that the humans are created first.<br><br>Hope this helps....<br><br>But is this very important to you? Or are you trying to prove Christianity is stupid and decided to make them a fool before residing into your on beliefs? If the latter case is true, then why the "please respect them (the other religions)" and then slap your own face?<br><br>Want to be angry, feel free and blah yourself out. No need "in the name of respect" and snipe from afar.<br><br>Christians can be quite insensitive with their words but their intentions are good, juz like a nagging mum. Think of it this way, if mothers don't bother, she wouldn't care less to nag. A pain in the neck? Ya, but their intention is good.<br><br></div></blockquote>regarding your quote about :"now the lord had formed..."<br>now, that's complete rubbish. i don't know where you got that from. according to my 3 bibles, and according to <a href="http://www.bible.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.com</a><br><br>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him." So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.<br><br>As time progresses, I see that more and more versions of the Bible get "corrected". The point I'm driving is that I can't prove or disprove the existence of a God, therefore I shan't. However, what I'm trying to do is to make it clear that, I do not believe in the Bible because too many of its accounts are confusing and contradictory.<br><br>be free to believe what you want! i for one, believe that chu mei-feng is innocent and a victim of a devious plot. man, does she look completely decent!!!</div>
