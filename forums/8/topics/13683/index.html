That is correct and true.<br><br>Genesis 2:18-19 states that humans were made first. This is not true because the sentence said, "Now the LORD God had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air. He brought them to the man....".<br>The sentence never say "Now the Lord start to form..." or any thing suggesting that the humans are created first.<br><br>Hope this helps....<br><br>But is this very important to you? Or are you trying to prove Christianity is stupid and decided to make them a fool before residing into your on beliefs? If the latter case is true, then why the "please respect them (the other religions)" and then slap your own face?<br><br>Want to be angry, feel free and blah yourself out. No need "in the name of respect" and snipe from afar.<br><br>Christians can be quite insensitive with their words but their intentions are good, juz like a nagging mum. Think of it this way, if mothers don't bother, she wouldn't care less to nag. A pain in the neck? Ya, but their intention is good.<br><br></div>

In fact, I'll refute you BEFORE you give me an answer.<br>I'll quote the Bible of your Christian God.<br>Genesis 1:25-27 states that animals/birds were made first.<br>Genesis 2:18-19 states that humans were made first.<br><br>Are you SURE God made the world? Both Christian accounts contradict each other. Find a better explanation. Maybe David Copperfield conjured the world out of thin air? Maybe, Chokky made the world!!!</div></blockquote>well chokky, chapter one and chapter two seem to hv different accounts, but if u read properly, u'd find that chapter two is a narrative that focuses more so on narrating the story of man. chapter one narrates the sequence. in no way is there any contradiction. chapter two happens to mention mankind first and then says that God ALSO made the animals, and in no way focuses on sequence. u read it wrongly, chokky.<br>dun be so hasty and in ur haste, make silly mistakes like this.<br>imagine i wrote, and chokky was born on nov 11th and chokky's mother also had a girl. now which came first? is it specified?<br>think abt it.</div>
