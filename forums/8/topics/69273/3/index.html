They usually have all sorts of designs and cuttings for different figures, different taste.<br><br>Personally, I don't really emphasize much on which gown to get from which bridal shop.  Cuz if the bride is pretty, any gown will make her pretty.  Likewise, if I not pretty, if I get the most expensive gown in the world, I will still look the same.  that's my personal opinion lah.  But seldom (or even never) brides don't look pretty one.  Every bride that I see looks beautiful to me.  Everytime I see a bride (either having a gown fitting or photo shoot), I tend to stop by and look.  cuz any girl that put on a wedding gown looks like an angel.<br><br>Another thing you may want to look at while deciding is the style of the photos.  Different photographers have different style.  Some have magazine style.  Some conventional.  Again, it depends on what you want.</div>
