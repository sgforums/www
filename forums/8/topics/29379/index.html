            <div class='col-md body'>hi people, some feng shui stuff i got from an e-mail... thought i shared with u guys.....<br><br>For your reading pleasure.....<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Believe it or not?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;This is a really interesting article especially the very<br>&gt;last point which explains the existence of Bishan Park. Think about it,<br>&gt;these points actually make sense right? Please read on...<br>&gt;WHY PLANT TREES?<br>&gt;Ever wonder why Singapore is known as a Garden City. Why would Singapore go<br>&gt;around planting trees? After all, maintaining a Garden City is very<br>&gt;expensive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Well,here is the answer. If you were to look at Singapore<br>&gt;from the top, Singapore resembles a crab, with its mouth the Singapore river<br>&gt;and it's back facing Malaysia. We all know that cooked crabs (that means<br>&gt;dead crabs) are red, the colour of barren ground.<br>&gt;But a live crab is basically a dark shade of green. So, by planting trees,<br>&gt;you make Singapore look green and not red and therefore alive.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;TWO PROMINENT DISTRICTS<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Lee Kuan Yew runs Tanjong Pagar while Goh Chok Tong is in Marine Parade. If<br>&gt;you look at Singapore as a crab again , these two locations are situated at<br>&gt;the positions where the claws of a crab will be. We know the strongest parts<br>&gt;of a crab are its claws, so there they are.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;HOW SINGAPORE WAS CONQUERED<br>&gt;<br>&gt;To kill a crab, you stick the chopstick at the side of<br>&gt;the crab.. .<br>&gt;which is exactly where the Japanese attacked and<br>&gt;conquered Singapore.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;KALLANG RIVER CLEAN-UP<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Why clean up a river that spells different memories for<br>&gt;many Singaporeans and was one of the reasons for our<br>&gt;prosperity in the early years?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;During the 80's recession, we had just completed the<br>&gt;Benjamin Sheares Bridge...which happens to suspend over the Singapore river,<br>&gt;the mouth of the crab. This is as good as tying the mouth<br>&gt;of the crab, thus choking it... which explains the recession. In order to<br>&gt;get out of it, one way was to clean up the river so that the mouth is clean<br>&gt;and wealth can flow in without obstruction.<br>&gt;Sounds unbelievable? But it! seems logic al, doesn't it! ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Here is another thing for you to think about whether you<br>&gt;believe it or not.<br>&gt;Please reach into your pocket and search for a one-dollar coin and take a<br>&gt;good look at it. It is round, no doubt, but it also has a unique Octagonal<br>&gt;design - which is an important symbol in Chinese Geomancy or Feng Shui. This<br>&gt;is where the story of this coin begins.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;On the island of Singapore lived a very influential man<br>&gt;named Lee. He is very particular about Feng Shui, i.e. man's balance with<br>&gt;nature. There is a particular day and also time of day to inaugurate any<br>&gt;important event. There is also a particular colour of dress, when it comes<br>&gt;to important occasions, and so on. He has a feng shui<br>&gt;mentor - a famous monk, a particular Venerable who Lee would seek the advice<br>&gt;of this Venerable, whenever he had to make an important decision. The<br>&gt;one-dollar coin came into circulation at the time of the MRT construction on<br>&gt;the island (check the date if ! you do not b elieve me). The story oes that<br>&gt;the Venerable had<br>&gt;advised Lee that MRT tunnelling work would be bad for the Feng Shui of the<br>&gt;island, it's prosperity, etc. Firm however on pushing ahead with the<br>&gt;project, Lee asked if there was anything that could be done to circumvent<br>&gt;the bad Feng Shui."Yes", replied the Venerable,<br>&gt;"but it may be impossible to implement". Said Lee to the<br>&gt;Venerable<br>&gt;- please speak. The Venerable then said that EVERY<br>&gt;household on this island must have or must display a 'pak kwa' or a symbolic<br>&gt;octagonal(eight-sided)object. Oh no, there would definitely be racial riots.<br>&gt;How could Lee force every household to have a 'pak<br>&gt;kwa' at home? Hehheh... said the wise Lee - I have an idea. I know how to<br>&gt;make EVERYBODY like to have as many 'pak kwas' as possible and so,<br>&gt;our one-dollar coin was born.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;NEXT CHAPTER ...<br>&gt;But then, the economy did not do quite as well as<br>&gt;expected after the circulation of the one-dollar coin. Rememb! er the '85/8 6<br>&gt;recession! ??<br>&gt;So the Honorary Venerable was consulted again. He said<br>&gt;that whilst<br>&gt;the one-dollar coin did symbolise the pak kwa, it was of<br>&gt;no use if<br>&gt;everyone had it in his pocket and failed to DISPLAY it.<br>&gt;So the next novel idea was born, the ROAD TAX LABEL. If you recall, it used<br>&gt;tobe round and now, it is OCTAGONAL and it is DISPLAYED.<br>&gt;Maybe now,<br>&gt;you think this explains the many years of booming economy Singapore had been<br>&gt;experiencing. However, with the recent turmoil<br>&gt;in the region and now that the Venerable* is no longer around, what shall we<br>&gt;do next? Know any Feng Shui experts? *By the way, the monk mentioned is the<br>&gt;ex-head of a temple. When he passed away several<br>&gt;years ago, Bishan Park was born because his temple was<br>&gt;not allowed<br>&gt;to be blocked by any HDB flats.<br>&gt;<br>&gt;Well, its up to you to believe it or not but then its<br>&gt;food for thought!!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
