I laughed in my heart, "so thin already, still got hollow meh??'' (normally hollow necklace is for thicker necklaces). I could also see the sales lady's reaction to the request was like ''dot dot dot'' reaction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>SCENE B</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This auntie was saying that the gold necklace she's holding is too long and was asking the sales lady to cut up into a bracelet. The lagi best part is that when the sales lady asked her what to do with the cut-away part, that auntie replied ''sell back to you loh, so that I can get discount" (trade-in). The saleslady gave a even lagi best reply, ''Why not you just choose a bracelet, which is cheaper??

You know how people are nowadays ....trying to cut corners even during their conversations.<br><br>Scene B: Perhaps the craftsmanship for that necklace is what she had wanted and that even at loosing that bit of money on the trade-in deduction and workmanship is worth it!!! Afterall, it's her money and her choice...anything wrong??<br><br>TS, I don't really see anything wrong and certainly have a different view about your "aesop's" morals. Sorry to be offensive here, but I cannot help sense a little snobbishness on your part to have such a perception and moral. Besides, does minding one's own business means that this thread should not have its place here? I just wonder with my "bliss insanity" here. Look everyone will have his or her own perception but perhaps if we really look further than just skim the surface - it will certainly help a lot here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

There were 2 customers being served when i got there. Being just next to them, I could hear clearly all their conversations with the shop ppl.....<br><br>[b]SCENE A</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This uncle was holding a thread-thin gold necklace (ie; very thin like sewing thread) and was asking for a hollow one. I laughed in my heart, "so thin already, still got hollow meh??'' (normally hollow necklace is for thicker necklaces). I could also see the sales lady's reaction to the request was like ''dot dot dot'' reaction. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>SCENE B</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This auntie was saying that the gold necklace she's holding is too long and was asking the sales lady to cut up into a bracelet. The lagi best part is that when the sales lady asked her what to do with the cut-away part, that auntie replied ''sell back to you loh, so that I can get discount" (trade-in). The saleslady gave a even lagi best reply, ''Why not you just choose a bracelet, which is cheaper?? The trade-in deduction and workmanship for cutting here &amp; there will cost you more!''  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>MORALS OF THE STORY:</strong><br>#1 If you've no money, dun even bother to step into goldsmitths shop!<br>#2 If you're no common sense, it's best to shut up and not make brainless suggestions![/b]</blockquote>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br>guan ni pi shi!<br></div>
