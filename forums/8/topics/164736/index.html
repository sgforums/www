            <div class='col-md body'>I'm talking about in general.<br><br>As in for instance, <span style="font-style: italic;">"why are you working as a chef when you dislike being a chef?"</span><br><br>And <strong>not </strong><span style="font-style: italic;">"why do you write a report for work-purposes when you dislike writing reports?"</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">"why do you work at all, if you dislike working?"</span><br><br>I feel... that life is short. It's your life, you run it, so you have a choice of what you want to do. And sometimes, it's not a matter of "I have no choice", but rather how hard you work at finding alternatives.<br><br>And if die die people must do something they don't like, I think then they should change their perspective so maybe they'll find that things aren't so bad after all.<br><br>Aye?
