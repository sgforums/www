BUT, if my best friend suddenly turned gay, i'd still stick with him no matter wat. But i just find it hard to make friends with someone who is gay. oh no, I dun doubt their abilities... Gay guys can be really insightful and artistic. Alot of famous people were gay like Leonardo Da Vinci and he painted some really cute women, except i dun think Mona lisa is cute... anyways, the song is very meaningful, but writer probably thinking of guy instead of girl  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>How can anyone become gay? i know u can have really close guy friends and would die for them but the thought of sexual contact with another guy... man, dats just make my hair stand and  ----s shrink man... Ever get hit on by a gay guy? or even accidentally walked into a gay bar? i have, was really funny and scary but dat's another story ... well, to each his own ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read this thread with a very heavy heart.<br><br>Rinoa:<br><br>Why the emphasis that Â‘SomebodyÂ’ is written by a gay? Does it matter? Â‘Though it is written by a gayÂ…Â’, Â‘Cool song but written by a gayÂ…Â’ IÂ’m sorry this great song has been tainted because of its gay origin. It would have been so perfect otherwise. And please, stay away from all songs by Elton John or Pet Shop Boys. I donÂ’t want you to get upset further.<br><br>IÂ’m sorry all the gays you met are Â‘always trying to be hanky pankyÂ’ and you canÂ’t stand the way they talk. Perhaps you should tell them off the next time and tell them to go for speech therapy sessions. Or better still, a sex change! Why didnÂ’t I think of that earlier? I think I will go to NUH later to do just that.<br><br>Cluon:<br><br>I really hope you mean it when you say Â‘to each his ownÂ’. ItÂ’s probably just irksome me, but you sound so much less tolerating than you claimed in your postings. I wonder if you will be just as irritated if it is your straight neighbour who has that high pitch laugh. I guess not huh? Since he is not gay.<br><br>OhÂ… one of the _excuses_ why we _turn_ gay is because we want to get belittled by people like you.<br><br>Whew! ArenÂ’t you glad Â‘LatelyÂ’ is penned by the very straight Stevie Wonder?<br><br>------------------<br>'yah, it's just a phase --- those terrible guilt and struggles in life before finally coming to terms with yourself and admit that you are GAY'<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks Swiftwing...<br>Seems like u are optimist...like me!I ti is good to let ppl know about how u feel in your innermost heart. As far we our individual lives are concerned, there might be a Dr.Jekyll and Mr.Hyde in us. We might try to put a mask at work, smiling to ppl whom we really dread, doing stuffs that we hate doing. But here, is where you have your own voice and ppl can hear u out. That is why, I never feel a tinge of embarrasement to share what I have.It is abundant and take all you can. Thanks for your song!I do hope it can lighten some of the broken hearted here...!<br><br>Merci...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok am not much of a music guy here, but yeah i AGREE with the lyrics wholeheartedly(no, nvr heard the sonr b4)...<br><br>To all of you out there, especially 7th son...<br><br>And regarding gays, i used to be very biased against 'em until i got into close contact with 'em(no, only normal social conversation) and well, some of 'em are really cool pple, there's nothing basically wrong with 'em just that they are more female than male and prefer to be female(passive kind) whereas the active kind just prefers males emotionally and physically..heck there's nothing wrong with that...why cant we just let others live their lives the way they choose it...after al it isnt as if they're intruding on our lives...they're human beings too and have their own rights...<br><br>Sexual preference?? well i must say that evry1 has different fetishes...are we gnnna condemn all fetishes??<br><br>JUST had to get this off my chest..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never knew this song will actually bring up the issie of the gay community.*sigh*but I just want to say that gays are actually quite talented as u can see from the feel of the song.If not for Martin Lee Gore, Depheche Mode would have never succeed!So I hope no one is offended whatsoever. To me if it is a good song, I dun mind even if a third gender were to write it or compose it...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>
