            <div class='col-md body'>but pap percentage wise has gained significantly. about 10 percent. note that around 10 percent of voters are now new voters, ie. youngsters 21-25 yrs of age.<br>having been the products of the education system and beneficiaries of the pap-controlled rule, there simply is no reason for youngsters to vote the opposition. give me a lift to the floor of my flat, give tax rebates and singapore shares with monetary rewards, give excellent education(look at the nice new secondary schools!), why shouldn't i vote them? the older generation may have their own other reasons for voting out the pap. the younger generation don't! its simply---do what everyone else does, stay in line, and you'll be happy and well. and that's what has been emphasized all these years in local education. the results of the election are the fruits of what has been planted. critics argue that there is lack of creativity in the education system. but with creativity, you'll get more opposition as well. if the education system becomes more creativity-rewarding, such resounding victories will be just a memory in the past...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I always say that Singapore might become a One-Party State. But more likely, Hougang and Potong Pasir will be left alone perpetually as opposition wards, so that at least some semblence of an opposition remains. Always the same, never changing.<br><br>PAP wins by 55%, 60%, 65%, 75% or 80%, it doesn't matter, they still win. When they want to win, they will win. Ever noticed the extraordinarily high number of rejected votes in those "hotly" contested wards?<br><br>Well, we now know what Singaporeans listen to. There's no use talking about ideals like democracy, freedom of speech etc. There's no use in revealing the blunders of the PAP government. There's no use pointing out faults in PAP government policies. There's no use in questioning how the PAP government spends its money. In short, there's no use finding fault with the PAP government, no matter how glaring that fault may be or how much suffering it causes.<br><br>What do Singaporeans listen to then? They listen when their flats are going to be painted, and an extra balcony added. They listen when money is given to them. And they listen real hard when threathened. In short, they listen when things are promised to them, and they listen even harder when these things are threathened to be withheld.<br><br>Sorry Dr.Chee, the people of Singapore have not upgraded their thinking yet. Appealing to their senses won't work, you will have to give them something of apparent value.<br><br>Low and Chiam, pretty soon you will have to give them something too. That's the way it is.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Instead of being here and complain that "no use this no use that", why don't we make it known to the government that "we want this and we want that" and not being manipulated and under threat by the government?<br>We should stand up NOW and make our voices heard. We should be telling what the government should do and not the other way around. We elected (did we?) the government, we pay taxes, we pay for the ministers' salary, we support and contribute to the country's economy and we should be given the right to ask for what we want and not wait for carrots to be dangled in front of us and make us blindly follow instructions.<br>The extra balcony, do we really need it? Be reminded, the balcony is not free of charge, you have to pay for it, and what use does it have, really? And, upgrading is selective, it does not apply to every precinct. It depends on "luck" and up to the government to decide whether it is time to do it. There are precincts who faithfully vote for this particular party which promises upgrading for every election and have yet to receive news that they are going to get that new balcony.<br>Being a government, its role is to ensure that every part of Singapore enjoys the same privileges and benefits. Distribution should be fair, regardless of whichever party is in charge of that particular GRC.<br>A good government should be liberal and open to suggestions, whether by other non-ruling parties or by the people, then decide the best for all, and not stubbornly implementing and sticking to its policies regardless whether the people welcome them or not.<br>As the future leaders and economy-builders of Singapore, we should be brave to speak up and challenge the government (PM said they welcome that). We should be putting our ideas and ideals across to them.<br>Don't worry, the oppposition have not failed, in fact, it is a start to strengthen themselves and brace up for the next GE. Optimistically, I have confidence that this generation of Singaporeans will make the difference.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's useless i think. The GRC controlled, the opposition party being targeted and eliminated one by one.<br><br>So sad to see so many singaporean had degraded to such a standard as to get easily threatened or succumbed to powerful forces without listening to their heart.<br><br>The voice of the people is getting weaker. Even the new blood are not speaking for themselve. The threat getting stronger. It getting hopeless. The results demoralized most of the oppositions. Even if there's still 2 winning oppositions, their moral are also affected by the drops in voter's support.<br><br>Now we know what made mostly of singaporean. The people of Hougang and Potong Pasir who were admired by people who really care about the democratic future of singapore are now losing their ground. They sacrificed for the sake of democracy in singapore but now no longer hold their ground due to materislistic greed. It's disheartening. Even Chiam and Low would be discouraged by such a trend, what have we to say about the average citizen. Singapore will soon be a single party country in no time. Who would dare to sacrifice anymore?<br><br>The key point that was made by the results of GE2001 is that singaporean still like their life to be controlled rather than they themselve controlling their own life. This time Low have said the people made their choice, we have to respect their choice. I think this is really true. The result is really dishearthening. Even the young did not stand up for themselve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FI:<br><br>There are two strikes against your suggestion of "why don't we make it known to the government that "we want this and we want that" and not being manipulated and under threat by the government?".<br><br>First, the government already knows. But whether or not they wish to do anything about it is another story. I think you should know this by now.<br><br>Second, according to the election results, the general populance does not feel as though as they are being manipulated, neither do they feel threathened. On the contrary, they embrace the PAP government in every way.<br><br>One may argue that not all Singaporeans were able to take part in the election because of constituency walkovers. However, judging from the way the PAP has swept all the wards being contested by the Opposition with the exception of two, I doubt if the response will be any different should there be an outright national election instead.<br><br>People complain when they cannot change anything. It's all I can do now. If I complain, and the people do not support my complaints, no matter how valid or how truthful my points are, they are but naught. And the government will laugh at me.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Singaporeans are now rather passive than active and it is worrying and disheartening to see that the grip of the opposition parties on this generation is slowly loosening. However, it is encouraging to know that the Youth Wings of opposition parties have worthy people with good credentials and potentials. I believe this new batch will be well-groomed and well-informed and better-experienced from the past "mistakes" that the parties made.<br>All is not lost yet and the opposition parties won't be dissolved by this little setback.<br>Anything can happen in this 5 years. The people will be keeping a close watch on the ruling party and ready to pounce on them. Till then, I'm only an ignorant Singaporean teenager who does not give two hoots about politics.<br>hiaK~</div>
