            <div class='col-md body'>Rinoa, forgive me for not writing on monism<br>and dualism from eastern philosophic point<br>of view yet, for I have to rush an article<br>to computer times. But I will talk really<br>briefly what I have gained through my years<br>of philosophic study.<br><br>To be really honest, philosophy is really a<br>depressing topic.<br><br>If there is anything that philosophy is<br>aiming at, it is to instill into the disciple<br>the ability to question.<br><br>And the ability to question is not always<br>good for the questioner. Not to mention, that<br>"education" as it is, is to stop people from<br>questioning things that people take granted<br>for. The establishment dictates it this way<br>to have a false facade of social "stability"<br>and extending its own life.<br><br>People who are not well versed<br>in philosophy are at<br>least "happier" living in<br>the matrix oblivious to the fact that their<br>existence can be nobler.<br><br>If you study philosophy, you will also start<br>question your own beliefs, and sometimes you<br>find that those beliefs which define<br>who you are are so questionable<br>that you will probably see your whole<br>worldview crumbles before you. That is very<br>depressing, I have experienced it myself.<br><br>My dear friends, what is depressing is not<br>knowledge. What is more depressing is the<br>ability to question. Because that ability<br>threatens establishment, it threatens your<br>worldview. That ability can only come from<br>the study of Philosophy.<br><br>So have I ever regretted that I took upon<br>the task of reading and thinking on most<br>philosophies? No, never. Life is more than<br>just self preservation. Philosophy destroys<br>my previous worldview so that something new<br>can be built on top of it. It helps me<br>relate more well to the world I am living in<br>and I have grown more mature.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for those interested, here's a link to the last chapter of Russell's book "The Problems of Philosophy", aptly titled "The Value of Philosophy". In it, he tells us what he thinks the point of philosophy is and something abt the kind of ppl who engage in the serious study of it.<br><br>personally, i have found philosophy to be less a study than an engagement in a world of ideas, of understanding abt the way things are and, more importantly, of an appreciation and sense of wonder abt the way things could be. it is ultimately a positive endeavour, for it helps open up a world of possibilities. and hope thrives only where possibilities never cease. i am far less eloquent than russell, and for that reason, will keep my voice low and allow him to speak for himself and hopefully to speak to you as well. If his words strike a chord within you, philosophy would be all the better for it. if they do not, at least you'd have a clearer picture of what you've chosen to leave behind.<br><br>for those who do not know, Russell was a British philosopher, logician, essayist, and social critic who wrote widely on issues/topics like education, history, politics and science, amongst other things. Noted for his anti-nuclear and anti-war protests, he was awarded the Order of Merit in 1949 and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950.<br><br><a href="http://www.ditext.com/russell/rus15.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ditext.com/russell/rus15.html</a><br><br>for those who have read the chapter, you may also want to go to the table of contents where you will find links to the other chapters of his book as well as to on-line texts of several of the great (western)philosophers. this may serve as a sampling of what philosophy is abt, an introduction to philosophy if you like, for those interested in learning more abt it first hand.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pardon me that I have thought you have painted a very cynical picture of learning philosophy. Philosophy is concerned about asking why, and everyman on the street is  a philosopher. It is also manifested in the way how people live in the world. One can question his or her own beliefs, and then learn to filter out what is previously thought to be right, so that a person grows and mature. Your depression only stems from your own experience of learning philosophy. I think I am perfectly happy with learning and growing with learning more and understand more about the different ideas and thoughts of people. Some people just read philosophy out of interest, get something out of it and use it. There is no point asking some questions where you cannot find answers. So, if encountered with that, just forget the abstract and live your life happily....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The point of asking 'why' is not so much to get an answer but to arrive at well-informed (as well informed as possible) opinions of your own. However, more crucial is the set of analytical and logical skills you would have developed as a result of rigourous questioning. These skills are marketable everywhere.<br><br>For every Bertrand Russell, an anti-christian philosopher, there is a C.S. Lewis, an equally able apologetic. However, I don't want to turn this thread into a religious forum. I think Russell discussed this very well in one of his essays - MORALS. Lets use this as starting point for our discussion.<br><br>IS THERE SUCH A THING AS MORALS? WHAT IS IT MEANT TO DO FOR US? WHY IS SOMETHING 'RIGHT' FOR ONE PERSON, AND 'WRONG' FOR THE OTHER? DOES THIS MEAN MORALS ARE UNSTABLE RULES?<br><br>cheers<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When answering Terence's question, one must<br>however note that there are 2 levels in which<br>you can address him.<br><br>1) Moral as a prescriptive formula.

To question the basis and<br>motivation of morality.<br><br>Since Terence is trained in philosophy, I<br>would guess Terence wants an answer which<br>addresses point 2, not 1.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr Ng Kai Hoe, I would like ask you some questions out of curiousity. Is philosophy practical? Is there such a thing as practical philosophy? And last, is there a conflict between being practical and being philosophical?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course philosophy is practical.<br><br>As a matter of fact, I came out with a new<br>branch of philosophy known as Street<br>Philosophy (tm) - basically what works on<br>the street.<br><br>And you shall be the first disciple of my<br>philosophy. You shall carry the torch to<br>future generations.<br><br>Just joking. I explained this to Eck before.<br>Philosophy is not directly practical, it<br>helps however in determining the ends - what<br>you want to achieve.
