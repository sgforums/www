            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Sometimes, this abstract question bothers me. When I was younger, I am an advocate in fighting for my destiny, and believed in myself that I can change my fate. As I grew older, I realize that the more I try to fight against Fate, I felt more and more drawn towards it, till the point that I am almost resigned to my fate.<br><br>Destiny is something one would know in him/herself to the changing world of affairs. Do you believe in your destiny? Perhaps, because I am beginning to see where my destiny lies, I realize that I have the unfortunate choice to follow it. There are paths which are meant to tread, and yet there are paths which you would like to tread yet it turned out that you were moved into a different path.<br><br>So where does it stands? Do you believe that there is a destiny awaiting you?<br><br>P/S : I have used Fate and Destiny interchangably, as if they take the same meaning. Those who philosophize perhaps can give me a different meaning.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fate?<br><br>Some people live their entire lives as has been mapped out for them... defined for them... by the government, their parents, society, authority, etc etc etc<br><br>These fellas obviously will be inclined to believe in fate because they have no where to go... (from the path that they are glued to)<br><br>Some people decide to take fate into their own hands and become big movers and shakers, defining the world rather than the other way round. Hitler is an example... as well as the big bosses of today's corporate giants, leaders, etc etc. These fellas probably do not belief in fate, the boundaries they are governed by are significantly less significant (hee hee) than that of the typical fate worshipping folks.<br><br>I don't believe in fate.<br><br>YOU (not referring specifically to prodigal but the readers of this post in general) do not have to believe in fate either.<br><br>But please don't try to assasinate any of our govt. leaders...

            <div class='col-md body'>Proddy<br>Fate and destiny are meant to be together and not separated. When fate manifest in its truest form, it is the beginning and Destiny spells the end of the whole course of journey. If you have the fate to meet the one, but no destiny to fulfill, it is pointless and meaningless. Fate gives u the opportunity for things to happen but it is the whole course of journey that leads to destiny if you are meant to be.<br><br>But I believe one can manipulate his own life and fate...the inner locus of control acts in me to fight for my own wants and rights and I shall not surrender until my very last breathe.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep, get wat u mean..<br><br>Wat I was referring to was 'must' as an Ultimate and 'fate' as an Ultimate as well... saying this person MUST be an artist would mean it is FATE he is to be an artist.<br><br>Thus saying 'If a man can be, he MUST be' is in a way inclined towards the notion of Fate, which sorta contradicts your earlier discardment of the notion.<br><br>Regardless, any argument on Fate is quite pointless and meaningless because in the end, everything is a matter of perception. A man who seems to 'define his own future' could very well be simply doing wat he is fated to do... (we wouldnt know)...<br><br>Our viewpoints are just too limited to ever get to see the whole picture...<br><br>Let me suggest another interesting point, in Christianity, they believe that people can make their own choice, that Fate does not exist, BUT at the same time, the belief is that God is all powerful and all-knowing... he can tell the future... so if God can tell the future, and He already knows Man's decisions before he makes them, isn't that already....

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to disbelieve in fate.<br><br>But like prodigal, when i grow older, i started to believe. Because there are too many things that happen in life switch are so coincidentyal that you just can't believe that it is pure coincident.<br><br>Anyone here watch "Mangnolia" ??? Excellent show. Go watch it and ask yourself, "can everything be just PURE coincidence" ?<br><br>I love the show "Sliding Doors" too. The life of the girl is different if she miss/not miss the train. In that whole movie, the director is trying to tell the audience that there is no fate and your life changes every moment depending on what you do NOW, even missing a train can change your life ! But at the end of the show ..... there was a great twist. And i think the message at the end of the show was "If something is bound to happen, it will. You can postpone it, but not prevent it"<br><br>Very intelligent show.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Littleman,<br><br>Maybe I am a fan of the quantum reality, like the idea in the Sliding doors, basically, we have many realities, made by the choices which we moved through life by our interaction with the environment in a non-local fashion. There is no way which we can enter into an alternate reality universe, what we can find consolation, perhaps, in some other reality, we would have found that something which disappoint us in this reality... Looking at Sliding doors, in the end, whether she took the train or not, in the end, she still met that guy with the same sense of humour.. Hence all roads lead to Rome in some strange manner.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, read this in "Dork from Cork" or something like that.  Everytime we make a choice, a me chooses one thing and another me chooses another thing.  So I am right now is just one of the numerous me's and if I feel that my lot in life isn't so good after all, I can feel consolation from the thought that in another dimension, a me who has chosen wisely is living well.<br><br>But I don't believe in fate.  Maybe I'm too young, but as Bartrand Russel said, we define laws, perhaps the coincidences look too fishy to be real coincidences because of the way we choose to view those coincidences.  Watch Joan of Arc.<br><br>Anyway, how can you determine that you are living a life guided by someone/thing else?  There's absolutely nothing you can do to be sure that what you are doing is your own initiative instead of some unseen and unfelt hands.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi MayaJade,<br><br>It is very strange how our lives could be guided by some unknown force that we are forced to take certain paths. My only feeling  rest on my own deja vu with the place where I am staying, like I once stayed there before... In the words of Neil Gaiman's Sandman, I would subscribe to the following thought :<br><br>"We do what we must... Sometimes we can choose the path we follow. Sometimes our choices are made for us. And sometimes we have no choice at all."<br><br>However, sometimes, what I see in my life, seemed to be clouded with illusions that I do not know whether I should trust my own instincts, particularly, I don't know whether I can believe in something again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays,<br><br>sorry, have not finish ...<br><br>Yes, you are right that impossibility is impossible. But that is right only with logical thinking.<br><br>Can we imagine something that has an end but does not have a beginning ? It is beyond human imagination.<br><br>We are thought to think logically. When we say small, we mean not large. When we mean slow we mean no fast. These are relativities. But they are fuzzy logic. When I say small, how small is small ? Subjective. So can we understand something that is not relative ? Like something that has an end but no beginning.<br><br>I think i am a bit confused here too ! haha<br>But generally i think our brains are trained to think in a certain way. Hence we cannot understand things that are absolute and not relative.</div>
