            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Men vs. Women<br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>One basic truth:  Men and women are different. </strong><br><br><strong> RELATIONSHIPS </strong><br>*************<br>First of all, a man does not call a relationship.  He refers to it as a<br>romance, or a period of dating, of going out, or, in some unfortunate<br>circumstances, "that time when me and Suzie was doing it on a semi-regular<br>basis."<br><br>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry, and pour her heart out to her<br>girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men are Morons."  Then<br>she will get on with her life.<br><br>A man has a little more trouble letting go.  For six months, his ex may not<br>hear from him, but then, at three on Saturday night/Sunday morning, he will<br>call and say, "I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll<br>never forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a total bitch.  But I want to<br>let you know there's always a chance for us."<br><br>This is known as the "I Hate You/I Love You" drunken phone call.<br>Ninety-nine percent of all men past the age of 21 have made this call at<br>least once.  Some men make a career of these calls.  There are community<br>colleges that offer extension courses to help men get over this need; alas,<br>these classes rarely prove effective.<br><br><strong> SEX </strong><br>***<br>Women prefer 30 to 45 minutes of foreplay.  Men prefer 30 to 45 seconds of<br>foreplay, less if at all possible. For the man, driving back to her place is<br>considered a part of foreplay.<br><br><strong> MATURITY </strong><br>********<br>Women mature at a much faster rate than men.  Most 17 year old females can<br>function as adults.  Most 17 year old males are still trading baseball cards<br>and giving each other wedgies after gym class.  This is why high school<br>romances rarely work.<br><br><strong> HATS </strong><br>****<br>Women look good in hats; men look like idiots.<br><br><strong> GROCERIES </strong><br>*********<br>A woman knows how to shop for groceries.  She makes a list of the things she<br>needs, and then goes to the store and buys these things.  A man does not<br>shop on a frequent basis.  He waits until the only items left in his<br>refrigerator are an opened can of Schlitz and a half a lime.  Then he goes<br>grocery shopping.  A man buys everything that looks good.  By the time a man<br>reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett's<br>car on the Beverly Hillbillies.  Of course, this will not stop him from<br>going to the 10 items or less lane.<br><br><strong> MAGAZINES </strong><br>*********<br>Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked ladies. Women's magazines<br>also feature pictures of naked ladies.  This is because the female body is a<br>beautiful work of art, while the male body is lumpy and hairy and should no<br>be seen by the light of day.<br><br>Men are turned on at the sight of a naked woman's body. Naked men elicit<br>laughter from women.<br><br><strong> HANDWRITING </strong><br>***********<br>To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just<br>chickenscratch.  Women use scented, colored stationary, and they dot their<br>"i's" with circles and hearts.  Women use ridiculously large loops in their<br>"p's" and "g's."  It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman Even when<br>she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.<br><br><strong>COMEDY</strong><br>******<br>Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching television,<br>and an episode of the Three Stooges comes on.  Immediately, the men will get<br>very excited; they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the<br>actions of Curly, man's favorite stooge. The woman will roll their eyes and<br>groan and wait it out.<br><br><strong>BATHROOMS</strong><br>*********<br>A man has 6 items in his bathroom:  a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream,<br>a razor, a bar of Dial soap and a towel from a Holiday Inn.  The average<br>number of items in a typical American women's bathroom is 437.  A man would<br>not be able to identify most of these items.<br><br>Most men take only 2-3 minutes to relieve themselves. Women's Restrooms<br>always have long lines.<br><br><strong>GOING OUT</strong><br>*********<br>When a man says he is ready to go out, it means he is ready to go out.  When<br>a woman says she is ready to go out, it means she will be ready, as soon as<br>she finds her other earring, makes one phone call and finishes putting on<br>her makeup.<br><br><strong>CATS</strong><br>****<br>Women love cats.  Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men<br>kick cats.<br><br><strong>SHOES</strong><br>*****<br>When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then<br>slip in Reebok sneakers.  She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag<br>from Saks.  When a woman gets to work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five<br>minutes later she will kick them off because her feet are under the desk.  A<br>man will wear one pair of shoes for the entire day.<br><br><strong>LEG WARMERS</strong><br>***********<br>Leg warmers are sexy.  A woman, even if she's walking the dog or doing the<br>dishes, is allowed to wear leg warmers.  She can wear them any time she<br>wants.  A man can only wear leg warmers if he is auditioning for the<br>"Gimme the Ball" number in A Chorus Line.<br><br><strong>MIRRORS</strong><br>*******<br>Men are vain; they will check themselves out in the mirror.  Women are<br>ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface,<br>mirrors, spoons, store window, toasters, Joe Garagiola's head.<br><br><strong>MENOPAUSE</strong><br>*********<br>When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated<br>emotional, psychological, and biological changes.  The nature and degree of<br>these changes varies with the individual.  Menopause in a man provokes a<br>uniform reaction --- he buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap and<br>leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for a Porsche.<br><br><strong>THE TELEPHONE</strong><br>*************<br>Men see the telephone as a communication tool.  They use the telephone to<br>send short messages to other people.  A woman can visit her girlfriend for<br>two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they<br>will talk for three hours.<br><br><strong>OFFSPRING</strong><br>*********<br>Ah, children.  A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist<br>appointments and soccer games and romances and best friends and favorite<br>foods and hopes and dreams.<br><br><strong>LOW BLOWS</strong><br>*********<br>Let's say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on television.  One<br>of the figures is felled by a low blow.  The woman says, "Oh gee, that must<br>hurt."  The man doubles over and actually feels the pain.<br><br><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong><br>**********<br>If a woman is out driving, and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings,<br>she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions.  Men consider this to<br>be a sign of weakness.  Men will never stop and ask for directions.  Men<br>will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, "Looks<br>love I've found a new way to get there." and, "I know I'm in the general<br>neighborhood.  I recognize that White Hen store."<br><br><strong>ADMITTING MISTAKES</strong><br>******************<br>Women will sometimes admit making a mistake.  The last man who admitted he<br>was wrong was General George Custer.<br><br><strong>RICHARD GERE</strong><br>************<br>Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way.  Men hate<br>Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works at the<br>health club and dates only married women.<br><br><strong>DRESSING UP</strong><br>**********<br>A woman will dress up to:  go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage,<br>answer the phone, read a book, get the mail.  A man will dress up for:<br>weddings, funerals.<br><br><strong>NICKNAMES</strong><br>*********<br>With the exception of female body builders, who call each other names like<br>"Ultimate Pecs" and "Big Turk," women eschew the use of nicknames.  If<br>Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle get together for lunch, they will<br>call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah, and Michelle. But if Mike, Dirk,<br>Clint, and Jack go out for a brewski, they will affectionately refer to one<br>another as Bullet-Head, Godzilla, Peanut-Brain, and Useless.<br><br><strong>TOYS</strong><br>****<br>Little girls love to play with toys.  Then when they reach the age of 11 or<br>12, they lose interest.  Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As<br>they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and silly and<br>impractical.  Examples of men's toys:  little miniature TV's.  Car phones.<br>Complicated juicers and blenders.  Graphic equalizers.  Small robots that<br>serve cocktails on command.  Video games.  Anything that blinks, beeps, and<br>requires at least 6 "D" batteries to operate.<br><br><strong>PLANTS</strong><br>******<br>A woman asks a man to water her plants while she is on vacation.  The man<br>waters the plants.  The woman comes home five or six days later to an<br>apartment full of dead plants.  No one knows why this happens.<br><br><strong>MOUSTACHES</strong><br>**********<br>Some men look good with mustaches.  Those men are Tom Selleck and Burt<br>Reynolds.  There are no women who look good with mustaches.<br><br><strong>DAVID LETTERMAN</strong><br>***************<br>Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the Earth.<br>Women think he is a mean, semidorky guy who always has a bad haircut.<br><br><strong>CAMERAS</strong><br>*******<br>Men take photography very seriously.  They'll shell out $4000 for state of<br>the art equipment, and build dark rooms and take photography classes.  Women<br>purchase Kodak Instamatics.  Of course women always end up taking better<br>pictures.<br><br><strong>LOCKER ROOMS</strong><br>************<br>In the locker room men talk about three things:  money, football, and women,<br>They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they<br>think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.  Women talk about one<br>thing in the locker room -- sex.  And not in abstract terms, either.  They<br>are extremely graphic and technical, and they never lie.<br><br><strong>LAUNDRY</strong><br>*******<br>Women do the laundry every couple of days.  A man will wear every article of<br>clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were really hip about<br>eight years ago, before he will do the laundry.  When he is finally out of<br>clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatsuit inside out, rent a U-Haul and take<br>his mountain of dirty clothes to the Laundromat.  Men always expect to meet<br>beautiful women at the Laundromat, but this is only a myth perpetuated by<br>old reruns of Love American Style.<br><br><strong>POLITICS</strong><br>********<br>Men love to talk politics, but often they forget to do political things such<br>as voting.  Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedy's is<br>growing up and getting into politics because they will be able to campaign<br>for them and cry on election night.<br><br><strong>WEDDINGS</strong><br>********<br>When reminiscing about weddings women talk about "the ceremony."  Men talk<br>about "the bachelor party." CHEERLEADERS!!<br>Female cheerleaders are cute, sexy, fresh, and all American.  Male<br>cheerleaders are scary.<br><br><strong>SOCKS</strong><br>*****<br>Men are ambivalent about socks.  They wear argyle socks or standard white<br>sweatsocks.  Women wear strange socks.  Socks with pictures of clouds on<br>them.  Socks that are cut way below their ankles.  socks that have little<br>fuzzy balls on the back.<br><br><strong>GARAGES</strong><br>*******<br>Women use garages to park their cars and store their lawnmowers.  Men use<br>garages for many things.  They hang license plates in garages, and they<br>watch TV in garages, and they build useless lopsided benches in garages.<br><br><strong>MOVIES</strong><br>******<br>For women their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh<br>for the first time in Gone With the Wind.  For men it's when Jimmy Cagney<br>shoves grapefruit in may Clark's face in Public Enemy.<br><br><strong>NUDITY IN MOVIES</strong><br>****************<br>Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene.  This is<br>because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by a man.<br>The only actor who has ever appeared nude in the movies is Richard Gere.<br>This is another reason why men hate him.<br><br><strong>JEWELRY</strong><br>*******<br>Women look nice when they wear jewelry.  A man can get way with wearing one<br>ring and that's it.  Any more than that and he will look like a lounge<br>singer named Vic.<br><br><strong>THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE OF ALL</strong><br>************************************<br>Colored underwear.  Women are allowed, in fact encouraged, to wear colored<br>underwear.  There is no reason for a man to ever, ever, wear anything besides<br>solid white.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> PS: Thanks to Yen Lin for this... </span><br><br>------------------<br><strong> NOKIA.
