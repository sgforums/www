Or perhaps you can tok to him abt his army life...

If he doesn't, you better be on the alert that this relationship might fizzle out.<br><br>2) Change of interest. Guys would change perspective after some period of stress or incident (army is an eg.) If his view of life is changed and you are not in there, you better be ready for the possibility of a split soon.<br><br>I'm not kidding about this. Note Pt 1 above. That's very important. No matter what happens, a strong BGR would not run out of things to talk about or to do. TIredness is just an excuse. For guys, no matter how tired they are, for someone they like a lot, they would never give tiredness as an excuse. Only when there's a lack of passion will this happen.<br><br>(Imagine, if a guy likes football very much, but he's so darn tired after a long day's work that he would rather die than lift a finger, however, if he's told that there's a free tix for him to go to a match and the next day don't have to work (weekends), you think he would dismiss it and say 'No lah, can't move, too tired lah, don't think can go'??? I don't think so)<br><br>Lack of passion will deteriorate into a BGR split eventually.. so watchout!!!</div>
