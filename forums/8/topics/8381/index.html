I have absolutely no idea that modern youth feels that the only way to have a hot date is throught the extensive studying up of the Kamasutra. Anyway, it's more a source of entertainment for them. Beside, this book is considered to be a classic, abet in a different form. Hell, even Tao De Jing, the quessential book of Taoism, preaches on the proper way to have sex. And jolly, it's written by a male as well. Should we perhaps trash it and view it as man's dominated, sex crazed kind of thinking?!?!?!<br>Instead of condemming Kamasutra as a piece of trashy novel, why not learnt to  appreciate the classics behind it. Well, I believed there's more to sex in this book. If I am not wrong, it's about a relationship between a man and a woman, and how the woman entices the man throught the various means of sex. Anyway, this topic has inspired me to really read up on this topic, not because i am a sex crazed chauvinist maniac bent on imposing my hare brained idea of having sex "My Way"...but because there's a good yarn in all these hype up publicity.<br><br>By the way, I can't believe i am hearing this. If a woman truly enjoyed having sex, is she automatically branded a slut!?!!? Darn, no wonder all the gals i meet shudder at the word sex and swore that it's something exclusively associated with the male species. Ahem, aren't we at this age where women are entitled to have sex freely without the stigma with associated with it. And coming from a feminist advocate like you Trinity, frankly, I am surprised. By the way, guys liked to call gals sluts if they feels that they are exercising too much rights. Ditto for the gals too???<br><br>As for me reading up the book to please myself, ahem, I rather do something that is less strenous and spine-killing. After all, i believed sex is something i enjoyed at my own pace, not some bloody gymnastic excursion on the the bed.<br>And yeah, just my 2 cents worth of opinion.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mr Hata-san (edited 19 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr.Hata san<br>Thank you for resting your feet in my humble abode. Maybe let me do some clarification, slut hmm let me find the dictionary slut--sexually immoral woman. Hey I am not wrong then. it is a sexually immoral woman who enjoys sex or else who is it that she is called  immoral? Ok let me find the defination of immoral. Immoral--going against accepted standards of sexual behaviour. Ok, accepted standards of behavior which seems that the majority still prefers woman having a single partner to bed with..and the woman would be classified immoral if she were to sleep with other men..agree?<br><br>Even it might sound very common over the asia media or even in the media here (North America) that most of the young adults are basically "immoral" as they treat sex very lightly. This is entirely not true but the sitcoms made it so thus having an adverse effects on the teenagers especially that they should follow the so called Western cultures in order to be updated in whatsoever.<br><br>And I am definitely not a feminist though I sounded like one. I believe in equal rights but yet letting my man to know what is the rights belonging intrinsically to each of us and not abusing it. I do want my man to be intelligent as well but not trying to stifle me with his thoughts and we respect each other. Of course, squibbles here and there are in evitable but at the end of the day, we still enjoy ourselves regardless is it making out or surprise each other buying a gift. To us , sex is something sacred and not manipulative. Regardless if it is the kumasutra way or our way or even animalistic way...it is love making not just f***king like animals do...it is love and yes there is commitment and all.<br><br>It is just that if this Kamasutra is going to so called be a sex manual to 'guide' couples of better sex living...so be it. It might become one of another alternative to porn in the internet ...that might lead to a possible obsession in trying new ways to try on their sex partners. Well, just me and my hypothesis. But thanks for ur insights!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Trinity (edited 19 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>duh ...<br>so what do we have here ? well, i was registering, flipping thru, and saw this ... so i thought maybe my 5 cents worth.<br>well, kaRmasutra is not what trinity defines it as. as far as i am concerned, or rather what my material is concerned, kamasutra requires more than just physical action. it requires mental alert etc .. and anticipation. so maybe what trinity ought to do is to pick up a very credible kaRmasutra book and read it from page one to page Z AND READ IT WITHOUT PREJUDICE. i think people approach this book with a fair amount of anticipation ( no irony intended ). the horny ones anticipating sexual tintillation, the STRAIGHT people anticipating lots of satanic words etc ... well, i guess if u approach it with these undesirable ( again, no pun intended ) attitudes, u will come up with misintepreted and uninformed accusations. male chauvinism ? sexist ? well, does it not require 2 hands to clap ? a guy to have good intelligence but atthe end of the day, if he stays home to do household chores, what will our grand dames react ? eeeeaaaawww ! so unmacho ? where is the tie shirt etc ... what's with flower-sending and all the gentlemanly bull**** ? stop kidding urself. man only becomes chauinistic because it is a societal prerequisite<br><br>------------------<br>- i rest my case -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry if i sounded too offensive in the previous reply, but kamasutra is really informative. sex is not merely physical pleasure. i always regard sex as more intellectual than sexual. i have to admit though that i am still a virgin, but no, i am no holy chaste wierdo. i have been intimate, just no intercourse. u know what i mean ? it's not just about intercourse, and the boring old in and out concept. it's about seduction, how to play mind games, how to control and manipulate by not being domineering etc .... u get what i mean. and i forget too, how to breathe correctly. i am sure most people breathe the wrong way. what else ? meditation, and the study of anatomy too, which brings me to tantra sex ... now now ... we r getting some kind of a pic ? that's why i say these r complexand deep techniques which r very unfairly pushed aside as being "dirty". i admit i am still learning and will definitely not be ableto grasp what it is ALL about, but i will try ...<br><br>------------------<br>- i rest my case -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kamasutra was not meant to be a dirty sex manual. It was a piece of literature that teaches people how to enjoy one of the pleasures of life. It is more of a guide to making love. From the courting to dating and finally marriage and copulation.<br><br>Some of the ways do not apply as they are outdated. People avoid the book because the book touches on a taboo subject. In fact, the book tells people to be faithful. It is a guide to a happier life, really. A misunderstood piece of work.</div>
