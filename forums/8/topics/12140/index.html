            <div class='col-md body'>Electrical Engineering (EE)<br><br>What is EE?<br>It is an applied science, a study in some polytechnics and has<br>a profound influence on urban life.<br><br>What does it involve?<br>It starts off with power delivery, distribution, and also components,<br>systems and information technology.<br><br>How is it an applied science?<br>Alot of modern day products and devices uses electricity. How<br>they are safe and reliable involves design and economic usage of parts.<br>This is a role taken up by electrical engineers.<br><br>What does a study of EE involve?<br>Electrical Engineering graduates need to study<br>basic electrical circuits, electronics, design, power protection, PLCs<br>and mechanical interaction.<br><br>What does an electrical engineering project involve?<br>It could be a Programmable Logic Relay project or a electronics circuitboard<br>or a computer software or a product-material research/study.<br>The tools used could be statistics, interviews, and documentation.<br>The mode of presentation can involve website displays that show<br>'live' product performance.<br><br>What is PLC?<br>PLC stands for programmable logic controller. It is a tool<br>used to control traffic lights, MRT trains, robots, etc.<br>It is often linked with SCADA: Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition.<br>That is a tool often used in factories to supervise manufacturing processes.<br>Programs are written into the PLC machine through a PLC controller.<br>The machine then processes the program and shows the results.<br><br>Where is EE most profound?<br>It is a science that involves other disciplines. If we look at around us,<br>alot of our lifestyle is made possible through EE.<br><br>For eg. To have a proper apartment, materials must be made<br>to fit and proper for use in accordance with housing regulations.<br>The wires chosen must be of correct rating and the mechanical<br>parts(eg. armatures, housings, cableboxes) must fit exactly.<br><br>Their behaviour must relate to each other in such a way<br>that there is a form of 'distinguishment'. This distinguishment<br>is for safety purposes. Eg. Enough gap inside a socket-housing<br><br>Airconditioners are made through electrical and mechanical<br>eng. but are repaired by people well-versed in gases and fluids.<br><br>What skill is needed to understand EE?<br>Understanding of relationships of parts and how they<br>are presented to the user in a cautious way.<br><br>What is javascript?<br>It is a language used on web-browsers. It processes codes<br>written by programmers. Together with advance languages,<br>they can tell our computer what to do and what to display.<br><br>What has javascript got to do with PLC programming?<br>IMHO they are both the same in rules and methods.<br>Both involve a use of a dedicated device to process<br>the rules(PLC machine and the Browser).<br><br>Both involve the usage of rules to get<br>1) User variables/input<br>2) User expectations.<br><br>Whereas PLC programming/SCADA runs stored programs<br>to control remote lights, machines, sensors located far away, the same behaviour<br>goes for web-browsers: local browsers running codes stored<br>in servers and remote PCs in other countries.<br><br>Their only difference is that<br>1) PLC/SCADA serves the organisation requirements and is founded on "CONTROL"<br>2) Web-browsers/handheld netdevices serves the user interests and is founded on "FREEDOM"<br><br>Both are offsprings of EE.<br><br>How the two relate to each other is best found in<br>Space Satellites. There over 24 man-made satellites in outerspace rotating<br>around Earth. They deliver information to and fro. When a<br>satellite receives continental information, it activates its PLC program-turning<br>on or off the appropriate switches-then the signals are transmitted to another<br>continent. The local device(browser or monitor) thus presents the information.<br><br>Is there a possibility of a webbrowser running a server code to<br>activate: say my TV/RADIO/SHOWER and lights?<br>All this is very possible and is actually happening. Such a system is very expensive<br>but i think BILL GATES'S HOUSE got such a thing.<br><br>Is it profitable to sell such a system?<br>Unless it becomes a way of life, IMHO i think it would produce only marginal profits.<br><br>Foreseable benefits of JAVA cum PLC device:<br>1)Together with advance pollution control techniques, it would reduce AIR POLLUTION<br>2)and improve SAFETY<br><br>Benefits to URBAN society<br>1) Improved interaction among house-trapped citizens<br>2) Reduced traffice movement.<br>3) Demand of programming literacy will rise<br><br>How is EE related<br>to electronics eng.?<br>Electronics involve anything with<br>diodes, transistors, op-amps, they are<br>found in TVs, COMPUTERS, RADIOs.<br>EE focuses on INSTALLATION of utilities<br>and their INSURANCE of safety.<br><br>Liew Kian Boon, Lawrence - SINGAPORE<br><br></div>
