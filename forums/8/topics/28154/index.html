            <div class='col-md body'>A man is very ashamed of his "fly" because of the size. He has an extremely small "fly" and doesn't want his girlfriend to dump him when she sees the size.<br><br>One night when he and his girlfriend are making out in a dark corner he decides to show it to her. The man unzips his pants, whips out his small "fly", and shoves it into her hand.<br><br>He sits there impatiently waiting to see her reaction. His girlfriend says: "Thanks for offering, but I don't smoke."<br><br>**************************************************<br><br>Mr. Johnson got himself a new secretary. She was young, sweet, and very polite. One day while taking dictation, she noticed his fly was open. When leaving the room, she said: "Mr.Johnson, your barracks door is open."<br><br>He did not understand her remark, but later on he happened to look down and saw that his zipper was open. He decided to have some fun with his secretary.<br><br>Calling her in, he asked: "By the way Miss Jones, when you saw my barracks door was open this morning, did you also notice a soldier standing at attention?"<br><br>The secretary, who was quite witty replied: "Why, no sir,all I saw was a little disabled veteran sitting on two duffel bags."<br><br>**************************************************<br><br>This Red Indian boy goes to his mother one day with a puzzled look on his face. "Say,Mom," he asked, "why is my bigger brother named 'Mighty Storm'?"<br>"Because he was conceived during a mighty storm.",she replied. "Why is my sister named 'Corn Flower'?" "Well," his mother answered, "Your father and I were in a cornfield when we made her." "And why is my other sister called 'Moon Child'?" "We were watching the moon landing while she was conceived," the mother replied. The mother then asked the boy, "Tell me, Broken Rubber, why are you so curious?!"<br><br>**************************************************<br><br>Biology Lesson in Class<br><br>During a Biology class, the teacher asked the class: "Why is that during childhood, gals tend to grow taller than guys?"

            <div class='col-md body'>There was this little boy about 12 years old walking<br>down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a<br>string behind him. He came up to the doorstep of<br>a house of ill repute and knocked on the door.<br>When the Madam answered it, she saw the little<br>boy and asked what he wanted.<br><br>He said, "I want to have sex with one of the women<br>inside. I have the money to buy it, and I'm not<br>leaving until I get it."<br><br>The Madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in.<br>Once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked.<br>He asked, "Do any of the girls have any diseases?"<br>Of course the Madam said no.<br><br>He said, "I heard all the men talking about having to<br>get shots after making love with Lucy. THAT'S the<br>girl I want." Since the little boy was so adamant<br>and had the money to pay for it, the Madam told him<br>to go to the first room on the right.<br><br>He headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog<br>behind him. Ten minutes later he came back, still<br>dragging the frog, paid the Madam, and headed out<br>the door. The Madam stopped him and asked, "Why did<br>you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead<br>of one of the others?"<br><br>He said, "Well, if you must know, tonight when I get home,<br>my parents are going out to a restaurant to eat, leaving<br>me at home with a baby-sitter. After they leave, my<br>baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens<br>to be very fond of cute little boys.<br><br>She will then get the disease that I just caught. When Mom<br>and Dad get back, Dad will take the baby-sitter home. On<br>the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones,and he'll catch<br>the disease.<br><br>Then when Dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and<br>Mom will go to bed and have sex, and Mom will catch it. In<br>the morning when Dad goes to work, the Milkman will deliver<br>the milk, have a quickie with Mom and catch the disease,<br>and HE'S the son-of-a-bitch who ran over my FROG!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once upon a time in Singapore, there lived a happy<br>couple, Mr.&amp; Mrs.Ng with their 3 lovely daughters;<br>Elaine, Ena &amp; Ella. The 3 daughters were brought up in<br>a prim-and-proper way and when they reached 20,they<br>were still virgins. Years passed,and it was time to<br>get them married. So, the parents found them the most<br>suitable "leng chais" ( handsome guys). They got<br>married and were preparing to set-off on their honeymoon.<br><br>As 'concerned' parents, Mr. &amp; Mrs.Ng were curious about<br>their daughters' first-night experience. So, before the<br>daughters went on their respective honeymoons, Mrs. Ng<br>told them......" Your father and I want to know about your<br>1st night encounters and whether you are satisfied.<br>Write a letter to us, but as not to raise your husbands' curiosity...you all must use a code-name to describe your experiences". So, the excited daughters were off.<br><br>A week passed. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ng got the first letter. It was from<br>Elaine. They opened the letter and found the word STANDARD CHARTERED.They immediately took the newspaper and<br>looked for the Standard Chartered advertisement.<br><br>"Ah! here it is!", exclaimed Mr. Ng. The motto for Standard Chartered was....<br><br>"BIG, STRONG &amp; FRIENDLY" Mr &amp; Mrs. Ng were happy.<br><br>A week later, they got another letter. This time it was from Ena.<br>The content was simple. "NESCAFE". So, again they took the newspaper and looked for the Nescafe ad. "Ah! here it is.<br><br>'NESCAFE: PLEASURE TILL THE LAST DROP". Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ng<br>jumped in joy.<br><br>Another week passed. A month passed. And another.<br>There was still no letter from Ella.<br><br>The Ngs became worried.<br><br>Finally, the letter came. It was scribbled and could hardly be<br>read, but Mrs. Ng managed to figure it out. The code-name was "SINGAPORE AIRLINES". Why Singapore Airlines? Mr.Ng rushed to the nearest store and got a newspaper. He flipped<br>the pages frantically. "Ah! Here it is!" Mrs. Ng grabbed the<br>page and read aloud.<br><br>Before she could finish ...THUMP!!!...she fell off her chair. The motto was ...<br><br>"7 TIMES A WEEK. 4 TO 6 TIMES A DAY. NON-STOP".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened at Harvard University in October last year. In a biology class, the professor was discussing the high glucose levels found in semen, which gives the sperm all the energy for their journey.<br><br>A female freshman raised her hand and asked, "If I<br>understand you correctly, you're saying there is a lot of glucose, as in sugar, in semen?"<br><br>That's correct," responded the professor, going on to add statistical info.<br><br>Raising her hand again, she asked, "Then why doesn't it taste sweet?"<br><br>After a stunned silence, the whole class burst out laughing. The poor girl's face turned bright red, and as she realized exactly what she had inadvertently said (or rather implied), she picked up her books without a word and walked out of class, never to return.<br><br>However, as she was going out the door, the professor's reply was classic.<br><br>Totally straight-faced he answered her question. "It doesn't<br>taste sweet because the taste buds for sweetness are on the tip of your tongue and not the back of your throat. Have a good day".<br></div>
