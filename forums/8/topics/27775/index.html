            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I am very sad and depressed. Because I am I know that I would never able to sexually aroused by a girl. When I remember the past, I only recall that I have fall in love with 3 guys b4 (it is rather a one-directional thing, no relationship happens). I can also remember how my friends laugh at me for being so concern and caring for a guy. The worst is being reject and insulted by the one I care for.<br><br>The internet revolution has driven me deeper into the dark side (since 4 years ago), making me more "defined" in that way. I initially thought that I can surf porno for guys first and then turn to the girls later. But I was wrong, I can't change to girls later on. It was a very big mistake.<br><br>I have realized that there are lot ppl who r like me, with the same type of orientation. By chatting in some specific IRC rooms, I realize that the life style is not suitable for me. The people there are too cruel, go for sex and there is hardly any faithful and long term relationship. By the way, I am still a virgin, never engage sex with a guy nor a girl b4 (no even oral or anything)<br><br>So I have determined to change. But the past has become my biggest fear and worry. I don't want to cheat a girl. I don't know whether I am using this as an excuse to cover up or anything, but I just know that that abnormal lifestyle is certainly not suitable for me. I prefer to live in a normal life style. But I just dunno how to face it. Or perhaps I should just stay single for my whole life.<br><br>I don't know whether I should go and start a relationship with a girl. I don't know whether I can keep this thing forever secretly. Really hope to find someone who can understand my problem and accept who I am, and deal it together. The fear of being dumped or rejected by a girl is also a big worry.<br><br>Please help me! If you are a girl, will u accept ur bf to have a past like me? What should I do? I don't want to stay single because it is very lonely. I know that I can love a girl emotionally, but sexually will be a challenging issue.<br><br>Thanks.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...<br><br>you can start by going out more with your female friends. Talk to females more. If you can't do it , don't force yourself. Take it slowly.<br><br>you talk about your friends laughing at you? Well, all i can say is FUCK THEM ( sorry about that ) cause true friends will NEVER make fun of you cause of your sexual orientation.<br><br>from what i see, you are still not so deep into that orientation. You mentioned that you dont wanna cheat any girls? Thats good, but dont go into relationship with them as YET. as i said earlier, go out with them more and understand how girls think and feel ( even though its kinda tough but at least its something )<br><br>good to know you are trying to change! remember, it takes time to change! You go fight the power dude!</div>
