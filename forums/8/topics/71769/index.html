Will you donate your sperm or egg?</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Supplies are dwindling or non-existent at hospitals here; for couples desperate to have a baby, the wait can be up to 2 years<br><br>By Wong Sher Maine<br><br>MARTHA'S periods stopped when she was 16 because she had no more eggs in her ovaries.<br><br>When she got married at 25, she cried over the fact that she would have to take eggs from a donor if she wanted to have children. But two years ago, the secretary decided that was the only way to go.<br><br>Then she was told by Singapore General Hospital that there were no donors and she would have to wait.<br><br>'It didn't occur to me that there would be no eggs. I just assumed that when I needed them, I'd be able to get them,' said Martha, now 29, who declined to use her real name for the interview.<br><br>Now, she is worried that by the time her turn comes, she will have problems carrying the baby to term due to her age.<br><br>Both the supplies of eggs and sperm for infertile couples like Martha and her husband are dismal and their frustration is growing.<br><br>There are three egg and sperm banks here: at KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH), and at the National University (NUH) and Singapore General (SGH) hospitals.<br><br>Both SGH and the KKH are out of eggs and have waiting lists of 10 women and nine women, respectively.<br><br>At SGH, only two women donated eggs last year and the average waiting time for an egg there is two years.<br><br>The figures for donated sperm are not much better.<br><br>At SGH, the number of couples needing sperm each year over the last five years has ranged from 14 to 28, but the number of donors fell from 20 in 1992 to just three last year.<br><br>The hospital's sperm bank supplies, which can be stretched as one donor's sperm can be used to father up to three live births, will dry up within the next three years if more donors do not come forward.<br><br>A gynaecologist, who declined to be named, said: 'It's simply not in our culture for someone to step forward and donate his sperm.'<br><br>KKH had just one donor in 2000, two in 2001 and five in 2002. The hospital currently has 11 couples on its waiting list and no sperm.<br><br>They will have to wait for up to one year before they have a shot at conception through donor sperm.<br><br>Figures were not available from NUH.<br><br>The problem is more acute for those who require donor eggs as the procedure for obtaining them involves the donor undergoing hormone injections to stimulate production, plus surgery to remove them.<br><br>So the hospitals have encouraged these women to bring in their own donors, usually sisters or good friends, so they do not have to wait.<br><br>They have also tried getting some women who are undergoing in-vitro fertilisation - in which their own eggs are used, but fertilisation is carried out externally by doctors - to donate some of the 10 to 15 eggs harvested to the egg bank.<br><br>'Since we take out so many, we usually appeal to these women. Some say yes,' said Dr Julianah Abu, an SGH obstetrician and gynaecologist who runs the sperm bank there.<br><br>For most of those in need of such help, however, things are not expected to change for some time.<br><br>Others, like Martha, are preparing themselves for the fact that, even if they do get to the front of the queue, it does not mean the procedure will be successful. In fact, they may never bear a child.<br><br>She has already started scouring the telephone directory for the names of adoption agencies.<br><br>'This is my last resort. I just can't bear the thought of not having a child to bring up and love,' she said.<br><br>SPERM DONATION<br><br># A DONOR must be between 18 and 40 years old.<br><br># He writes down his medical history and indicates if his family has a history of any diseases.<br><br># He gives the hospital a sperm sample, which he can collect at home and deliver within the hour, or produce in the hospital. He has to abstain from sex for two days before giving the sample.<br><br># The sperm is assessed by doctors to determine whether it is healthy.<br><br># If it is, the donor goes through physical and psychological examinations, where he is interviewed so doctors can make sure he is donating sperm for the right reasons.<br><br># He undergoes blood tests to make sure he is free from diseases like Aids and hepatitis B.<br><br># He returns to the hospital to give another three to four sperm samples.<br><br># He gets a token sum of $150 from the hospital.<br><br># Six months later, he turns up for blood tests to make sure he is still free from diseases. If he passes these, then his sperm is deemed usable.<br><br>* Information from the SGH Centre for Assisted Reproduction<br><br>EGG DONATION<br># THE donor must be between 18 and 35 years old.<br><br># She writes down her medical history and indicates if her family has a history of any diseases.<br><br># She goes through physical and psychological examinations, where she is interviewed so doctors can make sure she is donating eggs for the right reasons.<br><br># She undergoes blood tests to make sure she is free from diseases like Aids and hepatitis B.<br><br># She undergoes counselling by the doctors so she is fully aware of what she will be put through.<br><br># For two to four weeks, she needs daily hormone injections to stimulate her ovaries so more than one egg will ripen. She can learn to inject herself or go to the hospital every day to get it done. The side effects of these jabs: bloatedness, nausea and mood swings.<br><br># She goes through an operation, while under sedation, where an ultrasound probe with a fine needle at the end is inserted into her vagina and into her ovaries.<br><br># About 10 eggs are extracted.<br><br># She gets a token sum of $150 from the hospital.<br><br># Six months later, she turns up for blood tests to make sure she is still free from diseases.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wanted: Eggs for the infertile<br>By Wong Sher Maine </strong><br><br>HOW do you react when a friend asks for your eggs?<br><br>Do you feel angry, flabbergasted or honoured?<br><br>At that moment, all I could feel was sympathy and some guilt.<br><br>As I sat facing her, 32 weeks' pregnant with my accidental first child, my 30-something-year-old friend told me how she had no eggs to speak of.<br><br>How she had cried for an hour in the doctor's room when she was told at the age of 18 that her two years of missed periods would go on forever.<br><br>She also told me how she had always wanted to have children because she simply loved them.<br><br>Now, after getting hitched to a man who loves her despite her condition, she has been in the queue for eggs at a local hospital for nearly two years.<br><br>As her annual calls to the hospital have yielded replies of 'Sorry, the queue has not moved', she is increasingly despondent and cynical.<br><br>'Who knows? I may have to wait 20 years before I get an egg,' she says.<br><br>She could jump queue if she brought in a donor, but the one woman she asked turned her down.<br><br>She does not want to adopt a child because she wants at least half of the child's genetic material to come from her husband.<br><br>Her husband laments: 'All the Government's attention and money is focused on trying to persuade those who refuse to have children, but can, to have them. What about people like us?<br><br>'We are desperate for children but we can't.'<br><br>Doctors estimate that one in five couples here have problems with their reproductive hardware.<br><br>These are not limited to older couples; there are increasing numbers of those in their 20s.<br><br>If they could all have children, Singapore could easily have its 50,000 live births a year.<br><br>These couples are probably keeping mum because they are too ashamed to talk about it, much less start a campaign to advertise their plight.<br><br>But the infertile do deserve policy attention, and one key area is cost.<br><br>In-vitro fertilisation, in which the woman's egg is fertilised with her husband's sperm externally before it is implanted in her womb, is costly, at $8,000 to $9,000 a pop.<br><br>Couples have to try several times before a successful pregnancy is achieved.<br><br>The Government allows claims from Medisave of up to $4,000 per treatment cycle, for up to three cycles. That adds up to more than $10,000 for the couple.<br><br>If the Government is willing to pump in $200 million a year to give women an extra two months' maternity leave at full pay, why not consider giving more financial help to infertile couples - especially those who may have given up the idea of fertility treatment because of cost?<br><br>There is also the suggestion to allow Central Provident Fund savings to be used for infertility treatments, a reasonable suggestion given that parents can already use their CPF to finance their children's university education.<br><br>Like education, children are an investment in the future.<br><br>Apart from money, couples who are having difficulty conceiving need more avenues they can turn to for help.<br><br>Medical fertility clinics cater to couples who are already aware that they have a biological problem.<br><br>But how about those who are unsure?<br><br>Groups like the Family Life Society and Alife are non-profit volunteer-run outfits which offer non-medical advice to couples, like how to time sexual intercourse to coincide with the woman's ovulation periods.<br><br>It may seem overly simple, but since a quiet opening in June last year, Alife has had a success rate of 16 couples among the more than 100 couples its volunteers counselled.<br><br>That is another 16 precious babies for Singapore's dwindling pool, from cheap and fuss-free interven- tion.<br><br>As for those couples who have more complex problems, like those requiring sperm or egg donations, perhaps the only thing that can help is to encourage more people to donate. But even that is difficult as it comes fraught with ethical issues.<br><br>The Singapore General Hospital, for instance, proposed to attract sperm donors last year by giving additional perks like free medical check-ups, but failed to get funding for what was seen as an incentive.<br><br>In the end, whether donors respond is a personal choice.<br><br>For me, in my own way, I reckon what I can do to help at least one infertile couple is to donate my eggs.<br><br>I have not decided.<br><br><strong>The writer is with the Newsdesk's community beat.</strong><br></div>
