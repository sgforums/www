We are a multi racial society and we have to be considerate towards one another.<br><br>Actually it is recommended for the safety of your pets that they be kept in carriers when they're being transported in vehicles, and the carrier safely secured by a seat belt. There are many different types of carriers at pet shops these days for dog lovers to choose from (I usually look at small ones coz I have little ones). From personal experience my pets have actually found their carriers to be their "safe haven", especially when I bring them out to unfamiliar surroundings and to their vet! They snuggle in there with their pillows and favourite stuffed toy and nothing in their behaviour indicates they find it a prison of any kind.  When I leave the carrier on the floor at home, someone's bound to be snuggled in there, sometimes even smuggling an additional toy in <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Caging a dog is actually good for the dog in certain occasions. For example, when you are frightened and introduced to a situation you may not like, you will generally want to feel comfort in the form of physical security. A dog's cage can act like that.<br><br>It's called a crate, to be more politically correct. My dogs' crates are generally for them to relax in when people who are afraid of them visit me. When I punish my dogs, I never punish them while they are in the crate because that place is where I want them to recognize as a place of security, comfort and their own 'pad' if you want to call it. It is like a bedroom for them where I will not enter with anything but good or essential intentions.<br><br>It's not unfair, it's actually humane when you think about it. Imagine if a dog greets a person over enthusiastically and you punish it by throwing your dog into his/her crate; that's being unfair. By using a crate correctly, you make your dog feel secure and safe in unfamiliar situations.<br><br>Think about it, when animals sleep in the wild, where do they sleep? In the wide open space where predators can jump on them? Or a cozy and safe place to bed down for the night?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh for god sake dogs have help us in every way they can. whos the one sniffing for bombs in airports and important functions? whos the one that stays wif you however bad you treat it? whos the one that never even thinks of betraying you?<br><br>i rmb a few years ago i carried my dog in a doggy BAG (My dog is Jack Russell, can squeeze into a bag designed for dogs and carry it ard) and i simply entered a Popular bookshop. Then this muslim woman saw the dog moving inside the bag and make such a big fuss out of it that she even called the security guard. unfortunately, the security guard is OSO a muslim. sheesh. chased me all the way out of the shopping mall. wth i had even taken my dog out for a walk inside another shopping centre and ppl dun mind. while walking on the streets of orchard we often passed by muslims and they dun mind, even laughing at the clothes my dog wears. they din even try to avoid it (Even though i try not to let my dog get in contact wif them). seems that teenage muslims dun really mind it much<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by philia:</div><div class="quote_body">Dogs are dirty.

            <div class='col-md body'>dirty and unclean are two different meanings.<br><br>many animals and including humans beings are can be really dirty when due bad hygiene. etc, no bath,<br><br>"unclean" is a different meaning all together and is discriminatory.<br><br>so in this case you mention dirty , it has nothing to do with religious or race.  there are many dirty (unhygiene), distraction or safety reasons why sometimes animals are not allowed in taxi's,  buses, or coffeshops or many places.  these are not discriminary reasons.<br><br>dogs are good guide for disabled persons, and can take taxi's if handled well subject to discretion of drivers.<br><br></div>
