Race threats are a definite no no and should be reported.<br><br>but its only a very small group that cannot compromise.  these grps ,regarless of race or religion, are the anti social troublemakers that wants their ways.  you can spot them very easily.  one the most common rebutters they use is accuse others of racist.  they can say it, means they are one of them.<br><br>so anyone encounter being called racists for your authority actions or even casual race remarks, just take note they are trying to put you down and should be reported to higher authority.  its a criminal defame.<br><br>its the same with making female remarks, it does not make a man MCP, or should it be punished and jailed.<br><br>sometimes, it may be due to wealth and status in live or have money or no money thing. or even jealousy.<br><br>we all do get all kinds of race remarks, jokes and so on everyday, we just take it as a passing thing and know we are all different and think differently.<br><br></div>

My Jack Russell did that too (female) by showing signs of protectiveness, growling when my maid approached her sleeping area, and sometimes eliminating outside of her toilet area. She did this occassionally for a month or two then stopped doing it when I was unrelenting on issues like aggression and toilet training.<br><br>In fact I have a new 5 month old female lab and though they're not really into the rank and order thing, it's difficult getting her to understand my JRT is the top ranked dog under the humans in our house, simply because of the differences in physical size haha..<br><br>But I love JRTs, great dogs, got to be real firm with them though. They have this somewhat funny tendency of thinking they're a 150kg dog when they're less than 15kg.. Mine intimidated the !@#$%^ out of a full grown German Shepherd when I took her for a walk the first day. They also don't seem to like other dogs as much as humans..</div>
