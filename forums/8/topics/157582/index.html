You don't see dogs licking themselves all over to scrape off dirt then cough up a hairball later (cat). Neither do you see a dog wallowing in mud to cool off (hippo). I've got 3 dogs and they only have their tongues out when they have been exercised rigorously. It is their way of cooling off, not a way for them to indulge in a hobby of dirt collection.<br><br>Humans sweat when they are hot and I doubt the sweat's that clean either.<br>Human skin also contains natural moistness and is in constant contact with the air. I think we can safely presume that a dog running through 30 feet of a cave untouched by humans is much cleaner than a person walking through 30 feet of an underground enclosed carpark. Dogs are naturally clean animals that do not eliminate where they sleep. Since when have you found a dog in the wild that is sleeping in an area littered with its own faeces?<br><br>On the taxi issue, if the taxi is properly air conditioned and the dog did not exert a great amount of energy in order to get into it, I doubt the dog will pant so much in order to drip saliva onto the seat, unless the dog has not been properly socialized to different situations, in which panting can result from nervousness, similar to that of when humans can sweat when nervous. Besides, the next person can always just wipe it over with a tissue or something before sitting on it. Don't forget the person before you at the food court may have split something with pork on the seat. It may or may not be visible.<br><br>I'm not blaming you for what you've been bound though, I always make sure my dogs do not approach anyone with no willingness to be approached and they are well known in the neighborhood to the extent that my cocker spaniel has played ball fetching with Muslim kids before using leaves and plastic bags to touch and throw the ball instead. In fact I have an ex girlfriend who's Muslim and she has 2 dogs too.</div>

That's one of the worse things you can do, as it just makes the dog want to chase you.<br><br>I think your teacher needs professional help if he has a true phobia of sausages. Does he really get agitated and experiences real and excessive fear or is it just something that makes him avoid it? Think you gotta tell him that word of mouth has also haunted my BMT company line, SOC grounds and field camp terrain. I've yet to see a woman wearing a red dress with long flowing hair waiting to suck my blood dry though.<br><br>Irrelevant question: Ever been licked by a cat? It's like getting wiped with sandpaper.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talk about dogs, I still miss my Pomerarian who have died of old age.  She is a great companion to our family.  When we are sad, dogs sense it and is kind to comfort us.  When we are coming home, dogs intuition tells her to wait at the door.  Dogs has their own personlity too.  It is a very intelligent animal.  Dogs can be toilet trained too.  My mum's neighbour's cat poops and pee  everywhere along the corridor.  I saw cats clean themselves by licking all over themselves.  I don't know what to say, but are cats cleaner than dogs?  To me all animals are prescious and the same.  Fish, snakes, dogs, cats, sharks, lions, hamsters all alike.</div>
