            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.....I have a dog and I love dogs.....I understand that some people do not like dogs either because of their religious beliefs or other reasons. I simply try to be mindful, for example when I walk with the dog I try not to let him walk too close to people. He walk pass with a good distance from people.<br><br>I think it's difficult for religious followers especially, to change their view of dogs. It's because it's a religious teaching. And so sometimes, although i have a heavy heart, I accept that some people in this world have a different belief which happen to include a specifics on dogs. They are decent people like you and me, like any dog lovers, and some of them could be animal lovers who have fish, or cat, or other pets at home. These are the very same people who would have had a dog if their religious belief doesn't have a specifics on dogs. But we have to face a fact that it's in the teaching, and so, they are just doing what they are believing.<br><br>I don't know about the taxi and restaurant thing, I think it won't be implemented as a formal rule. It's too trivial. I mean, as a formal law. I don't think Indonesia or Malaysia has a formal law officially regulating about that, much less will Singapore. If Singapore adopts formal regulation on that, it's way too strict, way too trivial, and veer too closely to a religion-based belief of a minority. Singapore is a secular country with secular laws. Heck, Singapore even dare to build casino against all the religions here. Singapore is not like that, it will probably be a ST-Forum talk only. I doubt anything will change in everyday's life too.<br><br>Personally I just want to ask a question to Muslims here, what's the source       of the believe that dogs are unclean? Is it taught by Prophet Muhammad, or one of his disciples, or even later, like several centuries later, by one of the Muftis? Is it explicitly written in the Qur'an, and if so, who wrote it?<br><br>Im asking coz I wonder if it's possible it's just some interpretations from some of the religious leaders and writers. As it happens with all the religions in this world. Pardon for my ignorance. And, if a Grand Mufti someday announce dogs are not unclean, due to new scientific studies, will it be accepted?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are right. There appears to be differing views about dogs among Islamic scholars (see: http://www.islamicconcern.com/dogs.asp)<br><br>However, I do not think it is right for us to tell Muslims how to live their religion, when we are not Muslims ourselves. Many of us may prefer a more secular, less fundamental view of religion but that is precisely what religious people are most worried about. Any attempt to force people, whether Christians or Muslims, to re-interprete their holy books is not only self-defeating but dangerous as it creates a backlash and allows extremist teachings to creep in. Certainly it is right for the Muslim community to consider such issues in the light of differing Islamic traditions but we should keep out of it.<br><br>I will also not say that these rules are made by man. Muslims and Christians alike believe every word of their holy books was given by God and to suggest otherwise is insulting to their respective religions.<br><br>I am not Muslim myself but I have many Muslim friends from different Islamic backgrounds. I try not to even drink in front of my Muslim friend from Iran during this period of Ramadan whilst I had accepted an invitation to tour Cambridge with a female Muslim friend from Turkey. The practice of their religion does vary just as they are strict vegetarian Buddhists and those that enjoy satay with us.<br><br>Transportation of pet dogs is not a big issue in the big picture. I am a dog lover myself but I think we have alternatives. Muslims who believe in following the religious teachings they have been brought up with do not.<br><br></div>

My Jack Russell did that too (female) by showing signs of protectiveness, growling when my maid approached her sleeping area, and sometimes eliminating outside of her toilet area. She did this occassionally for a month or two then stopped doing it when I was unrelenting on issues like aggression and toilet training.<br><br>In fact I have a new 5 month old female lab and though they're not really into the rank and order thing, it's difficult getting her to understand my JRT is the top ranked dog under the humans in our house, simply because of the differences in physical size haha..<br><br>But I love JRTs, great dogs, got to be real firm with them though. They have this somewhat funny tendency of thinking they're a 150kg dog when they're less than 15kg.. Mine intimidated the !@#$%^ out of a full grown German Shepherd when I took her for a walk the first day. They also don't seem to like other dogs as much as humans..</div></blockquote>My JRT is 5,2 kg and he thinks he is the lion. He doesn't move from my side, even right now sleeping on my knees. And yes, they think they are high in the rank. Mine was doing anything poossible and impossible to sleep with me in bed at night, was scrathing the door and crying, nothing helped. If I wanted to sleep at night, I had to let him sleep with me in my bed, else he would be scratching the door and crying the whole night. Now it's impossible to get him out of the bed when I am there. On the other hand, if I would sleep on the floor, he would sleep beside me, so it's not the cosy bed but it's me what he wants. He is very attached to me.</div>
