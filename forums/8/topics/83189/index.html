            <div class='col-md body'>My relationship with my father cannot say bad but cannot say good also. We just don't communicate much. I don't know how to talk to him and he don't know how to talk to me.<br><br>We used to get along very very well one but for no reason at all recent years our relationship not that good already. Perhaps its part of the growing up phase. Nowadays, I even have difficulty calling him "Daddy." During normal days we only communicate we times a day. During, breakfast, lunch and dinner where he calls me go and eat and I reply with an "O."<br><br>I can't say for sure whether I like or hate my father. Its like he has a split personality. When we are at home, he is quiet and agrees to our every request and when we go out he will buy me anything I want as long as he has the money but when he goes drinking, may I emphasize on the word DRINKING with his friends. Its chaos at night, he'll go on ranting and ranting about his problems and even other people problems that does not concern him. The next morning he wakes up, he'll have a cranky attitude. The worse thing is he goes drinking once a week now, it used to be almost 7 days a week.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mine dad is not the type who can handle kids, young time don't communicate much with him. Only when I am older then we became much closer. He worked permanent night shift and for sure afternoon he will be at home sleeping or doing housework. The days I spent most time with him should be my ns days where I need to perform fix rotating shift (including night shift) and would be at home during afternoon with him. During my rest day which falls on weekday, I would be at home with him only. He can cook great dishes which really suit my taste. He is the type who don't interfere with my personal things, never pressure me on my studies, never bother the type of jobs I go for. Even come to r/s he also never make any comment. Perhaps he is the type who let me lead my own life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my dad is very caring..pampers me alot and often help me do things as if i am a child. i tried to reject his offer to help and he does understands. Due to his working schedule..we seldom really talk much but once a week during his off day will go breakfast with him and spend more time talking with him. our relationship is quite good and can say he does carry his duty as a dad well... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
