We watch shows together and he laughs at all my jokes etc. Actually my father is not my father, but he is more of my friend. He also thinks so, when i was young he told me not to regard him as a father, but as a friend, coz he doesn't like this "father" term, prolly coz his father was very cruel to him. He's very honest and tells me to be candid too about my opinions, he supports my creative works and is very liberal, perhaps him being liberal may be considered by local standards as irresponsible, well i seem to have turned out well.<br><br>I do have 1 regret though, is that i do not really KNOW much about my father as in what he went through etc etc. But we get along VERY WELL.<br><br>On the contrary, my rs with my mum is AWFUL, both me and my dad dont really like her coz she's a bit cranky.</div>
