At the last minute, the wife decides she wants to serve snails and sends her husband to the beach with a bucket to get them.<br><br>While collecting snails on the beach, the husband meets a beautiful woman who strikes up a conversation and asks him back to her beach house. He spends the night with her and in the morning heads home with his bucket of snails.<br><br>All the way home, he ponders what to tell his wife. As he climbs the stairs to his beach house, he trips and spills the snails all over the steps.<br><br>Just then his furious wife appears at the door. He looks up at her, smiles, and says merrily "Good morning." He then turns towards the snails and says: "Come on now, we're almost there."<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A married couple went to the hospital together to have their baby delivered. Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to<br>the father. He asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it.<br><br>The doctor set the knob to 10 percent for starters, explaining that even 10 percent was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. But as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine, so he asked the doctor to go ahead and bump it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20 percent pain transfer.<br><br>The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and pulse and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this, they decided to try for 50 percent.<br><br>The husband continued to feel quite well. Since it was obviously helping out his wife considerably, he encouraged the doctor to transfer ALL the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain.<br><br>She and her husband were ecstatic.<br><br>When they got home, the mailman was dead on their porch.<br><br></div>

When he got to the Red Sea, he had his engineers build a pontoon bridge and all the people walked across safely. Then he used his walkie - talkie to radio headquarters for reinforcements. They sent bombers to blow up the bridge and all the Israelites were saved."<br><br>"Now, Joey, is that really what your teacher taught you?" his mother asked.<br><br>"Well, no, Mom. But if I told it the way the teacher did, you'd never believe it!"<br><br></div>

After an hour of gathering up his courage he finally goes over to her and asks, tentatively, "Um, would you mind if I chatted with you for a while?"<br><br>She responds by yelling, at the top of her lungs, "No, I won't sleep with you tonight!" Everyone in the bar is now staring at them.<br><br>Naturally, the guy is hopelessly and completely embarrassed and he slinks back to his table. After a few minutes, the woman walks over to him and apologizes. She smiles at him and says, "I'm sorry if I embarrassed you. You see, I'm a graduate student in psychology and I'm studying how people respond<br>to embarrassing situations."<br><br>To which he responds, at the top of his lungs, "What do you mean $200?"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A dying man gathered his Lawyer, Doctor and Clergyman at his bed side and handed each of them an envelop containing $25,000 in cash. He made them each promise that after his death and during his repose, they would place the three envelops in his coffin.<br><br>He told them that he wanted to have enjoy the next life. A week later the man died.<br><br>At the Wake, the Lawyer and Doctor and Clergyman, each concealed an envelop in the coffin and bid their old client and friend farewell.<br><br>By chance, these three met several months later. Soon the Clergyman, feeling guilty, blurted out a confession saying that there was only $10,000 in the envelop he placed in the coffin.<br><br>He felt, rather than waste all the money, he would send it to a Mission in South America. He asked for their forgiveness. The Doctor, moved by the gentle Clergymans sincerity, confessed that he too had kept some of the money for a worthy medical charity. The envelop, he admitted, had only $8000 in it. He said, he too could not bring himself to waste the money so frivolously when it could be used to<br>benefit others.<br><br>By this time the Lawyer was seething with self-righteous outrage. He expressed his deep disappointment in the felonious behavior of two of his oldest and most trusted friends. I am the only one who kept his to our dying friend. I want you both to know that the envelop I placed in the coffin contained the full amount. Indeed, my envelop contained my personal check for the entire $25,000.<br><br></div>

Do you want to have some Fun?"<br><br>"That's terrible!", the priest exclaimed, "But I have a solution to your problem. Bring your two talking female parrots over to my house and I will put them with my two male talking parrots who I have taught to pray and read the Bible, then my parrots will teach your parrots to stop saying that terrible phrase and your female parrots will learn to pray and worship."<br><br>"Thank you" said the lady.<br><br>So the next day, the lady brings her female parrots to the priest's house.

This is because one of the men has<br>a son who is a flaming, out-of-the-closet homosexual, and the other men don't want to make him feel bad.<br><br>One week, however, the man with the gay son is late to the country club, so the other three are sitting around the table and inevitably start talking about their sons.<br><br>"My son the Mercedes salesman," says one, "has been doing so well lately that last week, he tells me, he gave a friend of his a brand new Benz!"<br><br>"Ah, that's nothing," says the second one, "My son, the marina owner, has been so successful lately that last week he gave one of his friends a brand new speedboat!"<br><br>"My son," says the third, "has done so exceptionally well in the real estate market, that last week he gave a friend of his a whole HOUSE!"<br><br>Just then the fourth man walks in and says, "You know, I never thought my son would amount to anything. But then, just last week, his three lovers gave him a new Mercedes, a speedboat and a house''<br></div>
