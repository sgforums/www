              <p>2) Organising media events will cost the company money - what returns are they looking for from these events?  Are they setting performance measures, and if so, do you think you can meet them?  What are the consequences if you can't?</p>
              <p>Frankly, if they're going to offer a fresh grad the position of setting up a new department, there's one of two possibilities:</p>
              <p>1) You've impressed the God-honest fuck outta them</p>
              <p>2) They're a chickenshit outfit who couldn't find their arses with both hands</p>
              <p>In you position, I'd ask a few questions about what they're looking to get out of this, and based upon the vagueness of their answers, decide for yourself if they think you're that good or if they don't have the slightest idea of what they're doing.  Your choice ought to be obvious then.</p>
              <p>Personally, in your position I'd go for it, but then again, I's a sucker for punsighment and if I don't know what to do, I know enough people to find out anyway.  Have you got the contacts and/or the inclination to do that?</p>

              <p>Hi There,</p>
              <p>It will take you guts and a lot of street-wise to take up this job. However, I would say that you give it a shot and see how far u can push yourself. My gut is that your pay is properly soso to bad but such jobs teach you to be independent and strong.</p>
              <p>Depending on the size of the events, it may actually not be so difficult. Not to forget, in this technological age, you aren't really alone. The internet is a great place to seek all kinds of help.</p>
              <p>However, if you do progress, talk terms to the boss because small companies especially local ones likes to "eat" freshies.</p>

              <p>hey all..thanks for your replies. the company is a pretty popular one, not a small company in which i can afford to fool around with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the pay is average marketing pay and the way i see it, i'll have to work 2 to 3 times as hard here, as compared to marketing in another company FOR THE SAME KIND OF PAY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is it even worth it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by the way, marketing is an incredibly over-rated job, long hours, not much pay. i'm rethinking this position.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>they are pretty much in a hurry to set up a marketing department. imagine this: they even told me i didnt have to bring anything for the interview.</p>
