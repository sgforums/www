              <p>I've got a friend who survived at her company for near to 2 years .. her starting pay was crap. but she went ahead for the exposure the company gave. It depends on you. sometimes the job is shit, but you got to justify if it gives you any benefit on paper. for your case, I think it'll be something good to write on the resume..</p>

              <p>By saying that, it showed that you are un-initiated, and do not fancy challenges. Whether you have text book knowledge is not important cos with blaine and passhione, you can actually make it happen.</p>
              <p>I'm a marketeer leading a small team for a big firm for years but I do not have former nor professional training...read, think, and open your eyes and ears.</p>
              <p>You do know that you have the opportunity to do great things...or mess up. I'm not too worried abt the messing up bit cos IF your boss is sound, he/she will lead you along....many would die for such opportunity.</p>
