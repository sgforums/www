            <div class='col-md body'>This film was highy controversial because it is about the life stories of  some<br>high profile personalities of yesteryear Indian cinema.<br><br>Such an Indian film was never made again.<br><br>It is a retro- Indian film in modern times trying to replicate the yesteryear black and white Indian movies. Unique because it shows a lot of research into India's post independnce times, the cinema industry of those times and the famous personalities  with  a narcissitic and depressive bleak feel throughout the film<br>Some scenes will make u think about the ideas of fame, death and emotions.<br><br>A kind of socio-commentary with a storyline. Btw it is based on true facts in history. be prepared to sit thru a 2 hours and 45 mins film. Nobody appreciated this film when it was released because it was far ahead of times. The audience was not ready for that kind of film aethestic.<br>If my memory is correct, this film is talked about years after its release, dissected and studied by international film critics till today and shown all around the world in film fests.<br><br>It was a box office failure but a critical success worldwide in the art film category</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://img462.imageshack.us/img462/4969/hb12425xp.jpg"><br>fter seeing this i am rejoiced because this movie has got one the best songs in indian cinema. anyway my 1st post this will be. I can recall it.<br><br>The movie came out in 1997. It is about the life stories about the late MGR actor turned politician and the present Karunanidhi, minister in India. The part played by Aishwarya Rai is the present Chief minister of South India - Mdm Jayalalitha. She was a ysteryear actress of fame and popularity<br>The characters shown and their real life counterpart still around in India today all except for the late MGR. Parts of the movie are shown in black and white (no colours) to celebrate the heydays of Indian cinema in the 1950s-60s<br>The songs are most unique i heard. Because the songs are like retro-songs.Sound is clear like a CD but it has all the sound effects of the old "vinyl or gramaphone" old songs with todayÂ’s sound quality and usage of instruments and overall composition and it should have the essence of 50Â’s music.<br><br>If you ever wondered what is Aishwarya's First movie. Dashing and ravishing. She only played a minor role in the movie, that of a young budding actress.<br>The story was about politics and relation to cinema stars in India in the post independence period (1940s) , the setting. If you are anyone interested in the movie, tell me , i can get it for you. it is rare to find now though available in DVD.<br>And the movie ran into trouble with the Indian censors in 1997.Though we are told that this is not a true story and its characters are "fictious"<br><br>It is obvious that this is fully inspired by the life and times of MGR and K. KARUNANITHI, 2 prominent figures in India's early political industry and the women in their lives.. Whether the director  Mani Ratnam has the right to probe the private lives of these people is a different matter altogether, but as a director, he has done an excellent job of recreating the behind the scenes drama, glamour and glitz. But because of Aishwarya Rai's marketing appeal, it was finally released . Indians tend to idolise national icons<br><img src="http://img462.imageshack.us/img462/3183/hb22029rr.jpg"><br>A good watch if u prefer slow paced movies with high quality picturisation, or a different story from the usual indian film. The set design of it is quite amazing because it exactly replicates the contemporary setting of post independence 1940s. Aishwarya Rai appears in the costumes of those times, beautiful and novel. Will immediately you strike is her beauty.And her dance appearance is gorgeous<br>The movie has been basically sidewashed aside into alternate cult cinema.<br>A period time drama about politics in the olden days of India.<br>I have added a few images from this movie to another board.

            <div class='col-md body'>Before you all dismiss this as another typical indian film with fights and songs galore. It isn't. It is meaningful art cinema ( which i decide one to own in my DVD collection) into the life of high people and celebrities , the trials and problems celebrities go through.<br>Most  parts of the movie  are historical   and resembles a documentary.<br>Will a person unaware of the political history of India understand them?. You dont have to. Take it as a learning lesson<br><br>It had so many parallels with the 1940s - 50s Indian cinema boom period. Celebrity suicides were common in those days in India. Older Indians  will remember the real life  suicide  case of a gorgeous  flight stewardess turned actress in the 1950s<br>This movie is based on true history and facts of post independent India<br>It  will be very different from most movies that you will see. The director has  they filled the movie with subtle suggestions, which makes the movie very special.<br>In one part:<br><br>Aishwarya's character commits suicide  in the movie but it was never shown how and a that part of the story depressed me because it showed death is a part of life no matter how famous or beautiful anyone is, they can fall victim to fame induced depression, just disappears in sudden and people just forget them...When it was revealed hat she commited suicide, it was just a scene of someone informing. The audience who been watching will get a shock because not only did they wanted the pretty gorgeous girl to last through the end of the movie, even if she did commited suicide, they wanted to see the last of her<br>which is never shown<br><br>This is director  Maniratnam's way of presenting  in his movies, short and  vague but yet powerful amd shocking<br>Throuhout all the scenes are  and shown in such depressive light ..If you love watching the director Manirathnam, you will find something insightful in all his movies, whether iit is the technicalities or presentation usually is excellent Am I sure many Indians cinema lovers will agree? , the way he moves his camera and stories is amazing</div>
