            <div class='col-md body'>maybe teachers and students are getting too friendly<br>it happens more so for young teachers. ive observed that students warm up more to young teachers. perhaps theres a smaller age gap; most students would reserve their respect for older and more senior teachers.<br>there are students who talk to their teachers like they do to their friends, not that its not allowed but it may go overboard as in this case. i mean its ok if the two parties involved are students as well; they would be talking on the same level, but this is a teacher involved. the teacher might be just being friendly and joking but the student might  be put on her guard because this is a teacher, no matter how close they are on talking terms, this kind of approach may appear as "flirting", which is not perceived as acceptable on normal terms<br><br>if there's no ill intention on the teacher's part, it should be fine<br>that;s just my two cents worth <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The teacher trying to get too intimate with a student is obviously wrong, but I shan't go into that.<br><br>Instead, shall talk about the guy who saved the message and passed it around. I daresay he did it out of fun, and just because he found something 'fun' to do, nothing so righteous as in the Newspaper reported.<br><br>But of course, just to cover his ass/name/pride/whatever, he gave such a justified explanation to the reporters. -snicker-<br><br>Personally, I condemn his actions. If he felt it should be reported, it should be to the principal directly, NOT circulated among friends. That is just so lame, and wrong. Many young people don't think of the consequences of their actions, and this student is one of them, seriously.<br><br>Ever thought of what will become of the female student in question? Never.<br><br>Ever thought of how the teacher's performance will be affected? (which is likely to lead to further complications in future) Never.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hehe. I found it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>News<br>Teacher warned for having 'sexy legs' banter with JC girl<br>Nur Dianah Suhaimi<br>680 words<br>4 June 2006<br>Straits Times<br>English<br>(c) 2006 Singapore Press Holdings Limited<br>He was caught after his messages praising her beauty were forwarded to the whole school<br><br>HE SAID she had sexy legs and told her that she was pretty. Then he told her he was attracted to girls from her former school.<br><br>Flirty conversation between two adults? No, this exchange was between a 28-year-old male teacher from Tampines Junior College and a 17-year-old student.<br><br>He was caught after the messages were forwarded to the whole school. He was hauled up by the college principal, counselled and given a verbal warning.<br><br>It all started with a friendly exchange of messages on the JC's intranet messaging system between the teacher and the first-year arts student, formerly from Tanjong Katong Girls' School.<br><br>But soon, the messages became more than just friendly chat.<br><br>Aside from the 'sexy legs' exchange, he asked her if she had a curfew and if she often went out late at night.<br><br>When she told him she was only comfortable with people she knew well, he compared her to a new car which has to be warmed up first before it could function. He also asked her to go with him to buy school supplies.<br><br>The student told The Sunday Times that she thought the teacher was just being friendly when he started messaging her. She suspected something was not right only when he started commenting on her legs and her looks. She said she continued messaging him because she did not want to offend him.<br><br>'But when he asked me out, I stopped messaging him totally,' she said.<br><br>It might have ended there but the girl forgot to log off after using a school computer to check her messages on April 13.<br><br>Another student using the same computer later chanced upon her messages and read them out of curiosity.<br><br>Said the second-year science student: 'I realised that the teacher was doing something very wrong. I thought he should be exposed. That's why I decided to save the messages.'<br><br>He also forwarded them to his classmates and the messages, dated from March 31 to April 9, ended up being passed on to almost every student in the school, causing an uproar and a 'student-teacher scandal'.<br><br>College principal Goh Hwee Choo told The Sunday Times she has counselled the teacher three times and also gave him a verbal warning. But she added that she wanted to give the teacher, who has been with the school for a year, a second chance.<br><br>She said: 'As a new teacher, he might be a little naive about how to conduct himself professionally. His comments were not right but there was no physical relationship between him and the student.'<br><br>The Ministry of Education (MOE) said it was leaving it to the school to handle the matter but added that had there been any physical relationship between the two, it would have investigated and taken disciplinary action against the teacher.<br><br>The teacher told The Sunday Times that he regretted being too friendly towards the student.<br><br>'There was no ill intention on my part but I should not have been over-friendly towards any student,' he said. 'From now on, such over-friendliness will stop.'<br><br>The JC girl said the issue had not only affected her studies, it had also affected her social life. She described how schoolmates talked behind her back and some had even approached her friends to ask for details.<br><br>She told her parents when rumours about her began circulating throughout the school. Said her mother: 'I was shocked when I heard about it. As a teacher, he should be protecting the students.'<br><br>The student said she planned to avoid the teacher in future and regretted not reporting him to the school.<br><br>She said: 'I didn't want to blow up the matter and attract unnecessary attention. But now I know that if a teacher crosses the social boundaries, we should report it to the principal immediately.' </strong></div>

"oh..now i know that if a teacher crosses the social boundaries, we should report it to the principal immediately." ya right. she didn't know last time. DUHHH.<br>and i also didn't think she continued messaging him just because she did not want to offend him. i mean, if the conversation shown on the newspaper was really extracted from the conversation she had with the teacher, she obviously enjoyed chatting with him.<br><br>this is the conversation....<br>teacher: u must look after ur legs ok.. its the prominent limbs that makes u attractive.<br>student: i used to hate my legs though. hahah. i wanna be 170<br>teacher: 170, what for? ...too tall for u lah, later ur sexy legs dun look nice anymore.<br>student: my legs will stay sexy no matter what. hahahahaha<br>teacher: hopefully u'll stay sporty and sexy.</div>
