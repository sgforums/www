            <div class='col-md body'>Something I completely don't understand...<br>Nowadays, handphones are so common, it seems like everyone has them. Its true that they are a huge convenience, but their main purpose is to serve people, not the other way round. But I know of people who have signed some 2 or 3 year plan and gotten a perfectly nice looking handphone or an expensive one, often paying a couple of hundred for it, but take excessive pains to minimize their handphone talktime so they can keep within the 'limit' of their allocated talktime. A minute of talktime costs a few cents only compared with hundred dollar phones! Function wise, just about every phone can SMS and talk. Usage of the new GPRS and WAP services is simply too slow and impractical when there's broadband around. But the feeling I get is: People seem more concerned with getting a fashionable type of phone than having a good functional line that's available everytime! "I call you when I get home, my phone no more time.""Eh quick, phone bill is expensive!" The most pissing off thing is, when some people run out of time, they switch off their expensive mobiles! I got only one thing to say about that:"WAHHHHH LAOOOOOO EHHHHHH!!!!!!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. Handphones nowadays are not just communications equipment. Its a lifestyle accessory. Something to be seen with and to show off to. Its also a great way to while away time on MRT(Personal Snake record: 1719)<br><br>2. Handphones are fixed cost. Hp bills are variable cost. So to reduce total costs, reduce the variable cost lor. Or, since they spent all their money on the expensive handphone, so no more money to talk on handphone mah. Simple logic right?<br><br>3. People like to use their handphones only when they are in a movie or a theatre. So call them when they tell you they are going for one, they'll be most happy to talk to you for the entire length of the show!!!! (unless I happen to be in the theatre too, to rip off their heads)<br><br>4. Another possibility is that you called them at the wrong time. e.g. they are on the MRT listening to each and every tune on their handphones ruefully, meticulously selecting the best tune for their handphones. This is very important to them because having the right tune on the handphone cause the owner to be irresistible to gals who will strip dance to the tune and mate with them on the spot.<br><br>5. Chances are that you're not a hunk or a babe. So they see you as a cost more than a benefit to them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My explanation will be simple, Handphone talktime bill are incurred cost that cannot be redeemed at all. Handphone however by itself is an asset that can be sold off in later time althought its value depreciate with time. So that's the main reason why pple are more willing to spent on an expensive phone but take excessive pains to minimize their handphone talktime. Handphone bill can cost like bomb if unchecked and used beyond the limit.</div>

It's not that they cannot affort the expensive one but they just want the basic function and reliability instead of advance functionality. Often, it's the low-end models that are more durable than those high end gadgets. Do you think your Nokia 8310 can survive a fall better than a GH688? Furthermore, these big bosses usually own more than one phone.<br><br>Those pple that chokky are referring are mostly youngster or other who buy phone for personal usage. And some esp the girls got their phone as a gift. Of course, just like what i had said, being vain and trendy, they like to carry expensive high-end phone as an asset. However, they will take pain to cut down on their talktime usage becos mostly they are not doing business with their phone but paying the bill out of their own pocket. It's just not worth the money talking beyond the limit unless you are rolling in money talking to pay off the bills.</div>
