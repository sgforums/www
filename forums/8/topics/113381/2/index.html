            <div class='col-md body'>I remember the primary school workbooks back then..... they were made of glossy and really flimsy low-quality yellow paper. When I started using pens in Pri 3, I remember having to be careful not to apply too much pressure. No point tearing the pages for nothing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I was really young, but I remember that the 80s up till the early 90s were the golden era of cartoons. Bionic Six, GI Joe, Ghostbusters, He-Man and The Masters of The Universe... Those were classics. While some of these cartoons have been remade recently, they still lack the spirit of the original.<br><br>My favourite cartoon of all time though has to be MASK.<br><br>I remember having one of the toys: a green motorbike called Condor which could transform into a helicopter. My brother had Firefly, a 4WD vehicle which could turn into a plane. My cousin had the big bad boss..... a purple helicopter which could turn into an airplane.<br><br>We would spend hours battling each other.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
