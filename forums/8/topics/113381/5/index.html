I don't feel bad about slacking anymore.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Those strips had pretty crude graphics, but it was really cool.<br><br>I also remember the old works of Colin Goh..... The Orchard Road series especially. They came out even before he churned out the brilliant (but sad to say, recently-concluded) Concrete Jungle series.<br><br>I could still remember one of strips in the series: The Seng Singapore series. It's about a fictional local superhero. Of course, his name is a pun on the 'Sing Singapore' competitions of the past.<br><br>'The Mighty Murtabak.... The Prata of Power.... The Champion of Chapatis..... The Super Satay.... He is.......
