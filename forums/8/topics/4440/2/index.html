God will see them through. Lets hope he got great plans for them in the future.<br><br>Of course i don't mean turning a blind eye to them. But a third page news coverage would do fine in my opnion since it was her failing liver that is getting the news in the first place. Walk into a hospital and you will find people with other failing body parts. They didn't get any news coverage.<br>However, the "first in the world" operation, which in my opinion would make cover page material.<br><br>Just my two cents worth of the priority of the media in Singapore.<br><br>feel free to agree or disagree.</div>
