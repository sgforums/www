Japan went that way and the economy died ugly...<br><br>what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?<br><br>have we lost our souls for a few pieces of silver?  numbers in a bank account?<br><br>EZ-Link? they have a right.. but i think this is symptomatic of the people in singapore... everyone hoarded cards... and EZ-Link is forced to do this.. i don't blame them... how many news stories were there of people going to line up, wait for hours and buying 4 cards.. and each member of the family buys 4 cards.. what the hell for?  now, we're just reaping what we've sown<br><br>however, SBS and all that are a different matter... they have scalped the people.. and continue to do it, while still claiming high moral ground they do not have right to even sniff at.. that is unforgivable..</div>

SBS is the only public bus transport available to us. and EZ link is the more convenient and cheaper mode of paying. so for the majority of the population who can't afford private transport, we can complain all we want but they will still go ahead and raise the price and we will still use it because we have no alternative (can't be use coins everday like foreigner right?). they are too aware of the hold they have on us and will fully use it to their advantage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well since ez-link is made by the LTA they might have not done proper market research.Take for example translink....they having made the translink cards for years would know how many cards are lost,damaged,kept...etc etc.So i say this is bad research by the ez-link team and we should not be made to pay for they're over sight!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is getting more and more personal this tougher to ignore the constant Mis-management of our System.<br><br>The EZ-Link system was design and implemented to curb the millions of dollars lost due to the underpayment for the old system (translink cards).<br><br>After spending 1/2 a billion dollars in it, flaws, the lack of foresight and detail planning of those who were involve in this system is starting to show.<br><br>Firstly, why is there a need for EZ-LINK as a profit oriented subsidery? Losing a couple of dollars per month while our bus companies are recouping MILLIONS back now that there isnt an underpayment issue.<br><br>Common sense tells you that no matter how much lose you can make, it will never compensate for the profits made by having this cards.<br><br>Ironically, there are trying to spend $$ campaining for people to switch to public transport and on the other stab you in the back trying to find new ways of making more Profit once you have decided to make the switch.<br><br>The way i see it, it really shows the lack of quality in our singapore govt. The scholars who seldom understands the man in the street and the hardship we are facing. Heck. do they actually take public transport?<br><br>If the EZ-Link cards and its entire system was too expensive too maintain, why have it in the first place?<br><br>Personally, i think that the part of theProfits made by the bus companies should be included as revenues or benefits when acconuting for the EZ-Link system as this is what the system was out to solve rite?<br><br>I am not to going deviate from the topic and add in the cost and problems associated with the driverless MRT system but just to make my point,<br><br>Are those in our govt becoming a victim of their own success?<br><br>Yes, we need advancements to compete in this tough and changing envrionment but i think more can be done to instill responsibility for managing OUR money and respect for those who are paying the taxes.<br><br>We do not need 1/2 billion dollar ticketing system of solve a 10 million per year problem.<br><br>What we need is a system that is well though of, practical, innovative and does the jon RIGHT.<br><br>just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div>
