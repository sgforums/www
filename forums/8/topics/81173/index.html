            <div class='col-md body'>Meow! That's gotta be painful for all Singapore soccer fans. FAS must still be dreaming of its ridiculous GOAL 2010.<br><br>In it's bid to achieve greater success with its meow* team, a Chinese player - Shi Jiayi is set to set fellow foreigners including Agu Casmir, Itimi Dickson and Precious Emuejeraye in the young lions squad. Oh not forgetting the 2 has-beens in Egmar Goncalves and Grabovac.<br><br>How come Singapore needs to rely on foreign talent in almost every sport? Chinese players for table tennis, Indonesian for badminton and rojak for soccer? Since that's the case, might as well 'get' the whole Brazil team, which i doubt they will come to join this *meow team.<br><br></div>

I've watched S-league for a while some years back and it's so disgusting that I walked off in less than ten minutes after watching it. Our team can't kick soccer. Or rather, they can't play professionally. For even nearer examples, have Japan and Korea. Their players aren't like our players either.<br><br>And when they lose, they only know how to cry and complain about this and that, whatever excuse they could come up with. Sometime back last year I think, the Singapore team admitted they slack off or something, and that they didn't want to find excuses for themselves.<br><br>Retards. Talk is empty. Talk is nothing.

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that Singapore soccer is getting from bad to worse.<br><br>We chose to leave the Malaysia cup and set up our own S League which to me is not successful in making our national team players better in any sense.<br><br>I think the 70s squad of Quah Kim Song, Dollar Kasim, Raja Gopal and Co. will stand a much better chance in making to the world cup in the 70s. They played soccer for the love of soccer. Not saying that the new players dont love soccer but they have to think about their daily bread. Its like you love soccer but living standards in Singapore are getting higher, I don't think the players can survive playing soccer alone.<br><br>The commitment level is just not there. Which parents will allow their children to drop out from school and play soccer the whole day? How long can soccer career in Singapore going to last? What can the player do when he can't play soccer anymore?<br><br>Yes the government is trying....by setting up sport schools and importing foreign talents. (our so call foreign talent in soccer didnt shine leh) but don't think that enough... and too late for GOAL2010.<br><br>Countries like Indonesia and Vietnam are doing better these days. We even have problem qualifying for SEA games... do I need to mention WC when we can't even win gold? If Thailand gets into the WC then we can start thinking of our chances.</div>

However, I will not say that you are calling me 'uncle' instead of 'auntie' on purpose since I'm female. I'm not saying that calling me 'auntie' would be nice btw, since it would be another ten plus years before you would be justified to call me 'auntie' or 'uncle', whichever you like though I would say, just 'TLK' would do. Thank you.<br><br><blockquote>pls lah.. like that call disrespectful?? pls wake up b4 i really start being rude ok?? respect is earn u dun demand for it... for ur info i am not even mad at u...for what.. it's ur personal opinion...</blockquote>Seems like you do not know basic manners and respect at all. No use trying to talk to you about it.<br><br><blockquote>so if u  still think it's the player fault pls tell ask a solution can?? </blockquote> Sorry but I seriously catch no ball here. Care to explain if you want me to give a solution or ask (for whatever) please? Or at least attempt understandable sentence structure please?<br><br><blockquote>like i have stated above... someone else have used this player attitude excuse b4 .. that is why we have foreign talent and pro league now... but did we see any improvement?? NO!! </blockquote>I'm sorry but I do not know that 'someone else'. Just because someone said it once doesn't mean another can't have the same opinion. ^_____^<br><br><blockquote>tell mi pls... if players for bad attitude.... the coach can ask then to wake up right??? if coach nv.. then the manager and management can right?? they are the one that employed or choose them anyway.....so if they never bother to do anything about it...whose fault is it???</blockquote> There's always two sides to the story. What if they had done so? What if the players refused to listen? Would you know all that?<br><br><blockquote>like i said.. the management can just sitting high high up there and dunno the problem down at the ground level....the structure and support is not there at all....</blockquote> Yawn. Same old thing. Management management management.<br><br><blockquote>that is why alot of sg sports cannot make it nowadays....it's coz of the management.....</blockquote> Everything is the management's fault. Why are you so sure that it has nothing to do with the players themselves?<br><br><blockquote>p.s just go take a look at the programme and support they have for sailing or table tennis.. vs soccer.. and u will see the diff...hope that is not too disrespectful to u.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </blockquote>Do I care?
