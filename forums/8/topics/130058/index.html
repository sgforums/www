            <div class='col-md body'>The new system run on Microsoft platform and the e-filing web application was brought down numerous times on the 30th April. It displayed ugly error messages [database error messages] which any web designers know by instinct should be hidden from end users in case of system failure or application exceptions. At times, it simply redirect the end users back to the main page [mytax.iras.gov.sg] after the Singpass login without any messages. For certain instances, I noticed that some debug messages will be displayed at the top left hand corner of the main page. One example is a small capital letter 'f', at other times it was a string of other technical debug messages, useful only to programmers.<br><br>Besides, if you have just registered your Singpass at the CPF counter, I encountered [by helping friends] that they were able to log in using the new Singpass into CPF e-service but not the IRAS portal. Whereas I am able to do with my Singpass which was registered many years ago. The login was simply redirected back to the main page without any messages, or at times, as the system likes, some machine-readable-only messages again.<br><br>I believe that IRAS aims to provide a better service. However, I think the choice of system platform, web application design, exception handling has much to improve.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i had to apply for the SingPass thing because the PIN they sent to me didn't work!<br><br>i had so many problems with their PIN in the beginning too.. i could not get past the page that told me to change the PIN...<br><br>each time i keyed in the PIN they sent me, the thing brought me to the page where i was supposed to change the PIN.. and when i did, the application just outright stalled...<br><br>i tried all the browsers... i started with my default browser, Opera.. that didn't work and i was stalled at the PIN changing page.. the next night, i decided to use Firefox... stalled at the same place... when i used MSIE 2 nights later, i had some kind of error message after it took me to the change of PIN page...<br><br>i gave up in disgust...<br><br>so i went to get the SingPass and it worked... i think it was because i did my filing at around 5am... according to friends, they could not get in during office hours...<br><br>i wonder how many people's taxes were cocked up because of their lousy software?<br><br>there is no excuse for insufficient UAT and load testing.. especially with a system where you know you are going to get insanely high loading...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I HATE the tax portal! Had to file for my parents, and this year they decided to split and disallow joint filing, so I had to file twice. Apart from all the error messages and redirecting me back to the main page, I had to go apply for a SingPass for my mum coz they din't send her any PIN or what not, and then after trying to log in 10 million times, I finally succeeded once and the system told me there's nothing to do. Then I tried to call to ask, but of course I couldn't get through. Then I read in some FAQ that if the annual income is less than $22000, and you din't receive the forms and stuff, there's no need to file. So I gave up trying.<br><br>And I had to do all those in school, using school computers, coz my lousy home pc is pretty cranky and the java doesn't work.<br><br>Grrrrr... !@#@$#%&amp;</div>
