            <div class='col-md body'>If it is genuine case, we shoould all help.... but just a warning.... do not buy such 4D tickets... months ago there was a case of old people selling 4D tickets.. when the number come out, they go police station and claimed they lost the ticket.. whoever then tries to claim prize will be prosecuted...<br><br>Monks can only ask for food.. do not give them money!!!!!! So if they come to you in a hawker centre and put their bowl in front of you, kindly pick a piece of toufu/vege and put it in!<br><br>I was at Marina South (you know all the BBQ buffet area) when a young man about 17-18 came to sell tissue. He spoke with a "big tongue" manner, and acted retarded, calling people "Gor gor jie jie"... act as if his IQ only 50. THen his hand phone rang... he picked up his call and spoke in perfect mandarin cum hokkien..</div>
