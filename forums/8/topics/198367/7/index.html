            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Oh Maria:</div><div class="quote_body">IT is seregated inmto different sectors for eg:<br><br>Noida Residential Sectors<br><br>Sector -11<br><br>This is a partial residential sector (as it is partially industrial too), the sector is located on the outskirts of Noida touching the Kundli area of Delhi. Not much sale purchase of property happens here, as the speculative element of the property market is missing from this sector. Rental rates are about 9/- per sqft per month, Capital value is around 20000/- to Rs 22000/-  per sqmts.<br><br>Sector-12<br><br>This is a Sector adjoining sector-11 and opposite the Noida Stadium. The properties on the main road facing the stadium have now by and large turned into commercial outfits and lots of shops, training institutes, banks and medical clinics have come up on these properties. Again just like sector-11 apart from the properties on the main road not much sale purchase happens here due to the lack of speculative element , however the properties on the main road see a good buying and renting interest. Rates are more or less like Sector-11 apart from the main road plots which command some premium due to their commercial appeal. Both these sectors (i.e 11 &amp; 12) are bogged down by the presence of the Village Chaura Ragunathpur.<br><br>Sector-14<br><br>This is one of the oldest sector to be developed by Noida , the sector is located right at the Gol- Chakkar of Noida. Sector is fully developed and commands  good infrastructural facilities, Capital value of plots in this sector range from Rs 28000/- to Rs 35000/- per sqmts , but as the sector is fully developed this sector does not witness fast property turnaround, still it is good place for genuine buyers to look for their prospective home (but may be not from the investment point of view).<br><br>Sector-14A<br><br>This is the first residential sector one comes across as one enters Noida through the Mayur Vihar Route. This sector is a proud host of the residences of top NOIDA Authority officers and has good security system besides having an excellent infrastructure. As most of the sector consists of residential houses and apartments of Noida authority officers there is almost negligible property sale purchase interest in the sector, hence very difficult to quote the going capital and rental value of the sector.<br><br>Sector-15<br><br>This again is one of the oldest residential sector of Noida, now fully developed, it houses the oldest cinema hall in Noida( The Alka Cinema) , it is adjoining the Nayabans village. The part of Nayabans village on the Main Dadri Road  has developed into a haphazard commercial area. It is mainly because of the presence of Nayabans village that the sector does not command the same premium as sector -14, still the capital rates are in the range of  Rs20000/- to Rs25000/- per sqmt.<br><br>Sector-15A<br><br>One of the most expensive and posh residential area of NOIDA, Sector-15A is ideally located near the Noida Toll Bridge and right next to the film city. This sector has a minimum plot size of 200 sqmts and like sector-14A the sector has a very good infrastructure, the capital rates are in the range of  Rs65000/- to Rs 70000/- per sqmts. Due to the high capital value the sector does not see a fast turnaround in property but the sector is one of the best address in NOIDA and anyone looking for a good location for their dream house must consider this as a option. The plot size of 450mts are though in the range of Rs 60000 to Rs 65000 per sqmts.<br><br>The sector also houses the Deluxe and Super Deluxe apartments built by NOIDA Authority, these flats are reasonably well built and located and provides an alternative to those willing to locate in sector-15A with a lesser budget. The capital value of these apartments vary from Rs 60 Lakhs to Rs 65 Lakhs.The Sector 15A club is also a upmarket club to be a member of.<br><br>Sector-17<br><br>This sector has a very good location, as it is flanked by the NOIDA Toll Bridge on one side, Sector-18 Commercial area on the other, while it also faces the Main Dadri Road. The sector mainly houses the residential apartments of BHEL (this is major part of the sector) &amp; NDDB while the residential plots comprise a minor portion of the sector. It is very difficult to give an idea of the capital value of the BHEL flats as the same are virtually non-saleable while the residential plots command a rate of Rs35000/- to Rs 40000/- per sqmts, while those on the main roads may command a even higher rate due to their commercial value.This sector lies right on the confluence of sector 27 and 18 and is very strategically located, hence we feel that the capital value of the plots on the main road can rise substantially in the time to come.<br><br>Sector-19<br><br>One of the oldest residential sector of Noida, this sector is centrally placed and is surrounded by the commercial sectors 18,27 on one side , Industrial sector 3 &amp; 4 on the other and not to mention that the NOIDA Toll Bridge starts from the Sector 19 -Sector 3 crossing. This sector boasts of the Main Post Office, Main Telephone Exchange. The temple in this sector is one of the most sought after places during the festive season. Sector 19 has Noida flats and plots of all sizes and budgets. The plots facing the main roads have more or less turned into commercial establishments and their asking rates (capital as well as rental ) are very high . There are number of Banks , Govt offices , Computer Training institutes which have come up in these plots on the main road. As such the asking rate for the sector is around Rs 26000 to Rs 30000 per sqmts.<br><br>Sector-20<br><br>This sector too like sector-19 has plots of all sizes, but the majority of plots are of smaller sizes. The sector though located adjacent to sector 19 has somehow not been able to maintain its upkeep hence the rates here are not comparable to those of sector-19. The sector has a huge commercial complex in G Block which houses the Income Tax Office and other Govt offices. The capital value of plots in this sector varies from Rs 25000 to Rs 28000, but the plots on the main road dividing sector 20 &amp; 26,those on road dividing sector 19 &amp; 20 command a higher rates than this due to their commercial value as a number of Furniture Showrooms and Training Institutes have come up on those plots.<br><br></div></blockquote>WOW!
