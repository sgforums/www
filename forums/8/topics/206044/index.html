            <div class='col-md body'>A large scale 250,000-participant study has found that the Body Mass Index (BMI) which has been used for over 5 decades to gauge risks of heart disease is actually an inaccurate measure. The BMI takes into account total weight and in unable to differentiate between fat and muscle mass Â– so that several people who have a greater BMI are actually healthier than others, though theory suggests otherwise.<br><br>This index, invented by Belgian statistician and sociologist Adolphe Quetelet is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters. Generally, the normal healthy range is between 18.5 to 24.9, with a person whose BMI is lower being considered underweight. A BM Index between 25 to 29.9 falls into the overweight category, while above this would be considered clinically obese.<br><br>This study conducted by a group from Mayo clinic found that though as expected, the obese participants had greater risks of cardio-vascular disease, this was not always true for the overweight group. Many participants from the overweight category were healthier than those who fell in the 'normal' range. This was because BMI did not always necessarily have a connection with fat. A large muscle mass could also account for a greater Body Mass Index. For instance, New Zealand's large rugby star, Jonah Lomu, has a BMI of 32, however it would be inaccurate to classify him as 'obese'.<br><br>Note however, that the researchers do not completely disregard this index, nor do they suggest that being overweight is harmless. Rather, they call for a different measure, which will be able to distinguish between weight contributed by fat and that contributed by muscle.<br><br>A more reliable method and a much simpler one, suggest the researchers, involves only a regular measure tape. This method involves calculating the waist-hip ratio, whereby abdominal fat is accounted for. This pot-belly indicator is seen to be much more accurate in gauging fat mass and connecting it to cardio vascular risks.<br><br>However, Dr. Robert H. Eckel, of the University of Colorado and previous president of the American Heart Association cautions against disregarding the BMI completely. He points out that this index has been more accurate than inaccurate in the past and much more research needs to be done before it can be completely ruled out.<br><br>Source: http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/8207.html<br><br>hey looks like BMI not really that good in telling us whether we're really unhealthy!!</div>
