            <div class='col-md body'>Any of you kenna bullied or picked on by your boss, for being too good, too competent and capable?<br><br>Saw this article on the Straits Times today.  Quite interesting:<br>------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Bullying bosses motivated by exercise of power, say experts<br>There are important differences between bullies in the workplace and those in the schoolyard, new research reveals<br><br>NEW YORK - Every working adult has known one but very little has been done studying one up till now.<br><br>Researchers have long been interested in the bullies of the playground. Only recently has attention turned to the bullies of the workplace.<br><br>Psychologists who study the dynamics of organisations are discovering why cruel bosses thrive, how employees end up covering for managers they despise and under what conditions workers are most likely to confront a bullying boss.<br><br>Next week, researchers and policy makers from many nations will convene in Bergen, Norway, to discuss the issue.<br><br>Dr Calvin Morrill of the University of California at Irvine, who studies corporate culture, says: 'What we're finding is that some of the behaviours that we think most protect us are what in fact allow the behaviour to continue. Workers become desensitised, tacitly complicit and don't always act rationally.'<br><br>Bullying bosses, studies find, differ in significant ways from the Blutos of childhood. In the schoolyard, bullies tend to pick on smaller or weaker children to assert control.<br><br>But adult bullies in positions of power are already dominant, and they are just as likely to pick on a strong subordinate as a weak one, said Dr Gary Namie, director of the Workplace Bullying and Trauma Institute, an advocacy group based in Washington.<br><br>Women, Dr Namie said, are at least as likely as men to be the aggressors, and they are more likely to be targets.<br><br>A manager might use bullying to swat down a threatening subordinate, for example, said Dr Harvey Hornstein, a professor at Teachers College at Columbia University and the author of Brutal Bosses And Their Prey. Or a manager might be looking for a scapegoat to carry the department's, or supervisor's, frustrations.<br><br>But most often, Dr Hornstein found, managers bullied subordinates for the sheer pleasure of exercising power.<br><br>'It was a kind of low-grade sadism that was the most common reason,' he said.<br><br>The mystifying thing about this pattern is that it does not appear to undercut productivity. Workers may loathe a bullying boss and hate going to work, but they still perform.<br><br>Researchers find little relationship between people's attitudes toward their jobs and their productivity, as measured by the output and quality of their work. Even in the most hostile work environment, conscientious people keep doing the work they are paid for.<br><br>But some employees withhold the unpaid extras that help an organisation, like being courteous to customers, helping co-workers with problems or speaking well of the company.<br><br>Yet this fall-off in helpfulness and, indirectly, in performance is smaller than might be expected because fear motivates different people differently, said Dr Bennett Tepper, an organisational psychologist.<br><br>When the nostrils quiver and the lip tightens, Dr Hornstein found in his research, all is not lost. Ignore the insulting tone of a boss's attack, he said, and respond only to the substance of the complaint.<br><br>-- New York Times<br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.

            <div class='col-md body'>In my last job, two of my closer colleagues always got picked on.  Personally, I find that one of them was good at her work (I will call her "Fiona") and hardworking; while the other (let's call her "Sammie" may not be perfect, but her performance lies between good and very good.<br><br>However, the manager always picked on Fiona and Sammie.  He always scolded Fiona and even shouted over to her across the department, to tell her to come over to his cubicle.  Usually, when Fiona was at his cubicle, he would start scolding her.  His voice was so loud that I could hear from my desk which was a few cubicles away.  He would usually say "How many times do I have to tell you .... blah blah blah.  I must treat you like a small kid, you know!"  This Fiona was my work buddy.  The feedback about Fiona's work performance that I got from other colleagues was always positive.  Personally, I found her good at what she was doing and did not give up easily in dealing with difficult situations (such as nasty customers).  Moreoever she was efficient, and her attitude was positive all the time.<br><br>The worst thing was: This work buddy who has more experience in the work, was tasked to buddy with me so that whatever I did not understand I could ask her.  Once my manager caught me doing the wrong thing, Fiona got scolded very very badly.  But the manager did not even raise his voice at me.<br><br>The second colleague, Sammie, was a Team Leader.  She may not be fantastically good, but she managed to do what she was tasked to do as well as tasks that were above and beyond her area of work.  My cubicle was facing hers and the manager.  So everytime the manager talked to her, I could see.  Every week, at least once, the manager would give her at least one hour counselling session to point out her faults.  She became demoralised and even asked me whether she was so lousy that she needs so many counselling from the manager.</div>
