"I can accept criticism directed at me, but not attacks on my family, and I was worried for their safety."<br><br>Despite reaching the semi-finals, Chew has been one of the most criticised female contestants on the Project Superstar forum, drawing unflattering viewer comments such as "pretentious" and "ordinary looking".<br><br>Being the only non-Singaporean among the semi-finalists, Chew has also had to deal with postings that claimed she "bought her way into the semis". The contest is open to both Singaporeans and Singaporean Permanent Residents.<br><br>Critical comments on talent show postings are nothing new, of course. There have been heated discussions online since Project Superstar debuted on June 8 and Singapore's two previous major talent contests Â— MediaCorp TV Channel 5's Singapore Idol and Channel U's The Next Big Thing Â— also attracted their fair share of catty comments about the contestants.<br><br>But a contestant had never had his or her family's address revealed online before and the website's moderators moved quickly to remove the post.<br><br>When asked about the post, Lam Yen Fong, the assistant editor, NPP, Web Interactive (the forum's moderators) said: "Any post that is crude or vulgar, in bad taste and, most importantly, posts that have intention to threaten and/or cause fear and invading one's privacy will be deemed offensive and be deleted."<br><br>Since the incident, Chew said she has been escorted to and from rehearsals and recordings by MediaCorp staff.<br><br>Mr Paul Chan, channel vice-president of network programming and promotions for Chinese broadcasting at MediaCorp, says steps will be taken to ensure such incidents are not repeated.<br><br>"Moving forward, the IT department will be implementing a membership login system, should the surfer wishes to leave a message, he or she will need to log in for verification," he said. "This will discourage surfers from posting offensive messages."<br><br>Project Superstar, which has generated so much hype that it is now among the top searches on the msn and yahoo! search engines, will air tonight at 8.30pm and 11.30pm on MediaCorp TV Channel U.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seems like few ppl here appreciate Weilian's singing ability.<br><br>All talking about derrick and junyang like those little meimei supporters.<br><br>To b frank, although junyang's voice quality is good, but he has not really impress me so far in the competition that he is a complete singer capable of wide range of songs. Seems like his diaphram got not enough power to bring out the 'power' parts of certain songs that are supposed to be brought out strongly, like what Li Feihui said when he sang 'Yi wang guo qu' that night. Or maybe he was being too cautious. And during most of his songs there are no climax. To sum it up. he is a good singer, but too boring. Even derrick sometimes impresses me because he is more daring to try out those difficult songs with high range pitch.<br><br>As for gals, only one word... Kelly.<br><br>Xinhui has suddenly emerged as a dark horse with strong potential to muscle it out with Kelly, but ultimately, it will be down to her as the final gal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>tonight xin hui really shocked me with her great preformance, especially her 2nd song. she chose the right song that suited her low bass-like voice. in the past she always like to choose those fast songs that required her to shout all that. i'm impressed.<br><br>as for hebe, er... i mean kelly, she maintained her standard tonight but i find that the songs she chose are too easy, too calm. with her singing ability i expected her to sing a more challenging song.<br><br>ok back to xin hui, in the past she was always the one with the lowest points, so when she suddenly perform very well, everyone can see the differences immediately. but as for kelly, she''ll be more stressful as she is always known to be the better singer among the females, she has to maintain her standards and must always try new songs to surprise us.</div>
