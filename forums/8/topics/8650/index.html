            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Asure,<br><br>Actually, I feel inferior sometimes to people. Some people seemed to see an external side of me, which seemed confident and perhaps "intelligent". I doubt so, because I always feel that to be intelligent is a kind of handicap, a kind of handicap in dealing with people. Perhaps, I think that my EQ is not good enough.<br><br>Well, it is always so ironic that the more talented and intelligent a person is, the more inferior he or she feels. It happens to some of the people I know. I share the same feeling of not being sure of myself, because I feel that I am not really good enough for a gal....<br><br>Just my two pennies worth.<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

Humility can certainly be faked. I do know of someone who decided to do charity only because his friend "jio" him. The charity did not come from his heart. Probably due to peer pressure.

In either case, his goal is achieved as he is given more recognition.<br>I'm sure you have heard of ppl doing charity work, in name only <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div></blockquote>Yah agree with you on the 1st part, wherelse my view on the last part where pple do charity work in name only, well, if the targeted group of pple get benefits from it, or should i say does actually benefits from it, guess we can overlook if he did it in name or sincerely.

But sometimes it's also quite difficult a strike a balance. I'm very much on the side cynicism, if there's such a word.</div>
