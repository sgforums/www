I go over often, and never been robbed (touch wood), maybe I am lucky or I looked too poor to have anything to rob.<br><br>The big difference is the efficiency of the police in Singapore as opposed to the police in JB...if commit a crime, police  in Singapore will be out in full force to catch culprit, and being such a tiny dot of a country, and an island in that matter, not easy for criminals to escape.  As for the police in JB...they like to look the other way.  Moreover, a lot of violent crimes in JB were committed by illegal immigrants, who have no immigration records and once they escape back to their own country, they know they are no way they are going to be caught.  So we should be thankful to our efficient police force and our vigilant custom and immigration that prevent bad elements from coming into our country.<br><br>We do have violent crimes in Singapore too, mind you, murders, rape, etc.  Remember the porn-freak beast that raped and sodomised the China girls?  Or the serial rapist who even attacked and raped a 60 year old aunty?</div>
