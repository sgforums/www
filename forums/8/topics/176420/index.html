Complete NS then do ACCS, or the other way round. Not quite sure about doing ACCS while in NS. Ask NS men.<br><br>For question 2, visit ACCS website. Just go in to google and type in "ACCS"<br><br>The rest of the questions, let others answer you.<br></div>

Cannot do the ACCA cert then go NS meh?. If need to do this cert during NS then how do I find time for this course<br><br>A: u can do acca anytime its a pte course ie b4,during, after NS. am not too sure whether it qualifies for  deferment for NS<br><br>2. I also want to know how long does the ACCA course takes.? As far as I know it is roughly 1 year or so, correct me if I m wrong, and also the fees are 15- 18k, so is it true?<br><br>A: If taking ACCA without exceptions I think there are 2 exam sitings ay ear,3 levels and total 12 subjects.it is very unlikely to clear all 12 subjects in one year (if u do pls indro me ur sch and lecturer)Fees differ from sch to sch there are a few notable ones FTC, SAA and Etc. U pay the exam fees separate from school fees ,exam fees are paid in sterling pounds!!! i reckon juz under $500 per subject check out: www.icpas.org.sg to know more<br><br>3. What are the differences between a accountant and a auditor? If I want to be a auditor do I still take the same ACCA cert or others cert? I heard the a auditor earns more than a accountant. I want to know if they are more demanded by the society than accountants.<br><br>A: ok in very basic layman terms, an accountant will do up the acccounts ie AP,AR, BS, P/L  while an auditor will conduct an audit ie checks on the accounts prepared by the accountant.  The pay of an auditor may or maynot be higher or lower than an accountant, it really depends on the industry and company . As for demand, IMHO i will say its pretty equal as the staff turnover for both occupations are rather high.<br><br>4. And also I want to know about the starting pay of a ACCA grad? I heard that it is only 1.2k.<br><br>ACCA fresh grad working in a Big4 (Kpmg,PWC, EY, Det) is offered around 2k<br>I will think 1.2 k is offered to those who have juz passed the level one of the ACCA or the CAT<br><br>5. I would also like to know other than the SIC wad other schools in Singapore also offers this course?<br><br>A: www.icpas.org.sg<br><br>6. Is it true my fellow sgforumers that there are a lot of unemployed accountants out there? I thought accountants are at a large demand in the society?<br><br>A: I dun think so ...if you got the relevant qualifications accounting is a job tat is very hard to phase out...put it tis way even if a company is bankrupt u still need to do up ur accts. Mostly accountants leave the industry due to boredom, I mean how long can you be facing the same set of accts for days, mths and years??!!<br><br>7. Also is the ACCA cert more valued than a NTU or SMU degree? Then y do people still rush to get a university degree rather than a ACCA cert?<br><br>A: not necessary cos i would suppose the end objective of an accounting student is to get the coveted CPA(certified public accountant) title NTU, SMU offers the same route as ACCA too juz that acca allows for individuals to pursue on part time basis or simply allows an aternative for those who cant get into unis<br><br>8. I heard that Singapore and ngee ann poly are the best polys to nurture the best accountants is that true also?<br><br>A: I dun come from poly, cant help u there<br><br>9. I also heard that the ACCA is a part time cert. is that true? And is there any full time cert available? Because I want to do the ACCA cert b4 going to the NS<br><br>A: They dun certified Full time or Parttimeon the cert at least last i heard of.<br><br>10. Is it true that in NS when I m posted to not so operational unit I could take the cert during ns? And any way to be posted to not so operational unit?<br><br>A: mght not be the case, it will really depend on mindef, ur CO , OC then.IMHO if you really want to study try not to do it during NS b'cos it is not an entitlement for mindef to give u time off to study!!!<br><br>11. I m not taking POA in my secondary school days so will I still get into this course? And also will I have a very hard time grasping the basics?<br><br>A: dun worry about it , juz make sure u study hard in the beginning to get ur acct priciples, concepts and foundation rite u will do juz fine<br><br>12. My route: O levelsIs my route of mine ok? or rather i should take the route o lvl&gt; jc&gt;NS&gt;degree&gt;work ? the first route is only 7 months lesser but not that stress and still can work? so wad route should i take?<br><br>A: i took route 2 but i haf colleagues who took route 1, it is really up to the individual i got frens who work during uni and still got good grades ...<br><br>13. any 1 of u know of any website that can tell me the coursefees and schedule? except for acca.com... i went there but they did not say anything.. or maybe is there a place where i can take brochure to clear my doubts?<br><br>A: go to SAA at aljunied MRT the pple there should beable to help u<br>20 Aljunied Road<br>#01-04 CPA House<br>Singapore 389805<br>Phone (65) 6744 9700<br>Fax (65) 6744 9796<br><br>I know I have a lot of questions to ask but this concern my future so please guide me in this thx my fellow sgforumers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote><span style="color: blue;"></span><br><br>Hope i was of some help but pls dun take my word for it , i mean u really got to find your own resources and think abt ur routes. i never tot i was going to be an auditor untill i finished my degree...and i was a science student all the way??!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
