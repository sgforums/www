If the person cannot get that sense of emergency, he/she will start feeling it few weeks before Os and start mugging.<br><br>I started studying for my Os after I got 29 for prelims.

            <div class='col-md body'>Kena retained before, can share with you that when you get retained, you will live like never before. You cherish things more then ever, you value time, you work much harder to make amends, at the end of the day, you emerge a different person. Sometimes, its a blessing in disguise actually. I came out of it, even more successful then some of my friends whom were doing well. So you gotta look at how you want to see it.<br><br>You can cry about it, and blame the world, or you can use it as an opportunity to show the world that it has been stupid for them not to realize your boundless potentials.</div>

For those taking major exams this year, my advice will be to start 1 or 2 months before Prelims. Do not wait until u get back ur Prelim results then start to panic, although that sure did a world of good for my class and myself during JC. There's simply too much to cram, and if you are the "slow-to-absorb" kind like me, then u better start early, so that u won't feel that u have many things to remember just b4 exams</div>
