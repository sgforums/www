              <p><br>*Grins* I can't say that for the Basket-hilted scottish claymores, which I think the katana might have an upper-hand against. However, the two-handed cross-hilt claymores are definitely intimidating indeed. Against a katana in combat, its very difficult to say who will win as each sword has its pros and cons. Between these two, it's almost to the point where where one sword lacks, the other sword surpasses.</p>
              <p>Still it is an interesting thought! Haha! You sure are tall, for you...either a cross-hilt claymore or an odachi. XD These 2 will suit you very very well! Caesars is bringing in another CAS odachi, the first one got sold off last year if I remember, but I managed to get a glimpse of it. Hopefully might get to see the odachi again.</p>

              <p>*Nods nods* The broadswords were made for smashing armour and the like but its rather heavy. Anyways, its weight contributes to its smashing ability.</p>
              <p>LOL, must have self control la....owning a sword isn't as simple as it seems. Sure, the swinging it around carefully part can be fun, but one must also commit to cleaning, oiling and maintaining the parts ever so often *curses Singapore's humid weather*. XD</p>

              <p>Hiya ppl..</p>
              <p>There is no such thing as "real" or "fake" swords.. This concept of &lt;real vs fake&gt; is simply whether the sword is forged with vanadium  steel(ie. real) or with iron(ie. iron).. Most European blades, in authorised local retailor outlets, are forged with vanadium steel, whereas Asian blades are forged with iron and coated with other non-rust metals..</p>
              <p><em>*Therefore, no such thing as real sword or fake sword*</em></p>
              <p>However, the owner of the sword must never brandish the edges of the sword.. (aka. not to sharpen)</p>
              <p><strong><em>*All blade type weapons sold locally are non-brandished*</em></strong></p>
              <p>Those who claim that they are selling "sharpen" swords are doing so at their own risk..</p>
              <p>Pertaining to the licence, just keep the purchase receipt and ensure that it is in legible condition.. (ie. date of purchase, retailor address, receipt number etc.)</p>
              <p>Hope this information helps.. ^^V</p>

              <p>Hiya again..</p>
              <p>How much "damage" a sword can do (ie. cut trees, cut metal etc.) depends on 5 factors..</p>
              <p>1. Weight of the blade;</p>
              <p>2. Condition of the blade (ie. brandished or blunt);</p>

              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Umm...I think I've probably heard this 'debate' regarding 'real' and 'fake' swords a few times over the sword forums in the past. I'm not saying you're wrong, but my previous posts were catered to helping the general layman understand that some swords are "wallhangers" (for show-only) and there are those meant for cutting excercises.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Anyways, I can't really be bothered with this definition as to me, for a sword appreciator, as long as one can appreciate the beauty of different types of swords and their fittings and is able to tell a high quality blade from an inferior blade, that should suffice. After all, it’s a personal hobby kinda thing, so let technicalities remain technicalities as long as one gets the general idea, it should be good enough.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">As for brandished swords not being sold in Singapore, I'm afraid I have to disagree with that statement. However, I would like to hear your thoughts on this, because you do sound like someone who knows about swords as well and by all means, do share how you came to that conclusion. Note, I'm not trying to say you're wrong or anything, or that I know more than you, I'm just keen to learn more. Thus, I hope you do not misunderstand my intentions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Now, allow me to share why I disagree. Firstly, Caesars carries swords from CAS Hanwei and Bugei, which are well-known sword merchants from overseas. These blades are known to be sharp, quite a number can be said to be razor-sharp and meant for cutting medium to hard targets.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I have personally held and examined many CAS swords in Caesars, they are pretty sharp. I can't see any sign of blunting. I have a Musashi blade from Caesars, bought for me by some friends. The blade is razor sharp in my opinion. The small cut (probably less than 5mm) I received from it due to accidental handling while I was examining the blade before oiling at home is a testament to its sharpness. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">There was no pain felt from the initial cut when the blade just lightly tapped on my hand, which shows how sharp it is. You'll just see blood trickle down your skin and then you realize...there is a cut, only moments later do you feel actually feel a slight pain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">In addition, my Zatoichi Shikomizue just came in weeks ago. It is a sharp blade, not as sharp as the katana I mentioned above, but sharp nonetheless. You can search youtube for the CAS Zatoichi sword cutting videos. However, unlike those people who subjected this sword to more damage than it can handle, I believe this sword is only meant for cutting light targets at most.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Licensing is handled entirely by Caesars if you purchase from them, they'll note down your NRIC and of course, you'll have to be above 18 years of age. Of course, it'll still be good to have that receipt on you stored away safely.</span></p>

              <p><br>As for iron, every steel contains iron (if it doesn't...it isn't steel anymore)....so I have no idea what you're talking about in that line above. Care to clarify what you actually mean?</p>
              <p>As for coating with non-rust metals....this really only applies to 'wall-hanger' swords. In the case of non-'wall-hanger' katanas, I've never heard of the blade being coated. If it was...you wouldn't be able to see the hamon (assuming it is a real hamon). And even for stainless steel 'wall-hangers', there is no need for a coating, because stainless steel is a homogenous mixture.</p>

              <p>Heheh....as far as tonfas are concerned, I actually regret not buying the bladed tonfas held by Kroenen in the Hellboy movie. It's quite a masterpiece in its own right.</p>
              <p>Anyways, heres two pics of mine:</p>

              <p><br>LOL, thread revived....</p>
              <p>Hi Zackthemad, I've checked out the video link you provided. *Grits teeth a little* Haha, it's just my personal opinion, but the actionflex swords are really too flexible to able to simulate real sword combat. The shinai combat scenes were better.</p>
              <p>Another thing that I'm rather concerned about is Samurai Sports Singapore...any idea who is heading it? Or at least, the name of the Sensei/instructor and which school of Kenjutsu he is trained under?</p>
              <p>No offence, but as far as I can tell from the videos on the website (and the fact that they even teach this art to children), this looks to be a modern take on the art, rather than actual traditional Kenjutsu. The key quotes from the website that seem to give me this impression are: "<span style="font-size: x-small;">principles of accelerated learning"</span> and "All students are to note that they have to clock <strong>12 hours</strong> of lessons before they are eligible for grading". However, do correct me in anyway if I've unintentionally wronged your dojo. My intention is just to find out more since I too am currently learning a style of Japanese swordarts.</p>
