              <p>i did my survey for swords in the past few years too and so far there are no real swords being sold in singapore,all those swords exists are replicas of real swords.</p>
              <p>i know of only one such shop that sells different kinds of martial arts material ranging from weapons to books and they sell this sword replicas,it costs from $400-800,and they are blunt..u can only kill someone if u thrust(pierce) them,or else u cant even cut a carrot with it.</p>
              <p>these swords cant be sharpen or else u risk damaging it or might even break it because the metal they use are very poor and does not have strength,thats why the govt gave the green light go for such shops to sell them..as they are weak and blunt.</p>
              <p>if u do surveys of websites selling real swords from japan or USA u might be surprise at how much is the cost for real swords,the cheapest is equal to the sum of the pay of low ranked firefighters by THREE to FOUR months.</p>
              <p>so its either u get the replicas or import the real swords and go through licensing with the customs which high chances u wont get the license to own it at all...</p>

              <p>u tried it?it all depends on who forge it,the length and the ingredients,the layers of steel,how authentic..its all about quality.</p>
              <p>maybe because i just wanted an excellent real sword if i want to buy a real sword.</p>
              <p>an im talking about those fame sword quality like muramasa,masamune,and kotetsu just to name a few.</p>
              <p>these swords can not only just cut a tree,but a thick armor as well.though those swordsmith are gone,theres still some who can make those kind of swords similar to the famous swordsmith,therefore it is expensive.</p>
              <p>the real swords u talking about maybe is just a mass made sword from a factory with no distinct qualities.</p>

              <p>If you really want you can go taiwan and make... there is this master in taiwan that is renowned for making swords and the swords that he made are replicas of many of the ancient swords. Many of his swords are being used in movies like the hidden dragon and crouching tiger and such...</p>
              <p>He is the master in making such swords and you can have the jade sword... and not only sword, you can make a spear, a knife and even the hammer!!!</p>
              <p>The best thing is in his furnace, he added human bones to the fire and therefore it is said that human bones are part of the swords that he made. he said something like the spirit would be embedded in the sword and things like this.</p>
              <p>But i only know he is a man in his 50-60s and is living in Taiwan, which part i am not sure though.</p>

              <p>Hmm...the most straight forward, yet simple answer would be Caesars (Website: <a href="http://www.caesars.com.sg">www.caesars.com.sg</a>). They have 3 outlets in Singapore, main showroom and retail outlet is at Plaza Singapura top floor, the other 2 outlets are at Raffles City and Suntec City.</p>
              <p>I have been a sword appreciator for about 7 years now with knowledge centered around katanas (yes, real ones...not cos-play ones) rather than Chinese or medieval weapons. However, only recently, within the year have I started collecting katanas. Perhaps I will post pictures sometime...though I must admit I'm just replying to this post out of boredom while sitting at my office desk. XP, so forgive me if I go off-track a little (or a lot XD).</p>
              <p>Unlike what a lot people have posted above....all I can say is...*shakes head in slight disappointment* that they dont know much about swords.</p>
              <p>Anyways, just out of curiousity, what kind of 'real' sword are you looking to get? I say 'real' in inverted commas because tying that definition to a sword is just too vague and does not do the art of sword-making justice. Especially if, to you, 'real' is something that is only within a price range. Haha...that would indeed be silly indeed.</p>
              <p>So yea, if you understand what I'm getting at. Do feel free to be more specific in your questions regarding swords. I'll help ya out in your understanding as much as I can and perhaps for those here would are interested as well. Yea, so just shoot me questions....not with a gun please...XP.</p>

              <p>Truth be told though, those who own such swords have already customized the sword specifications to suit their own needs. In essence, a katana is supposed to encompass the 'resonating spirit/warrior spirit' of the user. So yea, its very unlikely they will part with it at all and anyways the sword specs might not suit the next owner. More often than not, it is tradition to pass on such a sword to a close family member or friend.</p>

              <p>cobra,I may not know much about the making of a real sword and having one,but hope the basic info about them suffice me for now.</p>
              <p>i too have taken interest in swords,but in the art of satsujin-ken,not for its beauty only. so i also did a bit of research regarding how it was made and how much it would cost at least.</p>
              <p>and true enough,its very expensive.the cost i mentioned was quoted by an american smith in their website.and yeah im interested in katanas,not double edged or funny shaped european and chinese swords.</p>
              <p>anybody would know that they're going to be expensive if they did some RESEARCH on the sword-making process and the different parts that comes with it...$900 for high end that can cut trees?its a joke man.</p>
              <p>i dont intend to pursue in buying a live blade if i just want it coz it could cut through this and that coz its not practical,its a waste of time and money for the likes of me and fireng</p>
              <p>the replicas are sufficient.and...did i mention if we attempt to sharpen these replicas we might actually break em?haha</p>

              <p><br>basically, a 'real' sword is just a piece of professionally treated and sharpened metal</p>
              <p>the ability of a 'real' sword to cut through stuff depends on the skill of the wielder as much as the quality of the sword</p>
              <p>cut through metal?<br>i can use a butcher knife to chop a 3cm thick aluminium block in half. is that what you are looking for?</p>
              <p>cut through armour?<br>what armour? kevlar armour? medieval knight armour?</p>
              <p>kevlar armour, design to stop bullets can be easily penetrated with any sharp, pointed object. kevlar armour is somewhat effective againts slashing attacks but fails completely againts stabbing attacks (subjected to the skill of the wielder)</p>
              <p>i would suggest for you to get some hth training first as an unarmed hth trained opponent can be more dangerous than an untrained opponent with a weapon.</p>
              <p>it is also more satisfying to kill with your bare hands</p>

              <p>I find that PedoBear's definition of a 'real' sword is a very good general statement.</p>
              <p>However, do let me take it further a little. To most sword appreciators (not all ar..), a real sword is at least a sharpened forged high-carbon steel blade. The key words here are 'forged' and 'high-carbon steel'. Do take note that there are many grades of steel and only some are suitable for making 'real' swords. But I won't go into detail what they are cause a simple search will yield some results.</p>
              <p>The next higher level classification would be a fully forged and differentially tempered blade. And of course, as mentioned before, the highest classification level would be the folded blades.</p>
              <p>Take note, though I have named these classifications there are still many manufacturing processes (if you happen to study metallurgy and manufacturing processes under Materials Science next time, you'll get to learn some of them) that will affect the toughness and quality of the blade. Thus, within each classifcation, there will always be a low-end and high end series of blades. Makes sense too!</p>
              <p>*Smiles* Ah, I see you're familiar with SatsuJinKen. *Giggles and points at LoudnessFZ* The force is strong in this one!</p>
              <p>For those who are unfamiliar with the term, this is the definition pulled off AikiWiki which is basically a site for Aikido-related stuff:</p>
              <p>' "The sword that kills." Although this would seem to indicate a purely negative concept, there is, in fact, a positive connotation to this term. Apart from the common assumption that killing may sometimes be a "necessary evil" which may serve to prevent an even greater evil, the concept of killing has a wide variety of metaphorical applications. One may, for example, strive to "kill" such harmful character traits as ignorance, selfishness, or (excessive) competitiveness. '</p>
              <p>Anyways, I do know what you're getting at LoudnessFZ. And I would agree that a lot of martial arts hold that same view, though in this time and age, it is necessary to refrain from killing. XD</p>
              <p>For me, my love for katanas brought about an interest in Japanese swordplay as well. My main interests would be iaido and battojutsu. Though, no such schools in Singapore exist (I'm not sure if there is a ban against these 2 forms of swordplay in Singapore, but I doubt there is).</p>
              <p>Anyways, American blacksmiths quote signifcantly lower prices, so do China ones. It isn't necessarily bad. But of course, you can't beat the Japanese at their own art and dedication placed into making a sword that is a symbol of their culture. So in essence, Japan-made katanas are always thought to be of the highest quality, especially those made by members of the ancient swordsmith families which are still alive today.</p>
              <p>Replicas have two categories, the display piece and the functional replica of an ancient but famous sword, usually belonging to some famous person. Either that or it is referring to the sword geometry and design from a particular era.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, you're quite right about swords breaking during sharpening. If it is the stainless steel replica (usually 440 stainless steel), then yes! These buggers aren't meant to take impact. As for the 'forged' and 'forged and differentially tempered' ones, they aren't meant for sharpening, but you can still sharpen them and they won't break that easily, more like bend. XD Last but not least, the shinkens can be sharpened.</p>
