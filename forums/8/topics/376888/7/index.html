              <p><br>I did a little research on WKC just now and also spoke to a friend this evening regarding that brand. As I said before, I'm not too familiar with it...umm...doesn't seem to be that well marketed as compared to other brands. However, my friend and I agreed that the quality of the swords seem quite good (their average quality could beat CAS's average range). However, according to what I read on their site, they are using modern methods to make the blades. So don't expect something traditional.</p>
              <p>The blades are supposedly made in Solingen, Germany. According to my friend, it is a well known as the city for knives. It is a well known fact that a lot of knife craftsmen there made bayonets and knives for the Third Reich. However, how good they are at katanas is anyone's guess.</p>
              <p>Judging from some blade geometries, I'd say their line of katanas will excel in soft-med hardness target cutting. Hope that helps.</p>

              <p>Of the 3 WKC blades on sale, the blue Hand Forged Folded Steel Katana seems to be the best made in terms of geometry. I can't tell much from the small photos cause I usually need really up-close pictures to judge properly but the fittings seem to be relatively good quality and the hamon (seems to be of kikusui design) has a nice hada showing.</p>
              <p>Again, these WKC blades don't seem to be built for hard target cutting. You may cut hard targets if you wish, however, you will notice that the edge blunts very fast because the edge geometry is not made for that purpose. All in all, a fine blade worth collecting. I wouldn't consider the WKC Tamahagane katana as the geometry isn't to my liking, I see some sections which just look kinda weird. Which is a pity cause the blade itself shows fine hada, though I can't say how pronounced it is by judging from small pics.</p>

              <p>I'm not familiar with Imperial Forge, but heard of them before. Cheness is definitely well known as well as Cold Steel. Can't say which brand is more famous though cold steel likes to advertise its blades as being able to take up a lot of punishment. It really depends which product model is good or not, even famous brands make mediocre blades as well as good blades.</p>
              <p>Therefore, I suggest for now, you should just compare which models you like. I can't give you an overview of the brand really, unless its a very exceptional brand. These brands however, all fall under the average to above-average category, so theres not much to compare.</p>

              <p><br>*Nods* For my level, I prefer looking at custom blades and fittings so I usually don't spend much time looking at brands unless they offer customization options. One brand stands out so far and it's Red Dragonfly Swordart.</p>

              <p><br>LOL! Oh nice! They managed to bring in a Butouken (the brand is commonly referred to as Martial Art Swords (MAS))! Yea, this brand is nice and solid, though I did hear that sometimes (depends on batch) the fittings shaked a little (very little though). I'm pretty sure they upped their QC by now. They are a well-known brand and make good swords (based in Korea).</p>
              <p>I would definitely prefer to get this sword compared to the other brands we discussed that were brought in by House of Swords.</p>

              <p><br>The link you provided is expired. But anyways I did a search and yes that purple sword is from Red Dragonfly Swordart. I was actually thinking of purchasing that blade from the company directly some months back. The fittings are silver. Quality-wise I believe this sword is exceptionally good but I can't tell much about the intricate designs on the blade cause the pics provided are not up close.</p>
              <p>You might want to email house of swords for up close pics.</p>

              <p><br>Umm...sorry I can't disclose how sharp swords are brought in. Basically, sharp swords are restricted items, the police will inspect any incoming swords be they sharp or not. Sharp swords will be blunted if the police forsee that one is incapable of handling these weapons or properly storing them, especially if you have little knowledge on these items.</p>
              <p>For me, I'm a practioner. So I can easily attain a licence to bring in swords for my own use.</p>
              <p>To find out more, I suggest you refer to the police arms and weapons division website.</p>

              <p><br>Yea, you will have to ask a local distributor company to bring in the swords for you. And seriously, I believe I've already stated that I went to Caesars for my shikomizue because it is a concealed weapon though I did not use the specific term, difficult for me to bring it in on my own as these items are restricted.</p>
