              <p><br>Hi RoyFang!</p>
              <p>Before reading on, please note that I am speaking for carbon-steel katanas and not stainless steel/decorative swords.</p>
              <p>Sword maintainence is simple enough and it definitely isn't as costly as the sword itself. However, it is time-consuming and takes a lot of dedication.</p>
              <p>There's 2 types of maintainence: 1) Fast/Quick Cleaning and 2) Full Maintainence</p>
              <p>The quick cleaning is simple enough to do and should be done once a week or once in 2 weeks (up to you really). Basically, you remove the old oil coating, and spread a new oil coat over the blade. You also polish off rust spots if any before applying a new coat of oil (this should be common sense).</p>
              <p>Then theres the full maintainence. This one's a hassle, but should be done every once in 3-6months, depending on the type of steel your sword is made of. Basically, its similar to the quick cleaning, except this time, you strip the entire sword of its fittings till you get a bare blade. Then you do the maintenance.</p>
              <p>To illustrate my point, here are some of my photos when I did a full maintanence cleaning.</p>

              <p>LOL, thread revived....</p>
              <p>Hi Zackthemad, I've checked out the video link you provided. *Grits teeth a little* Haha, it's just my personal opinion, but the actionflex swords are really too flexible to able to simulate real sword combat. The shinai combat scenes were better.</p>
              <p>Another thing that I'm rather concerned about is Samurai Sports Singapore...any idea who is heading it? Or at least, the name of the Sensei/instructor and which school of Kenjutsu he is trained under?</p>
              <p>No offence, but as far as I can tell from the videos on the website (and the fact that they even teach this art to children), this looks to be a modern take on the art, rather than actual traditional Kenjutsu. The key quotes from the website that seem to give me this impression are: "<span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">principles of accelerated learning"</span></span> and "All students are to note that they have to clock <strong>12 hours</strong> of lessons before they are eligible for grading". However, do correct me in anyway if I've unintentionally wronged your dojo. My intention is just to find out more since I too am currently learning a style of Japanese swordarts.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes we are very modern =)</p>
              <p>Firstly I do admit that actionflex swords are too flexible for actual simulation. What we are simulating is actually the length and distance of the katana. The truth is regardless of the flexibility of the equipment in question, you still received a clean hit from a katana-length weapon =) I'll really liked it if you come down to our training center in singapore to try ^^</p>
              <p>Our founders for the current system are David Sabobel and James Wee. They learned Kashima Shin Ryu and Toyama Ryu respectively.</p>
              <p>And we have deviated from the traditional method in the sense that we believe most people nowadays don't have the time to learn a martial art properly, so we fast-forwarded our lessons.. A lot. What we learn exactly you might want to come down and find out. However, we do follow traditional culture and etiquette.</p>
              <p>Lastly, no offence taken. ^^ What sword art do you learn?</p>
              <p>P.s: Damn I need to shake this lengthy way of writing.. and this is fail because I couldn't figure out how to quote before &gt;.&lt;</p>

              <p><br>Hi Zack!</p>
              <p>*Nods* Thanks for the info you provided, I now understand better where you're coming from. I only hope I didn't come across as offensive in any way, if I did, I do apologise.</p>
              <p>My reason for being skeptical initially is because I tend to prefer martial arts to be taught in a more traditional form rather than a modern take. But as you said, generally people nowadays dont have the time to dedicate themselves to such arts and I fully agree with ya. The fact that your instructors have trained in reputable schools puts me at ease too.</p>
              <p>The sword art I'm currently training in follows a more traditional approach and is based off Toyama-ryu and Aikido. I'll pm you the name (check your mailbox) as I've decided against posting it in public since a number of the forumers here aren't exactly serious in martial arts. Or at least, I fear that they abuse it after learning it. Haha, I've seen enough of such cases stemming from the more famous and popular martial arts around and it gets quite sickening at times. Hope you understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
              <p>PS. : As for lengthy writing, don't worry about it. You weren't spouting nonsense, you said what you needed to say and I understood it perfectly. Cheers and thanks!</p>

              <p>But on a more serious note, the best ones are probably found and ordered online but the question is, can you afford them. And even if you could...would you spend that money?</p>
              <p>Even then, the German/Japanese branded knives and choppers sold commercially in Sg do the job just fine. Takashimaya would be my choice to shop for such stuff.</p>

              <p>Hi all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is my information on Japanese swordsmanship, or authentic Kenjutsu, as there is some interest and discussion on it here in Singapore. I will write what I know here and try to put it down in a condensed form as there is way too much info on the subject to write down atm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will, in all likelyhood, get some people angry on this forum with my post but I'm long past caring about it already. If you don't think I'm comfortable with what I'm going to write, feel free to log off now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Authentic Kenjutsu is taught as part of the overall curriculum of a <em><strong>Koryu. Koryu are the old martial schools/traditions founded in Japan as martial/military schools for the Bushi before 1867(I prefer the term Bushi rather than Samurai). Kenjutsu was one of the main fighting skills. As such, there was and is no such thing as generic Kenjutsu. A Bushi would be trained in a certain Koryu style that identified him as a very distinct swordsman from another Bushi. For example, Bushi trained in the Yagyu Shinkage Ryu would be characterised by their wait-and-respond approach to an enemy rather than say, a Jigen Ryu Bushi who would initiate an attack with all out ferocious strikes. If you were to tell me that you train in Kenjutsu, the 1st thing I would ask you would be "What is the Ryu that you train in?" </strong></em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That brings me to the next point. Koryu is rare. Even in Japan, the local population are hardly aware of its existence. Authentic teachers possess teaching licenses that are passed from their own teachers and are given a heavy responsibility to ensure that the Ryu they inherit are passed on to the next generation in a proper way. It is rare to find Koryu outside of Japan but the foreigners who are authorise to teach a Koryu tradition are indeed very exception people who spent a lot of time and effort to learn the tradition inside out (Think 10 yrs or so in Japan...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Koryu is very different from its modern counterparts like Judo, Kendo or Aikido even though the latter is descended from the former. For a start, Koryu teachings are very extensive. It is more than just learning how to use a sword in combat but also learning other weapons like spears or staffs and other knowledge ranging from human anatomy (Bushi needed to know the vital spots of a human body to make their attacks instantly lethal) to the wearing of armour to esoteric buddhist rituals and chants. Also, paired kata is the main teaching method in the koryu (yes, I can immediately hear people groaning and complaining that "Wa lau eh...Kata very boring one ah...") as the techniques are too dangerous for free sparring and kata is one of the main reasons why a lot of these ryu are still able to preserve their tradition into the 21st century. Some koryu have experiemented with free sparring but none have replaced their kata with anything else.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I searched high and low in Singapore for an authentic Koryu teacher and all I found so far are...very, very wierd, anime, samurai xbox 360 fantasy things that are attempting to pass themselves off as authentic kenjutsu. There is no koryu here in Singapore as far as I know. For someone who wants to learn Japanese martial arts, it is best to learn Kendo or Aikido. They may be modern arts but they are descended from Koryu and have more intergrity in them than the b***s**t that is masquerading as Kenjutsu and badly misinforming the public and schools about what they teach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will post more about where to find more info on the Koryu and some of the famous ones still in existence in another post.</p>

              <p>The list of authentic Koryu being taught today is a little too long but I will put the most famous ones that most people know of here and a small description of them:</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ry</span>u - A very famous ryu closely associated with the Katori Shrine and founded in 1447. Taught at Chiba prefecture by Otake Risuke Shihan.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yagyu Shinkage Ryu</span> - The official training ryu of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Closely associated. with Zen Buddhism. Taught in different places in Japan and in numerous lines</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ono-Ha Itto Ryu</span> - The other official training ryu of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Modern Kendo is heavily influenced by this ryu. Noted for being a dueling school utilising just long and short swords.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Niten Ichi Ryu </span>- Founded by Japan's most famous warrior, Miyamoto Musashi. This school is noted for its 2 sword (Nito) fighting techniques.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Takenouchi Ryu</span> - Although Kenjutsu is the main curriculum of most schools, some schools focus on other types of combat. Takenouchi Ryu focuses on Jujutsu, armoured and unarmoured, with and without weapons.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shinto Muso Ryu</span> - This ryu teaches how to use the Jo, a short staff, to defeat a swordsman. Legend has it that the founder of this ryu defeated Miyamoto Musashi in a duel and allowed him to live.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Araki Ryu</span> - Another jujutsu ryu that is characterised by very ferocious close combat with short weapons like daggers and short swords and the use of a special chain weapon called a chikiriki. This ryu has a very merciless attitude to combat. Definitely NOT for the faint of heart.</li>
              </ol>

              <div>As I mentioned before, most things in Singapore are made-up fantasy, xbox 360 video game b***s**t that is pretending to be the authentic stuff. If someone really wants to study actual koryu, it will not come easily. You have to be prepared to leave Singapore for a period of time to find an authentic teacher and be prepared to study with him or her for awhile. But if you choose to do so, it will change your life perspective forever and you won't ever see martial arts...and life itself...again ever in the same way.</div>

              <p>The list of authentic Koryu being taught today is a little too long but I will put the most famous ones that most people know of here and a small description of them:</p>
              <p></p><ol>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tenshin Shoden Katori Shinto Ry</span>u - A very famous ryu closely associated with the Katori Shrine and founded in 1447. Taught at Chiba prefecture by Otake Risuke Shihan.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yagyu Shinkage Ryu</span> - The official training ryu of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Closely associated. with Zen Buddhism. Taught in different places in Japan and in numerous lines</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ono-Ha Itto Ryu</span> - The other official training ryu of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Modern Kendo is heavily influenced by this ryu. Noted for being a dueling school utilising just long and short swords.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Niten Ichi Ryu </span>- Founded by Japan's most famous warrior, Miyamoto Musashi. This school is noted for its 2 sword (Nito) fighting techniques.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Takenouchi Ryu</span> - Although Kenjutsu is the main curriculum of most schools, some schools focus on other types of combat. Takenouchi Ryu focuses on Jujutsu, armoured and unarmoured, with and without weapons.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shinto Muso Ryu</span> - This ryu teaches how to use the Jo, a short staff, to defeat a swordsman. Legend has it that the founder of this ryu defeated Miyamoto Musashi in a duel and allowed him to live.</li>
              <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Araki Ryu</span> - Another jujutsu ryu that is characterised by very ferocious close combat with short weapons like daggers and short swords and the use of a special chain weapon called a chikiriki. This ryu has a very merciless attitude to combat. Definitely NOT for the faint of heart.</li>

              <p><br>Hiya Iaido77,</p>
              <p>You do seem very passionate about what you wrote, though there's no need to curse/swear yea, someone interested in learning such martial arts should be disciplined enough to control one's emotions.</p>
              <p>As this is a forum thread, ppl here just share what they know (or think they know) and thats about it. No need to get angry k, after all, everyone's entitled to their own opinions and everyone's learning.</p>
              <p>That said, as someone who was also searching for authentic 'old/original' schools of Japanese Swordmanship for the past 8 years or so. I'd agree that it is very difficult to find these in Singapore and I have also come to the conclusion that there are none. However, there are Japanese Swordmanship schools in Singapore that teach, how should I put it...'an interdisciplinary mix of skills' derived from the original schools as those you have named above.</p>
              <p>Do check your PM mailbox. I've decided that it's better to take our discussion there since we're straying away from the thread topic. XD</p>

              <p><br> Hi RoyFang!</p>
              <p>Before reading on, please note that I am speaking for
              carbon-steel katanas and not stainless steel/decorative
              swords.</p>
              <p>Sword maintainence is simple enough and it definitely isn't as
              costly as the sword itself. However, it is time-consuming and takes
              a lot of dedication.</p>
              <p>There's 2 types of maintainence: 1) Fast/Quick Cleaning and 2)
              Full Maintainence</p>
              <p>The quick cleaning is simple enough to do and should be done
              once a week or once in 2 weeks (up to you really). Basically, you
              remove the old oil coating, and spread a new oil coat over the
              blade. You also polish off rust spots if any before applying a new
              coat of oil (this should be common sense).</p>
              <p>Then theres the full maintainence. This one's a hassle, but
              should be done every once in 3-6months, depending on the type of
              steel your sword is made of. Basically, its similar to the quick
              cleaning, except this time, you strip the entire sword of its
              fittings till you get a bare blade. Then you do the
              maintenance.</p>
              <p>To illustrate my point, here are some of my photos when I did a
              full maintanence cleaning.</p>
