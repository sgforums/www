              <p><br>Caesars. If you read my previous posts, I think it'd be pretty obvious.</p>
              <p>Anyways, how old are you Joey? Or if you're not comfortable in revealing your age, what standard are you studying at (eg. secondary, poly, jc, uni)? To own a sword, you have to be 18 and above, just so you know.</p>

              <p>Haha, if age is not a factor then all's good.</p>
              <p>Oh, the other two swords are custom iaitos from Japan. Those I ordered myself, not through Caesars or Sheares. Hope that answers your question.</p>

              <p><br>An iaito is a unsharpened blade. Basically meant for practitioners who require something of similar balance and weight to a live blade. Umm...I won't say where I got my iaitos from but you might try Tozando if you're really interested, they're a big company from Japan and make very good iaitos. Usually an average quality beginner piece will cost you around S$700 (shipping and licence included).</p>

              <p>Hmm....it really differs from person to person, with budget being the major factor. I suggest you state down a rough price range, either in SGD or USD so I may assist you better. Also, do let me know your preferences and what you'll be doing with your sword (eg. for display or iai-practice or batto-practice...).</p>
              <p>*Do remember that carbon-steel swords also require maintenance, which means oiling it weekly (or once in 2 weeks) and doing a full strip-down every 6 months. If you want to avoid this, get a stainless steel sword!</p>
              <p>Personally, I prefer saving up for really good pieces which are both functional and aesthetically beautiful. However, chances are that my preference usually leads me to select expensive swords. On the other hand, I also do like unusual, aesthetically beautiful (but perhaps not very functional) collector items from time to time like the shikomizue. Haha, *shrugs* I just find it cool having a sword that looks like a walking-stick when sheathed. Stealthy indeed.</p>

              <p><br>With all due respect JP, I enjoy discussions (which basically requires some level of knowledge/opinion sharing between 2 or more parties). I like helping people with similar interests...however, there's comes a time where I draw the line between those who are truly interested in something and those who are just in for a Q&amp;A session thinking they can gain understanding faster that way.</p>
              <p>To put it simply, I dislike spoon-feeding people. It isn't my job and I'm not getting paid for it. Any mature person, would know that there is no free lunch. I believe you're mature enough to do some research on your own, then ask what you want to know showing 'proof' that you did some readings on your part. Get my drift?</p>
              <p>Please know that I mean no offence at all, its just that I don't like the way you're just asking general questions and expecting a reply. I asked you for your budget, preferences and sword-usage for a reason but didn't recieve an answer. It helps narrow down choices. You can't expect me to summarize what I know in a single post with a general question like that because quite frankly I wouldn't even know where to start. Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, to me, functional and aesthetically beautiful swords can begin with a minimum price of US$8000.</p>
              <p>The key here is how to distinguish details, something you wouldn't know how to do at a beginner level. Anyone can then simply put a sword in front of you and say its good and you might just blindly believe them.</p>
              <p>If you're just interested in buying a sword without knowing a thing about it, then simply walk into Caesars. Simply put, there's many swords there that look nice and are relatively functional.</p>

              <p>Haha, well I'm not a staff of Caesars for sure but I do go there often. They do make purchasing of swords very convenient which is why I recommend beginners to go there. Only 2 stores in Singapore sell swords as far as I know, Sheares and Caesars. Sheares, however, specializes more in knives. So if you love knives as well, I totally recommend you check that place out. :)</p>
              <p>A little point to note though, high end swords are not mass produced and do not have a brand. They do however, go by the swordsmith's name.</p>

              <p><br>I checked out what brands House of Sword is carrying, basically Cheness, Paul Chen Hanwei (CAS) and Cold Steel are average brands. Not sure about WKC brand though, doubt I've heard of them before. *Shrugs* Seems like an average brand too, but I would trust the first 3 brands I listed since they're more reknown internationally.</p>
              <p>They are all practical, but some cut better than others cause they were designed for practioners.</p>

              <p><br>Unfortunately I've never visited Sheares, but a few of my friends frequent there cause they're knife collectors as well. From what I hear, Sheares tends to blunt their blades (shrugs, I can't be certain so don't quote me on this), but they do carry CAS Hanwei and Cold Steel if I remember correctly since my friend just bought a cold steel bokken from them.</p>
              <p>Ah yes, CAS Paper Crane! I held that sword before. I must say that the fittings and theme is very beautiful and of good quality. It is also one of the top line blades from CAS. Personally, I quite love the Choji hamon on the blade, it is done fairly well though still not as great as other blades I've seen done by Japan mastersmiths. But of course, we shouldn't compare the two standards since they are on a whole different level. The Paper Crane is truly one of the top blades for it's class.</p>
              <p>My only gripe is, I sincerely doubt this blade is meant for cutting excericises. As in, it won't cut as well as another blade designed for cutting. The Paper Crane is meant as a functional ornamental blade/ceremonial piece and it stands out in that category. *Nods* All in all, its definitely a good sword for collecting. Just remember to maintain it well cause Tamahagane rusts very easily in our climate. I suggest getting a display box to put this sword (cause its expensive) in and then throw in some slica gel packs to reduce moisture damage.</p>
              <p>Yea, if House of Swords can preorder other brands for you then you've hit the jackpot cause I know Caesars is only able to bring in select brands. Caesars will be bringing in Thaitsuki brand (another average brand) in June/July. Models aren't a problem for both companies though (or at least...it shouldn't be).</p>

              <p><br>Cutting blades...hmm...there are 2 basic categories for cutting blades. Those that cut soft targets well and those that cut hard targets well (usually these are the kind that were taken to battle in the past). Of course, most blades are sort of a hybrid mix that can handle soft-med or med-hard. The cutting effectiveness of a blade is determined by blade geometry and polish level. Though in theory, a martial arts grade polish will not cut as well as a high level display-grade polish, in reality, the difference is really very minute. Geometry plays a larger role.</p>
              <p>I really can't go any further into details online cause its just too complex. It's easier for someone to teach you in person when it comes to these type of general questions.</p>
              <p>Brands, you can just do a google search. Basically, there are a lot. And even I can't remember all of them. If you have the names on hand, I can more or less tell you whether they're good or not by looking at their products. Same with models.</p>
              <p>Another point to note is, for practioners, we usually have to measure and note what blade lengths suit us. But since I doubt you'd be using your sword to cut anything, so you needn't worry about that.</p>

              <p><br>LOL, eh? I only bought 1 sword from Caesars which is the shikomizue. My other incoming swords are not bought from them. Don't assume I only buy from Caesars, haha. I only go to them when I'm bringing in restricted items which I might have difficulty getting clearance by myself.</p>

              <p><br>The sword was around $530 if I remember. But I got a 25% discount by using a member card during the birthday month. The brand is CAS. Model is SH2267</p>
              <p>For the last question, frankly speaking I have no idea why you're interested in a superb cutter if you're not a practitioner. *Shrugs* All katanas can cut, but if you're not cutting, go for better fittings and design. Seriously, thats my opinion cause you'll realise that for most factory-produced katanas, those with nice designs don't cut that well and those that cut well usually do not have nice designs.</p>
              <p>However, the closest that meet the mark of "best of both worlds" for CAS's line is Tori XL, Oni Katana, Praying Mantis (I remember reading that this one was a pretty good cutter), Wind and Thunder, Shinto. CAS's has newer swords but since I haven't examined them up close, I can't say much about them.</p>

              <p><br>Haha yea, thats because I've been reading up on Hanwei stuff for years really. Plus, I also held many of their blades before. It isn't just me though, every sword collector knows about Hanwei.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, I can't share on-hand info on other brands because I haven't held much swords from other brands. But if you have a particular sword model in mind, show me a website link and I can tell you whether its worth the money. </p>
              <p>However, I do know of a good brand that works with Paul Chen and some other big names, their QC was in Japan (not sure about now), but anyways, almost all their blades are both beautiful and designed to cut.  The company is Bugei (<a href="http://www.bugei.com">www.bugei.com</a>). And again, Caesars does bring in some pieces from them, not a lot though and its pricer. You might want to consider this brand as their blades are thought to be of above-average to good quality.</p>
