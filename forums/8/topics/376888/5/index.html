              <p>Err....now I'm really am starting to wonder why you want such a sword. LOL... do pardon me,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-Note: I can only speak for katanas as I only specialize in them-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A katana range that is best for cutting through metal armour (more specifically the samurai armour, not chain-mail armour) would be a shinken (aka 'live') blade. These blades are made from folded tamahagane steel or bainite. The Japan-made ones are very very expensive, we're talking <strong>US$10k</strong> min without having included shipping charges. And they take about 6months to manufacture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even so, the US$10k blades are considered the low end in this classification of katanas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You also need to understand that it isn't just the blade but the fittings of the entire katana that are important as well. Any loose fittings will cause the impact shock to get directed to your arms. In addition, the sharpness and hardness of the ha (hard sharpened edge) plays a huge role.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last but not least, whether or not you are able to slice through armour, given you have a superior sharp-edge shinken, also solely depends on your skill and technique.</p>

              <p><br>Yea, for any steel sword produced in Japan, the authorities there require them to be registered. So they will naturally come with the permit and paperwork.</p>
              <p>Personally, I'd prefer to go for a high quality Japan shinsakuto with koshirae, I'd customize one from a good smith. In fact, I already asked for a quote a few weeks back. *Smirks* Not cheap but I kinda expected it to be around that price range from the start.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it should be noted that you can get Japanese-made katanas for lesser than US$6k. However, those are usually made from enthusiasts or blacksmith apprentices. Umm...can't say about the quality of these blades till one actually examines them up close and see how they perform during tameshirigi.</p>
              <p>Hmm....I'm still waiting for my two custom iaitos from Japan to arrive.</p>

              <p><br>Agreed, Caesar's swords are overpriced. However, I should specify that Caesars sells quite a handful practical-grade katanas. By practical I mean, meant for martial artists. But of course, they carry more replicas and anime swords. Perhaps only 15-20% of the swords carried by them meet my definition of practical grade.</p>
              <p>Anyways yes, I too can get hanwei swords for less than 40-50% of the price of what caesars is selling. I have my contacts too, so no big deal.</p>
              <p>Assuming a exchange rate of 1USD = 1.43SGD (buy rate), your SGD 5k would be around...say 3500USD. Umm...didn't I already say that you can find Japan-made katanas at less than US 6k made by enthusiats or apprentices or average smiths. Even if the sword is made of tamahagane, does that make it a good sword? Most definitely not.</p>
              <p>Let me explain: First, there are different grades of tamahagane. Second, heat treament, forging method, lamination method, wielding, sword koshirae fittings and balance...are what determines a good sword. You can get the best material, in this case, tamahagane, give it to an average Japanese smith and he produces you a SGD 5k katana. But does this mean it is a high quality sword? Can I even begin to compare the quality of this sword to one that has been made by a top-ranking smith? I believe you're smart enough to do the math and derive the answer.</p>
              <p>To put it simply, my point is, bad heat treatment can ruin even the best materials. I'm studying materials at the moment, if you like I can show you all the necessary data diagrams another time. You can't just judge the quality of a blade by it's materials, doing so is narrow-minded. Its like saying, oh I have a car made of titanium, it must be a good car. Well, WRONG....you forgot, the engine, wheels and such.</p>
              <p>Also does this mean that the sword meets strict imperial and traditional quality standards of a nihonto? Depends. And this is why Japan rates their smiths by their works. Good smiths produce good swords because of their extensive experience and though they charge a lot for their craftsmanship, you pay for what you get. Look at Howard Clark, one of the best smiths in America, he's only using L6 steel to make his swords. But his katanas are outstanding in terms of quality...you don't see him charging them at SGD 5k.</p>
              <p>Hope you get my drift.</p>

              <p><br>Ah okay, I get your point. Sorry for the misunderstanding on my part, was bloody stressed up from project work just now when I typed my previous post. Haha, ended up ranting in the process.</p>
              <p>Frankly, for the average collector, best to go for a katana within the SGD$2k to 4k range. Chances are, you'll be getting a decent quality forge or even folded steel blade with good balance (not fantastic, but good enough).</p>
              <p>A shinsakuto (newly-made katana) crafted by a good Japanese smith with an above-average polishing finish should cost you US$8 to 10k upwards, shipping excluded. It's not that expensive....but not that cheap either. Hahaha...</p>

              <p><br>Hmm...for starters to intermediates, best go with synthetic Japanese water stones first, the natural water stones cost a bomb. A full set of 8 synthetic stones from 600 or 800 grit onwards will cost around US$300+. Quite affordable if anyone is that serious into polishing, however, acquiring a high level skill in this art is not that simple. In fact, in Japan it takes longer for polisher apprentices to graduate than for swordsmith apprentices.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, an enlightening link. Thanks for sharing Deadstroke! :)</p>

              <p>Yes, I think for the layman, learning the art of sword polishing just takes too much effort and time for just a hobby.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, like I said my interest is more in utility knives. So, if you have anything that you like to sharpen on my 2-30,000+ grit Nakayama feel free to PM me. :)</p>

              <p><br>Hmm...interesting, just did a search on ebay.com.sg. HouseofSwords (user/company on ebay.com.sg) is selling a Cold Steel brand katana, it's pretty well known amongst those practicising Japanese swordsmanship and sword collectors alike.</p>
              <p>Howevever, though the quality is similar in some aspects to Paul Chen Hanwei's CAS brand, they're kinda overpriced in my opinion. The blade is definitely nice though, but if you can't afford it, I suggest sticking to CAS cause its cheaper.</p>
              <p>As for katana knowledge, you can always refer to the previous posts. I think I explained a lot already...however, if you have other questions, feel free to PM me.</p>

              <p><br>XP, Hi Joey!</p>
              <p>Umm...just refer to me as XK will do.</p>
              <p>There isn't a katana club in Singapore persay...however, there are quite a handful of sword collectors in Singapore for sure.</p>
              <p>Basically, I acquired knowledge through the years by reading a fair bit (lots of info on the internet and books). You also have to examine pictures of good swords and if possible, go and examine swords in person. You'll learn a lot more through careful and upfront examination of sword pieces. I can't claim to know a lot cause I've certainly talked with ppl who know a lot more than I do. But everyone's learning day by day, so take it slow and do some homework on your own first. If ya have any questions later, then feel free to approach anyone for help.</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p><br>You can examine swords at Cesars or Sheares. Basic questions, you can ask the sales people there, they do have some basic knowledge.</p>
              <p>Sites-wise, go google seriously. At this point in time, its better that you just read up a wide range, no one site contains all the info. As for beginner books, I suggest you pick up this book called " The Samurai Sword : A Handbook" by John M. Yumoto . Basically it looks like this : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Sword-Handbook-John-Yumoto/dp/4805309571/ref=pd_sim_b_1">http://www.amazon.com/Samurai-Sword-Handbook-John-Yumoto/dp/4805309571/ref=pd_sim_b_1</a> . It is sold locally.</p>

              <p><br>At the moment, two swords. Pictures are on page 3 and 4 of this thread. The shikomizue is basically a collector's item from the Zatoichi series, construction quality is good. The crimson katana is a cheap blade and not of authenthic construction but it was a gift from some friends of mine.</p>
              <p>Got 2 more custom blades on the way from Japan...but they're taking a darn long time.</p>
