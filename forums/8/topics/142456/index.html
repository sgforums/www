Because you never agree to pay them in the first place. If they want to convert from a free service to a pay service, they must first contact you to give you that option, which they failed.<br><br>Anyway you can totally ignore them. Also they cannot sue you as they change term and condition that you did not agreed. Next how can they sue you from USA, also to sue you they need to spend money, which is more then that  80 ++ . It is just a scare tactics .... just ignore them.</div>
