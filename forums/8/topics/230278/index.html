They are at the loosing end but hey nothing personal , just business. If the seller can afford to wait, the buyer is at the loosing end .<br><br>That is how you play the property market . Take it or leave it. I know of some who just force the hands down ....take it or leave it because I can go elsewhere to do this business. Nothing unethical about that especially when a person is forcing overzealous investors who overplayed their hand and need to lose the liability fast.<br><br>That's what my relative did to a developer.
