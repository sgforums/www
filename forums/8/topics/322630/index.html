In Singapore theres not as many Indian and Caucasian couples as Chinese and Caucasian couples mostly because there are lesser Indians in Singapore. But whenever I go to church I can see quite alot of Indian and Caucasian couples. Whats interesting is their CHILDREN! Have you seen their children? They look almost completely Ang-moh! WTF!? Most of the children have brown hair and coloured eyes. Their skin is also very pale and almost white. For example, last Sunday I saw this Indian lady and Ang moh guy. The lady's skin was very black and she looks like a regular Tamil but her baby's hair was ashy blonde and had green eyes. I know that it was her baby because of the facial resemblance.

              Are you talking about Black as in Negro or Black as in Indians?
              
              I think maybe Negroes genes are "thicker" to the extent that when they mix their children look more "negroid".
              
              So far I've seen, most half Chinese half Caucasian people have light yellow almost white complexion. Maybe the half chinese person was half dark skin italian or spanish european? But so far in my life, unfortunately all the Chinese eurasians I've seen don't have coloured eyes or hair.
              
              Anyways back to the topic about half Indian half caucasian Eurasians.

              If I remember correctly, in anthropoloy, Indians are considered Caucasoid. 
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race
              
              I.e. they are of the same physical attributes  minus the skin tone.

              I'm certain she wasnt the maid, judging by her dress, the way she spoke had an accent and she and the ang moh behaved like a couple.
              
              Maybe the child might look more Indian as they grow older...

              There are cases where you have to investigate your ancestry if
              suddenly your baby turned out different .Dont just come to a wrong

              <p><br>Haha, wow thats something. I did some research on that after you mentioned it. True Indians especially Tamil who are known as Dravidians by the way are also caucasoid. But it states that the suffix cauca<span style="text-decoration: underline;">soid </span>doesn't actually have the same meaning as cauca<span style="text-decoration: underline;">sian</span>. But it seems that both these Dravidians have Caucasians share the same ancestral lineage that can be traced back to up to 50, 000 years ago.</p>

              <p>I don’t know why but I’ve seen some Indian and Caucasian couples. In Singapore theres not as many Indian and Caucasian couples as Chinese and Caucasian couples mostly because there are lesser Indians in Singapore. But whenever I go to church I can see quite alot of Indian and Caucasian couples. Whats interesting is their <span>CHILDREN</span>! Have you seen their children? They look almost completely Ang-moh! <span>WTF</span>!? Most of the children have brown hair and coloured eyes. Their skin is also very pale and almost white. For example, last Sunday I saw this Indian lady and Ang moh guy. The lady’s skin was very black and she looks like a regular Tamil but her baby’s hair was ashy blonde and had green eyes. I know that it was her baby because of the facial resemblance. Can someone explain why these half black and half white mix breeds look so caucasian?</p>

              <p>hai yah. This kind of stuff so simple.</p>
              <p>The child, mother (tamil) most likely have half dominant and half recessive gene in which this case, the hair and eyes(green).</p>
              <p>Since tamil does have caucasoid lineage, means the recessive gene is still somewhere in the whole population.</p>
              <p>Most likely the ratio the couple having children with green/blue eyes(recessive) is 1:4. Most likely the other children will have brown/black eyes(dominant)</p>
              <p>Without the dominant gene, then recessive gene trait will show.</p>
              <p>e.g of dominant gene traits = brown/black eyes, black hair, curly hair, role your tongue.</p>
              <p>For reason why chinese and caucasion mixed children dont really look like chinese is because chinese have dominant gene like japanese and south east asians. Black hair, brown eyes etc.</p>
              <p>But if these mixed children get married there is a chance that their children will have the recessive gene traits.</p>
              <p>But also depends on the caucasion partner, if he is pure recessive or half dominant gene trait. Get it?</p>
