              <p>My thread is not stupid by any means, I already stated in a comment previously the reasons why I am asking such question. If you think its stupid, its your right to think. But if you think its stupid then dont bother about and rather waste your time reading something more "smarter". For fuck's sakes you dont have to come and post that stupid comment. Why waste your time and energy on something "stupid"? Am I right?</p>
              <p>But no you decided to post... and even if it was something like, "why do you start a thread like this? why do you care what the children are like?" then thats a different situation. But you posted a remark that people find offensive. Talking about colour and brightness. And now youre being a fucking hypocrite, sucking up what you had previously saud without one ounce of shame and acussing me of being colour conscious.</p>

              <p><br>Well let me tell the true, apparently, u post a damn stupid thread that deserve a damn stupid reply ya, why care about other interracial partner problem, nobody can guess what the baby will be like, <strong>as long as both love each other, love their babies and childrens, why you care about the color and all those silly stuffs. And what is so interesting about their childrens,</strong> and with the quote "WTF" are you implying that they are f**kers. I believe you got some racial problem here. Have some respect for others ya, Nobody, not even the gynaes and doctors can determine and explain the damn silly post you are indicating.</p>

              <p>I get the answer, thanks. So in other words, Indians/Tamils have the genes to coloured eyes and fair hair. But heres something to consider... did the caucasoids 50, 000 ago that decided to migrate towards europe have coloured eye and hair genes? Which in others words the Tamils will also have even though they migrated towrards the subcontinent? I thought only scandanavians (with the exception of australia aborigines) have the blonde hair as a result of sexual selection?</p>
              <p>Mongoloids have recessive coloured eye and fair hair genes? Mate, thus far I have only seen at most dark brown haired and light brown eyes east asian and caucasian eurasians.</p>

              <p>Probably only these two replies deserve any merit in this thread. I strongly agree with huzane89's explanation that the look of mixed children is to do with dominant and recessive genes.</p>
              <p>As for the rest, especially angel7030, perhaps spending 5% of the time you spend here reading a tiny bit of biology will help you sound a little more intelligent in future.</p>

              <p>It is true, Filipinos are not Malays.</p>
              <p>I believe the correct term to group both of them is......Austronesian.</p>
              <p>Austronesian is correct.</p>
              <p>To say Filipinos are Malays, actually is wrong.</p>
              <p>Malay is a smaller sub-group, and they are in Malaysia and parts of Sumatra Indonesia.</p>
              <p>Some people casually or informally use the term 'Malay' to refer to the Austronesian idea. But I believe this is inaccurate and is misleading, because there is a smaller sub-group called Malays and they are distinctively different with other sub-groups in the Austronesian family.</p>
              <p>With regards to Northern Indian and Caucasian....well, u have to check whether they dye their hair or not....</p>
              <p>Maybe it is not natural.</p>
              <p>Anyway if it is natural, I think it is possible.....if Im not wrong there is a grouping called Aryan, and the Northern Indians are Aryan decendants and Caucasians are also a relative of Aryans.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well there is a logical explanation for this just like there is for everything else. Read history , indians are the decendants of the caucasian race. Look at their features and the contour of their hair , its very similar to the Europeans. Skin colour may be dark and that is due to the fact of migration thousands of years ago and the tropical climate. If you look at a Viking from Northern europe , he is whiter than the south american but they are both europeans. So when you mix genetically a Indian and a european, the product will almost be without major differences in features. However if you mix a european say with a korean for example , there will be significant difference in the product formed. Go back to early civilization studies , the answers are all there.</p></div>
