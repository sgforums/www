Wherever I move to even if there is nobody, someone will also come to ask me changing channel(cc).  The person then said, "You asked for it" and he used several characters to defame me.<br><br>Thereafter, his guild members came to threaten me of more defame and saying, their guild will declare wars on me.  Just wondering, this is just a game and I did not even kill-steal or interrupting others but why such nusiance are existing.<br><br>Two of their guild members even using foul languages and abusive words in private mode to me.  They insulted my parents and causing discomfort to me.  I am just curious, it is more than a game and what if even they won.  Is it a glory to bully a lady and all those players doing this on me are guys.<br><br>I noticed after maplestory implemented guild, it causes more harm to other gamers such as bully in group or resulting in gang acts in game.<br><br>Any sharing.</div></blockquote>shut the fcuk up bitc,h!</div>
