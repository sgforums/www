Its interesting how she sees mundane everyday things and describes it in a different manner! Her english also helps make her blog a pleasure to read.<br><br>I have encountered blogs that merely reports what the author does everyday: today I go work, eat nasi brani for lunch then go home...<br>Why would anyone want to read that even if you're the nicest person in the world?<br><br>Xiaxue (not her real name) is ugly I heard. She considers herself pretty but she always declares that all her photos are heavily photoshopped. She never hid that fact, so in a way, although delusional, she never misled her readers.<br><br>At the end of the day, she is just another person, like you and I, finding our way home. If you hate her so much, then try not to fall into her trap and publicise her by creating a thread about her.<br><br>If you think she is bad, wait till you read about steven lim.

So its a different thing, and make up ur bloody idea.<br><br><blockquote>269 is really a good psle score, do you disagree with tt? so what if 'she ended up in poly'? she didnt get a good 'o'level results so she cant get into a good jc or something, so she went to poly. if she goes to jc, then university, study law or something, would you still think she is stupid? so all non-jc and non-university students are stupid lor?</blockquote>Hell ye, 269 is a good PSLE score. Damn, i didnt get 269 too!, actually far from it! Oh dude, I have nothing against non-jc or non-uni students, im just feeding back on the fact that she kaopei Normal Technical student and massively spam her 269 psle grads so I want readers to be well informed and not misled that she's a truly smart person(because readers, on knowing that she kaopei NT students, and kaopei others she dislike as ugly and dumb and that her psle is 269, will naturally assume that she is some NUS Medicine student)<br><br>Pls read my above posts.. u're a bit misguided.<br><br><blockquote>you are just living the standard modular mindset of typical singaporeans.</blockquote>Haha, if i'm. then you are.. so is xia xue. Come on, dont deny the fact that Xia Xue is <strong>NOT</strong> popular with people on the street. Don't believe? Go ask your friends!<br><br><blockquote>she is not pretty, and she never disguised the fact tt she photoshopped all her photos. but her wrong is to post her not-perfect-pictures issit? So you are saying if you are ugly you just live under a rock for your life and dont scareothers lor? if you are ugly you shouldnt go out, you should rot in your room?<br><br>oh, sorry, mistake your intentions. ugly people still ok, short and fat and ugly then jia lat right? so all the short and fat and ugly people quan bu zhua qu qiang bi ok. like tt you satisfied?<br></blockquote>No, i didnt say that. What i wanted to say is that, if you're UGLY, SHORT and FAT and photoshop all your photos, it gives you <strong>NO</strong> right to kaopei others for being UGLY, ie, Ms. Singapore. You get it? Dont put words in my mouth and read properly, pls.<br><br><strong>In conclusion</strong>: Thanks for the post <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
