            <div class='col-md body'>i think my primary school teacher did a wonderful job. she told us never to be a teacher and we all listened. and today we all thanked her for her advise. 20 years later and we still contact her. she is still a teacher and she agrees that the education system have changed.<br><br>During out time, caning is a common affair. now teachers cant even shout at the students. I work in a school, not as teacher but as technical staff and some children are so spoilt that they even smell rotten.<br><br>Teachers are not miracle workers, some become one for the fat pay, some really wanna make the diff in the students life, but the workload already so heavy that so many ppl quit after bond finish. that y every year got teacher recruitment drive. (they make it look like so nice too. haiz all bluff one)<br><br>and MOE will not reply much. oni will say they will look into the matter and discuss blah blah. anything but a straight answer.</div>
