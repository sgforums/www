            <div class='col-md body'>March 17, 2005<br>Why some dedicated teachers call it a day<br><br>FOR a long time, my husband and I have kept our grievances as teachers to dinners with our colleagues.<br><br>Why some dedicated teachers call it a day<br><br>It is difficult to share our woes and sorrows with non-teachers, who assume that we have long holidays, short working hours and a fat pay cheque. It just does not appear to those outside our circle that our job is anything but that.<br><br>Having left teaching after five years of service, I think it is time to set the record straight.<br><br>It is true that a handful of teachers do get away with doing very little work. These are the ones who skive and squirm their way out of any responsibility bestowed upon them. In every profession, there is bound to be black sheep and teaching is no exception. The truth is, for the rest of us, teaching is a lot of hard work and heartache.<br><br>Planning lessons that are engaging, effective and still 'cover' the syllabus is challenging for a 35-period week with three or four classes a day. Research needs to be done, resources compiled, notes and worksheets prepared and printed.<br><br>The actual lesson itself is more draining than the preparation. Teachers are always on 'high alert' in the classroom - discipline problems to handle (ranging from not doing homework to defiance, stealing and, in very rare cases, fighting); rapport to build, which is ongoing (students are not going to learn if they all hate us!).<br><br>Having to handle different sets of 40 or more students in a day's work - where we need to punish and reward, scold and joke with, teach and ensure learning takes place, enforce rules and impart moral values, rein in the egoistic students and give the shy ones confidence - is a daunting task.<br><br>Every comment we make may affect a student's self-esteem, desire to learn, willingness to cooperate with us, goals and ambitions for the future. The truth is we would never know the impact of our reprimands or words of encouragement.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Beyond the classroom, there are still the CCAs, department and committee work that demand our time and energy to plan, coordinate, implement and monitor.</span></strong><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>School programmes and events like camps and concerts are essential to the holistic development of our students but these add on to our already very heavy workload, which is teaching itself. </strong></span><br><br>Parents are a whole new category of problems for teachers. Most are supportive but a few problematic ones can cause a lot of pain for us. Some expect teachers to be on call 24/7; others threaten and abuse us when they do not get their way. Some think that we are miracle workers who can turn failures into distinctions overnight; others just treat us as agony aunts.<br><br>On top of all these, we need to answer to our heads of department and principals when it comes to 'producing' the number of passes or distinctions.<br><br>Teachers teaching the graduating classes are often made out to be the heroes or sinners when the results are released. The pressure is overwhelming. 'Results are not everything' is a myth!<br><br>Despite all these woes, I had no regrets going into teaching. I have had the privilege of getting to know a few batches of fantastic students at Hwa Chong Junior College and Fuhua Secondary School, who still keep in touch with me. They were the reason I decided to teach in the first place and they were definitely the highlight of my teaching career.<br><br>The truth is, teachers are no saints. They have only 24 hours a day just like any one of us, yet their responsibilities and duties are so demanding that their family life and their physical and emotional health are sometimes compromised.<br><br>And I believe that, at the end of the day, teachers who left did so not because they stopped believing in what they did but rather they believed in it so strongly that they did not think they could accomplish all that without making any compromise in the other areas of their lives.<br><br>Elaine Toh-Tan Yee Lin (Mrs)<br></div>

Kids are horribly spoilt and parents are stupidly protective.<br><br>My neighbour who is a skrink has been prescribing medications for calming to his teacher customers.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know of this family....<br><br>The boys are quite vain (ok lah.  which teenager is not).  They dyed their hair during the Dec holiday.  In Jan, they went back to school and were caught by the teachers.  It's against the rule to go to school with dyed brown hair.  The teacher forbid them to attend the lesson.<br><br>Then one of them called the mother to whine.  I was with the mother at that time.  The mother was furious.  She said "I sent my children to school to learn and study.  How can they stop them from entering the class?  Sometimes ah.. the school is too much."  Even though the mother was very close to me.  I have to tell her what is right.  I asked her this "Don't your children know the school rules?  Why didn't they dye their hair black before 2 Jan?"<br><br>I see that this is the norm of today's parents.  And thanks to this kind of parents that we have teachers seeking help from skrinks and students in uniform behaving like ba<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>stards on the streets.</div>
