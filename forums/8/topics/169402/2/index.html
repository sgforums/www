Well, I always thought they stay in Liang Shan Po as a self-ruling teritory, i dun think they move around to fight wars, unless u r talking to about the final war where they help to fight for govt.<br><br>Realistic fiction would omit the "magic" by luo zhen ren and that courier guy (tai zong i i remember correctly). I don't remember who Luo Zhen Ren, maybe u can update me on this. But i do remember there's a emperor called Tang Tai Zong in Tang dantasy.<br><br>Well, suddenly came across my mind and i  feel that it was not a frictional story as i remember there's a documentry about this water margin, where their fort and houses are preserved for historical value.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></blockquote>"The Water Margin" is a story of outlaws, hence it is unlikely there would be any officially documented history about the characters. Most of the events in the book are passed down as common folklore by word of mouth (hence perhaps the addition of some mumbo-jumbo to make things more interesting to mainstream listeners at that time), while the rest came from the writers themselves.<br><br>Though there could be some historical authenticity in the locations and characters like Song Jiang mentioned in the book, these are still being questioned by historians as uprisings and rebellions were common during the tumultuous end of the Northern Song dynasty, so the presence of outlaw forts could not really prove that the events in the book actually took place.<br><br>Personally one would rather think of it as a partially-fictitous story set in a historical background. Maybe half of the things in the book could really have existed and did happen, so the other half would have to come through using creative license, either by the writers or by the folks who passed down the stories.</div>

How real this real history is i also dunno. haha<br><br>If you look at it, lots of stories occur during the Song Dynasty but if you read them, they have conflicting mentions of one another.<br><br>Yang Warriors occur early Song.<br><br>Water Margin later Northern Song. There is some mention that Yang Zhi is the descendant of the Yang Warriors.<br><br>Legend of the Condor Heros, supposedly happening around the same time there was Yue Fei. But this is a purely fiction story.<br><br>Yue Fei, there are some mention of Water Margin heros helping out while the Northern Song is in trouble. BUt how could this happen when Water Margin is fiction??<br><br>Bao Gong (Justice Bao). The stories of Bao Gong spans over 3-4 emperors. How did Justice Bao maintain his "youth" through out?<br><br>Is Ji Gong during Song too??<br><br></div>
