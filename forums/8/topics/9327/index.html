            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.... i decided to set up this column so as to collect as many ways of you wearing and displaying your SPIDZ ID tag. Below are some of my suggestion.<br><br>1. Sew your ID tag at the top back of your t-shirt because this is where i think many people will notice without you feeling paiseh. Try to make it small but not too small untill people cannot see.<br><br>2. Wear it as a removable tatoos when you go clubbing next time. Try to put it around your biceps, wrist or top of hand. And i bet u gonna make MANY new frens that way. Maybe, i'll find someone to launch some kindda party at Zouk where people wearing this tag will get FREE entry. Plus, i also need some sponsor who could make the removable tatoos.<br><br>3. Text books or lecture notes. Just scribble your unique ID tag at those papers to attract more frens.<br><br>4. Make it into a key chain. Just use your own creativity in making them.<br><br>5. Get an iron-on print paper and print your ID tag. You could design anyway you like. But just bear in mind to include the 4 digits number and the alphabet gender. But the best thing is to get the Official ID tag design that i'll be releasing soon so that you could edit it on your computer and then print it. Just grab a white t-shirt and print the ID tag to the front left or right breast area and also to the top back. I also decided to design some logos for my SPIDZ. Just like "No Fear", "Rip Curl" or Quicksilver". Anyone out there who have some good design can contact me....okay. Hey...maybe i'll start some "SPIDZ STREET WEAR". Kewl.....huh.<br><br>Ok lah.....that's all the idea i have. Maybe you have MORE. Why don't you tell me. I'll be giving away own choice of unique ID tag for anyone who can suggest a good ways in wearing the ID tag. Ciao...!!!<br><br>------------------<br>My creationz:-<br><a href="http://r-manx.t2u.com" rel="nofollow">R-Man hOmEpAgE:eXtreme Edition</a><br><a href="http://sfogs.t2u.com" rel="nofollow">SFOGS:Singapore First Online Ghost Stories</a><br><a href="http://i.am/iTEENZ" rel="nofollow">iTEENZ:The Future of Cyber Child</a><br>ICQ: 8934511<br>email: r-manx@t2u.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got to hand it to R-Mann...<br><br>I guess only baboons totally incapable of coherent and productive thoughts will come up with something like SPIDZ... manz... and to think that very same baboon came up with a list of ways to make the tag visible..<br><br>Hello... anybody home?<br><br>Firstly.... why would anyone want to walk around with a number on their clothes? Not only will it make the person look like a convict in his prison garb... it actually spoils the clothes...<br><br>Secondly... the number has to be DAMN FREAKING BIG if they are to be visible from far.. so all your suggestions will be quite useless...<br><br>Thirdly... It's unsightly...<br><br>Fourthly.. if we can design the numbers anyway we want.. who's to know if the numbers really are SPIDZ ID tag and not some numbers scribbled down?? Like a friend's car license plate number... (for those who have been on the moon for the last 20yrs.. yes most license plate numbers are 4 digits as well)<br><br>I could go on and on... but basically.. the point is... the whole idea is dumb... a dumb idea created by a dumb person meant for dumb people to register and use.....<br><br>Hey R-mann.. if you're thinking of making this a dot.com and making money out of it.. then you better think again.... from my experience.. only a crazy company would want to sponsor you..... manz....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.....This SPIDZ site is actually a beta. But i had received many positive respond bout it and a few negative too. But...wat the heck, there's notting to lose for me.<br><br>Here, i will answer some of your question.<br>1. U said that why would anyone wann to wear numbers on their cloth....they look like convict. Well..... teens nowadays are pretty crazy and happenin. They will try to look different. Btw....they still can place the tag anywhere like their backpack etc...<br><br>2. U also said that i have to design the ID tag big enuff to be seen. Hey.....don't be silly. The tag is small enuff but still visible within 2 meters.(eg. from one end of MRT seat to the other)So...you the tag is still readable . Oh...btw...haven't u seen people wear some jersy with BIG number on their back?? Well.....why not apply dis to SPIDZ.<br><br>3. U also said that the number could be anything. And how would people know if the numbers is from SPIDZ.com. Well....i guess, u haven read my FAQ carefully. In there, i stated that the number are unique. Example are 3417F. The combination of numbers and letter can already tell that they are from SPIDZ.com. There are always 4 digit numbers plus and alphabet "F" or "M". "F" for female and "M" for male.<br><br>Ok...guess i answered some of your question.<br>And b4 i ciao, one more idea from me to wear your SPIDZ ID tag.<br><br>Wat about making a friendship band with the SPIDZ ID tag on it. I noe many girls like to do this kindda thing so..... maybe i can have some people ordering tis SPIDZ band from me and get their own personal ID tag on it.<br><br>OK....i'm outta here....<br><br>------------------<br>My creationz:-<br><a href="http://r-manx.t2u.com" rel="nofollow">R-Man hOmEpAgE:eXtreme Edition</a><br><a href="http://sfogs.t2u.com" rel="nofollow">SFOGS:Singapore First Online Ghost Stories</a><br><a href="http://i.am/iTEENZ" rel="nofollow">iTEENZ:The Future of Cyber Child</a><br>ICQ: 8934511<br>email: r-manx@t2u.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh well... if you insist that you are right... who am I to stop you....<br><br>Just don't think it's really "cool" or "in" to be seen being tagged.... special code? oh please... just 4 digit followed by a M or F? Manx....<br><br>2m? what if I saw that the other party a few tables away from me huh? Wouldn't I need to pretend to get near or tail him/her? so the next time we meet someone out of this world.. we look desperately for a number tag which could be anywhere! friendship band, file, clothes, bag, socks, spectacles? tattoo? bracelet? necklace? ribbon? wallet? handbad? suitcase? watch? ring? handphone? pager?<br><br>Manx..... the way I'd had to stare to find the number... people might even think I'm a pervert... especially if the other party is not nearby and you have to make excuses just to walk pass and start scanning everything from head to toe to accessories and other stuff...<br><br>Maybe the driving force behind this idea is good... maybe it might catch on.. but then again.. it's almost as good as saying singapore will win the world cup in 2004...<br><br>Happy dreaming...</div>
