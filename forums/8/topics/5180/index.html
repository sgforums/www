            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone....been away for quite a long while...but now I am back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just wondering, in yesterday's news there was mention of SDU and how it now plans to target undergraduates because it felt that undergrads spend very little time interacting between classes. WHat is everyone's opinion on this ?<br><br>Also, what is the overall impression of matchmaking agencies such as SDU and SDS ? Some people have even cruelly given SDU the label of having "Single, Desperate &amp; Ugly" members ! Is this justified ?<br><br>Comments and opinions are most welcome !

            <div class='col-md body'>The new aim of targeting undergrads is quite ok lor....after all...undergrads also need to spend time and interact with people instead of cooping up in their dorms and study....I am sure undergrads will not mind the chance to get to know more members of the opposite sex..even if it's organised by the SDU/SDS..right?<br><br>SDU = "Single, Desperate &amp; Ugly"?<br>I dunno...I neber go to SDU functions b4....*8-)<br><br>------------------<br><br>Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.</div>

It would almost always guarantee a late marriage. Usually around 26-29.<br>If this continues, i fear that it would be detrimental in the long run.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire, please tell me you're not ONLY into pretty women <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> Hahaha...<br><br>Most of your posting was about SDU people being "ugly"...but probably that is the reason they join ? Just to know more people and insecure that they cannot find the right one. Note that SDU is targeted at UNIVERSITY graduates...which implies that Uni grads are hopeless at finding life partners but can excel in other areas ?<br><br>Being a Uni student, I know that cross-faculty interaction is very minimal, if not non-existent. At least SDU can help to bridge the gap...and let people from different areas meet each other.<br><br>My friend told me that her sister went to visit one of these SDU functions once. She described the guys as "desperate" and "very obvious" in wanting to get to know a girl (presumably to marry her soon !). So this does not show up SDU as a very good place to join.<br><br>As for having a wide social circle before 20, please understand that not everyone is so sociable and charming. I was a very quiet and shy guy in JC...and was shunned by most girls because I was so "dao" (I still maintain that it was MY fault)....and Army was not a good place to meet girls ! That only leaves University...give us a chance.<br><br>To end off...please let us have a more positive impression of SDU...don't judge by their looks. There are probably more nice people there than the people I've met so far in my life...they just wish to communicate and have a chance that so many of us have (to get attached) but never appreciate.<br><br>More comments are welcome. Cheers !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>quite a coincidence!  just did a report on sdu a couple of months back.  man, those sdu people really put a lot of "goodies" in an sdu membership package to entice people to join!  however, the stigma attached to sdu made many pple shun it.  in fact, it got so bad that they made all graduates of ntu / nus automatice members of sdu!<br><br>but hey, in spite of that, i'm sure a sdu membership has its advantages such as lotsa  discounts in many areas (gosh, i think i sound like a cheapo ;p).  but one of the single most important advantage is networking.  you meet all your peers in those functions and boy, those contacts definitely come in handy when you are out there in the workplace (ok, so now i sound both scheming &amp; cheapo. argh~).  of coz, if you r realllllly lucky, you'll find your mate there.<br><br>so pple, don't look on sdu with distaste ok?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure when SDU started, but I'm guessing the proportion of "desparate" people will decrease as time comes.<br><br>I don't know much about SDU, but I think its a good thing that something is done to encourage interaction between people. A lot of people are not as active socially as others, and they need the help. Actually I wouldn't mind some help as well.<br><br>Take single's chat rooms and ICQ for example, you get a proportion of "desparate" even sleazy people. But there are proportions of people earnest about making friends as well.<br><br>So, my point is, I'm guessing that people will come to accept SDU as another way of knowing other people, and the make up of the members would change from what you guys see at the moment.<br><br>Still, I hope people won't look at desparate people and look down on all of them. Loneliness is no joke man.</div>
