              <p>fyi i 'm a guy...... i'm sick of the idea of wat is mine is hers, wat is ours is hers and wat is hers is still hers......... nowadays getting married is not that simple, if your wife is working and you are working(both earning about the same amount), and she thinks that your pay should pay for the household and buy gifts for her, while her pay is for her to keep.....any of you have encounter with this kind of girls? wat the guy signed is not a cert of marriage , but a cert of slavary, especially if the wife cant cook, cant do house work and behave like a queen.....</p>

              <p>I suggest you find a good day, when both of your moods are right for a deep discussion, sit down and calmly work out differences.</p>
              <p>Most women who keeps their own salaries do so out of insecurity. That she does it to you would mean she is fearful that one day she may be left alone with kids. Better have some form of security. Afterall, the traditional role of a man is to be the breadwinner.</p>
              <p>Women had always gotten the shorter end of the stick when a man leaves her. A 50 year old guy can still manage a company or work as a foreman, and get another wife, but no one will hire a 40 year old lady, let alone a 50 year old one, and she can forget about finding another companion at her age.</p>
              <p>I understand her fears, but it would be up to you to reassure her and prove her wrong on her insecurities. Sometimes, words alone are just not enough. Action is needed - let her keep her own salary. If you need funds, i am sure she would pass it over to you so long its an emergency and wont leave you in the lurch, afterall, she's your wife, married and trusted her life to you in your hands.</p>

              <p>Most of us just have our focus on the ends. When we get more money, we can do what we like. Forcing ourselves to endure the hardships just to enjoy the final rewards at the end, while forsaking enjoying the journey itself.</p>
