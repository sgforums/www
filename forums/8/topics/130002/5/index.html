            <div class='col-md body'>happen to see this story from another forum, jus take a look<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Hearing his demise, i would like to share my experience with the man himself, the late Dr Wee Kim Wee.<br><br>I was in a primary school near siglap, where he stayed.<br><br>1 day after soccer, my soccer friends &amp; myself would always go to a coffeeshop along Frankel Avenue. Older guys should know Dawood. As we were walking out, one of my friend told us that the president at that time, which was Dr Wee Kim Wee stayed just off the route.<br><br>Being curious, we decided to walk &amp; have a look at his house. Afterall, how many of us saw a President's house before?<br><br>Soon after, we were in front of his gate, which was not see through. In fact, we cannot see into the compound at all.<br><br>Not long after, a police guard came out of the gate.<br><br>"Boys, do not stay here." The policeman beckoned.<br><br>Behind him came an elderly figure.<br><br>"Dont frighten the young boys." came a voice. He came to the gate. Its Dr Wee!<br><br>"Come in boys. You boys want to have a drink?" Dr Wee said as he pulled open his gate to welcome us.<br><br>Apprehensive, we exchanged a few looks among ourselves. Paiseh lah...<br><br>"Come on in!" he assured us as he waved his hand as if to guide us into his compound.<br><br>Slowly, we walked into his nice garden.<br><br>He invited us to sit down at a stone table in his garden &amp; asked his maid to make us a pot of tea.<br><br>The pot of tea came. But we were not very enthuasistic about it because we were hot &amp; thirsty after soccer.<br><br>"You boys like a cold drink?" Dr Wee asked us again.<br><br>We nodded our head in unison &amp; with lots of enthusiasm. hahaa...<br><br>out came a jug of ice cold water to quench our thirst. and a man who melted our young hearts.<br><br>He continued to chat with us for about 30 minutes or so before we bade farewell because we were hungry. We cant be having our meal there!<br><br>One of us politely told him that we had to go have our meal &amp; go back to school to have a shower before our class started in the afternoon.<br><br>Ever the nice man, he even offered to fetch us there! but we declined as we are dirty &amp; sweaty.<br><br>He opened the gate again for us to take our leave &amp; he walked us to the door. He shook every of our hand, and told us to take care.<br><br>This is one man who touched every Singaporeans' heart, especially these 5 young hearts.<br><br>I will remember you Dr Wee. You truly deserve your reputation as the "People's President"<br><br>God bless his soul &amp; may he rest in peace.</span></strong></div>

Yesterday I took a cab to TM and when the radio announced this news, the taxi driver(appr. late fiftes or early 60) quickly turn the volume louder and after that I heard sniffing sound coming from the front. I even caught him wiping his eyes so I guess he must be crying bah.. Hmmm..

I am sure you have made a few racist jokes yourself. Jokes are fine, but targeting another person because of his race isn't.<br><br>Can't you see that the presidency is equivalent to the British monarchy? Both are titular heads of state, with no power to speak of. In fact, Prince Charles gets more laughs than President Nathan, if you aren't aware of it.</div>

Look at President Nathan and former president Wee. The reason why they left things pretty much as they are is due to their background. They served in the diplomatic corps and had not had any political position. Ong was a former MP and minister. I can understand if he still feels a need to speak up for the people.</div>
