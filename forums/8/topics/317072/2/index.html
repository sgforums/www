              <p>rubber hooks also not very effective......it will be much better than without, but after like 3 - 4 hours, the specs also start to slide down.....somemore my face is very oily.....i currently have the silicon nose-piece......it's very good, and when combined with good-quality rubber hooks (get the thick, really rubbery ones) and it won't slide down for like 5 - 6 hours.</p>
              <p>then, when it starts to slide, wash your face and nose-piece and can last for another 5 - 6+ hours again.</p>
              <p>only thing the silicon nose-piece lose the "holding power" after you wash it with water / soap.....i think it's probably due to the nature of silicon, but my physics is very bad, so maybe others can confirm.</p>

              <p>Wow! Really thanks you guys for your extensive replies!</p>
              <p>Regarding contact lens.. I'm actually thinking of getting it to eliminate this problem. But lol, yea.. I'm a noob with contacts man.. Tried it a few times 2 years back before NS, found it really difficult to get it in. But I'll guess I'll be trying contacts again since I'm now out of NS. However, I still would not prefer to depend on contacts all my life IF there's a choice. :p I don't like the idea of touching my eyeballs most of the time.. Noob? I'm alright.</p>
              <p>Earhooks, that's another method I tried.. but I would like to listen for more alternatives because the hook sticking out, is more or less obvious at the side.</p>
              <p>And yea, I've tried buying the blue absorbent pad to remove the oil on the face, at the same time tried it on the nose piece, it did help for awhile.. and yea.. only awhile.. :S</p>
              <p>Regarding <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/133646">viciouskitty74</a> reply, I guess I may give it a try that to reduce my oily face problem.</p>
              <p>However, I just would like to see how you guys solve this problem. and I just realised that there's something such as a silicon nose-piece? That's something I would like to try too. How much you have to pay for the change of the nose piece, <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/238486">Nikar 3</a>?</p>

              <p>the silicon nose-piece depends....the best are those that are thick and very rubbery.....avoid the harder ones.</p>
              <p>the most expensive piece of silicon nose-piece i ever paid was $5.....most are $3.....change it every 4 - 5 months or so....very cheap nia....</p>
              <p>for the rubber hooks, nowadays got these kind of "mini" ones where the thickness is thicker and the hooks is very short, so short that you can't even see it's a rubber hook.</p>
              <p>also got different colors.</p>
