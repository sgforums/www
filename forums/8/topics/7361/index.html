            <div class='col-md body'>Well just stating something that i saw these few days........<br><br>Exams coming for me, and i actually went out to study in the evening everyday. B4 going home everynite, mostly 11pm + or past midnite, will drop by the nearby arcade for a game or 2 to relief some stress.<br><br>Everything is normal in the arcade, but then somehow a very beautiful girl, abt the age or 18-20 caught my attention (well guess its just normal for a guy to look at gers, esp beautiful one   :p). I considered her as a lian, though not those hardcore 1. Well at least she didn't dyed her hair red or green or wear till very skimpy.<br><br>I really kinda felt pity for her, i mean she look really great, abt 1.65 or so, long beautiful hair and a nice figure, but just don't understand why she hang out in this place at such hours with her bengs friends (well she's the only ger ard) ......<br><br>Its really a pityful sight to see such a beatuiful ger mixing ard with the bengs .....i mean with her look and everything, she can easily be a model and make a name for herself soon. Why must she waste so many nites hanging ard, doing nothing bascially (except playing games maybe). Oh yes, forgot to mention, tonite is the 3rd straight nite i saw her in the arcade.<br><br>I dunnoe really, just something that i feel. Maybe she should be more 'zhi ai'. If she's my sister, i am sure she's gonna to get it from me. Or maybe ...... its her family's fault. I really dunnoe. What u pple think? Just felt pity for her ......</div>

She could just enjoy the arcade just as you do.<br><br>For all you know, she may even be a doctor.  I have a friend who's a dentist that is quite pretty, makes tons of money and occasionally hangs out at arcade because she likes arcade games.  Don't be so quick to judge.

Its not hard to tell...... anyway, i don't really enjoy arcade that much till can hang there for hrs........ just a short while maybe.<br><br>Moose ......guess u r rite that i only see the surface ......of cos i can't go up to talk to her, of 2 reasons, 1st i dunnoe how to appraoch a person, 2ndly, with all her bengs friends there, a fight is sure to outbreak if some1 approach her, jealousy spark fire mah....... again, og cos those who mix with bengs might not be lian but she's definitely not those so call 'guai guai' ger........ its weekdays, and staying out so late everynite .....<br><br>Maestro, well in the 1st place i dun see much things are wrong lor, but then just felt kinda pity that she should get a future for herself...... or maybe she have 1 and i am just pitying her for nothing, i dunnoe...... and fyi, if i have a gf, i wun't frequent the arcade at such hrs 1 lar. So i dun think its double standard. I won't criticise or pity some1 that i will be in his/her shoe.<br><br></div>
