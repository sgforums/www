            <div class='col-md body'>by Kway Png<br><br>US President George W Bush told reporters today that heÂ’s looking forward to his visit to Singapore next week, as he thinks he should Â“spend a little more time in China.Â”<br><br>Â“Gotta tell ya,Â” said President Bush at the White House yesterday. Â“SingaporeÂ’s a valued member of our coalition of the coerced, sorry, I mean Â‘willingÂ’. Gotta hand it to Â‘em. That shows they understand the need to be a real player on the world stage, alongside influential countries like Micronesia, Palau and Tonga.Â”<br><br>Â“And our countries got a lot in common, yep,Â” he said. Â“They got problems with Muslamic terrorists too, and I hear they also like barbecue a lot. Like that satay stuff. SatayÂ… wasnÂ’t that one oÂ’ Saddam HusseinÂ’s sons? Anyway, I hear they even showed Â‘American IdolÂ’ on Singapore TV! IsnÂ’t that amazing? It shows ya how inclusive Â‘Merican culture really is, when foreigners are willing to buy Â‘Merican TV shows, even though they probably got so many good shows of their own to watch.Â”<br><br>Â“Also had that Tong guy come over earlier to sign some Free Trade Agreement,Â” the President recalled. Â“Boy, that Tong guyÂ’s tall. They grow Â‘em big in China now. Just check out that Yao Ming fella. I thought SingaporeÂ’s leader, Mr Lee, was supposed to come, but he musta been scared of spreading that SARs stuff. He didnÂ’t have ta worry. IÂ’d have gotten Rummie to put him in a hazmat suit or somethinÂ’.Â”<br><br>President Bush said he looked forward to discussing a host of issues with Singapore.<br><br>Â“Yep, gotta lot to jaw about, no mistake,Â” he said. Â“Lot of worrying trends in Asia. Like you notice, lotta Asian countries have, like, political leaders passinÂ’ over power to their relatives. Look at Bangladesh, Pakistan, and especially North Korea. I mean, I was just tellinÂ’ my dad the other day, what kinda undemocratic banana republic is it where dads can pass power to their sons without having to win real elections? Boy, I hope your new Prime Minister can help suggest how to deal with this problem.Â”<br><br>The President also said he was cheered at how Singapore was trying hard to be a good business partner with the USA. Â“Like theyÂ’re pushinÂ’ everyone in Singapore to speak better English. I mean, thatÂ’s great. Saves us the trouble of learninÂ’ Singaporese. We Â‘Mericans can help ya out too. Lotsa ways we can learn ya to spoke better English.Â”<br><br>President Bush is also particularly excited about visiting SingaporeÂ’s famed Night Safari. Â“Golly, thatÂ’s somethinÂ’ else Â– a safari at night! All the ones I been to were in the day. Guess IÂ’ll have to bring night vision goggles along with my rifle, otherwise I wonÂ’t get to shoot nothinÂ’.Â”<br><br>*taken from <a href="http://www.talkingcock.com" rel="nofollow">HERE</a></div>
