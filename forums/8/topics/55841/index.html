My project team works used to suck back in school and I stored the same form of mentality as you. I've always opt for a personal project whenever I can so that I can achieve that 'standard' I want.<br><br>IC's (in charge) life in NS SUCKS too.... Everybody just have that 'couldn't be bother' attitude....<br><br>Later on I come to realise that this is probably the way life would turn out to be... Everywhere you go, you'll bump into other people... That's when 'management' comes in.... And the 'mentality' thing... No doubt I'm thinking for the 'best' of the results... Others are thinking of the 'best' too... Perhaps as in relaxation and stress-reducing, etc....<br><br>And everybody has a DIFFERENT life... I used to hear this saying that "If I can do it, I don't see why you can't...?" Come on... Everybody has a different capacity... You're good in this doesn't mean that you're good in that... And you've got the time doesn't mean that the others have it too...? I'm not saying that they should be totally BOCHAP about the project... That's when brainstorming of ideas come in and everybody decides the WORTH of things... Usually it'll not be easy to come to an agreement... But you'll be SURPRISED what kinda conclusion you and your group members can come up to... And how you can pick up 'allies' instead of foes on the way...<br><br>Personally.. I now thinks that group work don't necessarily means doing things 'right'... But more like doing things the way everyone wants it to be... And if you think that you have a STRONG case... CONVINCE them... And meanwhile, why not try letting yourself BE CONVINCED for a change...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
