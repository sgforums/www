With Imagination as our tool, we have ruthlessly slaughtered animals because they post a threat to us, we have meddled with technology and genetics, killing deformed or abnormal babies, and keeping the normal ones. from a technological point of view, we are already evolving through this brutal process of artificial selection (killing deformed or abnormal babies, and keeping the normal ones). we are the only animals on this planet who have imagination. homo erectus, homo habilis, neanderthal all DIED out because they couldnt imagine and secure their survival. but Homo Sapiens COULD! but instead of respecting Nature, the most of us spit on the ground, cut trees down, spray paint on the grass, pluck flowers, bash up bees and wasps nests...humanity is a PLAGUE, a DISEASE!</div>

Just think, in the last 100 years, we invented the automobile, airplane, spacecraft, radio, radar, television, computer, internet, and many other breakthroughs on technology and medicine. technology is advancing at an extremely rapid rate. whos to say that within the next 700 years, we'll still remain purely biological? u have to understand that Man's oldest and most 'unattainable' dream at this point is to create a 'Superhuman', or a 'Posthuman' being, a human capable of above-average human intelligence and physical abilities, including social skills. very soon we will create the first posthuman to ever walk the earth. he'll be 50% machnized, his thinking skills aided by biocomputers, his vision enhanced by cameras that interface with his brain, including receivers that help pick up sound at the sides of his head, and a brainwave-transmitter device that allows the posthuman to think of something which will be picked up by the device as brainwaves, code it in computer language, then send the message to his receipent.</div></blockquote>By 2700 AD, I am lying on the cold hard earth. I wouldn't even know if such things are to ever exist.<br><br>But no doubt, life could be extended. An article published last year (or a few years ago) says that we are able to live past 200 years old if we are able to keep our physical body wet. The minute we are born, we are dried. When we are in the amionic sac, it's wet.<br><br>Another article, published this year, involves using a protein called insulin. Insulin itself can't help us to live longer, but modifying their signal pathway will help us live longer. One of the side effects: diabetes. Lab tests on worms showed that while they lived longer than normal, their larval development and reproduction were disrupted.<br><br><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060311090736.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/03/060311090736.htm</a></div>

Scientists will treat it as mutation. Unless, it is becoming more common, then evolution might have started.</div>

Nothing. although a small minority of us protect wildlife and the natural habitat, it is not because we actually CARE about it, but because of fears that a loss in natural habitat could mean our EXTINCTION. you see, everything humans do is solely because of ensuring our survival. we dont even give a fcuk about anything else. after earth is wasted away, we'll progress to the moon to mine for its minerals, then head to mars, terraform it, live on it after Terra is dead...</div></blockquote>Fears of loss of natural habitat doesn't make us extinct. Rather, the extinction of other species which we feed on are what they fear. Once they go extinct, what do we rely on to make sure our bodies are healthy? Man-made vitamins? They are known to have side effects. If we take in straight from the animals and plants, side effects are probably lesser, excluding allergies.<br><br>There's no proof that an animal or plant (microorganisms found to exist) exist on any planets or moons other than Earth. We have been able to find Earth-like planets and moons, but studies are still on-going as to whether they can support life, like on Earth.</div>
