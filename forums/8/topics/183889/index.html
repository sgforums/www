            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The most popular belief today is that UFOs are spaceships piloted by aliens from other planets and other solar systems. But another good theory which never gets as much press is that UFOs may, in fact, originate right here on earth. Instead of being Extraterrestrials, UFO aliens might be Ultraterrestrials -- a species that has always been here, which evolved on earth along with homo sapiens, but which represent a species far advanced.These Ultraterrestrials are so superior to us itÂ’s almost impossible for us to comprehend their existence. All we know of them are fleeting glimpses of light in the sky, occasional bizarre encounters between human beings and so-called aliens, and other unexplainable phenomenon.Think of how a group of chimpanzees in the wild perceive human beings. Because their own level of consciousness is limited compared to ours, they cannot comprehend what we humans are beyond being just another kind of animal.A chimp may think of an airplane as some kind of magical, giant bird.<br><br>They relate to it with the level of understanding they have about their environment. The speculation of the chimp, at best, is a crude idea about the total truth of an airplane, and the fact that it represents entire levels of consciousness that are so advanced, they are literally invisible to chimp mind.Now think of a human being who encounters a UFO. To us a UFO seems to be some kind of flying, mechanical aircraft -- but the true nature of the UFO may be as different from a spacecraft as a bird is from an airplane. Like the chimp, we just donÂ’t have the advanced levels of consciousness we need to comprehend the true nature of a UFO.As humans, we make the naturally egotistical assumption that we are the species at the top of the heap -- we see ourselves as the peak achievement of evolution. We even make the bold claim that God, the supreme architect of the entire universe, created us in his own image!But itÂ’s not a big leap to consider that we are just another link in a vast chain of species, many which are below us, and some which may be above us.<br><br>People who support the Ultraterrestrial theory, such as authors Jacques Vallee and John Keel, point out that supernatural beings seemingly superior to humans have been reported throughout history. In previous eras they were called gods, angels, ogres, fairies, brownies, little people, demons, and more.The Bible is filled with references to supernatural creatures, including giants, Â“wheelsÂ” flying in the sky out of which incredible creatures emerge, and more.But references to flying disks were recorded centuries before the texts of the Bible. Cave drawing dating to 30,000 B.C. depict disks floating around in the sky, remarkably similar to modern UFO photographs.Maverick UFO investigators like Vallee and Keel have pointed out the amazing similarities of modern UFO aliens to that of elves, fairies and the various Â“little peopleÂ” famous in the folklore of many cultures.Fairies are known for kidnapping people, the same irritating habit UFO aliens have. People who are abducted report incidents of missing time, a phenomenon very similar to time lapses reported by people taken to and returned from Â“fairyland.Â”Fairies, like modern aliens, tend to be diminutive creatures with large magical eyes. Many reports of alien abduction even include Â“power rodsÂ” used to paralyze abducties, just as fairies wield Â“magic wands.Â”One of the most interesting comparisons between aliens and fairies is that both are interested in stealing babies.<br><br>One of the most common fairy activities is swiping babies from cribs, and sometimes replacing them with a false double, or Â“changelingÂ” as they are sometimes called.A large part of modern UFO literature involves aliens abducting women, impregnating them, and then later abducting them again, only to remove and take the unborn baby right out of the womb.Clearly, both UFO occupants and fairies have a strong affinity for the baby business.Fairies are closely associated with nature, just as modern aliens also display a certain obsession with environmental issues. One of the most common alien abduction scenarios involves aliens who force people to watch Â“moviesÂ” depicting massive environmental degradation caused by modern human civizilation. The aliens then give them a lecture on environmental issues and let them go.If aliens truly are a superior species from earth and evolved on earth, it would make sense that they would be concerned about another species wrecking the planet.But then you might ask, why donÂ’t the Ultraterrestrials simply step in and Â“manageÂ” us the same way humans Â“manageÂ” wildlife, including chimps and other large primates? The Ultraterrestrial theorists answer: Â“They are!Â” ThatÂ’s what all the abduction and experiments are about!Just as human beings capture and tag various species, UFO abducties report experiences of extreme similarity.<br><br>Many people report being Â“taggedÂ” during frightening sessions on a UFO operating table. Some of these Â“tagsÂ” have even been recovered, or show up on MRI exams, and remain unexplained.ItÂ’s also possible that Ultraterrestrials comprehend and operate within higher levels of dimension than we experience at the human level. A chimp, for example, does not comprehend the dimension of time like humans can, and a chimp could never understand that time and space are actually two parts of the same dimension, as scientists have discovered.Mathematicians tell us that many additional dimensions of reality exist -- dimensions which only the most brilliant math minds can glimpse through numbers, although they cannot experience them psychologically in any meaningful way.If Ultraterrestrials can exist Â“aboveÂ” or Â“beyondÂ” spacetime, that means they can easily see us, trick us and manipulate our existence, while we canÂ’t see them at all, or only in the most crude manner, or perhaps only when they allow us to see them.Imagine when a bear is shot with a drugged dart from a helicopter hovering above him. Imagine how terrified the bear is of the bizarre flying monster, and the noise and lights that come out of it. Now imagine what the bear thinks of the strange beings that emerge fromm the flying monster. The strange beings poke and prod him, look inside his mouth, apply a tag to his ear, and then let him go. Why? How can a bear understand or interpret the meaning of this incident on its level of consciousness? It canÂ’t. Human beings are so advanced and superior as to be incomprehensible.Is it so difficult to believe that the ongoing bizarre and seemingly incomprehensible phenomenon of UFOs and their activities are the actions of an earth-born species far advanced and superior to human beings? Just ask a bear or a chimp.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look throughout history, you see example after example of "barriers" being broken.<br><br>One example is that the Earth was flat and that if you were to sail far enough, you'd fall off the edge.<br><br>Another example is that the speed of sound couldn't be breached. When test pilots had gotten close to it and felt the turbulence it only strengthened the concept.<br><br>Yet people were able to break both barriers.<br><br>Today, we see the speed of light as a barrier that cannot be broken. The one thing that is different about this barrier is that we already know that, at least in theory, the ability to travel faster than the speed of light...and thus travel back in time is a possibility.<br><br>If you look at the rate of technological advance in the past 100 years, it's astounding. What we have accomplished in that small amount of time is mind-boggling.<br><br>If we have advanced beyond what was already thought possible in the past 100 years, who's to say we can't advance beyond the "barriers" that Einstein laid down?<br><br>Throughout human history, we have extended ourselves beyond what we thought (at one time) to be possible.<br><br>Why is it not then possible to believe that the "UFO's" we see are not indeed ourselves in the future who have been able to traverse the known barrier of space and time?</div>
