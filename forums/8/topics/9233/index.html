            <div class='col-md body'>I have heard and seen some stories recently which sits in a huge portion on my brain permanently.<br><br>I can still recall the scenes vividly on my mind.<br><br><strong>Story 1:</strong><br>My boss was driving me home one nite last year.<br>"So, what does ur bf do?" He asked.<br>"NS", i answered softly.<br>"Oh, i've been through that."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">( er, which guy don't?)</span><br>"I had my first gf at that time" He continued.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">(oh, i thought he was saying he has been through NS..  :p)</span><br>"I met her in colleage. I was posted to be an officer and i met my wife there." He smiled.<br>"so, why did u leave ur ex?" I asked.<br>"Oh, i find her too childish for me"<br><span style="font-style: italic;">(hmm, his taste seems rather high)</span><br><br>Recently, i heard tat he had a huge argument with his wife. No wonder he kept staying late in office, face black like charcoal.....<br>Oh well, he was getting pretty well with another colleague recently. He even helped her to get promoted to manager.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(What does he want now? He find his wife too childish? Or he is trying to find someone of higher status? Manager to be match with his director post?)</span><br><br><strong>Story 2:</strong><br>I was with a friend on a cab recently. He was rushing back to his camp. When reached, the cab driver said,<br>"kiss kiss, hug, say goodbye to each other, dun be shy..."<br>Kauz!!!!! We are just friends......Kiss wat?!?!?!???!?!<br><br>Then, the driver started to get emotional.<br>"I had my first gf when i was in army. I love her a lot, but she refused to wait for me. I know that she's happily married now with 2 kids....and i will think of her every Valentine's day."<br><span style="font-style: italic;">(oh well, another NS case, i thought)</span><br>"That was 15 years ago." He added.<br><span style="font-style: italic;">(i gasped. 15 yrs ago????? And he's still thinking of her every Vday??)</span><br>"But my wife waited for me for 5 yrs. My first gf couldn't even waited." He said.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(I could feel the sadness in his heart.....)</span><br><br>------------------<br>Fly me to the moon...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Churra:<br><br>response to your story....<br><br>yes, u feel luv cannot be tested.....but in every day that goes by, isn't that a little test in itself? That you have managed to live with another person, his habits, his joy and his idosyncracies, for 1 more day.<br><br>As for why the guy and gal quarreled....most of the time a guy would feel a failure if his gf tells him this....so in part its ego at work. He'll get angry and say angry words....but when the smoke clears, ultimately its how committed 2 people are towards the relationship...<br><br>after all, she only told him there was somebody else after her, but not that she was leaving him.....<br><br>foundation.....remember Elyn and James? They had a 1 year friendship foundation....thats why ultimately i believe their relationship will be very very strong. Cuz they have spent much time both together and apart, to live together as lovers do, and to live as an individual.<br><br>Sometimes...the line between a Significant Other and a normal friend blurs....<br><br>and that is why in many pple's hearts the perfect Other would be:<br><br>A friend when I need someone to talk to<br>A lover when I'm in a romantic mood<br>A person who understands me<br>.....and so on.<br><br>Then again, all this coming from me.....who *someone* called a flirt when i first came forum....<br><br>so......*shrugs*<br><br>------------------<br>Blue Fire.....<br><br>[This message has been edited by SuperSonic (edited 24 September 2000).]</div>
