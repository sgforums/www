            <div class='col-md body'>i'm one year away from my A level results, currently taking ARTS in a junior college. i'm interested in the faculty of design or media.. the others just do not appeal to me. on the contrary, i'm still rather unsure of my choice yet.. designing, computer animation and all seems pretty good to me.<br><br>considering my standings academically, those gits from rjc and hci would probably take up all the spots in nus. for me, it's either NUS or universities in UK or US. i do not want to study in NTU etc..<br><br>btw u might ask, why the sudden surge of interest? well, that's because i, or i shall say my whole school went for the career exbition in suntec yesterday. to my disappointment i witnessed the ugly side of singaporeans yet again, when they rushed for freebies. many neighbourhood sch sch kids who are presumably intellectually challenged are spotted as well. i really have no idea why sec sch ppl are there..<br><br>on a side note, one of the 'exhibitors' who was a caucasian was quite hot. hahaha.. i think it's largely because of confidence.. i seldom see local guys who are so social and open.. it's such a waste if they're good looking too.. it's like untapped potential. do not be mistaken, this guy is not just any tom dick and harry but he's actually a qualified individual that's why he's chosen rite? my friend actually took a picture with him -_-</div>
