            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">I am in a dilemma now. 3 years back, when I was in secondary school, I got to know a girl who was then in Sec 2. I did not have any chance or courage to approach her. After my O levels in 2000, I left school and did not have a chance to see her anymore. Last year, I waited for her outside school. I wanted to be friend with her and decided to approach her when she steps out of the school. However, everytime she have been accompanied by her friends and I do not have the courage to go up to her.<br><br>Then got one time, I decide to follow her to her place and approach her. I did not know why at that time I have such intentions. Unfortunately, I lost track of her soon after because she was in the bus, while I am driving. The same evening, I was in IRC and I saw her in there. I chatted with her and to be honest with her, I told her that I followed her home. She was very angry with me and is also scare. I was disappointed. It is wrong or right for me to tell her the truth of following her home?<br><br>Soon after that, I stop thinking of her. However, in November last year, I want to be her friend and so I decide to look her up. This time round, I got her address. One day before her birthday, I waited for her at the void deck and I approached her. She was shocked at the moment. But later, I identify myself and she agreed to be my Â“friendÂ”. I was so happy at the moment and we agreed to meet the next day so that I can give her a present.<br><br>On her birthday, I received a call from her saying that she will not be free that afternoon. I was so sad at that very moment. However, I got the present delivered to the place by the gift company. I confirm that she receives the present but why didnÂ’t she call me back. From then, it has been 3 months. No call, no letter, nothing from her. I have not given up.<br><br>I JUST WANT TO BE A NORMAL TYPE OF FRIEND WITH HER. Why canÂ’t she give me a chance to be her friend? What should I do now? Should I approach her again? I donÂ’t think I would like to do soÂ…. Should I write her a letter? But what happen if she doesnÂ’t replyÂ….<br><br>Please help me.  </span><br></div>
