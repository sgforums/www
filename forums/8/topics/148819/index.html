            <div class='col-md body'>in fact i dont. i hate it when i step my foot into my house as my parents are always quarrelling. my sis doesn't care about them too and has her own independant life too since she is already 26. my mom is a friggin lazy housewife. she does not work and yet lazes around at home and rarely cooks. almost every weekend she plays majong with her auntie neighbours and its so fuking noisy. thats why i dont respect her. about my dad he is a very hardworking taxi driver and plays the peacemaker role. although he cares a lot about me, i still hate going home because he frequently quarrels with my mom over little things. im 17 now and my mom still restricts me a lot.. she will scold me whenever i come back after 12 like a criminal. she is not aware that she is not doing her duty as a housewife at all. that is why i dont like to go home... i know it is sad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a 17 yr old kid with 2 elder sisters aged 25 and 28 so theres this big generation gap.sometimes my home would feel very hollow cos my dad and sisters are working.<br><br>a few years ago,our family life was really screwed.Almost every night when my family gets home,they'll kick up a ruckus.Thats when i'd retreat into my room and start blasting music.i really couldn't take it,my eldest sis and my mum would go hysterical and start crying,and my father would remain silent.They fought with the television on so sometimes i wouldn't realise what was going on downstairs,whether if its the drama serial reaching its climax or my family quarrelling.<br><br>We had lots of problems,my mum was very unhappy as she felt we werent doing anything to help her out with the housekeeping (we live in a 3 storey semi d and we have no maid),the housing loan was a constant source of stress,my 2nd sister was involved in a police case and had got pregnant by her bf,my eldest sister had a cranial nerve problem and etc.Everybody was on the verge of a breakdown and my father was working his ass off under our financial burdens.<br><br>when i was sec 2,my mother attempted suicide. and my sister's bf was sent to jail.<br><br>Somehow,i managed to cope without having all these without affecting my studies. partly cos i had friends to talk to and my family members never talked about some of these problems infront of me.<br><br>at that time,the only sanctuary in my home was my own room.i didnt like staying in this house at all,it seemed empty,cold,impersonal and it seemed my family members got together just so that they could fight.<br><br>this year,my sis gave birth to her child.i guess that changed everything.children,as you all know,signify hope and renewal.Granted,my mother is burdened with helping to take care of the baby but we do not resent it.After all,it is innocent.<br><br>The atmosphere in my home also feels different from the past,i guess everybody wants to make it a better place to bring up the child.<br><br>Skirmishes are also far and few between.<br><br>and theres always somebody at home.always,for now.<br><br>so...if you ask me,i say,yea...i feel at home.</div>
