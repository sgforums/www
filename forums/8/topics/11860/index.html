            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, help me .....Am I too much ???<br>Just quarrel with GF, she wake up in the morning she call me sounds so Xian so I asked her what's wrong and she said nothing. Subsequently, she revealed that she is unhappy over the fact that I reprimanded her for not taking care of the HP, a one day old V50 from Dubai, since she somehow managed to drenched the whole HP in a pool of water when her drinking bottle leaked. Since it is only one day old, I was very angry and I actually paid for the phone.<br><br>She then said she very Xian after being "scolded" by me and wanted to go home, so went for BK to settle my stomach and then proceed to her house. On the journey she kept on disturbing me since so thot that the HP will be okay once we dry it with hairdryer at home. Then come the part she realised that it is not working, she looks so sad and wanted to cry. But then one guy she never went out with called and she complained about the incident, and so jun the guy knows ppl to repair HP, she turn to be so happy and asked to meet the guy quick, all this in front of me.<br><br>Then this morning only, complained that I control her too much. She said she have no freedom. But I had earlier asked her to get a HP in Singapore and she dun want said that it is cheaper there, but I told no warranty very jialat, she insisted and I paid for the phone as promised. So By not taking my advise and this happen even though it is an accident, of course I very angry, when she says spend money to repair loh. I spend only $300 a month on myself and she still says things like that. I told her if she can manage her time and money after being with me for 3 yrs, I would have gladly let her make her own decision. I told her I am still worried since after 3 yrs, she still never show me any thing like this.<br><br>And the facts that for the many time she ignored my advise and go ahead, things really go wrong and I have to clear the mess for her. Of course I am angry in this instance also. She said that she wanted to do things that she likes, like clubbing, but I don't let her go. I don't want to let her go so often since she flies around and I only get to see her 5-10 days a months. And if she goes clubbing, the next day for the whole day she is tired and wanted only to stay at home and I have to go her house to look for her after work. She said she too tired to go out and I have been so coped up at home since she gets suspicious if I go out and will keep on asking and suaning me saying I Tian mi mi with other gals. So she not around I work and go home. She comes back also work go her place and then to my place. Even clubbing I also let her go every 2-3 months once or twice, so why is it so ????<br><br>She also just spend $5000 last month on tour, and bought a LV bag for $888, which I also paid for seeing that she had spend so much. Our plan was to get married, get a flat, and so on. All this costs money and I kept on reminding her to save up. Still she said I shouldn't interfere in her ways of spending money. I was telling her I did it because I wanted to make sure that we have enough money and not spend like that. How long do u guys take to save up $5000 ???<br><br>I already tried my best to be nice but I just can't see her getting into trouble every time and waiting to be rescued every time by me, so I tried to control her ways of spending and time management. I told her I would gladly let u run your own life if u can show me how she can managed her life better. Sh etold me she don't want to show me, she just want her freedom.<br><br>The last straw is, I told her, if in future u wanna see me then u call me if not I will not bother u again. I really feel so unfair to me. I did things for the good of us and yet was branded as controlling her Â…. so what should I do now ????<br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey,<br><br>I think you've got the one-in-a-million nightmare of a girlfriend.  I don't know her but I've heard about girls with this kind of attitude and mentality.  Not to say that they're no good but mostly girls with this kind of character belongs to BIG TYCOON, BIG Businessman, Rich Arabian Princes... get the idea?  Sorry for generalising but this is a personal opinion, ok?<br><br>I don't know about you but sometimes they have to learn their own lessons.  Perhaps, if one day she lost all her money and has no one to turn to.  She'll realise how good you were/are.  By standing around you're hampering her lessons in life, not only that get blamed for a lot of other things.<br><br>Now's my turn to fire some questions.  Why do you like/love her?  Why do you put up with all this?  Is there something redeemable in her? Why do you feel like you're looking after someone, like a father after a teenage daughter?  Do you?  Then tally up what you want in a future wife?  Does your girlfriend qualify?  After all this, if you feel she's still the one.  I wish you all the best.<br><br>Another thing, do you know that most millionaires have wives who are more thrifty, and money conscious than them.  That way they (the wives) manage the finances and the man become rich.  Behind every successful man is a woman, Behind every broken hearted man is also a woman.  Go figure.  That's all I've to say.  Take care.<br><br>Stay  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, actually i am also very troubled at this point in my life. I guess i understand tat you really loved her alot and willing to sacrifice for her... likewise i am facing the same thing as you, but me not tat bad bcoz not at marriage age yet.<br><br>Juz give her more freedom as she requested loh. When she says she wanted freedom, she really meant it loh, esp freedon with regards to clubbing. Yes, as guys we will definitely be worried when they go clubbing. Frankly speaking, i don like clubbing but my gf does... so i always never go with her but i will wait for her call when she reach home.<br><br>But this is very wrong! If we are worried, we should go with them loh, instead of sitting at home and say you are worried. And bcoz i never go with her, she get to know a guy there, and guess wat? she falls in love with this guy and tat guy also interested in her and going after her... now they seems to be together liao...<br><br>If you want to know my pathetic story, read [i]My GF don wan to answer my call[\i]<br><br>Bottom line is, give her freedom and do things with her, esp things tat she ENJOY. Don regret not doing it, otherwise you will be the 2nd me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sad to see that so many gers out there do not appreciate their boyfrens...<br><br>freedom is abstract and very subjective..<br>a caring boyfren may be misunderstood as "overly-protective"....<br>a bf tt gives the beloved too much freedom may be labelled as bochup or insensitive..<br><br>oso...gers have this inborn trait -- PMS attitude..<br>sometimes we juz like to whine whine a bit..throw some xiao-jie-pi-qi..trying to get their bfs to pay more attention to them and pamper them abit..<br>tt is harmless..but if things dont get better or worse..change for the negative..then mebe it is time to reconsider the rship...</div>
