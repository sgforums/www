            <div class='col-md body'><strong>National Council of Churches of Singapore<br>Statement on Homosexuality</strong><br><br>Preamble:<br>There has recently been wide discussion in the press and the Internet on the issue of homosexuality with different views expressed. Christians, like other thoughtful citizens, are also concerned about this issue. We present our position below as a guide to Christians in our member churches and as our witness, as concerned citizens, to the society in which we belong.<br><br>Our stand:<br>1) Recognizing the Bible as the authoritative standard for its faith and practice the Church has historically and consistently held the view that the practice of homosexuality is clearly incompatible with the teachings of the Christian faith. The only sexual relationship, sanctioned by God and given as a gift from God, is between a male and a female within the bounds of a monogamous marriage.<br><br>2) Therefore, we do not condone homosexual practice and we consider homosexual lifestyle as sinful and unacceptable. However, this does not mean that we reject or despise homosexuals (homophobia). We acknowledge that every person is loved by God and we all live under the grace of God. Homosexuals should be regarded and treated no less as persons of worth and dignity.<br><br>3) The Church is called to be a caring community and a sanctuary, always extending ministry to all persons. As sinners ourselves, we are committed to the path of true freedom made possible by the grace of God and found in and through obedience to Jesus Christ. Without minimizing their struggles, the Church offers those beset with homosexual desire the same opportunity to receive God's forgiveness and fulfillment in Jesus Christ and to experience His transforming power. Not accepting homosexual practice and lifestyle must not be confused with homophobia.<br><br>4) In public debate about homosexuality scientific data have sometimes been used to support certain claims. To the layperson, science has been unsuspectingly regarded as an objective discipline and conclusions based on its findings have been assumed as irrefutable and authoritative. But that is an assumption we do not accept especially with regard to attempts to give biological explanations to homosexual inclination and behaviour. We note that there is no clear evidence that homosexuality is biologically determined.<br><br>5) Though we deem homosexual lifestyle totally unacceptable on the basis of the Bible and our faith, we believe that unless there are legitimate reasons homosexuals, as individuals, should not be discriminated against in areas such as employment. It does not follow, however, that our society should be re-ordered or allowed to evolve to the extent that eventually homosexual practice is endorsed, permitted or encouraged as an alternative lifestyle. In this regard, we urge our government to maintain:<br><br>a) current legislation concerning homosexuality;<br><br>b) its policy of not permitting the registration of homosexual societies or clubs;<br><br>c) its policy of not allowing the promotion of homosexual lifestyle and activities.<br><br>6) As churches we seek to remain faithful to our Christian faith and practice. We shall strengthen the education of our members in the teachings and practices of our faith. We are committed to serving our nation by helping to preserve and promote wholesome values and lifestyles that will contribute to the well-being of our society.<br><br>29 July 2003<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Roman Catholic Church voice out also........<br><br><strong>Vatican calls for campaign against gay marriages </strong><br><br>VATICAN CITY - The Vatican urged Catholics and non-Catholics on Thursday to unite in campaigning against gay marriages and gay adoptions, seeking to stem the widening legal recognition of same-sex unions.<br><br>Catholic politicians have a 'moral duty' to oppose laws granting legal rights to gay couples, and non-Catholics should follow their lead since the issue concerns 'natural moral law', said the Vatican's orthodoxy watchdog, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith.<br><br>The 12-page document, issued in seven languages, was criticised by gay groups across North America and Europe, where politicians are increasingly granting homosexual couples the same legal status as heterosexual couples.<br><br>Most of Europe recognises gay unions<br><br>FRANCE: The French government introduced the Civil Solidarity Pact in 1999, which allows homosexual couples to register their partnerships with the civil authorities. They benefit from the same fiscal and social rights as heterosexual partners, such as inheritance and divorce rights, housing and social security.<br><br>Germany: Same-sex unions officially recognised since August 2001. This allows gay partners to take each other's family names, and benefit from the same rights as heterosexual couples.<br><br>Britain: After years of controversy, same-sex couples in Britain enjoy the same civil rights as their heterosexual counterparts since June this year. Homosexuals have been allowed to adopt children since 1996.<br><br>Denmark: First Scandinavian country to allow same-sex couples to register their unions in 1989.<br><br>Norway: Legalised same-sex unions in 1993.<br><br>Sweden: Same-sex unions have been legal since 1994. Gay couples have been allowed to adopt children since 2002.<br><br>Finland: Same-sex unions have been legal since 2002.<br><br>Netherlands: The Dutch Senate passed a law in December 2000 recognising homosexual unions. Same sex couples are allowed to adopt children as long as the child accepts Dutch nationality.<br><br>Belgium: Homosexual couples have had the same rights since June this year, but adoption by same-sex couples is not recognised.<br><br>Croatia: The Croatian Parliament accorded same-sex couples the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts in mid-July this year. -- AFP<br><br>'This new document is intended to intimidate public officials across the globe into doing what the Vatican has not been able to do on its own -- stem the growing tide for justice,' said Ms Marianne Duddy, executive director of Dignity USA, an organisation of gay Catholics. 'It is a tremendous shame that the leaders of our Church are becoming the vocal proponents for intolerance and continuing discrimination.'<br><br>But the document was welcomed by some conservatives, including in Pope John Paul II's native Poland, where Roman Catholic bishops read excerpts at a news conference to condemn a proposal by leftist lawmakers to legalise homosexual unions.<br><br>'The idea is immoral and hurting to families and marriages,' said Bishop Stanislaw Stefanek. 'We strongly object to it.'<br><br>The document, Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions Between Homosexual Persons, sets out a battle plan for politicians confronted with legislation legalising same-sex unions and rails against gay adoption.<br><br>Gay adoptions 'mean doing violence to these children, in the sense that their condition of dependency would be used to place them in an environment that is not conducive to their full human development', it said.<br><br>The document calls on Catholic politicians to vote against laws granting legal recognition to homosexual unions and to work to repeal those already on the books.<br><br>'To vote in favour of a law so harmful to the common good is gravely immoral,' it said, although it didn't specify penalties for Catholics who do.<br><br>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who is Catholic, has supported a proposed law that would define marriage as a union between two people, rather than a man and a woman.<br><br>In the United States, Vermont has a 'civil union' law, giving same-sex couples the rights of traditional marriages, and the highest court in Massachusetts is weighing whether to legalise such unions.<br><br>On Wednesday, US President George W. Bush told a news conference marriage was strictly a union between a man and a woman and that he wants to 'codify that, one way or the other'. Government lawyers are exploring measures to enshrine it into law, the White House said. -- AP<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think bear has misunderstood about free will.. free will is a good thing, use it for a good purpose, and for a good future. adam had free will, he didn't use it so wisely. i'd hate to comment on this, but its because of some issue, then the protestant movement started.<br><br>the way i see is this, when gays become legal, ppl will start exploiting this to create products for gays, then advertisments, then our children will be influenced. its like smoking, when smoking became legal, there were more products for smoking, then advertisments to promote smoking, then our children got involved.<br><br>and smoking is bad, so is being gay.<br><br>bear you have been nagging at me about trampling other people's rights. do you feel the same way when goverment put on the sticker telling the public the bad effects of smoking? the goverment knows smoking is bad, and christians, well, most "christians" anyway, knows how bad the effects of being gay is, i say gay cause its so much easier than typing homosexuality.<br><br>what we do is just let ppl know the bad effects of being gay, just like the government does about smoking.<br><br>the catholic is supposed to be for God.... but i shan't comment here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>and you've been going on and on and on about what are our view on this... listen and WAKE UP, if everyone just do stuff based on their own personal view, we'd be sinning against God and man and the world would just die. saddam did things based on his own personal view, so did george bush, look at the death brought across the land. why did God gave us the 10 commandments? cause He knows our own personal views are all screwed. YOU want to know what my PERSONAL view on catholics? everything u said so far just helped me understood why there had to be a reformation. your knowledge of His Word is so little, you hardly care how God feels about the issue, you are a hypocrite, hardly a light as you ought to be.<br><br>did i just sound ugly? i sure did. but thats cause its my personal view. want to know what God's view is? He feels the catholic, including u, are lovely, are His divine creation, His children, and He longs to work in your life cause you are so precious to Him. and He wants us to change and make the world better and point out that He alone is the answer.<br><br>see the difference? I try to look at everyone the way God does, and i do so very badly.<br><br>sorry if i had to offend you, but i had to also let you know how come i cannot just do things based on my PERSONAL view.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>as for the killings in the dark ages, and why we don't treat people from another religion that way. i will PM u on that for good reasons. if you would like my answer on that let me know ok? and really really sorry if i had caused any harm  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An engineering professor is treating her husband, a loan officer, to dinner for finally giving in to her pleas to shave off the scraggly beard he grew on vacation.  His favorite restaurant is a casual place where they both feel comfortable in slacks and cotton/polyester-blend golf shirts.  But, as always, she wears the gold and pearl pendant he gave her the day her divorce decree was final.  They're laughing over their menus because they know he always ends up diving into a giant plate of ribs but she won't be talked into anything more fattening than shrimp.<br><br>Quiz:  How many biblical prohibitions are they violating?  Well, wives are supposed to be 'submissive' to their husbands (I Peter 3:1).  And all women are forbidden to teach men (I Timothy 2:12), wear gold or pearls (I Timothy 2:9) or dress in clothing that 'pertains to a man' (Deuteronomy 22:5).  Shellfish and pork are definitely out (Leviticus 11:7, 10) as are usury (Deuteronomy 23:19), shaving (Leviticus 19:27) and clothes of more than one fabric (Leviticus 19:19).  And since the Bible rarely recognizes divorce, they're committing adultery, which carries the rather harsh penalty of death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22:22).<br><br>So why are they having such a good time?  Probably because they wouldn't think of worrying about rules that seem absurd, anachronistic or - at best - unrealistic.  Yet this same modern-day couple could easily be among the millions of people who never hesitate to lean on the Bible to justify their own anti-gay attitudes.</div>

Well, wives are supposed to be 'submissive' to their husbands (I Peter 3:1).  And all women are forbidden to teach men (I Timothy 2:12), wear gold or pearls (I Timothy 2:9) or dress in clothing that 'pertains to a man' (Deuteronomy 22:5).  Shellfish and pork are definitely out (Leviticus 11:7, 10) as are usury (Deuteronomy 23:19), shaving (Leviticus 19:27) and clothes of more than one fabric (Leviticus 19:19).  And since the Bible rarely recognizes divorce, they're committing adultery, which carries the rather harsh penalty of death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22:22).<br><br>So why are they having such a good time?  Probably because they wouldn't think of worrying about rules that seem absurd, anachronistic or - at best - unrealistic.  Yet this same modern-day couple could easily be among the millions of people who never hesitate to lean on the Bible to justify their own anti-gay attitudes.</div></blockquote><strong>For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace. (Romans 6:14)</strong><br><br>No doubt these laws are found in the Old Testament. A period of law given from God to Moses. These laws are demanding, to some extent harsh on the people. The purpose of these Mosaic laws is to show to the people at that time their sinfulness and their incapability to keep all of these laws. Even if we implement the same rules today...how many can obey all? Just look at the criminal records of singapore is an eye-opener.<br><br>As for the New Testament , it is a period of grace. We are infact now living in the period of grace and this grace comes from the Lord Jesus Christ. By His atonong sacrifice He has accomplished all righteousness and obtained for us forgiveness. We are no longer under law, but under grace. We obey laws not to obtain salvation but as a reflection and result of that. The 'rules' given in the book of Timothy are not meant to be legalistic. You dont read scriptures just by looking at words and sentences alone...have you studied the background of the people at that time and read with the entire context in mind? I doubt so.  Wearing of gold ornaments and forbiddence to teach men are social issues.<br><br>Paul do not want the people to be distracted by greed so he said that. He also want to organise a formal and proper way of WORSHIP since the church is still in her early days.Women in the past do not study (just like our forefathers time) and since they are known to be uneducated, to allow them to teach men seems inappropriate and they may teach the wrong thing. Also the thing about Men being heads of households is valid. You get it?<br><br>God is not a cosmo-police always on a look out for who is thte next one to zap when He sees any of us breaking the regulations. His laws are meant to set us free and provide for us the way to salvation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>We are under the covenant of grace not the law. Law does exist. It has always existed but we are not under it. The demands of the law for punishment of sin has been paid 2000 years ago. How many of your sins were in the future when Jesus died on the cross 2000 years ago?<br><br>Christians shall not come under the judgement of the law for blood has already been shed. You are covered in the blood. It is finished.<br><br>The law is there, its the holiness of God. It is precisely because that the law still exists that Jesus had to die.<br><br>Now after the cross, Christians walk in the spirit and you bear fruits of the spirit.<br><br>With regard to an earlier post on homosexual influence on children, well I have this to say. I grew up in the 80s, nothing homosexual in the era yet I am one. Was I influenced? No. Its not like somking. Its not a lifestyle you can just pick up. Its not cool. If its easy to pick up then you can decide to be gay overnight, clearly that is not the case. Homosexuality is not caused by environmental influences alone. Its a combination of BOTH biological and environmental factors.</div>

Notice my emphasis on homosexual instead of gays since apparently the revulsion towards homosexuals is against males pairing.<br><br>Remember how in the Genesis it was said that women was created from man? But science has now proven that a male is in fact borned female, before receiving a penis. How can we even be sure of what God really wants out of us when the Bible can make up a story of males being created first just so they can justify their patriarchial society ?<br><br>How can we be even sure that it is not simply the priests who hated homosexuals and claimed God didn't like them?<br><br>A being who according to the Bible is the creator of the universe as we know it could not predict the possibility of homosexuals within his creations? Yet every pastor i've met claimed &gt;&gt;HE&lt;&lt; is all knowing.<br><br>Please don't make up some bull about it is solely the environment that create homosexuals. I grew up in an environment where almost all my cousins are females but i have no special affections towards males and there are many examples of homosexuals that grew up in perfectly normal environments and family but could not help developing non-social acceptable sexual habits.<br><br></div>
