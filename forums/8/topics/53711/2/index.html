Notice my emphasis on homosexual instead of gays since apparently the revulsion towards homosexuals is against males pairing.<br><br>Remember how in the Genesis it was said that women was created from man? But science has now proven that a male is in fact borned female, before receiving a penis. How can we even be sure of what God really wants out of us when the Bible can make up a story of males being created first just so they can justify their patriarchial society ?<br><br>How can we be even sure that it is not simply the priests who hated homosexuals and claimed God didn't like them?<br><br><span style="color: red;">A being who according to the Bible is the creator of the universe as we know it could not predict the possibility of homosexuals within his creations?</span> Yet every pastor i've met claimed &gt;&gt;HE&lt;&lt; is all knowing.<br><br>Please don't make up some bull about it is solely the environment that create homosexuals. I grew up in an environment where almost all my cousins are females but i have no special affections towards males and there are many examples of homosexuals that grew up in perfectly normal environments and family but could not help developing non-social acceptable sexual habits.<br></div></blockquote>What do u mean by that statement? that God didn't know that there would be homosexuals? For goodness sake.. there were homosexuals wayyyy before our time.. in Sodom and so on. And no, there was not supposed to be sin, but man fell from grace and so went into sin.<br><br>Oh, and abt science 'PROVING' that males came from females.. how can anyone be so sure? How many times has science been proved wrong again and again? Can anyone really be 100% sure?<br><br>I've just gave u my personal beliefs, if u dont like it, well..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Dont agree then.

No one can be 100% sure. Science is never a 100% sure. Recently in school, i've been study philosophy and stuff like that.. about science, etc. Science is all about theories. There is no such thing as something that is DEFINITELY true, only guesses based on what we tell ourselves is true.<br><br>Dont think that'll make much sense to you.<br><br>How many times has science been proven wrong? How many times has scientists had to take back what they said? Take Einstein for example. For countless years, many scientific 'facts' has been based on his theories, like the infamous E=mcÂ² equation. But recently, some scientists actually believe that it may be wrong. And all this time no one has even doubted that it is nothing but 100% correct.<br><br>*apologises for putting some people to sleep with physics*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

And that is that we are not under all those laws anymore.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Oh, and especially for ur benefit, here's the part in the new testament which says homosexuality is a sin. The Apostle Paul, writing by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, declares that homosexuality "shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (I Corinthians 6:9; 10). It specifically lists, among other sins, and i quote "...or men who have sexual relations with other men... will not inherit God's kingdom."<br><br>And in the old testament: He said to His people Israel, "Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination" (Leviticus 18:22). "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them" (Leviticus 20:13).<br><br>So there u go, it is in both testaments. Funny how after claiming to have read the whole bible.. u missed out that part?<br><br>In Romans 1:26-31 twenty-three punishable sins are listed with homosexuality leading the list. Paul wrote, "For this cause God gave them up into vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet" (Romans 1:26, 27).<br><br>There.. is that enough for you? Now what else would u come up with next? What other things will u claim to have done? I stand by what i said before, u are full of nothing but HOT AIR. You talk like u're all knowing but is proved wrong again and again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course the Church cannot behave like dictatorship on the homosexuals....all she can do is setting the right examples backed by the holy Scriptures, do not herself promote or show favor to any deviant moral standards and most importantly able to discipline those under her stewardship who have erred in order to show example to the world outside.

Sure, I have to admit some churches might be corrupt, but not all.<br><br>In my opinion, YOU have to stop acting like u're better than everyone else, and that u know more than anyone else. All u know is big talk, u seldom have anything to back up what u say. All talk and nothing else. Like CLAIMING to have read the whole bible..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If u have to lie in order to get ur point across, then obviously u dont have much of an argument in the first place.</div>
