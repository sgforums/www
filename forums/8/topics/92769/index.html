The law should be fair &amp; just... legislative is slacking on this issue totally in singapore... investment rip a minimum rewards... may it be happy family or to provide not gaining... but at least it should never give more agony after done all he can... 1st concept of law &amp; order is wrong, 2nd given more priviledge to women, meaning man rearly able to really stand up without getting a slam dunk, 3rd priority of maintaining a non chaios society so that ppl r confident to invest the other half of his life..., 4th concept of sexes... women r also given the right to choose to give birth or not so should not be in any way surpassable to the society rights a man gain for serving the nation his whole lifetime or at least half... the risk is taken, protection taken, provide taken,... money.... then wat's more left life also want to take, because we can physically take it does not mean we have to take it... (learned from women) why should we take anymore harsher treats... since then i've been thinking of a way to demolish todays increasing threats without harming on the governments policy of increasing population of Singapore... make it legally just for the sex... law is only usefull if it is just. I'm a Libra <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>1st)if the only way to show the commitment is using one lifetime, so be it still i will provide to be fair, protect, commit, faithful &amp; help but in no way is the slacking legislative going stab me on my back oneday...<br><br>2nd)if still there r still so much intangible or tangible privilges provided unfairly to both sexes, i can do my part by not providing a single privildge anything or ability under my jurisdiction.<br><br>3rd)Unity is greatest strength... learned from women, i hope that man will too unit like women does... wat is pride of man when other man helps the women unjustly... she will not change for the better... curb her justly i mean, do not serender ur life in any means, the society will get better.<br><br>4th)The marraige problem will get better if the sexes r balanced... help those in need &amp; curb the overly arrogance.<br><br>5th)Physically able does not mean i'm born to be slaves, to woman who does not understand wat is love..."treat everything given as a bonus gift, taking it for granted means we guys r not doing anythng meaningfull at all, so we'll stop it untill a win win situation is absolute.<br><br>6th) This is the last resort... make sure the women aren't able to provide to themselves... meaning only married women are allowed to work &amp; earn money... if money is the main cause (It is stupid &amp; really sux but as long as it works... it is of good cost.) I too do not like this... it is a burden.<br><br>7th) I'll leave my lovely homeland 4ever<br><br>I show no sense of challenging, i mean harmony,peace &amp; happiness.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Lucky u to understand the meaning of she loosing a person who loves her wholeheartedly... but u only lost a person who does all she can to leave u... the determination performed by her that u never had seen before when both of u r in the relationship... &amp; u can be so damn sure that even if she returns u will be the gainer... if she never returns , she had lost it all. Upside down will her life be. c how long she can take ur game... &amp; yes from then on she will be in a maze, need not worry anymore.<br><br>There is a cost for every game.<br><br>I HEREBY SALUTE TO THOSE WHO HAD PUT IN EFFORT! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People now watch too many TV show. Think must love until no limit then consider love. Negative impact of TV show and it's promotion of selfless love (sometimes to the point of stupidity). Impact is that expectations are high or someone falsely thinking that love means giving in to everything (i.e. no life of his/her own). This happens to both guy and gal. See too many one-sided love liao.<br><br>So, everyone, please learn to<br>(1) don't expect perfection - TV bluff one;<br>(2) don't be con to always give in - you want to live the rest of your life that way?</div>
