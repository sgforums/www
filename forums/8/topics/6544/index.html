            <div class='col-md body'>MAR 12, 2000<br>Women dying to be equal<br><br>By DEXTER FILKINS<br><br>LOS ANGELES TIMES<br><br>ARASADITHIVU, Sri Lanka -- In a land where women are prized for their quiet passivity, one of the world's most ruthless guerilla groups is riding towards victory on the strength of its female fighters.<br><br>The women of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, rebels waging a war for an independent homeland in this island nation, are emerging as the movement's most important weapon after thousands of men have died in battle.<br><br>With vials of cyanide hanging from their necks, women Tigers are shooting their way into government bunkers and police stations. They are hacking to death men, women and babies.<br><br>Seetha, a 22-year-old leader of 1,500 women fighters, stands just over 1.5-m tall, wears her hair neatly trimmed and says she might one day like to have a family. Dressed in camouflage fatigues and toting a machine gun, she talks with the cool confidence of a battle-hardened commander.<br><br>"It's difficult to say how many people I've killed," said Seetha, who gave up her real name when she became a Tiger. "Sometimes after a battle, there might be 50 or 75 bodies lying around. It's hard to say how many of them were mine."<br><br>The women are proving just as ruthless as the men: In September, a squad of mostly women Tigers armed with swords and knives entered the Sinhalese village of Borapola and butchered 48 civilians.<br>but also challenging long-held views of their gender in this traditional society.<br><br>In December, a woman suicide bomber threw herself at President Chandrika Kumaratunga and blew herself up, blinding the Sri Lankan leader in one eye. A couple of weeks later, another woman exploded herself outside the Prime Minister's house, killing 10 other people.<br><br>Mr Anton Raja, a Tiger spokesman, said the use of women in war is part of a larger vision of the guerilla leadership to liberate Tamil women from the bonds of tradition.<br><br>"In the old society, women were cultured and nice. We loved them, but they had no major role outside of the kitchen. We went around to the women and told them: 'You are the equal of men, you have the same rights, you can join us in the struggle.' "<br><br>The result, according to him: "Hundreds and hundreds of women signed up to fight."<br><br>Suresh, a male Tiger officer, shrugged off the presence of women fighters. A foot soldier until he was badly wounded, Suresh says he fought alongside women for years.<br><br>Tiger women are held to the same cult-like standards as the men: no sex outside marriage; no marriage for anyone with less than five years' service; abstention from alcohol and cigarettes; the mandatory name change; and unquestioning allegiance to Prabhakaran. Violators have been executed.<br><br>________________<br><br>Equality?<br>there are women who just do it. of course one can argue about the nature or the methods. then there are those who whine about not getting it without having a clue the price it has. death or a lesser sacrifice....<br><br>cheerio<br><br>------------------<br>There are a number of mechanical devices which increase sexual arousal in women. Chief among these is the Mercedes-Benz 380SL convertable.<br><br>P.J. O'Rourke<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 12 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence<br><br>exploited again.  just like the old govts realize that enfranchising women meant more votes for them, tamil tigers used these women to fight for them.  they could have done the "favour" and gave them equal rights before, but of course none of that happened until they realized that women could kill, too.<br><br>oh well, there's no such thing as free lunch, right?</div>
