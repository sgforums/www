But the quirks are gone, you feel bored, you don't want to come to work anymore.  You spend your time working a little and when you talk to your colleagues, you talk about how sucky the workplace is.  You're monitored everywhere you go, you're monitored when you type anything on the keyboard.<br><br>How do you think you will feel?<br><br>Unless the staff are a-ok with the decision, productivity might increase, but now that the staff are sending a rep to discuss about this issue, they are not agreeable and should this still be implemented.

            <div class='col-md body'>Mebbe the representative shd just give the book 1984 to them and tell them, its just one step away from Big Brother.<br><br>Anyway any company which has to resort to this way to ensure productivity obviously shd be looking at proper HR policies, supervisory roles, and another areas. Incentive - not fear - should be what pushes employees. Why don't they just employ slave drivers with whips - that will REALLY ensure productivity!<br><br>It is also a big waste of resources - in order to ensure this system works, they need to employ people or use current resources to SCREEN what is being written - even if it is at random. THEN they need to implement disciplinary action. UNless they can ensure these steps will be carried out sufficiently - and that means a lot of extra man hours - then really its kind of stupid.<br><br>heheh Anyway hor.. uhh.. last time whenever I 'keng' at work... cos mostly I'll be using my mouse so if people keep hearing me type, obviously I'm not.. err working. Then I'll just use the disability keyboard which allows me to 'type' using a mouse. It's slow but... heee the survelliance software can't track mouse movements, can they? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">   (They can, however, track softwares being used)<br><br>Stupid Solution</div>
