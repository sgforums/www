            <div class='col-md body'>It was a nite out to celebrate Shain's birthday, in advance, and the only one invited is Rin. The reason on why she is the one being invited only is simple, Shain feel for her.<br><br>Rin is a plain ger in her early twenties, not really tat kind of ger who could make head turns along Orchard Rd but she do haf an aura that makes pple who knows her, wanting to know her better. And Shain was one of those guys who fell under her magic.<br><br>Shain got to know Rin at a friend's chalet. She is the most apporiate ger around to chat up with, as the rest were attached. And as they did, they realised tat they do share common interests like jogging and swimming and working out.<br><br>After a few days of yanking off on the phone, Rin agreed to Shain's date for a nite out to celebrate his bday, in advance.<br><br>"Hows the food eh" Shain tried to keep the conversation going as they dine at Swenson.<br><br>"Not really nice today.. the fries is cold and the beef is so hard! Not worth the money at all." She reply plainly.<br><br>"I feel tat its quite okie, thinking tat its only once in awhile i eat at such places."<br><br>"Hahaaa.." Rin's giggling reminds him of her very first gf, which he still think of from time to time. "Its the 3rd time i ate at Swenson this mth... I'm just not used to eat in foodcourts or hawker..."<br><br>"Woah, now u know where all ur pay goes to eh, boosting sg's economy, hehee.." Shain never knew tat she live such an expensive lifestyle, for her age at least. Rin did boost about her LV bag which cost her near 1.3k, after mths of saving. "U sure live a high life, dont think i can catch up with tat..."<br><br>"Its nothing actually, just something i enjoy."</div>
