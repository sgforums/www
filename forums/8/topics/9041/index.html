            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>I have reserved my special post to this number. This is perhaps a very special or bizarre post from me. It should have been done on 1300, but I guess if it is more meaningful, it should be done in 1314, because for those have played with pager numbers, you would know that this number in Cantonese means, Yi Shen Yi Shi i.e. a lifetime. I always wanted to write a special post but find numbers like 1000 or 2000 being too usual. So I chose a special number for this once.<br><br>Why 1314? Perhaps, it is a number about faith. I remember that there are two folklores saying that if one could make a 1314 stars or 1000 cranes, one could have a wish to come true. Though my wishes have failed twice, I never stop giving up in folding them and give it to people whom I meet on the way. I still believe in them, and perhaps, it is this believe that would propel me to hope for the thing I desire in my life. If one could start having faith in what they believe, I presume that someday, the impossible might become the possible. Even if it do not turn out that way, and impossible becomes remain impossible, at least the last thing I did was to try. Similarly, I urge people to try.<br><br>Have anyone of you watched a movie by Drew Barrymore entitled "Never Kissed Before"? The story is about this reporter (Drew Barrymore), who was asked to go undercover in a college, and somehow she made her way to become the prom queen in the end. Of course, she fell in love with her teacher, without him knowing who she was. In the end, she exposed her identity, and then the guy did not forgive her. So she wrote a commentary in the newspaper, and waited 10 minutes in the baseball stadium for him to come before a game starts. Well, of course, it is not the romantic bit which struck me so deeply. In the article, she mentioned that in her school life, she grew up in a more conservative way, worked hard and got herself a good job, and have missed all the things in her life, like teenage romance, one night stands and even she even missed going for a prom and was never kissed before.<br><br>There are some things in my life (and I have missed them already) before I start working in 2 years time, which I want to experience before I would to go. To be able to experience the future, the first and foremost requirement is not to dwell in the past or let loose ends of the string still dangle in your heart. After a year in SGforums, perhaps, thanks to the people here, and particularly a special friend of mine who always make beautiful pictures and share a common taste with me on Cantonese drama serials, particularly "At the Threshold of An Era 2", I have moved on, making a very big step in the last 2 days. A lot of loose ends has more or less tied up and buried by a cruiser passing the Bay of Bengali. I have some strange bizarre encounters on my journey to India and the journey has brought me many happy moments and many stressful moments.<br><br>If I do not manage to make it, I will find it regretful that I did not manage to do it. One of the things that I really wish to do in my life is to bring this gal, whom I have never met in my life to the Mayball 2001 in Cambridge. That is the small town which I lived in. The bard has ceased to be the storyteller, and wish to be in the story. Sometimes, when I miss a chance, I feel that I am always at the wrong place at the wrong moment. I made many promises and I fulfiled most of them when I got back to SG the last time. Hence I would look forward to fulfiling this promise. If you are worth it, I can wait for you a year, if u are the One, even if I have to wait 10 years for you, why not?<br><br>I am quite happy with where and who I am... And hope everyone of you will be so as well....<br><br>I will leave this URL for people who dream and believe and have a good time, particularly friends of mine who are asking for a 2nd chance again :<br><a href="http://prodigal.diaryland.com/theone.html" rel="nofollow">http://prodigal.diaryland.com/theone.html</a><br><br>Good luck<br><br>See you soon....<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>A Happy Prodigal<br>from Chennai<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>
