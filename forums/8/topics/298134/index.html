            <div class='col-md body'>Recently, I received a call, offering me a complimentary makeover session at this company 'S' at Hong Kong Street and that end of the day; I will get 2 free photos as complimentary. As I have not tried makeover with this company, I went for it.<br><br>The experience wasnÂ’t great. The consultant upfront told me there is no obligation about their offer after the makeover as the main objective is to let me enjoy the process. Of course, I expected hard-selling at the end of the session.<br><br>During the process, I wasnÂ’t at all satisfied with the make up and hairdo. Besides, the makeover was done at a very old staircase, which surprised me. After that, it was another 2 backgrounds, more like what would happen in a studio.<br><br>After the session, I was shown the photos and the consultant started to sell her products, which was to persuade me to buy package of their albums/posters. However, I wasnÂ’t satisfied with the outcome of the photos as the makeup appeared too light and didnÂ’t bring out the beauty of a makeover. After much persuasion, I was firm that I am not taking up the package but the consultant kept going on, saying it was her job to finish up the description. Apparently, she wasnÂ’t happy and even called her manager to talk to me. To no avail, the latter told her to give me my photos and passed her the CD to copy the files. I was not allowed to choose the best 2 shots as she just dragged any 2 files on the PC to the CD and started the copying. I asked her why I wasnÂ’t allow to choose and her reply was, because I am not taking up the package and that the terms and conditions state that customers are not allowed to choose. I didnÂ’t even see the terms and condition she was talking about. After which, she replied that complimentary is like that.<br><br>That is too realistic and ignorant of her. I told her off that if they are doing complimentary this way, they are sure to lose business in the long run as I wonÂ’t consider the photo shoot nor would recommend anyone there.<br><br>I would advise those who have received calls about complimentary photo shoot from this company, not to waste time and money trying out.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I received a call from the same studio in the evening, offering me complimentary again. I thought what the heck this company is doing, the staff don't even communicate. The guy who called, didnt know i went yesterday. So I told him I went and not happy with the service and that consultant. His manager called shortly to find out what happened. Haha.. I told him all my displeasure but too bad couldnt remember that consultant's name.</div>
