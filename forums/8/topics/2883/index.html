            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with nutx, some gals who are just casual friends, really take you for granted. For example, once when I went to my friend's chalet at East Coast. When I was about to leave for home with my gf, I agreed to drop this girl friend of my friend out of courtesy at the nearest taxi stand at Marine Parade. Guess what ?<br><br>I overheard the girl telling my friend, saying that I am not sporting to drive her home, which is at Toh Tuck, I feel like really stopping the car at the expressway shoulder and ~@!#$^%*&amp;()_~!@#$%^ throw her out. But to keep my cool in front of my gf, I dropped her at a secluded taxi stand at Siglap. hehehhehh Serve her rite for demanding so much.<br><br>Like Asure had said, sometimes when you treat ppl too good, they really climb up your head and shit on it. !@#$%^&amp;*()__)(*&amp;^%</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everybody for your enthusiastic responses..now for my own opinion...<br><br>As a girl, I would really appreciate if my bf (if he drives) offer to pick me up for the date, and drive me home after that. I believe this to be the responsibility of the guy. Moreover, considering that my place is a distance away from the nearest MRT station, it can be quite inconvenient and time-consuming when i take public transport. Since my bf has the priviledge of having a car, i dun see why he should not pick me up. This said, I must emphasize that I would only expect him to drive me when i go out with him. I will NOT ask him to come pick me up or send me home when I go out with other friends coz I'm not treating him as my chauffer.<br><br>If however, it's just casual friends, i think it would be nice to send your frds home if it's on the way, if not, drop them  at the nearest busstop or mrt station.<br><br></div>
