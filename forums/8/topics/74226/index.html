            <div class='col-md body'>FUMO FUMO FUMO~~~ "Heres smth for U peeps to read &amp; tink abt..."<br><br>Business Times<br>Published October 11, 2003<br>Young, successful - and in search of a dream<br><br>By DANIEL BUENAS<br><br>UNHAPPY - that's how I feel as a young Singaporean.<br><br>I feel this way not because I'm jobless, poor or uneducated. In fact, I<br>have a good job, a stable income and a good education. By most<br>standards, I should be considered a successful young man.<br><br>However, I am slowly realising that the achievements I have been<br>chasing are, perhaps, a chimera. I have sought and yearned for success,<br>when perhaps what I should have been looking for was happiness, or meaning<br>in life.<br><br>This is the dilemma that the youth in Singaporeface - we cannot<br>reconcile our apparent success with our gnawing dissatisfaction with<br>life, and nobody can tell us why.<br><br>What we suffer from is a crisis of the soul.<br><br>Young Singaporeans are getting lost in a world in which our worth as<br>human beings is tied to our material, social and physical successes.<br><br>However, as we look behind these successes, we often find the faded<br>vestiges of what once were our dreams. Thus, our life's purpose has been<br>drowned in the ocean of practicality.<br><br>This distinction between success and happiness was brought home to me<br>recently after the death of a friend. He had passed on suddenly and in<br>the prime of his life, and his death shook me from the stupor of endless<br>days of work.<br><br>I realised that I had perhaps neglected my family and friends around me<br>and,in so doing, had lost the true meaning of life.<br><br>It is too late now, but if I could speak to my friend one last time, I<br>wouldn't say anything. Instead, I would listen to what he had to say.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because Singaporeans are too busy rushing to work, rushing from work<br>and rushing at work. We don't take the time to listen to others.<br>His death made me reflect on my own life, and the search for happiness.<br>Sadly, the need to find meaning in life wasn't one of the things I<br>learnt at school. The need for success, however, was.<br><br>The desire for success is ingrained in our national psyche, and has<br>been pursued with a fervour that equals - and often surpasses - religious<br>zeal.<br><br>From young, we are streamed, labelled and forced into educational<br>moulds,emerging as world-class products of our world-class education<br>system. We graduate equipped to be successful in life.<br><br>Yet, I feel that in some way, we are lacking. I was never taught to<br>pursue my dreams. Instead, I was taught to be practical. I chose my<br>field of study, computer science, and my university based on practical<br>considerations. I thought this would eventually lead to success. But<br>success doesn't always translate into happiness.<br><br>Perhaps my idealism is brought about by a life that has not known the<br>cruelty of war, or the bitter struggle for survival. Yet, I have met<br>those who hold on to similar ideals, despite going through great suffering.<br><br>For instance, I recently interviewed a well-respected academic who<br>spoke at length with me on the virtues of finding meaning and purpose in<br>what we do. He was no stranger to suffering, having lived through the<br>Japanese occupation, the Communist revolution in Chinaand nearly starving<br>to<br>death as a young boy. After so much hardship, one would expect him to extol<br>the virtues of being practical.<br><br>Instead, he spoke of passion, desire, purpose and happiness in what we<br>do. I found it ironic that it took a senior citizen to point this out to<br>what he called 'a handsome, energetic young man' (what I found even more<br>ironic was his use of the word 'handsome').<br><br>Singaporean youth need to learn that our lives are not just about<br>achieving success and that we cannot rely on the government or society<br>to provide us with the reason for our existence. If we do, we will surely<br>come away disillusioned and disappointed.<br><br>More than anything, Singaporean youth need to know that the beauty of<br>life lies in fulfilling our own dreams - not someone else's - and that<br>we should not fear pursuing them, whatever they may be. Therein lies our<br>road to happiness.<br><br>As Eleanor Roosevelt so eloquently put it: 'The future belongs to those<br>who believe in the beauty of their dreams'.<br><br>The writer is a BT journalist. He is 24.<br><br>~Happiness is a perfume you cannot pour on others without getting a few<br>drops on yourself~<br></div>
