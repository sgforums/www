              <p>He used to grace this forum with some of his famous women bashing threads. Some of it may be blunt but to a certain extent holds some truth. Below are some of his words and you all can judge.</p>
              <p> <span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0); color: #454545; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;">Caramon says:</span></p>
              <div style="color: #454545; font-family: UICTFontTextStyleBody; font-size: 17px; text-decoration: -webkit-letterpress;"><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"><br>If we ask any woman what she's looking for in a man, she'll come out with a long list of ennobling qualities: a sense of humor; a guy who's nice to her and treats her well; good values; a strong moral character, interesting and intelligent, but monetary terms will never be in the picture.. Does that means she will go for the poor guys if he have the above qualities? ... NO...<br><br>Many women lie.. They are experts at self-deceit because if they ever admitted to themselves what they really want from men, then they'd be forced to acknowledge that they don't really want a "nice" guy.. They are equally contradicting as they always lament about the lack of "Nice" men arounds..<br><br>I always watch what a woman does, rather than what she says.. And what does she actually do? When it comes to choosing men, she heads straight for the cash.. What women want most from men -- and therefore the criterion most significant to them in selecting a mate -- is money or the assurance of thereof in the future.. ThatÂ’s probably why guys with a bigger house have an edge over the poor live-with-parents-kid.. And guys driving Lexus have an edge over SMRT riders...<br><br>You'll never catch a woman saying what she wants is a tall handsome man who drives a continental car, with lots of money and lives in a condo.. They got to have thick skin aka leather to do that (and we all know how lovingly soft the skins of sweet asian things are.)<br><br>Some women are blatant about their mercenary choices, openly choosing men with substantial material assets that they can exploit.. But most are subconscious hypocrites, screening out less successful men without admitting it to themselves.. They publicly announce that all they want is a nice guy, but privately disregard any men who don't meet their elevated standards for money, success, and status..<br><br>Let's be honest -- if women really chose men based on what they say they're looking for, then every nice, average guy out there would be besieged with females trying to go out with him.. Like my friend Peter, nice, average looking generally stay at home on the weekends with a date from the PC/TV..</span><br style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"></div>

Its not about women-bashing, but the retaliation that we(men) finally did after tolerating all these years.. so those feminist wants equality.. but cried foul when guys back-lash at them..</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Girls likes to assume being in a stronger position, but when presented in such a situation, they find those guys as wimps or not assertives enough.. when going for a date, they like guys to treat them as their equals, but when it comes to payment, they expects guys to pay.. It's officiate as 'correct' or a must, but when urge their counterparts to foot the bills, girls lament them as 'stingy and 'ungentlemen'.. comments like this have become so common place that nobody stops and thinks how 'unequal' or 'unfair' this is..</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">I wish I can logically explain this phenomenon, but it's beyond my ability to fathom what's going on in their pea size brain.. They have no problem to treat men as their equals, but they got a big problem in behaving like a 'gentlemen'</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Apparently, we guys are supposed to take insults 'like a joke' or 'like a man', but when a guy says something about girls, he's label as 'sexist' or a chauvinist.. Girls like to project themselves as independent when around with guys, but when in the presence of ang moh, singapore women turn into submissive sl_uts.. All that 'modern independent woman' crap goes out of the window the moment they start licking the boots of the ang moh..</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">But one thing I can do, is say that the phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever.. As more local guys are marrying overseas, its only time before those feminists, intellectual wh0res finally woke up to find themselves in a 'solace' situation and realise they should remain less vocal and in less unassuming position.. Until then, I propose a toast to all the guys.. You know who you are, and I know you are sick of the double standards thats been practising by the local ladies.. Fear not, as your well deserved vindication is coming..</span></span></div>

Women are the engines of love, acting much like the heart in the body.. They create the family that is the fundamental building block of society and the foundry of the future..</span><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">But, singaporean females refuse to acknowledge the fact that THEY are the ones who've become unattractive &amp; unfeminine to local men..</span><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">So what does today's singaporean woman bring to the marriage table? So she has her own career, her own car, her own business.. So what? A man also has his own career, his own car, his own business.. So where's the difference.. For a man, it's just like marrying another man..</span><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">Nature had intended men to be masculine &amp; women to be feminine.. That's why there's a ying &amp; a yang.. Opposites attract &amp; complement each other.. If a woman has qualities that are the same as a man, where's the attraction? It's just like being with another man...</span><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><br style="color: #333333; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 22px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto;">I believe THAT'S the real reason why singaporean Men are marrying foreign women..
