              <p>My suggestion would be to just just include the paint, wood and metal components into the cost. Let cost price be X. Your selling price given the nature of your product should be Y% of X + X=Z.</p>
              <p>In this case, Y will your variable.</p>
              <p>Do a calculation of how much does your heating equipments and misc. tools cost and see how many clocks do you need to sell to break even. If you believe you can sell 30 of these clocks, let Y x 30 be 50% of your investment cost in the heating equipments and misc. tools.</p>
              <p>Therefore, you'll need to sell 60 clocks to break even. This is provided you believe they will sell. Since you need to sell 60 of them to break even, Z should be &lt;$8, which is a sum of money I'd pay for a clock.</p>
              <p>This is just my 2 cents, just suggesting<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>there's no right or wrong way to set a selling price for your product =)</p>
              <p>but u need to set ur objectives right and identify all costs that you intend to cover.</p>
              <p>so far you mentioned materials and equipments. how about overheads? manpower? opportunity costs? storage costs? work area? up to you to factor them in if you realise these costs play a big factor in your production. if they are not consistent, your prices will vary in the future if these factors are not plan properly.</p>
              <p>so objective is low and affordable? low but enough to cover costs, what about profit margin? any target profit margin? or do you want to approach a different strategy by benchmarking against the market rates and putting a lower price? but will it cover your costs and target profit margin?</p>

              <p>When the product is new to the consumers, it is always prudent to set the selling price of the product according to what the consumers has evaluated.</p>

              <p>Thanks all! :-D Happy new year!<br><br><strong>From Dinky1409:<br></strong>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">so far you mentioned materials and equipments. how about overheads? manpower? opportunity costs? storage costs? work area? up to you to factor them in if you realise these costs play a big factor in your production. if they are not consistent, your prices will vary in the future if these factors are not plan properly.</span><br>----------------------------------------------<br><br>Actually, since this is going to be a very small business (just part-time, won't even register it as a real biz), manpower, work area and storage costs won't be a problem, because I'll be working in my bedroom. Actually, a 2 by 2 metre work area allocated in my bedroom is enough. X-D<br><br>btw, what is opportunity cost?<br><br>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">what about profit margin? any target profit margin? or do you want to approach a different strategy by benchmarking against the market rates and putting a lower price? but will it cover your costs and target profit margin?<br></span>----------------------------------------------<br><br>I'm trying to make S$5 - 6 out of each product. I already have a day job so I'm not looking too much to make a real living from this, but to supplement my income.<br>I've thought of benchmarking against the market and setting a lower price, but then, their biz concept and marketing etc is different from mine, so I rather not go that route.<br><br>My idea is to keep it affordable for people to buy in this economy, and also sensible enough for me to make some $.<br><br><strong><br>From Mk7:</strong><br>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">18 dollars. For something handmade, it's low enough and good enough for skills+misc+profit.</span><br>----------------------------------------------<br>are handmade stuff usually expensive?<br><br><br><strong>From Parn:<br></strong>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">When the product is new to the consumers, it is always prudent to set the selling price of the product according to what the consumers has evaluated.<br></span>----------------------------------------------<br>So, if the customer see the product as S$3.99 stuff, then how? X-D<br><br><br><strong>From Bubbly:</strong><br>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">Product cost = ( Material cost + Equipment cost + Transport cost + Workmanship cost/hr + 30~50% profit)<br>Handmade items most of the time ppl sell it at 2 ~3 times it supply cost.<br></span>----------------------------------------------<br><br>Ah, I think I can use the above formula to base my pricing on, just that for the Equipment cost, I will probably not factor it 100% in. Maybe like:<br><br>Product cost = (Material cost + 3% of Equipment cost....blah blah blah)<br><br>If I factor the equipment cost 100% in, then if the equipment costs $12,000, then ho-seh liao.<br>The final price will be insane. :-)<br><br>If I just factor in a tiny % of the equipment cost, then I can recover it slowly, assuming I can sell the products.<br><br><br><strong><span style="color: #000000;">From Fatum:<br></span></strong>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">cos you can't set it at any less, but the cost price per unit of something made in china similar to yours would be considerably less than $10.67, so how you plan to compete ?<br></span>----------------------------------------------<br>I've thought about this before, but if I really have to compete with the Chinese, then mostly it will be through branding. A single "Made in Singapore" sentence printed on the product is enough to beat out most of them. :-D<br><br>Anyone, cannot compete with Chinese on price, will 101% lose out.<br><br><br><strong>From eagle:</strong><br>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">I think in China, the cost price would be like.... $10 for all 30?</span><br>----------------------------------------------<br>That's not surprising, but usually, that $10 is only if you order 5000 pieces in quantity or more. :-)</p>
              <p><br><strong>From Bubbly:<br></strong>----------------------------------------------<br><span style="color: #0000ff;">http://www.etsy.com/view_listing.php?ref=sr_list_8&amp;listing_id=8608860</span><br>----------------------------------------------<br>Thanks, but the link isn't working. :-)<br>However, if the price of that clock is $29.90 (USD, I assume), then it's really quite expensive.<br>Add in the shipping cost (especially International shipping) and you're looking at US$40+ for this clock.<br><br>The advantage to setting a high price for a product, though, is that it elevates the status of the product, because usually in people's minds, it's :<br><br>very cheap product = imitation, shoddy work, outdated, made-in-china, low quality, defects<br><br>very expensive product = premium quality, very rare, luxury item, precious, made in USA / France / Japan, one-of-a-kind<br><br>that's how it goes. :-D</p>

              <p>hmm orite cool.. but you may want to consider factoring in overheads such as electricity/water expenses if you incurred extra expenses in the production of your products..</p>
              <p>Roughly research on a good average market price for similar products, and you see if you can set a price below this price while still covering your material costs and targeted profit margin.</p>
              <p>You would want to consider lowering costs by getting cheaper materials to allow more profit margin or reduce your sellling price further. But of course, there is always a trade-off, and it may be quality wise.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, you can try to adopt the low price and differentiation strategy by making your products unique and difficult to be emulated by others and yet still cheap.. Depends on your workmanship i guess.. =)</p>
              <p><br>All de best! gd luck~</p>
