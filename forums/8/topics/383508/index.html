              <p>Today afternoon when I walk past city hall mrt station where there is a citibank branch there, a guy from citibank ask me to take up the credit card.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He say its free. There are no charges and if I apply now, by evening I will be able to get my credit card already. He say there are no annual fees to be paid and no hidden cost too. All I have to do is to use my singpass to log into cpf website using their computer than I can apply for it already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Have anybody try applying for this free credit card before?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I didn't apply it because I remember the age old saying that if anything sounds too good to be true than it probably is not true <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I see. They have a requirement of how much you should earn. Probably you exceed the amount required to get the card. <br><br>Probably the branch is near the Citibank Card Office, thats why for the fast response. <br><br>Suggest you login to<br><a href="http://www.citibank.com.sg">www.citibank.com.sg</a> for more details would be better =)</p>

              <p>It sounds like its the Citi Clear Card, with a credit limit of $500.</p>
              <p>Anyway if you're a student, why would u even need the credit limit? Stick to your pocket money and you'll be better off than having the daily temptation of over-spending with the CC in your wallets.</p>
              <p>Btw, not just the 24% interest, but a late payment charge of $25 applies too, if I'm not wrong.</p>
              <p>There's other similar cards from other banks too, so you can compare ard if anyone's really interested in this.</p>
