Your transport expense should be around Â¥1,000 or less per day. You can use their ez-link card, the Suica/PASMO card. I'll recommend you <a href="http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/suica-nex/index.html" rel="nofollow">get the Suica card together with your Narita Express (N'EX) ticket</a> at the JR office at Narita Airport. All seats on the N'EX are reserved.<br><br>2) Disneyland is still in Tokyo proper. It is just like a ride to Odaiba, and is nearer to Tokyo than Yokohama, half an hour away by train. The ride from Tokyo Station to Maihama is only Â¥210 and 20 minutes away by JR Musashino Line.<br><a href="http://www.hyperdia.com/cgi-english/hyperWeb.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.hyperdia.com/cgi-english/hyperWeb.cgi</a><br><br>3) You can choose to convert your Exchange Order to the Pass proper with your passport at any of the <a href="http://www.japanrailpass.net/eng/en009.html" rel="nofollow">exchange offices</a> at a later date after your arrival in Japan. However, it must be converted within 3 months from the purchase date at STB in Singapore.<br><br>4) You can use roaming services with any 3G-enabled phone. Cost for SingTel users are $10 Autoroaming charge for logging on to roaming network, and $0.42 per SMS sent.<br><a href="http://home.singtel.com/consumer/roaming/default.asp?ctry=Japan&amp;network=gsm%20900%20autoroam" rel="nofollow">http://home.singtel.com/consumer/roaming/default.asp?ctry=Japan&amp;network=gsm%20900%20autoroam</a> I'd prefer to use Internet services to call back.</div>

I m quite confuse where is belong to Tokyo.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div></blockquote>Chiba is to the west of Tokyo. Tokyo is a perfecture and a city of its own, on par as a perfecture like Chiba.<br><br>However, you're right in that the Greater Tokyo Area refers to the metropolitan area of Tokyo as well as neighbouring suburban areas, where many people commute to Tokyo for work daily. To the east of Tokyo is Chiba, west is Saitama, to the south is Kanagawa.<br><br>The airport is located within Chiba, that's how far it is away from Tokyo itself. After Narita Airport and Narita station, N'EX will stop at Chiba station before running express down to Tokyo proper. From Chiba station you can visit the Chiba Urban Monorail, the world's longest suspended monorail system. It's scary! Beyond that it is essentially a suburban area.<br><br>On Saitama side, you can visit Tama town (home of Hello Kitty), Studio Ghibili etc. But it is also essentially an suburban area.<br><br>Kanagawa has Yokohama, which was the base of foreign trade in the 19th century. It has more colonial buildings than other parts of Tokyo, with some recent modern development (Minato Mirai 21), and also the Yokohama Chinatown.<br><br>All these places are at least half an hour's journey by train from the Yamanote Line.</div>

Japan is still a strongly cash-based society and even if you have a card, ATM's do not run 24-hours, usually only when the post office is open.<br><br>In fact, the only ways I use a card overseas is to swipe for purchases and hotel stays. It's the most fool proof way to leave your cash for daily usage.<br><br>And don't worry, everyone there is used to carrying a few ten thousands out, but you should worry about your bringing cash out unless you plan to step into red light districts like Kabukicho. Otherwise Japan is a very safe country, much like Singapore, just have the normal precautions and some vigilance.<br><br><a href="http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2208.html</a></div>

The website form was pretty straight-forward in terms of field to fill in, but they emailed back in english a week prior to departure. The staff is based there 9 to 6 for check in and check out, beyond that u can use the access card to get in and out. Full payment on the first day. Foreigners must hand over their passports for photocopying, same as every hotel.<br><br>They speak very limited English but you don't really need their help except on the first and last days, if you know how to move around on your own. The room is big in terms of Japanese standards and is a steal for the price, but it's like a normal bedroom in a Singaporean HDB home.</div>
