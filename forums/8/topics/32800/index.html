            <div class='col-md body'>Remember these? &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;Well, This really brings back so much memories &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br>&gt;For those who studied in Singaporean primary schools...<br>&gt;Remember these?Heartwarming and a little funny... the things<br>we used to do... 50 things for Singaporean teenagers.<br>Sit,enjoy and think back about the past...Were you one of these?<br><br>1. You grew up watching He-man, Transformers, Silver hawk and Mickey<br>Mouse. Not to forget, Ninja turtles and Smurfs too.<br>2. You grew up brushing your teeth with a mug in Primary school<br>during<br>recess time. You will squat by a drain with all your classmates<br>beside you, and brush your teeth with a coloured mug. The teachers<br>said you must brush each side10 times too.<br>3. You know what's Bin(1) Fen(1) Ba (1) San(1) is all about.<br>4. You know what SBC stands for.<br>5. You were there when the first chinese serial, the Awakening was<br>shown on TV.<br>6.Internet? What the hell is that? So you thought a decade or more<br>ago.<br>7. You find your friends with pagers and handphone cool in Secondary school.<br>8. SBS buses used to be non-airconditioned. The bus seats are made of wood and the cushion is red. The big red bell gives a loud BEEEP! when pressed.There are colourful tickets for TIBS buses. The conductor will check for tickets by using a machine which punches a hole on the ticket.<br>9. Your favourite actor and actress is Huang Wenyong and Xiangyun. Next is Lee Nanxing and Zoe Tay and the Aiyoyo woman.<br>10. You've probably read Young Generation magazine. You know who's Vinny the little vampire and Acai the constable.<br>11. You were there when they first introduced MRT here. You went for the first ride with your parents and you would kneel on the seat to see the scenery.<br>12. Movie tickets used to cost only $3.50.<br>13. Gals are fascinated by Strawberry Short Cake and Barbie Dolls.<br>14. You learn to laugh like The Count in Sesame Street.<br>15. You longed to buy tibits called Kaka(20 cents per pack) and Ding Dang(50 cents per box), that had a toy in it and it changes every week not forgetting the 15 cents animal crackers and the ring pop, where the lollipop is the diamond on the ring.<br>16. You watched TV2(also known as Channel 10) cartoons because<br>Channel 5 never had enough cartoons for you.<br>17. All that you know about Cantonese is from the Hong Kong serials you watched on TV2.<br>18.Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, The Three Investigators, Famous Five and Secret Seven are probably the thickest story books you ever thought you have read. Even SweetValley High and Malory Towers.<br>19.Civics and Moral Education was "Hao3 Gong1 Min2".<br>20. KFC used to be a high class restaurant that serve food in plates<br>and let you use metal forks and knives.<br>21. The most vulgar thing you said was asshole and idiot and THE<br>MOST EXTREME WAS 'super white'...you just couldn't bring yourself to say the hokkien relative.<br>22. Catching was the IN thing and twist the magic word.<br>23. Your English workbooks was made of some damn poor quality paper that was smooth and yellow.<br>24. CDIS was your best friend.<br>25. The only computer lessons in school involved funny pixellised<br>characters in 16 colours walking about trying to teach you maths.<br>26. Waterbottles were slinged around your neck and a must everywhere you go.<br>27. Boys loved to play soccer with small tennis balls in the<br>basketball court or play something that uses tennis ball to hit<br>other players known as "HUM TAM BOLA" during recess /after school<br>28. Hopskotch, five stones,chateh and zero point were all the rage<br>with the girls and boys too...<br>29. Science was fun with the balsam and the angsana being the most important plants of our lives.<br>30. Who can forget Ahmad, Bala, Sumei and John, eternalized in our minds from the textbooks. Even Mr Wally.<br>31. You did stupid exercises like seal crawl and frog jumps.<br>32. Every children's day and national day you either get pins or<br>pens with 'Happy Children's Day 1993' or dumb files with Happy<br>National Day 1994'.<br>33. In Primary six you had to play buddy for the younger kids like<br>big sister and brother.<br>34. Chinese teachers were always old, boring and damn fierce<br>looking.<br>35. Your form teacher taught you maths, science and english.<br>36. The worksheets were made of brown rough paper of poor quality.<br>37. You went to school in slippers and a raincoat when it rained,<br>and you find a dry spot in the school to sit down, dry your feet,<br>and wear your dry and warm socks and shoes.<br>38. Famous Chinese singers were only Jacky Cheung, Andy Lau, Aaron Kwok and Leon Lai<br>39. School dismissal time was normally around 1 pm.<br>40. There would be spelling tests and mental sums to do almost<br>everyday.<br>41. Your friends considered you lucky and rich if your parents gave<br>you $3 or more for pocket money everyday.<br>42. During class gatherings, parents always tag along in case<br>someone gets lost at Orchard Road.<br>43. You freak out when the teacher tells you to line up according to<br>height and hold hands with the corresponding boy or girl.<br>44. Handkerchiefs were a must for both genders<br>45. Collecting notebooks and all kinds of stationery was a popular<br>thing.<br>46. Autograph books were loaded with "Best Wishes", "Forget Me Not",and small poems like "Bird fly high, hard to catch. Friend like you,hard to forget".<br>47. Class monitors and prefects loved to say "You talk somemore, Iwrite your name ah!"<br>48. There were at least 40 people in one class.<br>49. Large, colourful schoolbags were carried.<br>50. You brought every single book to school, even though there was one thing called the timetable.<br><br>Spread this heart warming message around ... but don't if you feel<br>untouched.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> miss old times... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>
