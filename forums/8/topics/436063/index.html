              <p>I remember once, a Chinese Singaporean ex-classmate of mine wrote on her facebook "I am not 100%". She later clarified that she meant that she has some indonesian ancestory. She uses the word 'Singaporean' in reference to race, and there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
              <p>However, whenever any of my Indian Singaporean classmates would refer to their race as Singaporean, the Chinese Singaporeans would say things like "your race is Indian, not Singaporean", while they themselves think of themselves as members of the Singaporean race. </p>
              <p>I personally feel that there is nothing wrong with identifying onself with nationality instead of race, like in France, but this is different. In this case, when the word 'Singaporean' is used, it only refers to Chinese Singaporeans. They seem to think that Chinese Singaporeans are members of the 'Singaporean race' while non-chinese Singaporeans, even the Malays, are whatever other races they are of.</p>
              <p>What do you make of this? Has things like the 'Speak Mandarin campaign' gone to certain people's heads?</p>

              <p>Start the "Speak Malay campaign"  and  "Speak Tamil campaign"  also lor.  How come no have them ?</p>
              <p>Recently I don't hear Malay children speak Malay to their parents anymore.</p>
              <p>A few weeks ago, this Malay father (with 2 children playing around) was talking to Malay lady friend (2 children around too) in Malay.  Whenever the father turns to call the children and communicates with them, he switches to English.   The Malay lady also talks to her children only in English.</p>

              opposition party in Tbilisi claims the authorities want to make
              English the dominant language in Georgia.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The Labor Party on
              Friday dismissed what they call a policy to make English the main
              language in the small republic located in the Caucasus.
              <strong>Forcing children to study a foreign language at the age of
              six means they can lose their “national identity,” Secretary
              General Iosif Shatberashvili said. <br></strong><br> Several dozens of teachers from the US, Canada, Britain and New
              Zealand came to Georgia on the same day to teach English in
              secondary schools. They are participating in the program “Teach and
              study in Georgia,” which President Mikhail Saakashvili started a
              year ago. The program has attracted more than a thousand teachers,
              and the authorities expect 500 more teachers by the end of the
              year.   <br> <br> The opposition says the <strong>government<em> “ignores Georgian and is doing everything to make English
              the dominant language.” </em>Without knowing English graduates
              cannot get their diplomas in universities, and state bodies do not
              hire them, Shatberashvili told reporters. </strong>  <br> <br> <strong>He stressed that the authorities want to declare English
              the state language. “As a puppet of Anglo-American imperialism,

              <p>Ik denk if this goes on deze kinderen/jong mensen will have a phobia of languages, Do you think the people will bother to care so much? kinderen can't learn that much of language, especially when their parents speak to them only in english and mandarin (for my case) and some dutch (via some sources)?</p>
