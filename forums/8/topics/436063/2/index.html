              <p>Indian race in Singapore is also singaporean . if we wanna talk about 100% originality . the malay in malaysia or in indonesia stand higher chance to be proven as 'more singaporean' than any of the other races . because singapore island was dominated by malaysia and indonesia empire long ago before any chinese junk ship ever made it to the shore .</p>
              <p>Basically all the chinese living in Singapore are not from 100% singaporean ancestry . our chinese ancestors came all the way down from china . and now that some china men come here to be their line of ancestry . we mock them .</p>
              <p>maybe in the past our chinese ancestors were also mocked by local singaporeans by their time too . see the contradiction here ? we are the same . just different time .</p>

              <p>Mijn vriend, you are not at all wrong, you are correct to a certain extent but it is because you use now as a point of reference only for the taal situation in Zingapoor. You are saying deze jong mensen find it useless because they are not using now. But when it becomes a subject parallel with Maths, Physics and Physical Education, even people who loathe them (initially) will have to learn. In the future, when everyone knows how to speak them, it will become useful, and all taal will not be optional anymore. Vee can look into future or possibilities. Ik denk it is goed.</p>

              <p>Hello OP.....your post is not clearly written, and also is not clearly thought out....</p>
              <p>First of all....</p>
              <p>It is true that there is no Singaporean race.</p>
              <p>Singaporean is a nationality / citizenship.</p>
              <p>Ethnicity or race is different.</p>
              <p>Ethnicty and race is determined by heritage (which group you are born into this world)</p>
              <p>Some people dont understand the difference between ethnicity/ race and nationality.</p>
              <p>Tomorrow you can emigrate to another country and adopt a new citizenship, then you can get a new nationality and can start referring to yourself as such.....but ethnicity and race cannot be changed (unless you perform drastic plastic surgery like Michael Jackson)</p>

              <p>Indian race in Singapore is also singaporean . if we wanna talk about 100% originality . the malay in malaysia or in indonesia stand higher chance to be proven as 'more singaporean' than any of the other races . because singapore island was dominated by malaysia and indonesia empire long ago before any chinese junk ship ever made it to the shore .</p>
              <p>Basically all the chinese living in Singapore are not from 100% singaporean ancestry . our chinese ancestors came all the way down from china . and now that some china men come here to be their line of ancestry . we mock them .</p>
              <p>maybe in the past our chinese ancestors were also mocked by local singaporeans by their time too . see the contradiction here ? we are the same . just different time .</p>

              <p>Because the Malays from Indonesia and Malaysia who came to settle in Singa Pura were already here before the chinese immigrants or the Indians made to shore . and that means their ancestry line is longer here than most of the chinese in Singapore .</p>
              <p>and so in accord to the matter posted by the topic owner . it is not ethical if only chinese in singapore that should be considered singaporean race . because if we really want to compare . the malays ancestry line is longer than our singaporean-chinese-race ancestry .</p>
              <p>And like you said . everyone who acquired singapore citizenship is 100% singaporean . if an FT came here and become permanent resident and later have family and got singapore citizenship . they are also singaporean . totally agree .</p>

              <p>I read that it has a little problem on identity and like to share opinion. Singaporean begins as a multicultural society that embrace each and every cultural importance such as celebrating of different festivals, an eulogy of ancestry contribution to society well beings. Identity is merely a label that should not be taken over zealously. As it will develop conflict and undesirable result for future well beings. As a matter of logic, there is white skin, dark skin, brownish and it can't do away either. Most importantly is a benevolent and loving-kindness mind/soul that all cultures, languages and races place emphasis upon. Singapore started off from a humble beginning and ought to be travelled with humble journey in order to enjoy everlastinly. It is not unusual along human history especially political leaders, for slight lost of sanity in an affluent city away from its humble beginning. Too much of political instability is an opportunity for breeding and nurturing of bad internal forces, and will tarnish the peace and harmony that all enjoy so far. And the future kinship of political leaders are not spared as well. It is lovely for all people across the globe to reside in Singapore, as you can imagine that a small city that has a size of the globe, how beautiful you all are in. The identity of Singapore is benevolent and loving-kindness based on the common interest of all people that love to live in joys and peace. It also work well in Singapore that has interests in foreign land for an amicable lasting relationship. In fact, the tenet of any cultures, races and languages etc is on joys and loving-kindness, too much emphasis over a language is not healthy given that the formation of mindset in Singapore may not be as so adulthood or cultured. For language emphasise, for instance, an expert in English may perceive some Singlish singaporean or non english speaking folks not as lovely based on language important, while in fact, a cultured mind does not necessary speak fluent english as that of an expert in english. Many folks process highly cultured mind that education of language alone is not matchable. This is through experiences of interacting with all walks of life in their course of humble beginning and true faith of cultured mind/soul passed down from their noble ancestry - truly lovely.</p>

              <p>I don't understand allm the race stuff discussed in this country. From a totally external and non-biased perspective,AFAIK</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some lower class chinese migrated from South China to part of M'sia,got kicked out due to Chinese majority,had great economic development atleast for the Govt. and infrastructure. Since the people were not very bright the Govt. decided to bring in more people. And now facing the truth that they suck they cry foul.Anything I missed?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know what happens in that little country of yours. Outside you are either Chinese/Malay or Indian. Nothing changes(except for some visa application) if you are Singaporean other than the race you look like.</p>
