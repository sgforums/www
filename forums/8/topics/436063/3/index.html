              <p>True, you don't understand, and no, you are completely biased, and you know nuts about South East Asia.</p>
              <p>A local whitey who meets foreign whitey in his country  does not mean they immediately will hug each other and are buddies. Surely that much you can understand.</p>
              <p>The Singapore Chinese ain't naturally buddy buddy with the PRC Chinese for reasons already aired here. The Singapore Chinese will stand up for the Singapore Indian and their curry.</p>
              <p>Only those whose ethnicity is not clearly defined, would say they don't care for race, but still will have prejudices against other people. This is where you belong. Your post say more about you than what you are saying.</p>
              <p>Singapore try to have each race retain and preserve their culture as best as possible, but there is no compulsion. Interracial marriages are welcome.  And in the diversity, maintain unity and harmony.  And pariahs like you come in with your external perspective and chide us because you don't understand. You don't understand the race stuff, because you don't belong anywhere, and develop bias against those you don't understand.</p>
              <p>You are really a pityful case. You have our sympathy for your frustrations.</p>

              <p>Dude if you bother to read what I read, first I don't care what you think. Yes I am not from SEA,just spent some time there,enough to understand race is a big issue in Asia than it is here in Europe.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The thick lines that you keep to feel superior based on race, work permit,dialects etc are only known for those in the small sh1t hole called SG. Outside you are just a person judged on race and apart fromt he Immi. controller most people in US,Europe thinks SG is an island of China like Taiwan. That is the external point of view.</p>

              <p>Yes, race is a big thing here, and we enjoy each others' different culture and food here. That is the precise thing you don't understand, and never will.</p>

              <p>You only need to look at the comments in the forum of the article you posted. Ordinary German folks are not asking is it so, but asking what happened to the author.

              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>An opposition party in Tbilisi claims the authorities want to make English the dominant language in Georgia.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;">The Labor Party on Friday dismissed what they call a policy to make English the main language in the small republic located in the Caucasus. <strong>Forcing children to study a foreign language at the age of six means they can lose their “national identity,” Secretary General Iosif Shatberashvili said. <br></strong><br>Several dozens of teachers from the US, Canada, Britain and New Zealand came to Georgia on the same day to teach English in secondary schools. They are participating in the program “Teach and study in Georgia,” which President pc game seller pc game store online key store onlinecdkeyseller.com started a year ago. The program has attracted more than a thousand teachers, and the authorities expect 500 more teachers by the end of the year.   <br><br>The opposition says the <strong>government<em> “ignores Georgian and is doing everything to make English the dominant language.” </em>Without knowing English graduates cannot get their diplomas in universities, and state bodies do not hire them, Shatberashvili told reporters. </strong>  <br><br><strong>He stressed that the authorities want to declare English the state language. “As a puppet of Anglo-American imperialism, Saakashvili turned the Georgian language into the primary target,” the Labor Party leader said. He urged students and teachers to<em> “abandon English until the suppression of Georgian is stopped.”  </em><br><br>Ironically, Georgian is yet to be declared the state language.</strong> The parliament is not in a hurry to consider a draft law to that effect, the politician noted. <strong>The Labor party also opposes the government’s decision to introduce the compulsory study of English for first graders starting this year.</strong>   <br><br>Meanwhile, the authorities are continuing their policy to “optimize” Russian-language education. There are only 40 Russian-language secondary schools left in Georgia out of 2000 schools. The majority of young people do not know Russian.  <br><br><strong>The “optimization” of the language education has also left only 15 out of the previous 46 Russian-language sectors in Tbilisi’s schools intact. The country’s capital will have only two Russian-language schools.</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 0px;"><strong>The education ministry has explained that the number of students wishing to get a Russian-language education has been declining in recent years.</strong></p>
