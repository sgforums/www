In fact there is nothing to worry about.<br>I am sure LHL can close the issue and GOH will be around playing the backup role, just like SM Lee.<br><br>Remember before the handover of My from Dr M? A big SH@T over the water issue and all those heated up talks about the ownership of just an islet with a lighthouse upon it. Dr M has to create a stir that can easily be resolved by the new PM so that the ppl of My can trust their new leader.<br><br>LHL's visit to TW may well be a test of how supportive China is towards Sg's new leader.
