              <p>Do we want more bad people to spice up our miserable lives? Do we really want that?  If not why do we allow them to happen? <br> <br> It is the same question as why we allowed ‘equal’ human beings like 
              politicians, diplomats, dictators to dictate us, control us and to pee 
              all over us and evidently informing us that it is just dirty rain. <br> <br> There is a common understanding that something horrible is happening yet our generation remains silent, unmoving and weak. <br> <br> We shaped our societies into police states, we nuclearize warheads and 
              we continue to build more prisons. What’re we really preparing for- 
              Global slavery?!<br> Slavery was once abolished? No, the power allowed it to mutate, the supposedly rejected still exist.<br> <br> We the people, the slaves, are either too ignorant or it’s a hush-hush topic that shouldn’t be discussed about. <br> This is unhealthy. <br> There is a decline in morality and empathy in our society and we should 
              be allowed to talk about contemporary slavery! Let me give you some 
              examples of some contorted strains of slavery. <br> Sexual slavery, “there is demand, and there will be supply”. <br> How infuriating, is that how our society is going to justify itself as 
              they legalize prostitution? - Unfortunately yes, lonely old man, ah 
              tiongs and Bangladeshi needs to unload too right?<br> <br> Strong hand no feel, use support hand, support hand always feels like somebody else‘s, try it today, say no to prostitution.<br> <br> How about child prostitution? <br> Oh boy, did I just crossed the line, now that’s totally wrong isn’t it? <br> So if there’s a huge demand to exploit children for commercial sex? Is 
              the society is going to tell me that it’s different, that it will never 
              allow such things to happen? <br> Our world knows no boundaries under this capitalistic regime. <br> In India, 40% of the commercial sex is provided by children, fark wow amirite?  I’m pretty sure; there is probably no god now.<br> <br> Let’s move on.<br> <br> You get caught by the police for petty crimes and the po-po gave you 2 
              to 9 years. Who says it’s impossible to have all three, better, faster 
              and cheaper, we have prisons for that sole purpose. <br> <br> Prisoners are chained up to perform work like mechanical robots 
              following routines and deadlines like everyone else expect their paid is
               cheaper than child’s labor,  they live in a 6 by 6 cell and some foul 
              play with the soap.<br> <br> That’s why we’re enlarging our prisons. Instead of using pure force and 
              domination, they wait patiently for you to make a mistake so they can 
              feed you to the beast.  <br> <br> There too many types of venom that will eventually turn a man bad- 
              disneyfication, consumerism, wage slavery, propagandas, religions and 
              those feces from your black box or extremely enormous LED TV set where  
              you just sit in there with your dilating eyes, shaking back and forth 
              waiting for the commercial to end. <br> <br> The most obvious and common one is CCTV; they’re putting up more and 
              more CCTV to ‘protect’ you, the public is constantly under the watch by,
               probably some really fat and creepy dude.<br> <br> CCTV is used as surveillance in prisons, airports, shopping malls and 
              highly protected areas- not anymore they’ve invaded the schools, public 
              transports and the corner of the stairs you and your lover(s) used to 
              snuggle at. <br> <br> They’re watching your every movement, raping your privacy and controlling your behaviors.  <br> Researches have shown that if you’re constantly being treated like 
              criminals and terrorists, the more likely you’re going to behave like 
              one. <br> <br> There is always debt bondage, the most common slavery we struggle against every-single-day. <br> <br> For those unfortunate kids like me, who aren’t lucky enough to be born 
              in a rich family will understand the concept of working to death or at 
              least coma  after 18 hours’ worth of over time.<br> <br> You work to consume and pay for the home you barely use except for 
              sleeping and with your initial debts from your education or your 
              parent’s. <br> I’m not finished, the highlight of all that is you has the bills, the 
              god damn bills, which kept coming and coming to the point you wish- you 
              had a gun in your mouth.<br> <br> In debt bondage, the slaves are rather unhappy with stress, diseases, anxiety and depression and all that. <br> <br> The common advice is always to look at people living in the third world 
              as you’re not showering in cow’s pee because I’m such a lucky busted.<br> As if it going to solve anything by looking at dirty dead children, it 
              only adds to the depression and hopelessness that showers the world.<br> <br> There are always creative outlets for such unhappiness, from my own 
              experience I use Microsoft word to write lengthy essay to express myself
               in a third person, whatever helps him sleep at night right? <br> <br> Those poor salves will usually fall into vices such as unhealthy eating 
              habits, smoking, prostitution, gambling, drinking and drugs.  <br> Further develop more health complications and difficulties that acquire medical care which only deepens the cesspit of debts.<br> Especially those who’re hooked by the jaw, those addicts who are 
              asphyxiate by their debts and their needs will force them to the extreme
               as they start a life of criminality and eventually reeling them into 
              the prison system.<br> <br> There goes the vicious cycle of prison, once you’re in the belly of the 
              beast, working in the penal labor; it’s unlikely you’re getting out of 
              the cycle. Kapeesh yellow ribbon?</p>

              <p>My father once told me to see my future like a blank canvas, it is up to me, the artist, to paint my own destiny and to fufill my own dream.I used to be able to dream but the canvas started to crumble, slowly as each year passed, the canvas gets smaller and smaller. I can only hope to have the willpower to keep holding on to what's left.</p>

              <p> What if, your suffering fuels your passion and your dissatisfaction motivates you to be better. Do you want to live in mediocrity, unmotivated and unmoving. The world is in the pursuit of happiness 
              but to be happy, isn't it just another desire, the truth is happiness 
              just a dream because happiness is biologically fixed since birth. Man 
              abandoned their individuality becoming mechanical robots rooted in a 
              fixed position. They gave up and gave in because the society created a 
              generation of defeatist.</p>
              <p>What is extreme? Nothing is of black or white, especially when 
              I'm a singaporean, influenced by both the east and west. My perspective 
              is mazed by the grey isthmus, I refused to be cooped in a cube, a piece 
              of lego that is replaceable and hollow.</p>
              <p>What lies beyond the isthmus is hyperboria, romanticized lands, an utopia, mystical, imaginary and non-existing.
               I am a hyperborean, I am a dreamer, I am a rebel, and you can label me 
              anything you want.  I will push through because I refuse to flow with the river like a dead fish.  In contrast, I'm fighting for my freedom as an individual, I fighting for my dreams, does that makes me an extremist?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hey angel, so do you think I've lived life to the fullest?</p>

              <p>Your way of life is not my cup of tea because you rather live as
              a fool in conformity than to understand what is worth fighting for.
              There is no such systems, you can't grade life or get a high score
              in life. You either had lived life or you don't. You probably don't
              even understand human rights, nonetheless talked about life itself.
              Again, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, go google the
              difference between a dream and a goal. The wright brother's dream
              is to take flight, it was a fool's dream back then, the Icarus's
              dream, they been criticized and laughed at, it took them a while
              but they became successful.  Failures are inevitable in life,
              but a defeatist will never try, it takes courage, paramount of
              courage to try again after a defeat. Apparently, you perceive it as
              something negative, what you see is stubbornness, what I see is
              determination, the potential willpower for greatness. </p>
              <p>Only a determined man will keep trying, history taught me that
              great man are foolish enough to dream and stubborn enough to keep
              trying. I only call tell you not to conform, it up to you to
              decide.</p>

              <p>I never said that I am perfect.</p>
              <p>As
               I've already explained, I'm a hyperborean, I'm a dreamer, I'm a rebel 
              and you can label me anything you want. A fool? Perhaps, replying to you
               might be idiopathic, but I regard your comment as a bump and I thank 
              you.</p>
