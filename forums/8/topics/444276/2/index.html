              <p>Your way of life is not my cup of tea because you rather live as a fool in conformity than to understand what is worth fighting for. There is no such systems, you can't grade life or get a high score in life. You either had lived life or you don't. You probably don't even understand human rights, nonetheless talked about life itself. Again, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, go google the difference between a dream and a goal. The wright brother's dream is to take flight, it was a fool's dream back then, the Icarus's dream, they been criticized and laughed at, it took them a while but they became successful.  Failures are inevitable in life, but a defeatist will never try, it takes courage, paramount of courage to try again after a defeat. Apparently, you perceive it as something negative, what you see is stubbornness, what I see is determination, the potential willpower for greatness. </p>
              <p>Only a determined man will keep trying, history taught me that great man are foolish enough to dream and stubborn enough to keep trying. I only call tell you not to conform, it up to you to decide.</p>

              <p><br>Of course, nobody life is anybody cup of tea, moreover, i drink only yoghurt, milk and water, never into any of those leaves and beans stuffs. We all live differently with different print. Before you understand human rights, you need to understand human first, human behavior, human aggressiveness, human bad and human good. Then perhaps, you will understand why human need laws, orders and system to make them civilise. Your dissatisfaction is on these laws, orders and system created by human, but you should not bring it up to yourself, because human are not god, they make hell of a lot of mistakes here and there, corrected here and there come another problem, it is a never ending process of do and redo and so on. Once you understood human, then you talk about your rights as a Human.</p>
              <p>Even at the end of the day, you can find your conformative in the way you like it, someone will not like it and start to be like you, because one man good is another man bad, that is one aspect of human. Out of 10 particpant, there is only one winner, so the rest 9 of them lost, are they going to become depressive with life, the rules and orders of this place, the winner only takes 1% of the general, but that does not mean the winner takes it all, and the loser has to fall.</p>
              <p>By doing what you can and what you can do within your limit is already job well done, even if you failed in it, it does not mean you had fallen and that is it, if that is the case, then you are basically coward to face the real true of life and instead blame it on human rights? what rights you want? go changi AP and book a plane out or take a cruise to nowhere??</p>

                  <p>O Angel, do you know about the bread and circuses? Those shyt must be
                       stopped, if we continue to allow power to tease and sedate us, it will 
                      be too late for a true change. Karl Marx is correct in many ways, he is 
                      considered as one of the masters because he speaks the truth.</p>
                  <p>The
                       system we're using now is democracy, there is no such thing as 
                      different arena, democracy has a longer history than Karl, since Plato 
                      which is around 400 BC. Marxism will be considered as new ideology 
                      compared to democracy.</p>
                  <p>I don't think communism and fascism failed at all, it just got corrupted by democracy.</p>
                  <p>First of all, China still exists, unless you're a hobo who insists that 
                      China is not rising to the power. Secondly, Singapore is both 
                      totalitarianism and authoritarianism, 
                      Singapore is a fascist state that is fueled by plutocracy, facism do not
                       work? This just proved that you know nothing about how our system 
                      works.  You think there is no monarchy in Singapore? Are you that 
                      ignorant? A certain someone is playing the puppet behind the supposedly 
                      democratic society, certain someone is still ruling us for 51 years and 
                      counting- but not for long.</p>

              The government allowed private property and "free market" because it attracts investors, why will they destroy the market when they can suck blood from it? The free market isn't free anymore, it is regulated by the government. 
              Anyways, totalitarianism also talks more about how they rule, single party, regulation and restriction, no freedom of speech, no human rights, most importantly, it uses fear to control the people. 
              The "genius" of  this system is a blend of both authoritarian and totalitarian, like a hybrid, a Merlion. Doesn't that sounds familiar?

              It's about existence you see, how do you know that you truly lived?

                      That's rather vague don't you think? You assume that I've anger and I detest myself. What makes you think so?  You don't get to choose to feel or not to feel, emotions are not options, classic example of a robotic zombie. The most basic of human rights, is freedom of speech, the freedom to express!  I'm a Singaporean, I don't have such luxury. It is ironic how you put it "forever be a slave until you decide to do what you want to do". 
                      
                      When you go to schools, you do a series of examinations, and you get to choose a series of subjects with another series of examinations, then depending on your scores you're shortlisted for a series of subjects, then focus on those series of subjects into variety of majors, then you focus on one of the major, when you're done with all that, you go to work.
                      
                      When you look back at your education, you'll realize, you're just following- and following what you're given.
                      What you know, what you've studied, what you're doing now it's already chosen for you, there is only few possibilities of what you going to do- when you grow up. 
                      
                      People do jobs they don't want for money, they studied what they don't need to pursuit things they don't like, they work to buy things they want that they don't need. You talked as if you've embraced the infinite possibilities of life, too bad, you don't. Consumerism, so many choices given to me, don't know what to decide, I'm forever a slave perhaps, at least I know my place. That is probably why misery and truth is best friends. 
                      
                      Now do you understand why robotic and zombie?

              <p><br>That's rather vague don't you think? You assume that I've anger and I detest myself. What makes you think so? You don't get to choose to feel or not to feel, emotions are not options, classic example of a robotic zombie. The most basic of human rights, is freedom of speech, the freedom to express! I'm a Singaporean, I don't have such luxury. It is ironic how you put it "forever be a slave until you decide to do what you want to do". When you go to schools, you do a series of examinations, and you get to choose a series of subjects with another series of examinations, then depending on your scores you're shortlisted for a series of subjects, then focus on those series of subjects into variety of majors, then you focus on one of the major, when you're done with all that, you go to work. When you look back at your education, you'll realize, you're just following- and following what you're given. What you know, what you've studied, what you're doing now it's already chosen for you, there is only few possibilities of what you going to do- when you grow up.

              <p>Your way of life is not my cup of tea because you rather live as
              a fool in conformity than to understand what is worth fighting for.
              There is no such systems, you can't grade life or get a high score
              in life. You either had lived life or you don't. You probably don't
              even understand human rights, nonetheless talked about life itself.
              Again, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, go google the
              difference between a dream and a goal. The wright brother's dream
              is to take flight, it was a fool's dream back then, the Icarus's
              dream, they been criticized and laughed at, it took them a while
              but they became successful.  Failures are inevitable in life,
              but a defeatist will never try, it takes courage, paramount of
              courage to try again after a defeat. Apparently, you perceive it as
              something negative, what you see is stubbornness, what I see is
              determination, the potential willpower for greatness. </p>
              <p>Only a determined man will keep trying, history taught me that
              great man are foolish enough to dream and stubborn enough to keep
              trying. I only call tell you not to conform, it up to you to
              decide.</p>

              I doubt you know how to plan at the age of 7, when education is just something you probably don't like, teachers tell you to study hard and get good grades so you won't sweep the streets for a living. When education becomes a piece of paper, it is all about the scores and not about the knowledge. I don't blame the system, the system works; it is just that the side effects make my life meaningless. I can't speak for the world, I can speak for myself, and I only presume myself as a slave. You work, you consume, you repeat until you die, so mediocre but it works. 
              
              When I was secondary two, I decided I want to be a doctor. Unfortunately, my school didn't allow normal academic stream to take biology and there isn't art class either, even after I requested from the principal, he denied me by telling me to get more students to join me, I only managed to get 3.  I wasn't given the chance to pursuit my dream, so I stopped studying, failed pretty much at everything and got myself into a shitty poly course. Do you know why the principal didn't allow me to take? If I were to fail biology and art, his year-end bonus might just be disrupted.
