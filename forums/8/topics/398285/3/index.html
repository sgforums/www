              <p>1) China is at 57. He mentioned 53.</p>
              <p>2) That was 2009's rankings. The current problems that Europe is facing isn't taken into account yet.</p>

              <p>Because the west is feeling the pressure. </p>
              <p>That's why there is talk of China rising.</p>
              <p>The thing that those western states will not tolerate is the rise of an asian power to challenge their dominance in world politics.</p>
              <p>Same thing as in Singapore. The british won't tolerate a pro-China regime coming to power in Singapore, that is why they connived with Lee Kuan Yew to destroy the local chinese elite from taking power.</p>
              <p>That's why no dialect chinese came to power in Singapore even though the majority is dialect chinese.</p>
              <p>Understand or not?</p>
              <p>That's why you today are brainwashed to hate mandarin, support english.</p>
              <p>The system is designed to strengthen english and weaken mandarin and dialect.</p>

              will see they have won 100x China's medals and have an economy that
              is 100 times China's.</p>
              <p>China's GDP is only 3.6k USD, lower than many African nations

              <p>Please, even if we assume America stands still today and
              stop growing which is impossible, China will take at least 30
              years to catch up with America's 15 trillion dollar economy. Even
              if we assume that Singapore stand still today and stop growing,
              which is impossible due to inflation etc, China will take at least
              50-100 years to catch up with Singapore's 38k USD gdp per capita.
              By that time we all will be dead.</p>
              <p>China still has so much problems - pollution, terribly
              widespread poverty, their education, legal, medical systems are all
              in a mess. Their government is a dictatorship. Even the internet is
              censored and one cannot access youtube or facebook.</p>

              a big economy because it has 1/4 of the world's populace

              <p>They are not even 1/2 as rich as the Libyans and they are about

              <p>It is true, GDP per capita is low compared to other developed countries, but you must also remember that the total Gross Domestic Product of China carries more weight. GDP per capita is mostly just indicative of the standard of living, or the average amount of goods and services each citizen in China can enjoy. And China, having about 3 times the population compared to USA, is bound to have a lower GDP per capita.</p>
              <p>Do remember that economic prowess is not just measured by GDP, we also look at the rate of economic growth. USA's average of about 3% growth is nothing compared to China's RATE of about 8-10% thereabouts. (Rough figures, note China grew by 13.4% back in 1994.)</p>
              <p>It is naive to speak of China as a third world nation especially if it's economy can expand at such a rate, although Chinese mainlanders may adopt that view out of humility. The big hoo hah about China? Potential market. In the past, no one wanted to give a damn because of the lack of spending power the people had. Now you're talking about a billion people, most of which have the financial ability to buy goods and services, as well as having propensities to consume similar to their western counterparts. This is especially prevalent in city areas such as Guangzhou, and even higher tier cities such as Beijing and Shanghai. </p>
              <p>The main limitation that China faces? Its immense population size. The government's hands can only extend so long, it takes considerable time and manpower to make sure everything is functioning well in such a large country as China.</p>
              <p>Have you seen the military prowess of both Chinese and American forces? Neither are to be trifled with. And yes, China has a knack for reverse engineering, so their military technology is state-of-the-art, though I'll concede that if they are to truly match up to the United States Armed Forces, it will take some more time and funds.</p>
              <p>Let us not forget that our stereotypes of a mainland Chinese being typically a farmer, and an American as being a cool dude in an Abercrombie and Fitch outfit has been reinforced by the media. There ARE Americans living below the poverty line too. All you need to go is to go to Detroit City, and see for yourself. Ghettos, slums etc, are in abundance.</p>
              <p>Mind you, as many of the contributors above have mentioned, USA has to thank China for much. Who has been in a trade deficit since the '60s? USA. Who is the world's biggest debtor? USA. Who had to borrow money from China in order to fund ObamaCare, bank bailouts etc? USA.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, China has trillions...no, sorry...TRILLIONS in its foreign reserves. It is an industrialized nation whose energy needs demand a new coal plant to be opened every week. How then can one compare the vibrant growth of mainland China (albeit plagued by social, pollution and healthcare problems, that no industrialized or industrializing nation is spared from), to the persistent mess of political instability, war, disease and hunger that is often experienced by mostly impoverished African nations?</p>

              <p>Sigh.  Opinions are opinions, everybody will always differing opinions.  That being said, some of the opinions voiced so far have been really really stupid.</p>
              <p>People using the united states as a benchmark for a "Successful" nation need to recheck their definition of what successful is.  Would you say a nation that has a $4 trillion debt is a successful one? If national debt be a measure of a nations success, then we should all migrate to Greece right now.</p>
              <p>China is the superpower to watch gentlemen, in terms of pure economic growth.  I lucked out by investing in the Shanghai property market before the government red tape was slapped into action last year =) So lets just say I have reasons more than most to support China's rise.</p>
              <p>Go CHINA! make me richer!! bwahahahahaha. </p>
