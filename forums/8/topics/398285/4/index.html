              <p>Actually did u guys been to china? I have been to china such as chengdu, chongqi . It is 4 times bigger than singapore. At first my impression of china is like so so dun really think they are very modern, but when i got off from plane, i was surprise, the housing and infrusture is building up like crazy and lot of audi A4 and branded cars (although china make lah) but some are "imported"!!!!!, I was heard before in 1986 or 1984 is juz like many farmland but in 15 years to 20 years it quite modern, equal same as wat u see in singapore. I mean chengdu not BEijing or shanghai which is very moderness i believe but still rual area still have alot in off captial area lah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think if singapore din really progress much in no time we be overtake by them and not only china maybe india(from wat i see still abit lag as i visited it like 2005 before). Im not pro chinese or wat but juz some observation i encounter. Btw Im working in multi-national company so get to see pple from philipine, mymmar, prc, India so on</p>

              <p>Why is everything talking as if China will be the next
              superpower when it is a thoroughly third world nation with GDP per
              capita same as African countries?</p>
              <p>China is the number 2 economy, china has won many olympic
              medals.. Yeah China has 1/4 of the world's population that is why.
              If you put together Europe and America's 1.4 billion people, you
              will see they have won 100x China's medals and have an economy that
              is 100 times China's.</p>
              <p>China's GDP is only 3.6k USD, lower than many African nations
              such as Libya, Equitorial Guinea, South Africa etc...</p>
              <p>Please, even if we assume America stands still today and
              stop growing which is impossible, China will take at least 30
              years to catch up with America's 15 trillion dollar economy. Even
              if we assume that Singapore stand still today and stop growing,
              which is impossible due to inflation etc, China will take at least
              50-100 years to catch up with Singapore's 38k USD gdp per capita.
              By that time we all will be dead.</p>
              <p>China still has so much problems - pollution, terribly
              widespread poverty, their education, legal, medical systems are all
              in a mess. Their government is a dictatorship. Even the internet is
              censored and one cannot access youtube or facebook.</p>
              <p>China the next superpower? Please stop dreaming. China will have
              a big economy because it has 1/4 of the world's populace
              but for the rest of our mortal life, the Chinese will still
              have a very low standard of living just like the African
              nations.</p>
              <p>They are not even 1/2 as rich as the Libyans and they are about
              1/2 as rich as the Thais!</p>
              <p>Even in the best scenario, I don't see China overtaking the
              USA/Singapore in terms of GDP per capita and standard of living
              within 50 years. And this is the best scenario! For all you know,
              China might do another "Great leap forward" or "Cultural
              revolution" or "Tian an men".</p>

              <p>ok..I'm back to give more information for Ranson..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>take a look at the awards that Hong Kong airport had gotten. Is Hong Kong a country?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HAve you been to Shanghai?</p>
              <p>Have you watched 2008 Beijing Olympics?</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,univers;">The Rolls-Royce outlet
               in Beijing is one of the brand's top-selling dealerships. And Bentley 
              Beijing has sold a half-dozen 728 stretch limos -- at $1.2 million each,
               the world's most expensive car -- more than any other dealership in the
               world.</span></p>
              <p><strong>China's not a normal country - it's a huge empire, it's like the 
              first world, the second world and the third world co-exist together.</strong></p>
              <p>In terms of trade, China is the largest trading nation in the world 
              today</p>
              <p>In big cities like Shanghai, first world China and third world China 
              don't just co-exist, they collide.</p>
              <p>Car sales in China surged by 45pc 
                last year to 13.6m vehicles, easily eclipsing the 10.5m sold in the US
               and 
                the growth story has continued this year with first-quarter sales up 
              63pc on 
                2009.</p>
              <p>Many car customers are 
                still in their 30s and the youngest was just 28 years old, which is 
              very 
                different from what you see with the Rolls-Royce brand in other 
              countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For China's very rich, customisation is king. Among the busiest stalls 
              in 
                Beijing were the specialist out-fitting companies such as 
              LongboHummer, who 
                take the world's most vulgar car, stretch it and then vulgarise it 
              still 
                further.</p>
              <p>BMW, which already sells twice as many of its top-of-the-range 7-Series 
              in 
                China than anywhere else, announced this week it <br> was raising its 2010 sales target to 120,000 vehicles after seeing 
              February 
                sales up 96pc this year. It plans to make 200,000 cars a year in China
               by 
                2012.</p>
              <p>"The real profits are coming from China," said John Zeng, an auto 
                industry analyst for IHS Global Insight. "China is now very important 
                for global automakers both for profits and sales volume."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a nutshell, the wealthy people in China are extremely wealthy and the poor are ...well, you know the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Chinese are found in almost every country of the world and immigration invariably brings people from different levels of a society in a particular country into another particular country.</p>
              <p>A self-percieved notion due to the number of rich and poor chinese in a particular country would tend to cloud your awareness of this global phenomenon. Put it in simple english: Research before you speak out. </p>

              <p>Why is everything talking as if China will be the next superpower when it is a thoroughly third world nation with GDP per capita same as African countries?</p>
              <p>China is the number 2 economy, china has won many olympic medals.. Yeah China has 1/4 of the world's population that is why. If you put together Europe and America's 1.4 billion people, you will see they have won 100x China's medals and have an economy that is 100 times China's.</p>
              <p>China's GDP is only 3.6k USD, lower than many African nations such as Libya, Equitorial Guinea, South Africa etc...</p>
              <p>Please, even if we assume America stands still today and stop growing which is impossible, China will take at least 30 years to catch up with America's 15 trillion dollar economy. Even if we assume that Singapore stand still today and stop growing, which is impossible due to inflation etc, China will take at least 50-100 years to catch up with Singapore's 38k USD gdp per capita. By that time we all will be dead.</p>
              <p>China still has so much problems - pollution, terribly widespread poverty, their education, legal, medical systems are all in a mess. Their government is a dictatorship. Even the internet is censored and one cannot access youtube or facebook.</p>
              <p>China the next superpower? Please stop dreaming. China will have a big economy because it has 1/4 of the world's populace but for the rest of our mortal life, the Chinese will still have a very low standard of living just like the African nations.</p>
              <p>They are not even 1/2 as rich as the Libyans and they are about 1/2 as rich as the Thais!</p>
              <p>Even in the best scenario, I don't see China overtaking the USA/Singapore in terms of GDP per capita and standard of living within 50 years. And this is the best scenario! For all you know, China might do another "Great leap forward" or "Cultural revolution" or "Tian an men".</p>

              <p>They won't really rise. Too much shit factor to consider &amp; will block their way climbing to the top. So many 'Hei Xin' products, so many inhuman happenings, animals torture, language barriers, diseases, bribery, human behaviors &amp; rudeness. Even if they climb a step up, those mini factors will push them back.</p>
              <p>Unless they fixed that, they can't rise.</p>

              <p>Then you slowly wait &amp; see loh. One factor, any for example, officials bribery cases are more than enough to stop them from rising.</p>
