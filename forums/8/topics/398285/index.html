              <p>Why is everything talking as if China will be the next superpower when it is a thoroughly third world nation with GDP per capita same as African countries?</p>
              <p>China is the number 2 economy, china has won many olympic medals.. Yeah China has 1/4 of the world's population that is why. If you put together Europe and America's 1.4 billion people, you will see they have won 100x China's medals and have an economy that is 100 times China's.</p>
              <p>China's GDP is only 3.6k USD, lower than many African nations such as Libya, Equitorial Guinea, South Africa etc...</p>
              <p>Please, even if we assume America stands still today and stop growing which is impossible, China will take at least 30 years to catch up with America's 15 trillion dollar economy. Even if we assume that Singapore stand still today and stop growing, which is impossible due to inflation etc, China will take at least 50-100 years to catch up with Singapore's 38k USD gdp per capita. By that time we all will be dead.</p>
              <p>China still has so much problems - pollution, terribly widespread poverty, their education, legal, medical systems are all in a mess. Their government is a dictatorship. Even the internet is censored and one cannot access youtube or facebook.</p>
              <p>China the next superpower? Please stop dreaming. China will have a big economy because it has 1/4 of the world's populace but for the rest of our mortal life, the Chinese will still have a very low standard of living just like the African nations.</p>
              <p>They are not even 1/2 as rich as the Libyans and they are about 1/2 as rich as the Thais!</p>
              <p>Even in the best scenario, I don't see China overtaking the USA/Singapore in terms of GDP per capita and standard of living within 50 years. And this is the best scenario! For all you know, China might do another "Great leap forward" or "Cultural revolution" or "Tian an men".</p>

              <p>If you wanna make political statements, i suggest going to the speaker's corner and not QQ here. Its true that what you said happens. But that does not only mean china. Democracy takes time, and does not happen in one day. Russia isn't any better. You can get "poisoned" by
              radiation and the government will deny their implication. The fact china comes to spotlight is because china is one of the growing powers at a fast rate.</p>

              <p>I understand that you have a Phd in economics and also in whining. But just let me highlight to you that in case you dont know, china is not dictatorship. The rest of the methods just serve to control people by the goverment. Just that china's method is a tad more intense. Each political system has its own advantages/disadvantage.</p>

              <p>Well the vast gap between China's rich and its poor certainly helps in its rise.  With the vast number of people that are prepared to work hard for almost next to nothing, and sufficiently large number of affluent people willing to invest money in setting up factories and other essential infrastructure, China ensures that it will be the manufacturing superpower for years to come.</p>
              <p>China has maintained a very very strict "You dont bother us and we dont bother you" policy, following its last major conflict in vietnam.  Since then it has remained neutral in almost all matters of disputes, with the exception of North Korea.  This carefully calculated neutrality makes it possible for them to do business in countries that other nations have issues going into, such as Iran and Rwanda (China imports oil from Iran and exports 15% of military hardware it produces to iran and runs one of the 2 satellite tv companies in Rwanda)</p>
              <p>In short, China has more business oppertunities than most countries.  Being neutral is good business and ultimately good if you want to "Rise". Oh and it helps if you have nuclear weapons as well to back up the "If you dont bother us, we wont bother you" school of thought.</p>

              <p>why are you all arguing with him? this fellow is just pissed off that he failed his Chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just to make things clear, China's policy isn't very different from Singapore's in terms of democracy and such, just that with such a huge population size things tend to seem more autocratic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GDP is definitely not a 100% accurate measure of wealth. Imagine if you earn 50k a month but you have 50 mouths to feed, versus 5k a month and 1 mouth to feed.</p>
              <p>those 50 kids may seem more pitiful and pathetic, but they may very well grow up to earn 5k each. is it likely for the one kid to match them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so which is the richer family?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>naive and most probably TS <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'll give you a better explanation when I have the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a look at the latest auto show in china, the number of world's fastest ferrari and the latest rolls-royce that were bought by the chinese in China.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take a look at the top 5 banks in the world (with the most amount of wealth)</p>
              <p>Has US president obama been visiting China lately?</p>
              <p><br>Compare Hong Kong and Singapore. The rent of a compable condo would cost around USD 4000+ a month in Singapore but it cost more than USD 10 000 in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is part of China.</p>
              <p>Compare the banking industry in Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
              <p>Which are the few countries that have the most Rolls Royce in the world? Which city has the most Rolls -Royce in the world?</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>USA owes China money.</p>
              <p>Do you read Forbes or Times?</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>During the financial crisis China doled out billions in contracts in Great
               Britain and France. Last  year it surpassed the U.S. to become the 
              largest trading partner of both Japan and Brazil. It conducts more than 
              $100 billion a year in trade with both the Middle East and Africa. In 
              Africa it is laying down highways and other infrastructure projects. 
              Already 750,000 Chinese workers have moved there.</p>
              <p>China surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest car market last year. Have you read about China's Volvo deal?</p>
              <p>The main reason you see that China is still being poor is due to the unequal distribution of income.</p>
              <p>I reckon TS is still a young kid who doesn't read up alot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I'm not supportive of this China superpower but since I've done a great deal of research on this I could give you plenty of supporting references.</p>
              <p>China offers a large talent pool of skilled workers who can handle both 
              basic jobs such as processing insurance claims and mortgage loans, to 
              more technically advanced information technology jobs.</p>
              <p>If China adopts a bilingual policy of English and Chinese, it will become the world's largest English speaking population</p>
              <p>Have you heard of the natural order? China: 1st</p>
              <p>India 2nd</p>
              <p>USA 3rd</p>
              <p>Have you been to USA, UK or France? Take a look at the educated prc population there.</p>
              <p>Have you heard of a contestant in Beijing Olympics 2008 who gave up his uk citizenship so as to represent China in the Olympics?</p>
