They have a family to feed - parents, younger siblings, maybe even kids because of some heartless husband simply deserted them for selfish reasons.. Being the responsible daughter,  they felt that they need to take care of their family cause there is really no one else..<br><br>So admist their fears and even shame, they go into the line that many frown, despise upon..<br><br>What would you do if you are in their position? Would you do the same? I don't know if I have the guts.. So if anything, I respect them for their guts and filialness rather than those intellectual wh0res with high education but have no qualms going for ONS..<br></div>
