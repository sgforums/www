            <div class='col-md body'>For the whole portion of my life, I get the concept that prostitutes are dirty, one who is low life and despise upon.. one that you will not associate or seen with.. But this retarded my personal development and I doubt if I am alone..<br><br>From a philosophical perspective, most women are prostitute in certain ways.. And we certainly have no right to despise those wretched women who is not given much choice in this modern world we live in..<br><br>For women who was not given much opportunity in lesser country, sex is an amoral means of livelihood.. their meaning of poor pales in comparison to what is in singapore.. Its not about no money for the mid-night cab or which place to go clubbing for cheap beer.. In their world its about not having money to even eat and being a burden to the family..<br><br>Yet some local ladies who frown upon prostitutes have no qualm going for ONS after a few pint of beer.. Its factitious that the meaning of "pure" goes out from their very same mouth..<br><br>A good family or a good education doesn't makes you exquisite, but intellectual wh0res are experts at self-deceit.. they extinguish themselves from prostitutes even if they went for ONS.. Its amazing and I wish I can logically explain this but I can't fathom what went on inside their pea brain..<br><br>LOOK, if a prostitute have to delegate so low as to sell her body, imagine how much the mental and psychology barrier that she has to overcome? It isn't easy, but intellectual wh0res don't even give a hoot on giving ONS..<br><br>Cheap as prostitutes may sound to you, I urge everyone to ponder and also reflect on these phenomenon..  are those women sinned ?</div>

How come I never see you post anything bad about guys before...let's be fair here.<br><br>If you want to bash women, pls do get your facts straight. I really do disagree with you saying that most women are prostitutes in some ways. You have no right to say that. How would you feel if I say most guys are pimps and gigolos in some ways?<br><br>And what makes those women go in for sex after a few pints of beer? Have you heard of guys who just put in dope into their drinks, guys who just keep buying them drinks in hope to get the girls drunk so that they can bring them to their house and f.uck the girls...do you want to hear what I think about those guys?<br><br>I really wonder how much experience you have regarding women. If you post all this crappy assumptions based on your experience with just a few of them, I think you are not being fair. And I really do think it is extremely unfortunate of you to keep meeting such ladies. Maybe you do need a change in your circle of friends or surroundings.<br><br>And the word I highlighted above, are you sure you are using the right one? It seems more appropriate for me to use "distinguish" instead of "extinguish". You not only need to get your facts right, but your vocab too.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

If you post all this crappy assumptions based on your experience with just a few of them, I think you are not being fair.
