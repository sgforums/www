            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>The New Paper - 03 Feb 2003<br><br>MOHAMED SULTAN<br><span style="color: red;">Where have the cool people gone?</span><br><br>By Jeanmarie Tan<br><br>TWO years ago, Mohamed Sultan Road housed a stretch of Singapore's most hip and happening nightspots.<br><br>Apart from Zouk and Centro, it was the place to see and be seen.<br><br>Now, it is a different scene.<br><br>Clubbers are saying that Mohamed Sultan is at best, losing its edge, at worst, dead.<br><br>[ ] 'Cannot make it'<br><br>Entertainment writer for I-S Magazine Terry Ong harshly pronounced it <strong>'an embarrassing hangout for cannot-make-it people</strong>'.<br><br>'<strong>Only Bengs and Lians hang out there</strong>,' he complained.<br><br>So what happened?<br><br>At the height of its popularity, club-hopping at Mohamed Sultan was the norm, and overcrowding was often the No.1 problem at the popular shophouse strip.<br><br>Then, funkier clubs which played progressive house music such as Sugar, Orange, Club Eden, Nox and Lush either left the prime location or had a change of management.<br><br>Enter the dodgy-sounding Coyote Ugly, ThaWu Bar and Illusion, as well as 'Beng-ish' watering holes such as Club III and Club Seventh.<br><br>Mr Ong, 26, said: 'Sure, it still has some of the office crowd, but I don't think anyone who has any pretensions to be cool would want to go there! Clubs that manage to sustain themselves play only Top 40, R&amp;B and retro crap.'<br><br>Recession, he said, has also forced clubbers to tighten their belts.<br><br>'They'd rather chill at cafes, at home, or restaurants. And if it boils down to one place every weekend, the logical choice is either Zouk or Centro.<br><br>'If I ever go to Mohamed Sultan again, it is probably to patronise the corner kopitiam.'<br><br>Science educator Roger Wong, 26, who used to frequent Club Samsara, which is now 'infested with army boys', feels that Mohamed Sultan these days is 'plain sleazy'.<br><br>'You have Ah Bengs walking up and down, hoping to score. Nobody cares about the music anymore.'<br><br>At 10.30pm on a drizzly Wednesday, youngsters trickled in via taxis and sports bikes to pound the Mohamed Sultan sidewalks.<br><br>Don't expect beautiful people, celebrity sightings, rainbow-hued Japanese street wear, branded togs, or the smell of Hugo Boss or Calvin Klein cologne.<br><br>Its regular clientele now don mostly-black attire and is more comfortable speaking Mandarin or Hokkien.<br><br>For guys, tight-fitting shirts, gelled-back floppy hair and flared pants are de rigueur. And the girls were all alabaster-skinned, skinny, with long brown rebonded hair, and wearing black spaghetti-strap tops with tight hipster pants.<br><br>Most make a beeline for Club III and Club Seventh, which took over Zeus and Suede respectively in late 2001, and seem to be the hot favourites. Both joints are managed by the same company.<br><br>They play ear-splitting techno music, with an age limit of 21 (men) and 18 (women) - the lowest on the stretch.<br><br>Most revellers are spill-overs from Boat Quay's teen crowd.<br><br>A 20-year-old student with dyed blonde tresses eschews high-class haunts such as Zouk or Centro because she is a big fan of Eurodance.<br><br>Another Club Seventh fan, 22-year-old bouncer Sky Woo, admitted the standard has dropped and the crowd is getting 'more rowdy'.<br><br>He said: 'You get fights once or twice a night during weekends.'<br><br>True enough, while The New Paper was at Club Seventh's entrance, a heated quarrel broke out between two men in their 20s, and a string of Hokkien vulgarities spewed freely.<br><br>Even Mr Joseph Wong, operations manager of both Club III and Club Seventh, appeared regretful that Mohamed Sultan's older, more sophisticated yuppie crowd has disappeared.<br><br>'Now we get more street kids, Ah Bengs and Ah Lians, not trendy types.'<br><br>But Mr Wong, 28, said there are advantages in attracting a younger coterie.<br><br>'While executives are facing unemployment, (the kids) don't have obligations. They just sign credit cards and spend their parents' money.'<br><br>Although Madam Wong's is still Mohamed Sultan's No 1 club, Mr Wong believes Club III and Club Seventh are not-too-distant runners-up.<br><br>He did not want to reveal their profit margins though.<br><br>'I don't really care what type of crowd, as long as there's a crowd and there's money coming in. At least we attack the techno market, and the whole stretch is ours (in that respect).'<br><br>[ ] Can't hold liquor<br><br>Sandwiched between these 'twin terrors' is expat joint Cheeky Monkeys, which was bought by owner Paula Greenway a month ago.<br><br>The 50-year-old Englishwoman is concerned about drunk youngsters who cannot hold their liquor well.<br><br>She said some who look younger than 18 would be vomiting outside the two clubs at 4am. Others would buy beer from the 7-Eleven store nearby and sit along the pavements to drink.<br><br>Ms Greenway said: 'As a mum, I don't want to see my children like that. Sometimes the managers stop them from going in, but I don't know if there's enough control.'<br><br>Mr Steve Walker, boss of Next Page which has been there for a decade, agreed the present 'aesthetics' doesn't look too good.<br><br>'When Mohamed Sultan first started, it was like Club Street, a niche market. But it's become a commercialised zone. We've lost the people with creativity.'<br><br>However, Mr Walker, 50, conceded that Club III and Club Seventh are 'making a lot of money' and are the 'most expensive' club there - charging $12 a drink.<br><br>'People said they'd disappear after a year, but they're still here, so obviously they're doing something right. But I'd prefer it if they were a few doors down!' he chuckled.<br><br>One staunch defender of Mohamed Sultan's devolving landscape is Mr Simon Lim, owner of Siam Supper Club and Indigo, which caters to a more mature clientele.<br><br>'Any good area worth its salt should change. You cannot have a monotone of pubs playing the same music for the same crowd, if not the stretch will die faster.'<br><br>Mr Lim, 35, also aggressively denied that Mohamed Sultan is becoming unhip.<br><br>'Where's the new hip place? As far as I know, there isn't one. Sure, it's become quieter and less crowded, but it's not because people are going somewhere more hip.<br><br>'They're just not going out as much. The supply is shrinking.'<br><br>But what about the black sheep in the flock?<br><br>Mr Lim proceeded cautiously: 'Of course, there are some places that we feel shouldn't be around, or could do with a better concept.<br><br>'But it's a free market, and it's not relevant for me to say anything.'<br><br>[ ] Still cool<br><br>However, nightlife veteran Peter Wong, who owns Madam Wong's and Newsroom Bar, said: 'We can't stop these new kids from coming to the block, but they have caused some disruption.<br><br>'Still, one bad apple doesn't mean the whole basket is rotten.'<br><br>Does Mr Wong, 45, credited as Mohamed Sultan's pioneering force, miss the old days?<br><br>'Of course! They were the best years of our lives, and we really enjoyed it. People are becoming so hotheaded now. Last time, it was a cool, nice scene. But this doesn't mean Mohamed Sultan is over. We just have to continue going on as best we can.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Playing musical chairs<br><br>CLUB Eden was taken over by Indigo; Orange made way for Illusion; and Tajie folded after a failed rent negotiation.<br><br>Just another round in Mohamed Sultan's notorious game of start-stop musical chairs in the past year.<br><br>Sales at these nightspots plummeted due to the loss of big spenders and the rise of competitive price-slashing.<br><br>A former operator, who declined to be named, shut his joint down not because it was poorly-received, but because of 'legal stuff... that hasn't been ironed out'.<br><br>He doesn't plan to return to the area: 'There are so many concept clubs around, so you have to be really different and come up with a brand-new idea.'<br><br>But he hasn't completely given up hope.<br><br>'Right now, there's no party street except Mohamed Sultan. Club Street has no hype, and Boat Quay and Clarke Quay have become food paradises.'<br><br>Mr Michel Lu, director of the Centro 360 group and ex-honcho of Lush, moved out of Mohamed Sultan in 2001 to create a new identity for the organisation, which now owns half the tenancy at One Fullerton.<br><br>Mr Lu, 34, insists he'll never go back: 'We've done Mohamed Sultan and moved on. We're planning on opening a couple of new spaces in a completely different arena.'<br><br>As for successful stayers such as Madam Wong's and Next Page, Mr Lu said it was their 'intimate' customer relationship that contributed to their longevity.<br><br>'I would imagine that these established clubs provide personalised service so that it becomes like a second home.<br><br>'It's important not to feel like you're going to some impersonal hotel lobby bar.'<br><br>Copyright Â© 2003 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
