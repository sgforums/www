            <div class='col-md body'>Found this on the net, not sure if it's have been posted here in Sgforums or was it a fiction, but anyway one can see how greed and lust can make this world a shitty place....<br><br>*************************************************************<br>Couples Beware.<br><br>This incident happen in Singapore during the 2004 European Cup Football. Newly married couple. Wife early 20s was very pretty. 2 of Husband HBÂ’s friends lusted after her. HB not rich but likes to gamble. All guys in early 30sÂ’. Friends baited HB to put up bets on football for nights of passion with wife. Total bet was close to S$10,000. Wife was pressured into agreement. HB lost bet and have to give away his wife to his friends. The tryst took place in a hotel at Marina area<br><br>Wife was subject to all sorts of sexual trysts including anal, which rendered her needing some medical attention. But wife was naÃ¯ve (or stupid) to continue her obligation and the 2 Â‘friendsÂ’ subject her to further humiliation by asking wife to parade around without underwear. All things come to a head when she was Â‘coercedÂ’ into having group sex with 2 other business contacts (Japs) of one of the friends.<br><br>HB was indifferent to wife after the incident probably viewing her as Â‘damaged goodsÂ’ and marriage soured since. HB gambling habit will continue to put wife at risk from predator friends. At least one of the 2 guys own up &amp; admitted what he did was wrong but was Â‘overwhelmed by the wifeÂ’s beautyÂ’. No further action was taken against the guys as HB was a wimp.<br><br>These guys are university educated professionals, average guys whom u will never suspect will do such a despicable act. Only animals behave this way.<br><br>So couples especially women, be careful of yr HBÂ’s friends who may have less than honourable intentions for u given an opportunity.<br><br>Please warn yr daughters/sisters/ friends to be careful with guys who has got gambling habit. They will put their partners at risk from men who can only think with their Â‘small headÂ’<br>*************************************************************<br>88423.35 in reply to 88423.24<br><br>An update:<br><br>The wife contracted SCLC (lung cancer in Oct 2005) . Grim diagnosis &amp; HB already left her for a colleague.  One of her HB's friends who screwed her in 2004 came in to help with her treatment to clear his guilt and conscience.<br><br>For almost a year, she was used as a collateral for her HB's soccer bet with bookies. Not sure she willingly participated in the later bets which I doubt.  In her dying moments she regretted using her body for the bet and destroying her own credibility as a wife. Actions of HB's friends contributed to her death as well.   A moment's folly is all it takes to undo her marriage.<br><br>She died early March 2006 and her obituary appeared in the ST on 12th March 2006 which reads of bitterness in death.<br><br>In memory of ****<br><br>Heaven knows the truth,<br><br>Judgement days will come,<br><br>And Justice will be done.<br><br>May she rest in peace..<br><br>**************************************************************<br><br>Very sad  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> peace for her, hope her scumbag husband got his end!<br><br><a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages?msg=45874.1" rel="nofollow">http://forums.delphiforums.com/sammyboymod/messages?msg=45874.1</a></div>
