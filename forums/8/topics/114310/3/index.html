But noooo, they buy up Australand , Optus etc.. , invest in China . Anyone recall Suzhou losses?  </span><br><br>Like my dad said , when they kicked out the british , singapore went for local talents.  The temporary foreign talents who came in to help Singapore were truly exceptional and rare , like the israeli army and a dutch economist who planned out the ports and economy.  Then they went off on their merry way and left the local talents to continue improving on their ideas - Local talents who built up a modern day Singapore today.<br><br>With new and modern permanent foreign talents - the main thing is cost cutting - even if the so-called foreign talent has less talent than our locals - they are still preferred because they have the label "foreign talent".  It is meant to undermine the local worker . That is why Australian work unions are not too friendly towards  the policy of engaging "foreign talents".  They see it coming from a mile and they blocked it out . That is why Qantas cannot engage foreign workers by the load full . Hence the Qantas advert " I still call australia home" and qantas is making money .<br><br>You can be a peasant in Singapore - surviving off the streets day by day with no welfare and struggling to hold your job one day at a time. It is your choice.<br><br></div></blockquote>Temasek obviously have its reason for buying up other companies. Maybe they forsee bigger profits in other countries than in Singapore.<br><br>Hmm...well Im taught in Social Studies that FTs help boost productivity in our local workforce. In fact Im also taught that without FTs, singapore might not even have a competent workforce and this would scare away investors. Therefore, We need FTs.

In Hua Liang's case, if his family wants compensation, they have to bring a civil action agaisnt the driver.<br><br>I realize you are upset about the perceived injustice of the cases, but without detailed information as to what really happened, we should not be so quick to condemn our judicial system.<br><br>To illustrate my point, let's say that the driver in this case is heavily insured. Would it then not make sense to award such huge damages against her? The amount is easily borne by the insurance company, and the immediate welfare of the jogger's family is secured. The driver is not ruined financially;all she has to bear is perhaps the burden of increased insurance premiums in the future. This way, wealth is spread in the most efficient manner possible.<br><br>I'm not saying that this is in fact what happened; what i am trying to illustrate is that certain facts and circumstances can turn what might be seen as an unjust decision into one that is logical and sensible.<br><br>Re the way damages is calculated at 45%, the Judges probably have guidelines to follow. For eg. the guidelines might state that in a car accident, a passenger who is injured due to the driver's recklessness should have his/her compensation levels reduced by 30% if the passenger was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the accident .<br>The judges then have then unenviable task of trying to apply these guidelines to all the combination of facts before the court.<br></div>

No SIA = no angmor<br><br>6) The jogging shoes manufacturer - no jogging shoes = no jogging for angmor.<br><br>7) The parents/ancestors of the lady driver - no ancestors = no lady driver<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> The ancestors of the angmor - reason same as above<br><br>9) ... and the list goes on.</div>
