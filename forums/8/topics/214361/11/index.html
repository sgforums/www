            <div class='col-md body'>I do have some comment on this "illegal downloading" issue.<br><br>Firstly, i dont see wat's the point of tracking down downloaders when Mp3 players are selling all over in the country. By allowing mp3 players to be sold in the country, the country should knows well that people will download songs and transfer into their mp3 players. Dont give me the crap that people can get their own CDs and rip it in... The government is telling the people that everyone can own up CDs with about 30GB?<br><br>Secondly, some albums are really trash,only about 3 tracks are nice or should i say "listen-able", and the remaining 7-9 songs are just crap. So u are expecting us to get those album? Hello?<br><br>I use to keeps buying album in the past, but i found out most of them doesnt meet my expectation as i think they would be before i got them. I still buy albums these days. But wat i do?First,i download them, I listen to the albums, wether it is worth it. If they are, i still buy them. Downloading actually press on the music industries and push them to make better music to fight with so call "downloading" world.<br><br>So the Government thinks that they will really be able to stop the country for downloading by just catching 10 plus people so far? Please, We are not stupid, Trust me, no one would ever stops. At most, they will only stop for a moment and start all over again.<br><br>So why catch the people? God damn please, Dont give me that crap that police officers dont download? Look at the cd prices nowdays... $16 - $22 per album?<br>That's half of my school allowance per week. Dont tell me it's for copyright as those are the effort of the singers. Well alright, we can affor, so we download.<br><br>Download,on the other hand promotes songs too at the same time. first,i heard a nice song from the radio,second,i download it off the net,if i found it nice,i download more of his/her songs,then if it's really worth,i'll still get them in the end.<br><br>Slove the problem from its root, not its seeds, make us buy,rather then forcing us buy.</div>
