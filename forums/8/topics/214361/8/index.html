What grabbed the attention of the 1,000 or so industry leaders at the Singapore Expo event last night was the competition heating up in the broadband market.<br><br>By offering at least two years of free access, telecom operators SingTel, iCell and QMax beat six others to the chunk of state money offered to subsidise the initiative.<br><br>The Government is committing $30 million of the expected $100 million for the wireless networks, which will cover the Central Business District, Orchard Road and HDB town centres, for a start.<br><br>With broadband on the go, notebook or PDA users do not have to be cooped up at work or at home to go online.<br><br>Details will be announced in December, but a user can expect to access all three networks by signing up with any of the three operators.<br><br>The expected number of on-the-go surfers: 250,000 within two years, up from 50,000 today.<br><br>But the service does not mean it is time to ditch the high-end office or home broadband service.<br><br>With speeds of 512 kilobits per second, Wireless@SG will allow for basic services, like surfing the Net or chatting online. Heavy users who want to download videos, for example, may want to pay a fee for premium services offering up to 1 megabit per second. Prices have yet to be fixed for these premium services.<br><br>The upside is that the burgeoning competition in the broadband market is likely to lower costs of subscription, which start at about $30 for a home connection now.<br><br>Established players like MobileOne, StarHub and Pacific Internet, which lost out in the bidding, are understood to be preparing similar wireless services.<br><br>With the broadband market given this boost, more people will start using broadband now, analysts said.<br><br>Analyst Nitin Bhat from research firm Frost and Sullivan noted that similar free wireless services in the United States and Taipei have prodded broadband providers into offering new and cheaper services.<br><br>Service providers may also go into online TV programmes Â— something that a free but slower connection cannot give, he noted.<br><br>Second Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts Vivian Balakrishnan said Wireless@SG will lick the old problem of service providers being unwilling to invest in a new network, and users keeping away from spotty coverage provided by hot spots.<br><br>The slow broadband take-up Â— under 60 per cent of homes online here against more than 70 per cent in South Korea Â— is a rare blip in SingaporeÂ’s otherwise rapid adoption of infocomm.<br><br>In his speech, Mr Lee went back into history, noting that for many years, the public sector owned only two mainframe computers.<br><br>Singapore took a 'leap of faith into the unknown' when it decided to scale up technology use in 1981. By getting government agencies to adopt technology and exposing the young to it, the country got set for the digital age and got itself plugged into the global grid, he added.<br><br>He thanked technology pioneers Dr Tony Tan, Mr Philip Yeo, Dr Tan Chin Nam and Mr Lim Swee Say for driving the effort, which has now resulted in the infocomm sector chalking up $40 billion in annual revenues.<br><br>He added that the key to reaping 'digital dividends' for Singapore was to stay ahead of trends that may not always be clear.<br><br>'By the time a trend becomes obvious to everyone, we may have already missed the boat.'
