Go out and talk to good friends, watch movies, clubbing, shopping, people watch, and move on with your life.

            <div class='col-md body'>dear Edniva<br>I think the gal u like doesnt liek herself. Thus thats why she would forego goping out with a nice guy liek urself for some 'bad guy' who will be bad to her.<br>IMHO(In my humble opinion) I think this gal that u like has low self esteem she doesnt like herself and she doesnt believe that someone how is nice to her and who wont hurt her actually exists. In her warped reality perhaps she thinks that all guys jsut want to hurt her and jsut want sex?? jsut a maybe<br>Also note that she didnt say she doesnt liek u she jsut said u have bad taste meaning she doesnt think highly of herself, my advice to u is let this gal learn to like herself on her own and well forget about her cos as long as she isnt happy with herself she CANNOT be happy sharing herself with someone in a relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Edniva, that happened to me before too... Ah well, thing is, if you really appreciate someone's company, sometimes it's best not to look too much into it. Just let it happen you know. Go out with her and stuff, try to know her better and all. Rejection kills the spirit and if you're not ready for it spirtually and emotionally, don't mention the four-lettered word. I mean LOVE.   If she really likes you you'll know it. That is, if she isn't one who enjoys sending out wrong signals and rejoice as guys go suicidal 'cos of her. Then you'll know that your relationship can really move on.<br><br>Which is why I don't dribble into romance these days. I wanna get deeply involved in a host of other priorities and be strongly independent. To restructure my life. To strive for better grades. To make plans for a bright future ahead... new year resolutions, essentially. If somehow I could find a girl who would accept my nerdiness and anti-sociality, and who relates to me more than just an exquisite gem or a flower vase, then I'll consider popping THE question.<br><br>Perhaps you know all too well the advice given by some guru, that if you want her, you've gotta go for her. But for someone who's haunted by the ghost of rejection, you'll understand that advice is always easier to dispose than to undertake.<br><br>Rejection is ultimately the greatest aphrodisiac. And if you're weak, you'll probably die of an overdose.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>alright. Let's hit the stacks.<br><br>1. Getting steads through IRC is not possible. Because it is totally different worlds .<br>2. Don't get ever interested on IRC frends to be lovers. They don't do well if they know u are interested in loving them.<br>3. Some people do have different taste.<br>4. Not everyone on this sorry country say... Singapore is nice and good. Just think that they are also Ah Bengs and Ah Lians. And i do think they are better off with someone more fitting than a nice person.<br>5. IT is 100% Sure that no Internet Love Relationship can last . unless of course if you do meet someone in life...... before internet..<br><br>Anyways, I don't really think that it is possible to wait and give her another chance. It is better off either treating her as a normal friend or forget about her.<br><br>If you are really wanting to get yourself a stead, you are best off getting off your internet and go outside. It stands much chance that way.<br><br>Don't let this event get to yea.<br><br>( i love to be lonely. Serious. )</div>
