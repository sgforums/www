Sigh, go to any forums and 80% of the forumners are negative and depressed people who always think that the world is such a bad place to live in. And the other 20% are the happy and rich who have absoutely no complains whatsoever. I wonder why... perhaps if you guys would just accept that the world is such and not a utopia perhaps your world would be a a little happier. To quote George Bernard Shaw , "Some men see things as they are and ask why. Others dream things that never were and ask why not." If you are unhappy about the way of life, try to change something that is within your control. Complaining and cursing will bring you no where. I love my country is because this is where I am born, for better or worse I will die and fight for it even though there is a greener pasture out there.</div></blockquote>I wouldn't say 80% are depressed. But I would rather say, 80% are the enlightened ones who know the reality of life.<br><br>"If you are unhappy about the way of life, try to change something that is within your control. " = Yes, migrate.<br><br>I think where you are born is no longer significant in today's global economy. I tend of think of myself as Cindy Inc (or Republic of Cindy). My resources are my knowledge and experience. I can move across border with ease. Being tied to a country, esp Singapore is no point. I seek the best of monetary, spiritual, quality of life, etc in a place.<br><br>To take up knifes and choppers to fight for my $200k, 83 years lease running, 110 sq m HDB flat, I hardly think so.

You said 80% of every forumers of any forums are negative and depressing. Is there any statistic figures to proof that? Or is it just your opinion on things? I can tell you your figures are way off. I, personally, knows a lot of forumers from other forums and I can confirmed with you, THEY ARE NOT LIKE WHAT YOU SAID.<br><br>If you are rich, it doesn't means you are happy, and if you are poor, it also doesn't means you are depressed too. It just that both different society hierarchies have different priorities on the same $$$ issue. The rich will find ways to make more $$$ so as to maintain or even improve their luxury lifestyle. The poor is just trying to make both ends meet.<br><br>Your quote of George Bernard Shaw is inappropriate here. You are telling us to keep dreaming and always ask "Why not?". Come on, get real! The only time I will dream and ask "Why not?", is the 10 million Toto on every Chinese New Year. For me, I always trying make changes within my control, but there is a limitation to it. Maybe, you should try this quote from the same author, George Bernard Shaw's "Lack of money is the root of all evil."<br><br>It's true complaining and cursing will bring you nowhere. But, in proper term, it's called "feedback" and feedback is what makes things improve.<br><br>Last but not least, I'm also a 100% Singaporean. When the nation security is threatened, I can tell firmly I will not be a step behind you when facing the threat. And I will lay down my life for my family and friends if necessary.
