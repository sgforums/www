You said 80% of every forumers of any forums are negative and depressing. Is there any statistic figures to proof that? Or is it just your opinion on things? I can tell you your figures are way off. I, personally, knows a lot of forumers from other forums and I can confirmed with you, THEY ARE NOT LIKE WHAT YOU SAID.<br><br>If you are rich, it doesn't means you are happy, and if you are poor, it also doesn't means you are depressed too. It just that both different society hierarchies have different priorities on the same $$$ issue. The rich will find ways to make more $$$ so as to maintain or even improve their luxury lifestyle. The poor is just trying to make both ends meet.<br><br>Your quote of George Bernard Shaw is inappropriate here. You are telling us to keep dreaming and always ask "Why not?". Come on, get real! The only time I will dream and ask "Why not?", is the 10 million Toto on every Chinese New Year. For me, I always trying make changes within my control, but there is a limitation to it. Maybe, you should try this quote from the same author, George Bernard Shaw's "Lack of money is the root of all evil."<br><br>It's true complaining and cursing will bring you nowhere. But, in proper term, it's called "feedback" and feedback is what makes things improve.<br><br>Last but not least, I'm also a 100% Singaporean. When the nation security is threatened, I can tell firmly I will not be a step behind you when facing the threat. And I will lay down my life for my family and friends if necessary. My love is not just reserved for this country but also for my family and friends. I believe a lot of the forumers here are no less patriotic than you. So, stop acting as if you are the "Most Patriotic Singaporean" of the year.<br><br>Everybody has the right to voice out their own views. Respect the others and the others will respect you.</div>
