            <div class='col-md body'>What do you value most?<br>A young man learns what's most important in life from the guy next door.<br><br>It had been some time since Jack had seen the old man. College, girls, career,<br>and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in<br>pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life, Jack had little time<br>to think about the past and often no time to spend with his wife and son. He was<br>working on his future, and nothing could stop him.<br><br>Over the phone, his mother told him, "Mr. Belser died last night.  The funeral<br>is Wednesday."<br><br>Memories flashed through his mind like an old newsreel as he sat quietly<br>remembering his childhood days.<br><br>"Jack, did you hear me?"<br><br>"Oh, sorry, Mom. Yes, I heard you. It's been so long since I thought of him.<br>I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago," Jack said.<br><br>"Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were doing.<br>He'd reminisce about the many days you spent over 'his side of the fence' as he<br>put it," Mom told him.<br><br>"I loved that old house he lived in," Jack said.<br><br>"You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr. Belser stepped in to make sure you<br>had a man's influence in your life," she said.<br><br>"He's the one who taught me carpentry," he said. "I wouldn't be in this business<br>if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things he thought were<br>important...Mom, I'll be there for the funeral," Jack said.<br><br>As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next flight to his<br>hometown.<br><br>Mr. Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children of his own,<br>and most of his relatives had passed away.  The night before he had to return<br>home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see the old house next door one more time.<br>Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing over<br>into an other dimension, a leap through space and time.<br><br>The house was exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories.  Every<br>picture, every piece of furniture....Jack stopped suddenly.<br><br>"What's wrong, Jack?" his Mom asked.<br><br>"The box is gone," he said.<br><br>"What box? " Mom asked.<br><br>"There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk.  I must have<br>asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell me was 'the thing<br>I value most,'" Jack said. It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly<br>how Jack remembered it, except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser<br>family had taken it.<br><br>"Now I'll never know what was so valuable to him," Jack said. "I better get some<br>sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom."<br><br>It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died. Returning home from work one<br>day Jack discovered a note in his mailbox.  "Signature required on a package. No<br>one at home. Please stop by the main post office within the next three days,"<br>the note read.<br><br>Early the next day Jack retrieved the package.<br><br>The small box was old and looked like it had been mailed a hundred years ago.<br>The handwriting was difficult to read, but the return address caught his<br>attention.<br><br>"Mr. Harold Belser" it read.<br><br>Jack took the box out to his car and ripped open the package. There inside was<br>the gold box and an envelope.<br><br>Jack's hands shook as he read the note inside.<br><br>"Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett. It's<br>the thing I valued most in my life." A small key was taped to the letter. His<br>heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully unlocked the box. There<br>inside he found a beautiful gold pocket watch.  Running his fingers slowly over<br>the finely etched casing, he unlatched the cover.<br><br>Inside he found these words engraved: "Jack, Thanks for your time!  Harold<br>Belser."<br><br>"The thing he valued most...was...my time."<br><br>Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his office and cleared his<br>appointments for the next two days.<br><br>"Why?" Janet, his assistant asked.<br><br>"I need some time to spend with my son," he said. "Oh, by the way,<br>Janet...thanks for your time!"<br><br>____________________________________________________<br>"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that<br>take our breath away."<br></div>
