Likewise, u(some women) may love big and long penis but your bf has 'kacang putih'-like penises? no sweat. During sexual intercourse, just relax &amp; think of it as 'BIG' and enjoy the intimacy &amp; b4 u know it, u will too go,"waow, small and short penis is not bad after all eh."<br><br>Well, if any of u  still feel sorry abt how small your breast &amp; penis are, hey, no cause for alarm.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">) Intimacy &amp; love making should not resolve only ard those super sensitive parts of our bodies.

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr: i gave an absolutely constructive reason as to why your theory about the relation between breastfeeding and fascination with breasts, and that is not all guys were breastfed. I did not simply say your theory sucked or something like that. I made my point and that was it. I do not have to give my own explanation to comment on yours. In all fairness I gave a valid reason to substantiate my point. This is just the way how people assess hypothesis. too bad u saw it as being lame. In your first response you had to say things like "feeding your childish spite" etc. A pity you are obviously taking it personally. Was i putting you down? Or was i putting your point down? hhmmm As for the popularity part of it, well frankly speaking I don't care (if u haven't realised by now). I'll say something when I feel like saying it, doesn't matter if it's a popular view or not. I'm perfectly fine with people attacking my views etc. anyway as to why i did not put fwd any theories, the answer is simple. Cuz there's no one simple answer to this. there are possibly as many reasons as there are types of ferns.<br><br>as for firewire's ignorance of the Oedipus complex, it is evident from the way he tries to explain the so called deep rooted and subconscious fascination with parents becuz of their withdrawal. So does that mean people with parents who are just as loving, continue to "watch tv with arms around" etc will not suffer from oedipus or electra complex? And he thinks it is a portrayal of the loss suffered as children etc etc...please lah, do some homework before bullshitting here in a "matter-of-factly" tone. Go read up on Freud to know what it is all about.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1-winged angel: Eh I didn't pick the quarrel with purr , she started it...i am picking it with firewire.<br>Hey come on man, let's go for round 2 of the slugging. I was talking about Oedipus complex when i said do your homework cuz your explanation ran against the grain of his theory. The complex has nothing to do with the withdrawal and isn't conditioned etc but came about simply because of the basic attraction for the opp sex which obviously has its roots in evolution...to ensure self-propagation, to spread genes etc. Freud comes into the pic naturally since he coined it and we're talking about his work here. And i did give a pretty good reason on why purr's theory doesn't work out....as opposed to just a one word reply. So are u and purr saying that if someone said the earth is a cube, i must come up with my own theory in order to say his theory is wrong? I can't dispute it just because his cubic earth theory cannot explain our observance of moon crescents? duh. as long as there's a valid reason i can put down any existing theory.....eat that. like i said, she's just taking it personally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kaiser,<br><br>I've been meaning to talk about your reason. I was waiting and waiting for you to go on and explain becos I think it's really lame. Thank you for finally opening up the topic so that we can discuss it rather than put someone down.<br><br>If you think my insults are uncalled for, let me say that it just seems to me that they are the only thing you understand and contribute, so I have no qualms using them back. If you insist on going on with your attitude, I will go along with you. But if you can talk politely and contribute to the discussion, then I will be nice back to you.<br><br>True, many guys are no longer breast-fed by their mothers. But then again, the milk bottle's teat is shaped like a woman's nipple. And when you hold a baby and feed him, you do it at chest level, holding it to your body.<br><br>I've never claimed that the Oedipus theory is right. It's something I'm curious about. It's a fact that many Japanese and Italian want their wives to be like their mums. It just makes me wonder if there's some connection.<br><br>Savageyoda brought up a point about guys getting satisfaction from breasts becos it pleasures their female partners. But if this is the case, isn't sensitivity of the nipple more important than size of the breast?<br><br>Is the role of the breast more for sex or reproduction? For the latter, as in bigger breast= more milk? Could this be why male brains are hardwired to get excited by bigger breasts so that their children will turn out strong and healthy?<br><br>Can some guys contribute why they prefer larger breats? It's no shame to admit you like them.<br><br>As for penises, I think it's not really the length because all the nerve endings are at the mouth of the vagina. If anything, it's the thickness because it gives getter abrasion. So I think that if you have a short, thick stump, it's better than a long thin one.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>purr...<br>You do sounds like a sex expert.. I dun know about all these theory you guys are going on about, but they do sounds logical to me. Perhaps, I am more of a logic guy, usually just yes or no. Perhaps you could go on and do a research course in Sexology.. haaha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To put away a theory based on logical refutations is in itself a constructive contribution so we know which direction not to head further into. as far as that goes, i've been contributing right from the first mail in the thread. As for insisting on going on with "my attitude", well it was a pretty neutral tone i used for u right from the start. Unfortunately the response was somewhat sour. anyway oedipus complex is not even the answer to the original question so why should i elaborate on it?(i can almost imagine some lamer coming up soon saying "aiyah cannot elaborate then say so lah"...) duh...so here we go again, we have "lame" and "smoker" etc. It'd be interesting to see what comes up next from pussy. And lemme tell u what's to my benefit....I'm not here to LEARN from you people giving your two cents worth about stupid topics like this. I'm here for entertainment and as far as that goes, I am getting a lot of it. Good guy? Bad guy? hah who cares, as long as i am kept entertained. hope u don't feel too stupid giving me advice on how I can "benefit" from this forum of "experts" haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh my, what a hard shell. Is it so difficult to be nice?<br><br>"As for insisting on going on with "my attitude", well it was a pretty neutral tone i used for u right from the start..."<br><br>And in the man's own words (in his first few postings here):<br><br>Oh here we go again with firewire trying to talk about Oedipus Complex this time when he knows shit about it.<br><br>Purr: so since u were asking i was telling you your theory isn't right. Simple as that? I see you are having some problems taking that. And since when did I say my english is good? I believe some other lame individual said that rather...u might wanna check to see if you need new glasses or if that's not the prob, try increasing ur level of comprehension.<br><br>Isn't there some contradiction here? And if you really want to know, what really pissed me off in the beginning was not that you disagreed with me, but that you always go around biting others (i.e. Loletta and Firewire among the many others) like a mad dog. Well, if you want to behave like one, people who have seen your behaviour will treat you like one even if you haven't bitten them. Why? Becos they detest what you've done and they don't want it to go on.<br><br>And I dun feel bad about my criticisms of you. I call a spade a spade, especially when it has shown itself to be one.<br><br>Okie, this has gone on long enuff. People who's been following this has probably alredi made up their minds and/or taken sides, so there's no point going on.<br><br>Could I suggest that we start ignoring Kaiser if he makes anymore mean remarks? It's really a waste of time.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 14-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kaiser's remarks are indeed inflammatory so to those who are getting offended, just ignore him..i guess he jsut needs the attention eh? so let's deny him that<br><br>Anyway to add my point of view. Breasts do attract my attention as a guy. and don't we all wish that our gals have larger than average ones, for us to play with. BUt the truth of the matter is that, even if she has small boobs, the experience is never less satisfying  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As to the size of the dick, as purr said, a guy with a long one would tend to try to jam the whole thing in...causing intense irritation and discomfort , as the penis hits the cervix(which is about the same as hitting your testes)<br><br>POsitioning is more important than anything else in giving pleasure to a female..and personally i feel that with the female on top. she can control the speed and depth of penetration, such that she can control the pleasure she is having.<br><br>And guys..the G spot in on the front wall of the vagina.... search!!  it's worth it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To all the ppl who contributed to the topic. I salute u guys. I find that ppl aren't that open towards toking abt sex or size and stuff related. Man was i wrong when i read ur replies!<br><br>Anyway to add on, i find that whether size matters applies to whom your partner is. Which means whether the 2 of u are sexually compatible.<br><br>Purr: Not everyone hates ramming ;p hehe  Just that u have to find the 'right fit'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And one more thing ...lets not make this site a flaming site ok?
