            <div class='col-md body'>The size of boobs or tits, more appropriate word is breasts, does not matter to me. Of course, if she has bigger than average size chests, it is sure a plus.  The bigger the chests, to a certain degree, the nicer they feel when you fondle.  Sorry to sound like if the girls' chests are toys for the guys to play.  That's not what I meant.  But it's something that you would automatically start to fondle when making love.  You just can't resist not touching it, if some girls offer them for you to touch.  Just like girls, they would play with our little brother when making love.<br><br>Call me a pervert, but if I walk down the street, and if I see a girl with bigger than average size chests, ahem, I would look at it. I would look only if she is not paying attention to me or not noticing that I am looking at her.  I don't know if this a guy thing or what. I have spoke to male friends, and they say that the chests are the first thing that they attracted to them if a girl they see have a bigger than average size chests.<br><br>Also, I think this must be genetic.  I notice that most Caucasian females have bigger chests than most Asian females.  It's probably due to their bigger size bodies.<br><br>Any questions / comments?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wonder if guys' fascination with breasts is the best proof of Freud's Odepious (correct spelling?) Complex theory.<br><br>(Note: Odepius is the guy in Greek Mythology who killed his father to marry his mother)<br><br>Babies suck their mothers' breasts to get nutrition. Later on, the guys grow up and maintain their fascination with women's breasts - probably due to the feelings of warmth and intimacy with their mothers? Is this how it works??? Or is there another explaination of guys' fascination with breasts even though they do not have a direct role in sex?<br><br>I know breasts excite guys sexually but does it do anything for them (i.e. give feelings of sexual satisfaction) when they touch the breasts? I've asked my ex and current bf this before. They got embarassed and mumbled something incoherent, so I still dun know how this works.<br><br>BTW, I read somewhere that size of penises do not matter because just as long as you can hit the g-spot, which is 2-inches inwards, it's alright. Personally, I feel that skill is preferable to size anytime.<br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 12-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To add on, one of my exes had a big stick and he was damn proud of it. The problem was, he'll always try to go as deep as possible, all the way to the end of the tunnel. It's like a battering ram hitting one of your most sensitive areas. Owwwww!!!!!<br><br>I wish I could say it was due to his inexperience. But the truth was, he was the self-centred assholes all my friends tried to persuade me to dump. Stupidly, I tried to find excuses for everything he did and try really hard to make the relationship work. It was not until I've broken up with him that I got REALLY angry at the way he used and abused me. He always ordered me around in bed to do this and that but he would refuse to go down on me or do anything extra than 'wham-bam-thank-you-mam'.<br><br>Another case of a brilliant mind spoiled by too much admiration and self-centredness. Sigh.<br><br>Sorrie for disgressing. Need to let my anger out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since we're on th Odeopus thing....<br><br>The whole psychology of the family, especially the nuclear family, has something to do with this whole idea of sexuality between direct family relations...<br><br>When we are born, we are very close to our parents...The mother hugs and kisses and nourishes us in a very intimate manner, and the father gives all his affection and consideration to his daughter or son.  AS a result, we have a very deep bond between the family...(something that we keep for life?)... At the earlier stages of our life betweent he time we are born and the age of 12-13 yrs old...wee are showered with love and physical affection...cuddling up to our parents was ok and some mothers will even feed younger children their breast milk even after the age when they dun need it anymore...<br><br>So there is a lot of intimacy within the family that is overlooked and taken for granted...<br><br>Then as we enter puberty, when we need that affection and understanding from parents the most, they withdraw from us..It suddenly becomes wrong if we get too close to our parents besides the occasional hug and kiss on the cheeks...It suddenly becomes wrong if we see our mother's breasts or it is wrong now to sit and watch TV with our father's arms around us...<br><br>In this process, is it any wonder that children have a deep rooted and subconscious fascination with their parents...as they say, most men try and find girls like their mother subconsciously and girls try and find their fathers subconsciously...<br><br>Is it really any wonder when suddenly all that affection is cut to such a drastic degree at such a volatile time as puberty when we are most lonely and trying to find our place in life and society among our peers...We go through a pshycological and emotional withdrawal that maybe doesn't show itself right away, but stays with us our whole lives...and we search continuously for the object of our affections.<br><br>Deep down inside we still have that child inside of us that asks why mom and dad doesn't care about us anymore...or that fear of it...and, altho cliche, is very subliminal and unknown to our conscious minds.<br><br>So is it really such a fantastically mythical thing to fawn over or seek that thing that made us feel so secure and comfortable...aas we know, events in our childhood affect us much more deeply than events thereafter as it shapes who we are and what we become and how we react to things...<br><br>Although it might seem unnatural, it really is a sad and understandable thing .  We always seek approval in some form or another from our parents..no matter how detestable we find them...or how loving and understanding they are...and this is just the same as the odeopus complex...<br><br>...Always and forever seeking the comfort of our most safe years when the world wasn't so scary and complicated...When parents took care of all your problems..<br><br>The mother's breast being the object of such early childhood memories of comfort and affection and connwection with her, it is easy to become a small or large fetish for us guys...but dun get me wrong, it is a fetish that does have a base in everything that I've said here...<br><br>Also, because as teenagers we are "told" or given ideas that breasts are objects of sexuality and that is why we can never see our mothers breasts again...<br><br>So my point is that the Odeopus complex (also dun know how to spell....RINOA!!!!Help me here!!!) is just a mythical portrayal of the loss that we suffer as children and our traumatic separation from our mother(and her bossom).  Not altogether wrong...in fact quite on the dot I must say.<br><br>What is the one overriding thing that follows us everywhere we go in life...no matter whether we are lone wolf or independent or plain shit assholes????<br><br>It is that we seek approval from our parents and a desire to make them proud and/or happy that we are their children...Everyone has this feeling all their lives...even after the parents death, people still will pine for their parents approval in some form or another...you can deny it, but it's there...and when u think about it u will see that it's correct..no matter whether you hate your parents or not...<br><br>So the Oeopus complex does have a great deal to do with our fascinationm with breasts and very easily becomes objects of sexuality because we are trained to believe it as such at such a young age...remember that when we were children, it was never a sexual thing. ......<br><br>..anmd so the fetish comes about...:-)<br><br>Sorry for the Psychology there..but suffice to say that there is much more to it than that...<br><br>I like breats because they are soft and they just feel nice in your hand(my hand).  I also like to suck on the nipples (yes Odeopus) and fondle them and very often like to rest my head on them...:-)  and I don't fool myslef into thinking that I don't find comfort in them as I'm laying there with it under my head...It's so spiritual...<br><br>Sorry...:-) very long and boring...<br><br>You see purr!!!...got me going now I can't stop!!...ha hah ha:-) now as punishment, I make you read it all!!!....:-)<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sexslave: I think guys want to insert to the max also. you're probably right.<br><br>My point was that in terms of sexual satisfaction with a penis, there are more things that you can do with a big'un than a smaller'un. You can insert it to the max, but you don't have to. I read that some females find this extremely uncomfortable, but some like the feeling. So, a big'un can do both but a smaller'un can only do one of them. Ergo, big one better than the smaller one.<br><br>No, I didn't say female enjoy with bigger ones and guys enjoy with smaller ones. I'm suggesting that big'uns can probably satisfy all sorts of females compared to a smaller'un. So, again, big one better than the smaller one.<br><br>In addition, strictly speaking for guys, I'm guessing we will enjoy regardless of big or small so long as there is someone willing to do it with us.<br><br>[This message has been edited by pacman (edited 13-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Purr: so since u were asking i was telling you your theory isn't right. Simple as that? I see you are having some problems taking that. And since when did I say my english is good? I believe some other lame individual said that rather...u might wanna check to see if you need new glasses or if that's not the prob, try increasing ur level of comprehension.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Purr, I seriously think u should start your own sex advice page....its great learning so many things from a female's perspective. And seriously your honesty is really cool, cos sometimes cos in real life when you talk it out with your partners, they tend to keep quiet or not say anything (I guess its to prevent brusing the guy's ego)....just lemme get the last point down in my notebook...."don't ram cos it hurts" hehehe<br><br>------------------<br>________________________<br>If not me, then who else<br>________________________<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kaiser,<br><br>you are the one who's short on comprehension. I'm not asking you whether I'm right. I'm asking you whether you have anything productive to contribute. Obviously, you've shown that you don't. Saying something without supporting it is really lame. You're only here to make trouble. Thank you for proving my point  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For somebody who has such a superior attitude, you sure dun seem to be very intelligent or articulate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kaiser,<br><br>I've never demanded that anyone to agree with me. If you dun agree, then let's hear it  discussed (rather than a lame "I dun agree" that's not supported), so everybody, including myself, can learn something. Again, you just want to come and put people down, not contribute anything. Ever wondered why you are not popular in this forum or elsewhere? Well, look no further becos the reason is glaring in your face.<br><br>I trying to make this thread educational for everybody by encouraging a discussion, not a put-down session. Thank you for your compliment. It really warms my heart to know that you appreciate my efforts   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by purr (edited 13-12-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People, Chill out. This is a non-antagonistic, non-adversarial forum.<br>And Kaiser, thanks for the correct spelling of 'Oedipus'.<br>Purr, good comments and tell us more so that it goes towards the greater education of 'Guy-kind'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Size of breasts: Purr, correct me if I'm wrong but most S'pore Gals are an A cup. So I guess, this is the size that most average S'poreans have to accept. It's the nipples that are sensitive and not the breasts so in my opinion, it doesn't matter.<br><br>As for penile size..well. Size does matter, but so does technique...and my Ex doesn't tell me if it counts...so I would like to have a female opinion on this one.<br></div>
