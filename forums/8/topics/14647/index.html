            <div class='col-md body'>Man Utd 0-1 Arsenal<br><br>It took Sir Alex Ferguson 10 years to secure a second domestic Double with Manchester United. At Old Trafford last night, on the pitch Ferguson has long considered his personal playground, Arsene Wenger did so in six.<br><br>How Manchester United's manager must have cursed his fate, and how, in the privacy of a dressing room shattered by the rigours of a season that has left them without a trophy for the first time in four years, he must have turned the air blue.<br><br>Sylvain Wiltord's 57th minute goal had transformed this previously impenetrable fortress into Wenger's theatre of dreams, ending a title race that had threatened to run to the very last game in the worst possible fashion for the defending champions.<br><br>For Arsenal it was perfect. The perfect way to finish an almost perfect campaign that not even Ferguson can argue has seen them emerge as the finest team in the country. In completing one Double they celebrated another, having already beaten United at Highbury.<br><br>They also became the first team in more than a century to end a season without losing a game on their domestic travels, which in itself is some achievement.<br><br>This was a bad-tempered encounter, a contest that would have disappointed those who hoped to see football fit for a title decider. United ruined any chance of that, a team driven by Roy Keane's accusations of cowardice succeeding only in inflicting pain of the physical variety on their opponents.<br><br>Arsenal did not mind. A side that has not been beaten in the Premiership since December was enjoying another famous night, an evening every bit as enchanted as the one, in 1989, that saw Michael Thomas seize the championship at Anfield.<br><br>But this was better than that, even if it lacked the drama of that unforgettable climax. This was an Arsenal team that only four days earlier had lifted the FA Cup with victory over Chelsea, an Arsenal side that had dominated the English game with class and conviction.<br><br>If Ferguson was desperate to make Arsenal wait a little longer for the title, his decision to select Ruud van Nistelrooy among his substitutes came as something of a surprise.<br><br>Arsenal had been weakened by injuries to Thierry Henry and Tony Adams, and Dennis Bergkamp started on the bench, but the selection of Diego Forlan as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's strike partner remained a strange.<br><br>Nicky Butt's knee injury meant Juan Sebastian Veron had to play with that troublesome Achilles problem.<br><br>The game started at pace, Wiltord meeting a Ray Parlour cross with a first-time shot that took a slight deflection off Phil Neville and whistled wide of Fabien Barthez's right-hand post.<br><br>United responded immediately, Paul Scholes sending a powerful drive just over the Arsenal crossbar before a Veron cross caused some concern.<br><br>It was exciting stuff, and an atmosphere already charged by an overwhelming sense of dread took on an extra dimension in the 20th minute when Scholes caught Edu with a nasty challenge from behind.<br><br>Arsenal players rushed angrily towards the United midfielder, referee Paul Durkin raced to the scene, and a furious Ferguson made his way along the touchline in obvious protest, going so far as to shove the fourth official, Jeff Winter, in the chest.<br><br>Durkin allowed Scholes a second chance by showing only a yellow card, and he then stopped short of dismissing Neville and Keane for their respective fouls on Wiltord and Patrick Vieira.<br><br>Keane, in particular, could consider himself rather fortunate, having nearly caught his great rival in the groin with his studs. It was somewhat disappointing to see United resort to such heavy-handed tactics. As a football team they have set the standard these past few years.<br><br>That they should find United in such malevolent mood was a measure of just how far Arsenal had come since last winning the Double in 1998. Arsenal have proved this season that they can beat United at their own game. In terms of finding their target United were doing little. For David Seaman, and for Barthez for that matter, the opening 45 minutes proved a quiet affair.<br><br>A Veron free-kick was blocked by the brave head of Vieira shortly before the break, while a second attempt was driven into Arsenal's defensive wall. For the watching David Beckham, there is no danger of him losing that job.<br><br>Arsenal finally struck when a mistake from Mikael Silvestre lost possession and allowed the visitors to launch an attack. The ball eventually fell to Freddie Ljungberg on the right and, when he muscled his way past Laurent Blanc and his shot was turned into the path of Wiltord by Barthez, the French international striker drove the ball home into an empty net.<br><br>Ferguson immediately withdrew Veron and sent on Van Nistelrooy, but it was no avail. United were trapped in their worst nightmare, and not until next season will that have the opportunity to escape.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As history goes, the last time Man Utd won the treble was when they ended their 98 campaign trophy-less (deja vu?) and lost the domestic double to Arsenal FC (more deja vu?)<br><br>No doubt Arsenal is now the new dominant force in the premiership but look at their first team? David Seaman, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell, Martin Keown are the only england players (save the occasional appearance fo ray parlour)<br><br>The remaining team includes Lauren (Cameroon), Vieira, Pires, Wiltord, Henry (all french), Bergkamp (Dutch), Fredrik Ljungberg (Swede).<br><br>Basically more then half the team are foreign imports. Is it any wonder why Wenger has completed a domestic double so soon?<br><br>Ferguson relied on his youth system, even selling three of his key players to make room for young blood.<br><br>The current squad has: Scholes, Beckham, Butt, Neville brothers, Brown, all of which are full-fledged internationals of the England squad. The rest include 3 french, 1 welsh, 1 EIRE, an argentine, a dutch and a norweigian.<br><br>But the bulk of the squad is english. So is there really a comparison if any? If anything, i've always admitted that for Man Utd to come out stronger, they have to lose first.<br><br>For Man Utd, things can only get better now...</div>
