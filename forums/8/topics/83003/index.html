These spirits were thought to lurk behind your shoulder, waiting for an opportunity to strike.<br>Bad Luck: A bat flying into the house<br>Bad Luck: An owl hooting 3 times<br>Bad Luck: 3 butterflies together<br>Bad Luck: Looking at the new moon over your left shoulder<br>Bad Luck: A 5-leaf clover<br>Bad Luck: Breaking a glass while proposing a toast<br>Bad Luck: Putting a shirt on inside out<br>Bad Luck: Red and white flowers together<br>Bad Luck: Hearing a rooster crow at night<br>Bad Luck: Cutting your nails on a Friday<br>Bad Luck: Putting a hat on a bed<br>Bad Luck: Getting out of bed left foot first<br>Bad Luck: Violets blooming out of season<br>Bad Luck: A picture falling<br>Bad Luck: Breaking a mirror<br>Bad Luck: Singing before breakfast<br>Bad Luck: Opening an umbrella indoors<br>Bad Luck: Giving away a wedding present<br>Bad Luck: Stepping on cracks in the sidewalk<br>Bad Luck: An itch inside your nose<br>Bad Luck: Crossed knives<br>Bad Luck: seeing an owl during daylight<br>Bad Luck: If a dog suddenly barks for no apparent reason in a house that has a sick person then<br>Bad Luck: You must wear new clothes at Easter or you will have bad luck<br>Bad Luck: There will be an argument if knifes are crossed at a table.
