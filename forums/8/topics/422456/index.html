              <p>Huh?? u said all singaporean are Cook? Crook or Cook?</p>
              <p>So far, while drinking in my pub, a singaporean handsome guy once told me the best description of a taiwanese gal, he said we are like taiwanese sausage, sweet, nice and munchy. As for taiwanese guy, frankly as a PR here, taiwanses guy are very sor lor, meaning more rough then sg guy. So if gal love rough type men, take taiwanese guy, very rough and manly</p>

              <p>Oh, my goodness, this seem to be the first time someone agree to what i said.....7030 is going to be first prize soon!!!,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Joke aside, in comparing with other so call chinese related countries like japan, korea, taiwan and even Hongkong, Singapore gals have the least respect for their men, unlike for eg in taiwan, since young, my grandma already taught us how to serve a husband, the respect and the care of them, when he come back from work, place their shoes, prepare hotbath for him, cook or heat up the food for him, all his childrens must call him before taking dinner, the wife also need to make sure, his cloth are washed and iron for the next day, his lunch packet etc etc...of course if the wife is working, she will get a maid or so call help in laundry , cook food, sweep floor and do some dry cleaning, maid or so call house helper are just in for a few hours, not like singaporean, take maid like slave. It is not that we taiwanese gal are not well educated, we can be on par in term of education with sg gals, just that we are more "wen rou" meaning more caring and loving with respect to our men. Equal gender in taiwan is very much like singapore, just that we understand that man hv to be the head of the family and no matter what happen other than having affair, we stand by him.</p>

              <p>@angel7030: I totally agree with you about how I have been educated in more traditional way that girls need to take care of the family such and such, knowing how to cook is the basic. Even though I have been to the States for 10 years I still carry the tradition. Or maybe just my parents are too conservative. </p>
              <p>So far I only met one Singaporean girl, I have to admit that she is pampered but then she is cool. I stay at her house during my stay in Singapore and her parents were so nice. I remembered we stayed up with the mom and watch horror movie until 3am. The dad took us out to Little India and see the red light district of Singapore at like 1am in the morning. </p>
              <p>The guy was very nice that he accompanied me almost everyday except when he had to give tuitions and work. He basically paid for everything. I don't that whether he is just being nice or I think too much. Do all the Singaporeans do this? </p>

              <p>LOL really. The guy told me that he can only found another guy who is nicer than he is. </p>
              <p>I like the guy because he is like very mature and know what he is doing. During the conversations with him, I learned a lot from him. One point I like about him is that He remembered almost everything I said, good memory. Although his mouth is pretty bad, overall a good guy. He goes to NTU i think...... </p>

              <p>First of all, like is not equal to love ya, frankly, you can meet any kind of guys in this world, not only in singapore, but because you are from states and maybe sexy and pretty like me, every sg men will treat you nice, but as the sg guy saying goes, nothing is for free. So, BECAREFUL.</p>
              <p>Usually when i said I am a taiwanese to sg guy, then feel relax and start to boast about his achievement and what he can do and so on. But if it is a sg gal, sg guy tends to be more introvert and quiet, cos sg gal knows sg guys too well.</p>

              <p>okay, enough of the guy. I am here to meet more people! Singapore is a good country to live in. I miss the street vendor carts that sell ice cream for S$1 each. The æ–‡æ�±è¨˜ Chicken Rice is the best. Although I can't really take the spicy of the foods, others are good. Bugis Junction is a good place to shop . haha i do miss Singapore.

              <div>koi (50 åµ�ï¼‰is one of the few major chained tea shop in Taiwan. We also have others such as æ¸…å¿ƒç¦�å…¨ã€�æ­‡è…³äº­ã€�æ˜¥æ°´å ‚ã€�ï¼˜ï¼•åº¦ï¼£. In my opinion, ï¼˜ï¼•åº¦ï¼£ is well-known for its coffees and desserts. I am not sure which shop sells the best bubble tea but all of them are good. æ˜¥æ°´å ‚ is probably the better one, but everyone has different taste so I can't really judge. </div>

              <div>If you visited Taiwan, definitely try the bubble tea from other shops. I am sure each shop has its own taste of bubble tea. </div>

And there's a new so-called "competitor" Gong Cha, coming in quite strong too. I'm just wondering if there're many others in Taiwan that are far better than koi. looks like there is :D I saw one website from a bubble tea shop over there (can't remember the name but the website's all orange) and they've got vitagen based drinks, sounds/looks really good! Nvr visited Taiwan before but I so wanna go soon. </p></div>

              <p>I believe you are here because you want to know more about the way singaporean guys think. :-D The guy you like is an introvert, it means he needs a little pushing from you. Initiate small chats with him, be proactive in sharing your experience with him. Slowly, he'll start to open up and talk to you more. <strong>If you want to know what he's thinking, then you need to make sure that you're in the same frequency as him...</strong>  How to be in the same frequency? You must try to pick up some visual cue... usually guys at his age tends to get bothered by a few stuffs... usually it falls into one of the category</p>
              <p>1) Money issues<br>2) Boy-Girl Relationship issues<br>3) School work Issues (grades, results, peer competitions, etc)</p>
              <p>If he's upset, it means something is bothering him. Let him open up to you by saying "<em>I know I may not able to help you, but if you trust me, please share with me your problem, I am willing to be your listening ears</em>". After he done finishing, you MUST NOT give any comments or suggestion. :) because he needs a listening ear ONLY!.</p>
              <p>Guy paying for everything... Don't mistaken that he's overly nice or what. It's the culture here to pay for the ladies. It's kinda like the host-guest relationship where the host pays for everything... It's our unique culture to host a guest from oversea... When I go out with my female friends, I tend to give them treats too.. because it make me look *gentleman*.. haha! :-D on a lighter note, it's kinda egoistic~</p>
