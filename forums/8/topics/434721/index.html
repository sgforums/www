              <p>The current road condition in Clementi is bad enough because<br>1.There are a lot fo private condo buses parking in the bus stops---Eg,The Chevrons,The Botonia,The Infinti,The Carellia (spelling might be error)<br>There will be 5 private buses at one time and CAUSED JAMS.<br>2.There are railings as you had mentioned.<br>3.The taxi did not obey the principle as there only wirtten MAX 3 TAXIS but it can go all the way up to 10 taxis<br>4.There are some inconsiderate drivers who tend to park/wait the cars there as some might just buy food or deposit/withdraw cash so they park thier cars<br>at LANE 1.By doing so,it had taken up the Lane 1 with the Taxis as well and Priavte buses<br><br>and dont worry,it had been jamming there since 6 years ago in 2005 as I lived there so long I had get used to it.So with the New Clementi Bus Interchange,<br>it will make no difference even if it skipped the current old bus stops and go to interchange straight away.<br><br>Our conditions were like Nex@Serangoon.The
              
              road got 3 lanes.SAME AS OURS and jams all over.Anyway we did say we will ike to have 1-2 more lanes so it has 5 lanes but it is rather<br>impossible due to too cramped.</p>

              <p>There is no current condition. The condition is as it is since more than two years ago.</p>
              <p>I don't think the problem was addressed at all, until maybe just recently. I spotted some people video the bus stop at Clementi Mall from the MRT connecting bridge for a few days.
