            <div class='col-md body'>You know abt the reporting of Scams to the police.

For example, I reported an assault case before, and i told the officer verbally in English that the attacker <span style="text-decoration: underline;">charged</span> towards me. However, in his case report, he insists on writing, "The attacker <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>walked very quickly </strong></span>to me".. You know the usage of verbs could impact whether you will be successful in filing for a magistrate complaint to sue the attacker. The judge will view it differently between usage of verb i.e. "charged", versus "Walked very quickly to me"<br><br>It is really a painstaking affair to relate your account to a desk case officer who is really poor in English.

Hope you will understand.<br><br>This happened few months ago. So don't fall for the same trick after reading this. I know i'm foolish at that moment.<br><br>That day i was sitting down at a void deck with my friend. We were waiting for another friend. So we started smoking. (I'm underage) Cos normally i smoke i will spit saliva. Suddenly a 'NEA Officer' came and show his pass to us. He told my friend to hold the ciggarette bud. We were with our bicycles. He told us to push them and go one side with him. As we were walking, he told ask my friend a few questions, like got play gang anot, got case anot etc.<br><br>We walked to a bridge. He told us that his 'boss' was over there where we first got caught. He say he don't want to summon us as we were school students and my friend has got case somemore. At that moment i was really scared. I thought 'siao liao.. that time just kenna hsa 30$ fine.. now 200$.. my parents going to kill me for sure..'<br><br>He offer us an 'idea'. He say he don't need to summon us. He told me to give him my handphone to show his 'boss' that we will go for his conseling coruse after that he will return to me back my phone. I was thinking 'give him already he gimme back, no summon.. good what just go for the conselling coruse will do! whats more my parents will not know..'<br><br>He told us to take out our phone. My friend handphone model was nokia 7610 and mine was nokia 6233 ME. He picked mine. (More valuable) He told me to take out my sim card and return to me. He say he will be back in half hour to return my phone. He just need to show his 'boss'. He gave me his handphone number. He told me to meet me at the block downstairs where we first got caught. Then he will return me my phone.<br><br>After the moment he left, i thought something no right.. I turn back, he gone. I got really worried. My friend went and look for my another friend. He told me to find that guy. I searched around.. Can't find him.. My friend say maybe not scam.<br><br>We went to the block where we first got caught. Wait for half and hour.. No sign.. I decided to call the police.. The police took down my statment and tell me 100% no hope getting back..<br><br>1 day after school, my case officer called me down to the HQ. He typed a long statment. Ask me to check, and sign there. (The statment is about what happened, at where etc.) My case officer told me that the person was caught. But he sold away my phone as soon as he scammed my phone. Then someone the next day some buyer bought my phone. So my phone can't get back.<br><br>So guys, becareful. Don't got scam like me.<br></div></blockquote>hell you must be really young and foolish........<br><br>anyways....try harder</div>
