            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore is probably the most unhealthy nation. It promises of a country with strong information and knowledge base, promises of young talents in the service sector but it fails to present the the effective results of its meritocracy system which the country strongly believes in.<br><br>The education system is flawed, like as if a contagious disease, and this disease is spreading like an epidemic. Singaporeans, perhaps consists of the most people with poor knowledge that brags about their capabilities and probably contains the most thick-skinned shameless fools who will go public for the sake of money.<br><br>Have you watched 'Who wants to be a millionaire?' on TCS channel 8 on the 27th of March 2002? It is humilating to have one Singaporean not knowing about the fairy tale 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves' but it is even more shameful to see our fellow Singaporeans go public shamelessly without knowing that a python is a non-venomous snake. This is sad to know that we are indicating that majority of the Singaporeans are poor, in their general knowledge.<br><br>Fellow Singaporeans heed my call, do not make us fools and clowns by going public when some Taiwanese can watch our TV programmes with their cable. DO YOUR HOMEWORK.<br><br>Our nation is facing a huge disaster. The current education system is not helping the nation anymore. Look at the number of 'O' level passes and 'A' level passes and judge yourself. Is this the end? Look into the mirror and ask yourselves: are you knowledgable?<br><br>Mind you, we do not have natural resources and Chinese from China are starting to compete with our locals in the service sector. Our nation will starve if nothing is done to improve it.<br><br>Take a look at the way students are answering questions. They are answering questions because they have the answers. If you ask them something they dont know, I'll wager that they cant be bothered to even find out. They are fed like babies, mouthful by mouthful. They are dragged about by masters like a dog, educated only how to answer certain questions. ONLY those that will affect their results.<br><br>The concentration on aggregates only reflected that Singaporeans will never be improving creatively, it only ensured that these people will become employees and not employers for they only know how to answer questions with answers already provided and not do their HOMEWORK. In this case, in this society, men must acquire knowledge from different sources, however, what I perceive in out nation are people who happens to only learn what that will appear in their exam papers.<br><br>Do you see many 6 'O' level passes in UK? I bet you won't 'cause their government won't put too much concentration on aggregates. Singaporeans may have good assessment skills, but they failed in their knowledge and practical work. Look at how the scores are weighed in the favour of assessment in Physics, Chemistry and Biology. Practical exams seemed to become an assessment in local institutions of education.<br><br>Singaporeans only tread behind footsteps of others, they never create their own path. Entrepreneurs? Probably 10 out the million in Singapore will become, and most likely the number will not increase. Look at the country, where most offices belong to the Government, how is Singapore going to progress through these difficult times? As if the competition from our south-east asian neighbours isn't enough, we got China that is rising fast.<br><br>The Government must slice the current education requirements badly or it'll face grave difficulties in allowing free learning space for its citizens. If the texts goes thinner, there might be hope for the bag weighs light and the students won't be that tired, resorting to 10 year series. They won't learn why they are answering, they just answer.<br><br>------------------<br>I think it's time to blow this scene and get everybody together, ok 3, 2, 1, let's jam.<br>The work which becomes a new genre itself, will be called, Cowboy Bebop.<br>See you Space Cowboy.<br>~ Cowboy Bebop ~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I felt that what was mentioned was more like the cultural aspect of Singapore rather than the education system.<br>If you are not willing to widen your knowledge, afraid to ask questions for fear of embarassment, no matter what type of education you get it will still be the same.<br>Singapore is moving towards Ability driven education, instead of efficiency driven as in the past. But it is impossible to move entirely in that direction. If students learn what they want to learn, will they wanna learn?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what the system is like, I am sure there are people who agree and disagree on it. Imagine now we adpot all the Western style of learning, then what are those slower but more hardworking students going to do? I mean I am sure you have classmates now or before who are really smart but lazy at the same time. Those slower but more industrious students are definitely going to lose out to those who are born with the gift of a smart brain.<br>The system we now have is there because we want to promote a hardworking environment and to only allow those students who are willing to put in the effort to work hard to succeed in life. Of course there are also a lot of disadvantages in our current system and I do not have any idea how are we going to overcome them.<br>Just offering you guys another perception by looking at another angle.<br><br>------------------<br>If you could have told me everything<br>You would have found what love is<br>If you could have told me what was on your mind<br>I would have shown you the way<br>Tomorrow i am going live without your love<br>I've never thought beyond that time<br>I've never imagined the pictures of that life<br>For now I will try to live for you and for me<br>I will try, try to live with love,<br>With dreams and forever with tears</div>
