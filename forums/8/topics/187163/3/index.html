            <div class='col-md body'>No matter what generation you folks are talking about, there things that should remain unchanged. That is, <strong>personal grooming</strong>. Can't fathom why most of you are sidetracked to something else.<br><br>Personal grooming has got worst among those born post-90ers. They either embrace Ah Seng/Lian fashion or Sadistic/Gothic fashion as their personal trademark. The former points to gangsterism or hooliganism while the latter indicates distortion of belief and values due to negative influence of the mass media.<br><br>Personally, it may be acceptable to your own reality. However, it is detrimental to your professional life. Furthermore, personal grooming is part of code of conduct for gentlemen and ladies. You disrespect yourself if you fail to properly dressed and tarnish your own image and reputation.<br><br>Having a personal style in dressing oneself is crucial to be distinctive in your personal and professional life. You also stand to gain indirect and direct benefits by dressing well and look at your best.<br><br>Take your chances if you want to.</div>

Wearing t-shirt is okay but what irrates me is that there are some people that wear sloppy t-shirt and jeans to formal occasions like weddings.<br><br>Worst of all is that I have seen sales promoters wearing bright kiddy t-shirt and jeans doing his/her job. I mean come on man, what's so difficult to dress proper? A proper formal attire like long-sleeved shirt and pants will make you look better really.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

From beautiful evolving to stumpy teapots lor..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Anyway, it's an opinion of yours hence it tends to be biased towards your experiences. What you say cannot be generalise. From my point of view and what I have experience, I can say the girls today do have their fashion styles and it meets the fashion world in this era. You are right on the point that we had not gone through your era, so we do not see what you had seen but more or less through education and movies and whatsoever, we do know roughly or at least a bit of how the fashion was back then. Times changed and we conform to the society demands. How do you define "star looks"? Because you were from that era of time, your appreciation of fashion may not coincides with the girls these days. Hence, your discontentment with how the girls dressing these days. It is ok to voice out your opinions and such, but at the end of the day we are not to concede to anyone's opinions but ourselves. To each his own.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Man.. what you mean by full figures? wOOt that's hot!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
