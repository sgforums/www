In my opinion, they will eat S'HIT if his rich friend asks them to. Suckers!<br><br>Don't they realize that his friends' richness has nothing to do with him. Why the FXXX they are so proud of it?<br><br>really cannot understand this type of singaporeans!<br><br></div></blockquote>case 1: he's property angent, and someone buys some super expensive penthouse means he get a big commission. that's his job, he just happy that he earn some big bucks, so he tell u guys that. it's like u work in some company, u did well for the yr, boss give u 4 month bonus while others only get 1 or 2 months, u will also tell u friend cos u are happy about that, rite? As a property agent, besides giving professional advice to his customers, he should please them too. Attitude does matter when it comes to sales job.<br><br>case2: this maybe really those type of ppl who lick rich man' ass like u said. And u said "brag", so maybe he's not really that close to those rich guy.<br><br>case3: i dunno if that rich guy is really close to ur fren. If they are really close fren, i think it's ok that ur fren go help him settle down. cos it doesnt matter he's rich anot, if his close fren who's not rich, just came to singapore and want to look for a HDB flat to rent and settle down, he should go help too.<br><br></div>
