It's very strange if permit is needed just to speak in the public. All this shit about freedom of speech is just a government plot to resettle a restless population.<br><br>The people of Spain got their wake-up call just a few days before the election with the Madrid train blast, and as a result, a new Socialist government was elected. Given Singapore's staunch support for the <span style="color: red;">ILLEGAL</span> Iraq War by <span style="color: red;">WORLD BULLY USA</span>, i won't be surprised if someone out there is plotting to bomb up Raffles Place MRT station during office hour.<br><br>I feel it's a good thing that companies are nationalised because it ensures that what's Singapore will remain Singapore's.
