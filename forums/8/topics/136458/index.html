            <div class='col-md body'>There's this theory that time travel is impossible. Theory is that if there is time travel or that it is made possible in the future, it would have been apparent by now from appearances made from future travellers. The fact that there is none made it clear. Could they have been held back by some unknown forces as not to make an appearance ? Consider this. If they have the tecnology that makes it possible to time travel, they would have not been held back.<br><br>Again, consider this, that if time travel is not possible by physical means, say your body would be disintergrate the moment time...reverses backward or moves forward, then all that's possible is to view it through special apparatus...then is there any point to time travel ?<br><br>Also, people travel back through time by recalling their memories. Is there much of a differences here?  And by viewing the future...isnt that same as making it through each and everyone individual actions ? To believe in a stable future means believing in a stagnant world where things would be unchanged planned by so called fate and destiny. I refused to believe in that.<br><br>I personally believe that in life, not only do you serve as a witness to events but as a person, you exist by stating your presence by participating in the events around you. Being a mere observer would reduce you to no more than an immobile stone.</div>

I dun think it's possible to travel back to past thou...and even if one day, the technology is so advance that we could, might not be good thing..cos we're meddling with nature and it will have its effects.<br><br>Like in the story, they came up wif a technology to transmit ppl like sending data via a fax machine from one universe to the other... but it had its flaw... those return to find some of their "data" not fully transcripted back or some alteration wif their original self.
