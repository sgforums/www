In daily life we don't notice weird time warps, because the effect becomes dramatic only when the motion occurs at close to the speed of light. Even at aircraft speeds, the time dilation in a typical journey amounts to just a few nanoseconds--hardly an adventure of Wellsian proportions. Nevertheless, atomic clocks are accurate enough to record the shift and confirm that time really is stretched by motion. So travel into the future is a proved fact, even if it has so far been in rather unexciting amounts.<br><br>Image no longer available. The full versions of this and other articles from the print edition--including all graphics and sidebars--are available for purchase at Scientific American Digital.<br>A Wormhole Time Machine in Three Not So Easy Steps<br>To observe really dramatic time warps, one has to look beyond the realm of ordinary experience. Subatomic particles can be propelled at nearly the speed of light in large accelerator machines. Some of these particles, such as muons, have a built-in clock because they decay with a definite half-life; in accordance with Einstein's theory, fast-moving muons inside accelerators are observed to decay in slow motion. Some cosmic rays also experience spectacular time warps. These particles move so close to the speed of light that, from their point of view, they cross the galaxy in minutes, even though in Earth's frame of reference they seem to take tens of thousands of years. If time dilation did not occur, those particles would never make it here.<br><br>Speed is one way to jump ahead in time. Gravity is another. In his general theory of relativity, Einstein predicted that gravity slows time. Clocks run a bit faster in the attic than in the basement, which is closer to the center of Earth and therefore deeper down in a gravitational field. Similarly, clocks run faster in space than on the ground. Once again the effect is minuscule, but it has been directly measured using accurate clocks. Indeed, these time-warping effects have to be taken into account in the Global Positioning System. If they weren't, sailors, taxi drivers and cruise missiles could find themselves many kilometers off course.</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>there will be a tremendous change to everything if time travel's made possible. many good points about that, but nothing less with the bad points. imagine what terrorists could do.<br><br>world peace.<br><br>say, i'd rather remain this way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Time travel is theorectically possible...you just have to travel faster than the speed of light...but then again, anything is theorectically possible. Also...as for alteration of history affecting the present...heard of the butterfly effect theory? It's been made into a movie...haven't watched it yet, but i think it depicts a pretty realistic view of the the butterfly theory. Anyways...are there any sciences forums here?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if you believe that time travel exist in the form of multiple universe, then it really isn't time travel at all - at least for the rest of us who are unable to do it. This is because whatever already happen in this universe cannot be changed. You are changing the progress of another universe. So, if you are the one who is making the time travel, good for you. For the rest of us, what you do in another universe does not affect us.<br><br>Of course, if technology exist to allow everyone to move to another universe, then it really is a disaster for this universe as well as the rest. Since this universe will be empty out in no time and the other universe will be quite messy due to too much meddling from this universe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
