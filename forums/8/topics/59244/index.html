            <div class='col-md body'>Spider in the Toilet Hoax<br>September 1999<br><br>The following message is totally false. According to the Entomology department at the University of California, Riverside, there is no such animal as a South American Blush Spider. There is also no Journal of the United Medical Association (JUMA), no Big Chappies restaurant at Blare Airport, no fact there is no Blare airport, and no Civilian Aeronautics Board (the Civil Aeronautics Board was disbanded in 1984). Beverly Clark is a line of wedding apparel and a Blush Spider is a cosmetological term referring to patches of tiny varicose veins on the surface of the skin. As mentioned at Urban Legends.com, "If you're attacked by one of these, I'd recommend calling a plastic surgeon rather than the exterminator..."<br><br>*************************************************************<br>WARNING:  From Texas A&amp;M International University<br>*************************************************************<br><br>An article by Dr. Beverly Clark, in the Journal of the United Medical<br>Association (JUMA), the mystery behind a recent spate of deaths has been<br>solved. If you haven't already heard about it in the news, here is what<br>happened.<br><br>Three women in Chicago, turned up at hospitals over a 5-day period, all with<br>the same symptoms. Fever, chills, and vomiting, followed by muscular<br>collapse, paralysis, and finally, death. There were no outward signs of<br>trauma. Autopsy results showed toxicity in the blood.<br><br>These women did not know each other, and seemed to have nothing in common.<br>It was discovered, however, that they had all visited the same restaurant<br>(Big Chappies, at Blare Airport), within days of their deaths.  The health<br>department descended on the restaurant, shutting it down. The food, water,<br>and air conditioning were all inspected and tested, to no avail.<br><br>The big break came when a waitress at the restaurant was rushed to the<br>hospital with similar symptoms. She told doctors that she had been on<br>vacation, and had only went to the restaurant to pick up her check. She did<br>not eat or drink while she was there, but had used the restroom.<br><br>That is when one toxicologist, remembering an article he had read, drove<br>out to the restaurant, went into the restroom, and lifted the toilet seat.<br>Under the seat, out of normal view, was a small spider.  The spider was<br>captured and brought back to the lab, where it was determined to be the<br>South American Blush Spider (arachnius gluteus), so named because of its<br>reddened flesh color. This spider's venom is extremely toxic, but can take<br>several days to take effect.  They live in cold, dark, damp, climates, and<br>toilet rims provide just the right atmosphere.<br><br>Several days later a lawyer from Los Angeles showed up at a hospital<br>emergency room. Before his death, he told the doctor, that he had been away<br>on business, had taken a flight from New York, changing planes in Chicago,<br>before returning home. He did not visit Big Chappies while there. He did, as<br>did all of the other victims, have what was determined to be a puncture<br>wound, on his right buttock.<br><br>Investigators discovered that the flight he was on had originated in South<br>America. The Civilian Aeronautics Board (CAB) ordered an immediate<br>inspection of the toilets of all flights from South America, and discovered<br>the Blush spider's nests on 4 different planes!<br><br>It is now believed that these spiders can be anywhere in the country. So<br>please, before you use a public toilet, lift the seat to check for spiders.<br>It can save your life!  And please pass this on to everyone you care about<br><br>Officer Sylvia Steele<br>Texas A&amp;M International University<br>5201 University Blvd.<br>Laredo, Tx 78041-1999<br>956-326-2100<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
