            <div class='col-md body'>SINGAPORE : The National Kidney Foundation has laid off 92 of its non-clinical staff in a bid to contain costs.<br><br>Most of those affected were involved in the organisation's fundraising activities.<br><br>Sixty-four are workers on probation and have been with NKF for less than a year; 48 are foreigners.<br><br>NKF says it has consulted the Manpower Ministry and the Singapore National Employers Federation in determining the severance package, which will come up to about S$350,000.<br><br>By trimming non-clinical staff by 26 percent, it will save some S$3.2 million a year, or 22 percent of its manpower costs for non-clinical employees.<br><br>The latest restructuring exercise comes at a time when NKF is coping with the fallout from a public outcry over the salary and bonuses paid to its ex-CEO TT Durai.<br><br>In the seven weeks since the previous Board bowed out from the furore, NKF has lost 16 percent, or 40,000 donors who used to pledge a monthly donation to help kidney patients.<br><br>This amounted to a loss in income of S$400,000 every month.<br><br>While it restores public confidence, NKF says it will hold back all mega fundraising activities for the next 6 to 12 months.<br><br>With no work for its fundraising staff, its interim Chairman Gerard Ee says the management could not justify their manpower costs.<br><br>He says NKF is also rationalising its mission as it tries to regain public confidence.<br><br>The interim board is looking at getting suitable people to take over the NKF Children's Medical Fund and the NKF Cancer Fund.<br><br>This is so as not to send out mixed messages as NKF redirects its focus on caring for kidney patients.<br><br>And when the major fundraising activities resume in the future, the format will be different.<br><br>Instead of the present practice of enticing the public to donate money by offering attractive prizes like condominiums and cars, the format will be that of a "lottery ticket". - CNA /ct<br></div>
