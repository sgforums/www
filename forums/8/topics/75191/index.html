            <div class='col-md body'>From the straits times website:<br><br>READERS of The Straits Times were of the opinion that the National Kidney Foundation (NKF) owed the public an explanation after news broke that the non-profit organisation had $189 million in the bank.<br><br>The Straits Times received 50 e-mail messages and 27 calls on this subject yesterday.<br>Advertisement<br><br>In particular, many of them demanded to know why only 52 cents out of every dollar raised in 2002 went towards the foundation's beneficiaries.<br><br>Most of those who called or e-mailed said they were taken aback when they read about the NKF's nine-digit reserve. And 15 readers said they had decided to vote with their wallets - they would stop donating to the NKF.<br><br>But there were five who said they would continue to support the foundation. And eight kidney patients made a plea that the public not pull the plug on Singapore's largest charity.<br><br>The NKF, which raised $67.5 million in 2002, has enough reserves to see it through at least three years without any more fund-raising, unless it has other specific development plans, said Mr Willie Cheng, chairman of the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre.<br><br><strong>In response to criticism, the NKF said that 'charities in Singapore should raise as much funds as they can get' and protect their reserves to ensure that they will have sufficient funds 'for the unpredictable future'.</strong><br><br>The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore told The Straits Times yesterday that the NKF had spent at least 80 per cent of its donations and income on charitable activities so far.<br><br>Mr Charles Chong, MP for Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC and chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on Community Development and Sports (MCDS), felt that the NKF had some explaining to do.<br><br>He said yesterday that the NKF should tell the public what it planned to do with its reserves.<br><br>'Tell us how much of the $62 million you need to raise a year goes towards your reserves, how much goes to operations and how much goes to the patients,' he added. -- Theresa Tan<br><br>---------------------------<br><strong>In Bold</strong> Aparrantly, NKF does not get it, it is not donating the people are not doing, it is what NKF is spending or what it wants to do with the money that the people wants to know.<br><br>For me, if they don't explain, forget it, I donate to some other charity since they have enough to last for 3 years and some other charity needs it more than them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dun u find their modus operandi and mindset of gathering as much reserve as possible, even when there is already a mountain of reserve, for the "impending storm" rather familiar? such a sense of deja vu when i read it...</div>
