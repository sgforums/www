            <div class='col-md body'>well.. guess if you know how to shop smart, you can really get some good deals from SLS. Just make sure that you try out the stuff in the shop itself, make sure it is covered by warranty, make sure you do your research before buying your stuff then check all accesories are included. My friend bought the same creative mp3 player as mine from there $40 cheaper with everything included and in perfect working condition.<br><br>However if you do not know how to get around those SLS chaps best bet is to stay away and prevent getting conned.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Usually they will give you an overpriced quote when you ask them for the price of an item. The trick is to tell them "thank you. I will take a look around." This is prompt them to give you a lower price. Then try to bargain somemore.<br><br>I was at sim lim sq yesterday shopping for a video camera battery. I entered a shop and the guy quoted me $65 for a battery. I said no thanks and that chap told me "what about 40?" I said no thanks again as it was the first shop I entered and I intend to check out the prices of other shops as well but finally the guy quoted me $35 for the same battery he wanted to sell me for 65.<br><br>This made me very curious and suspicious. I went to another shop and asked for the same thing. That chap took out a battery and quoted me $60. I rejected and he offered $38 finally.<br><br>So be careful if you're buying electronics stuff from the 1st and 2nd level shops. Those computer shops at the 3rd and 4th level should be more reliable as their prices are mostly fixed and displayed. </div></blockquote>not actually.....the last time when i went to simlim to fix my PC......it was at bliss pc.....i think its 04-02 shop........they wanted to dig up some extra cash......its not really trying to be tricky here......but from the facial expression and body language was 100% positively sure they were thinking about trying to cut the customer........<br><br>and it was ages last time....but does anyone ever encountered any expereince such as people who sold their USED.....or rather tested motherboards to their customers????.....well i had........later to realise that the bios settings were altered.....luckly it was asus motherboard which was reliable and hardy......never gave me much problem for 3 years.............<br><br>anyway it sim lim was once reputed to be a black market once .................hmmmm....wonder if it has anything to do with their sleazy attitude and tricky........ hmmmm....anyways........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When shopping at Sim Lim Square, here are some tips.<br><br>1) Know what you want to buy. Best if you do your research in retail outlets first, check out the internet on official website of the manufacturers.<br><br>2) Know the full retail price of the products.  Here are some tips...<br><br>digicam you usually can only get 10-15% cheaper in Sim Lim. Someone offering you any lower than that, be suspicious.<br><br>e.g. Retail for $290 A430... the best you can get is around $265 (WITH Canon promotional items).<br><br>3) You can't get huge discounts on Compact digicam under $500. Retailers themselves have little to earn on. Hence that why certain stores try to con you into buying their "warranty", "batteries". Bottomline is, you can get cheaper price for the same thing SLS but don't expect prices to be 30% or more lower.<br><br>4) Boxes of these cameras will usually put what items you will receive in the box. So you CHECK the items you are receiving with the items listed on the box.<br>CHECK you receive ORIGINAL batteries, adaptors, len caps, straps, etc.<br><br>5) Before buying, look in newspapers to see if there is any promotional items included.<br><br>6) Buy from ACCREDITED dealers. Go to official manufacturer websites to find out who official dealers are in SLS.<br><br>7) CHECK and RECHECK stamp on warranty cards.<br>a) Check that the warranty card is issued by the Singapore arm of the manufacturer (Canon Singapore Pte Ltd, Nikon Singapore Pte Ltd, etc etc)<br><br>b) CHECK that the warranty is UNSTAMPED by the dealer before you buy. If they are stamped by another dealer other than the shop you are buying from, it means the dealer is not an official agent and bought its supply from another shop in SLS.<br><br>c) Look clearly on the warranty card, CHECK there is no stamps like "REDEEMED" or "CLAIMED". This is to make sure that the promotional items are not claimed by the shop before you buy it.<br><br>d) Make sure when they stamp the warranty card, it is their shop's name. The manufacturer only issues warranty cards to shops who are their agents.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Do not rush into buying. Go to the "reputable" shops in SLS. Even in reputable shops in SLS you should be wary there are salesmen who will act independantly of the shops.<br><br>9) I reiterate, do your research into what you want to buy. Don't let the SLS ppl tell you what you should buy.</div>
