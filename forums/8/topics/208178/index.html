            <div class='col-md body'>some advice when shopping at sim lim square.<br><br>First time buyers at SLS beware! esp. when buying cameras and accessories from those level 1 shops. Usually they will give you an overpriced quote when you ask them for the price of an item. The trick is to tell them "thank you. I will take a look around." This is prompt them to give you a lower price. Then try to bargain somemore.<br><br>I was at sim lim sq yesterday shopping for a video camera battery. I entered a shop and the guy quoted me $65 for a battery. I said no thanks and that chap told me "what about 40?" I said no thanks again as it was the first shop I entered and I intend to check out the prices of other shops as well but finally the guy quoted me $35 for the same battery he wanted to sell me for 65.<br><br>This made me very curious and suspicious. I went to another shop and asked for the same thing. That chap took out a battery and quoted me $60. I rejected and he offered $38 finally.<br><br>So be careful if you're buying electronics stuff from the 1st and 2nd level shops. Those computer shops at the 3rd and 4th level should be more reliable as their prices are mostly fixed and displayed.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>anyway, when I was buying a mini DV video cam from SLS a while ago, another incident happened. I told that person I am choosing a below 1000 camcorder and I pointed to the panasonic camcorder and the person gave me a rather low price and i thought that was cheap. that guy brought me into the shop took out calculator, tested the stuff and collected money from me. After that, he said "i think this camera not very good" and he showed me another video cam (which I think will be more profitable if he sells me that) and persuaded me to buy the video cam at a little bit more (he has collected money from me earlier on, but had not issued any receipt) at the same time telling me how lousy the panasonic camcorder is.<br><br>He kept insisting that I take the other camcorder and even lowered the price even though I persisted on the panasonic one. I finally told him to give me back my money in an angry tone but he still tried to persuade me. Finally he gave me back my money in a very boi song manner and I went to PC fair to buy canon instead.<br><br>Another thing is try not to use nets or credit card at SLS in case the same incident as above happen where I used cash instead. Usually the person will ask you whether you want to use nets or cash at an early stage of the buying process. AND NEVER PASS THAT GUY MONEY UNTIL HE IS ABT TO ISSUE RECEIPT. But sometimes that guy acts as if he's abt to issue receipt(like my case) and collect money from you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree that there are some unscrupulous dealers at Sim Lim.<br><br>Once I wanted to buy a Canon Powershot A430 from a shop. The recommended selling price from Canon was $299 (with 512MB SD card), while the shopkeeper quoted just $220. But then, I got suspicious of the low price.<br><br>Me: 'What's the warranty length?'<br><br>Shopkeeper: 'No warranty. You want, must pay $30!'<br><br>Me: 'Oh... then is there any memory card to go with it?'<br><br>Shopkeeper: 'No dun have.... you want 512MB, must pay $40!'<br><br>Then that's a total of 220 + 30 + 40 = $290. So what's the diff?!?!<br><br>I told him straight in the face: 'NO DEAL'. As I was leaving the shop, he kept cursing and shouting at how I was missing out on such a 'good deal'.<br><br>I walked into another shop. This time, they were selling the exact same camera for $240 - but with the warranty and 512 MB card thrown in. Heck, when he saw that I was a student, he said: 'Ok lah... since you're local, and you're still studying, I will give you the whole set for $220. Can?'<br><br>So my word of advice:  As dumb as it may sound, please ask for things like memory cards and warranty when you buy a camera. Ask to try out the camera to make sure it isn't defective.<br><br>That freakin' first shopkeeper nearly screwed me of $70.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
