            <div class='col-md body'>If you were married, you needn't be worried about buying condoms.<br><br>So were you having sex before you got married? I think many of us take this far too lightly. There isn't a doubt that sex is more than just reproduction. There's a certain bond that is supposed to be there when you have sex, unless you suppressed your conscience by sleeping around too many times and/or listening to decadent pop stars and societies telling you otherwise.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, I have no problems buying condoms off the shelf anywhere.  If ur going to sleep around, the least u can do is protect urself and ur partner.<br><br>I find the attitudes of the aunties and everyone else who give people this "look" offensive and closed minded.  They are from a different generation than we are.<br><br>For grail, I know that this is ur own belief that people should be married before they have sex and ur belief that these aunties hold the keys and all the answers to our values.<br><br>If u really believe that, then every girl is  being shameless for whatever they wear everyday.  Unless they wear clothing that completely covers all parts of their body, then they're showing poeople that ur loose.  Am I not right?<br><br>Have u ever seen urself naked in the mirror before? or ever seen any kind of porn? If yes, then ur going to hell and society should shunn u and give u the silent trestment for as long as u r alive...<br><br>The belief that our ancestors and older generations hold the keys to our values and virtues is eronous.  If it was like that, then every generation, since man became civilised, should follow all the values and virtuous sets defined by their parents.  Every generation should theoretically follow these values/virtues or else they're being shameless sluts with low morals.<br><br>The reality is that every generation changes it's ideas.  The change of ideas will bring a change of value.  It's obvious that ur values aren't the same as ur ancient ancestors.  It's no excuse that just because the whole society of girls in todays world thinks and dresses like they do, u can do the same.  If u really believe and have the conviction of what u say, then any girl who end up with u should be bounding their feet, no matter how painful or inconvenient. they shouldn't be working or studying either or else they have betrayed all that their ancestors have lived and worked for...aren't u afraid of betraying ur ancestors spirits?<br><br>I don't mean to attack u in anyway...Sorry if it sounds like it.  I just wanted to point out and give some examples of the possible error in ur logic.<br><br>I totally have little respect for older people who have no respect for the younger generation.<br><br>I once went to look for a bra for my girlfriend that she didn't have time to buy.  I wanted to buy it for her as a surprise...Just a bra for christs sake..:-(<br><br>The auntie working there stared at me with that way of looking when u know that they disapprove of u touching womens things...etc, etc...  She gave me a really dirty look, but I just went about my business trying to find the bra.  Then, i found it...happy!  I was about to go and pay for it when that same auntie briskly walked over to me and snatched it from my hand rudely and violently and started to fold the bra up again.  then she gave me that dirty look and curled her lips up and snarled Yes!  Can I help you!?!!!  I just looked at her with disgust and walked away very pissed off.<br><br>it was at Seiyu, Parkway Parade.  Was it in my imagination?  No it wasn't...period..:-(<br><br>Then this other time at my block....<br>There's this Indian family that, for some reason, is always moving their luggage back and forth from their apartment on the same floor as mine and to somewhere else.  Then they'd move it back...  At first I was really friendly with them and used to help them everytime I saw them moving their things in and out of the lift.  I helped them.<br><br>Then one day as I wore my singlet.  the father started to question me about my tattoo(It's a star, not some dragon...) He then started to tell me that only gangsters have tattoos and shit like that. Then from that day forward, they wouldn't even let me enter the same lift as them. Every time they see me walking to the lift, they'' say,"no room, no room...u wait after us..."  and there were  only 2 people inside the lift.  after that day, I never helped them again.<br><br>ANGRY AS HELL....If these are the people that hold the key to my values and virtues, I decide that I'd rather go to hell than have them judge me by standards that they themselves most probably broke in some way or the other...<br><br>ANGRY!!!!!!  Just to let people know.  My parents didn't teach me this...neither did any friends or society.  This is a belief that I feel for from my own observation and experiences of the world around me...So if u slam me for my views, just know that it's all me and noone else that's talking....<br><br>And to all u guys and girls,  if ur going to do something, make sure that u do protect urself...no matter what people say or how they look at u.<br><br>again, Apologies to Grail if I sounded like I was attacking u.  I see that some people have  different values and virtues, but I hope that u also can see where I'm going with this....<br><br>Cheers<br><br>[This message has been edited by firewire (edited 28 October 1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firewire,<br><br>I really admire you with your long letter, no, I am not saying it's long winded.<br><br>But something I have to disagree with you. Sad that you have such bad experience from some elderly aunties and uncles. But truth is, our ancester DO have some wisdom in their experience during their time, and those wisdom will not and should not fade with time, or generation. Just a matter of looking at it in another angle, and filter away those that are no longer appropriate now.<br><br>The auntie had demonstrated that she is from a extremely conservative society and background that she couldn't accept female things to be touch by a male. At that time, that was wrong, but not now. Being a young and educated person from an open country like USA (did I mix you up with someone else? If so, sorry for that), if you can accept things that are not YOU, why can't you accept this auntie's mentality. I think that you anger should be towards her "rude-ness" rather than her conservative-ness.<br><br>That goes for the uncle ... he should feel shameful for his behaviour, for treating you like that after all your help for them.<br><br>Grail,<br><br>Getting married is not just getting married. There are lot of issues and considerations and many other constraints that bring two people together, or separate them apart.<br><br>And even married couples need condoms, for birth control, just in case you didn't know about that.<br><br>As for the auntie in 7-11, she just can't take that, and probably proud of herself for not changing that. In another word, stubborn.<br><br>So Dangerguy, if you are doing something with a reason, then just do it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How true ur words are.  Sometimes, anger can blind even the most accepting of minds.  The conservative people are ok.  They have a belief that they live by and so does everyone else...but I always believed that u should always treat every person u meet or see as an individual.  When u meet someone, u shouldn't automatically judge them by the standards u set for ur own values/virtues.<br><br>When I meet people, I always give them the beneift of the doubt...always.  I don't judge them by my standards until I get to know their character/personality better, then u have something to work with.  But when u have no idea at all, then I perosnally find it difficult to accept...<br><br>It is a bit idealistic, but I try and live by that idea anyway....but u r right nonetheless.  i seem to have that little hypocritical streak in me...:-) everyone has it....in small quantities.  right?<br><br>"No army can withstand an idea whose time has come."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You've brought up a good point. The whole idea of being liberal, or "less-conservative", is that we accept new ideas, and that we not close our minds to things that are different. And thus, even a conservative view-point must be carefully scrutinised and judged, and perhaps accepted.<br><br>Unfortunately, this does not work both ways. Most conservative view-points, by their very definition or philosophy, preclude the acceptance of other ideas. And so it becomes a case of you accepting them, but they not doing likewise.<br><br>Additionally, while traditions and ancestral anecdotes handed down from generations before will most certainly have their merits, one cannot simply take them wholesale and hold them up as the great wisdoms of time immemorial.<br><br>The tricky part of being a good "liberal" (I hate that word) is not only to accept new ideas, but to analyse them, digest them, judge them on their merits, and discard the ones that do not stand the test of time.<br><br>One must think, and not follow blindly, lest we follow in the tradition of the Salem Witch Hunts, the Spanish Inquisition, the enslaving of the African peoples, or the Holy Crusades.<br><br>------------------<br>Cya,<br>Praetor<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, its long been know that putting the condom in the wallet for prologed periods might actually cause it to degenerate and possibily even break during use.<br><br>So unless you're like my friend, who uses it up before the week, I really wouldn't recommend it at all man (of course if you change it regularly then no problem lah) But then again if you change it regularly, means you have to constantly buy fresh ones.<br><br>But I guess one of the most discreet (and my favourite) is to order it off the net. Pretty cool, delivered in a plain brown envelope  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. No need to pai seh.<br><br>But then again, I guess some girls actually do take the initiative to carry condoms in their purses when you go out with them. (Man talk about getting lucky boy)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Such are the conservative attitudes of the older generation of Singaporeans.<br><br>Take the very 'hip' centre parting of hair which was 'introduced' (well, partly) by Aaron Kwok in the late 80s and early 90s.<br><br>Most guyz started to comb their hair tat way, I am no exception. Frm my old style of 'guai-guai' side parting, I changed the parting.<br><br>Well, my dad didn't approve of it. He said tat only those Chao Bengz, Pai Kias and Hooliganz sport this sorta hairstyle. He even cited one example whereby, in his workplace, his Boss condemned one worker cos of his hairstyle.<br><br>Well, I ignored tat and till now, I still sport tat centre parting. Everyone got used to it and the novelty of 'centre-parting' hairstyle faded. Now everyone sports this hairdo.<br><br>Hahaha... Shao Jian Duo Guai. Duo jian jiu bu guai!</div>
