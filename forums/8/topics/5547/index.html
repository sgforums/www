Sure, there're bound to be differences, but it's only thru' discussions that there'll be hope of resolution.<br><br>It's sad to find some people having such negative attitude towards relationship, cos' they fail to understand that every failed relationship is a lesson learnt, so that each party will know what to look out for in his/her next relationship.<br><br>Gender does not matter, we're all humans afterall...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not that people have negative attitudes about relationships, but I feel that most are just afraid to get hurt.<br><br>Ok so call me a business student, but it's based on a CBA (Cost Benefit Analysis)...if the person thinks that having a relationship has benefits that outweigh the costs, then he /she will actively pursue one. This also pertains, by the way, to the concept of self-maximisation. Everyone wants the best for themselves but some are not willing to bear the costs to incur them.<br><br>At the expense of this sounding like some business analysis, let me just conclude that most people desire relationships, but it's just that other extraneous factors prevent them from doing so. What these factors are is up to everyone to speculate....any takers ??<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Musicwhiz: CBA? If love's about giving and NOT taking at all, then what's the point? It was doomed to failure (or some degree of misery).<br><br>You certainly can't go in thinking "What's in this for ME?" Because if you both do that, you're going to get together, expect something good from the other person, find out that she's not giving it (because she's after the same thing from you), make yourselves miserable in that failure, and go off again, looking for ANOTHER realtinship with the premise of "What's in it for ME?"<br><br>CBA shouldn't figure into the equation at all.<br><br>And that factor you're looking for?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually i think gambler might be right. The cost of living in singapore is not cheap.<br><br>Consider this, once u get married, if you don't stay with the parents, u have to be able to cough up the HDB flat deposit, get worried about paying the house installments.<br><br>And if you have children start saving up for their education.<br><br>Maybe if you own a car, have to finance the car loan also.<br><br>Before having children is where the honeymoon years are, when there really is no heavy responsibilty to think about, but once you do bring another generation into the world, there are problems that can really strain both parties out.<br><br>Lemme state for a fact that I am not against marriage, in fact I do long for the day where I would take a walk in the park with wife in hand and cuddling my children in my arms, the only thing is that the parties involved have to be willing to take that responsibility that comes with it.</div>
