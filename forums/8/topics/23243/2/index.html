Been fun bashing you in the other forum topic, just that I was getting bored with you due to your extremely low level brain activity you have been exhibiting.<br><br>Told you almost everyone hated you. Tsk tsk. Betcha you still stay up in the middle of night pondering what to reply to others. Hahaha.<br><br>BTW, where was the final showdown with your lover you promised? I am still waiting. Or has it frizzle out due to no one's interest in your grandma story?<br><br>Oh, well, all is going accordingly to plan. And your days are probably numbered. So in the mean time, perhaps it is time for you to go back to your cess pool and reflect.<br><br>Sayonara. Kudos to the moderators. Keep an eye out for this psychopath. So in the meantime, everyone stay happy except informer. Remember to check your corners, informer. Who knows, some of you old ghosts might come back and haunt you.</div>

You mean that the moderators reply because they are being nice or because they have something to say ? And the don't like it here, get out mentality is whats wrong with Singapore today also. Instead of staying back and trying to correct any faults, many just take the easy way out and leave. Are you saying that SGFORUMS only wants people who will say what SGFORUMS wants to hear. You can't be serious right.. how can that be a forum then. I really don't mind Informer saying all those things actually...in fact, he was quite entertaining in ICERED..until he started posting details. I am sure you felt that way too... or don't you. And I agree, I can place my vote my not participating in the discussion..and I really don't see how saying only what the moderators want to hear is good..<br><br><strong>come to think of it, it seems like you are the one with a vendetta against informer. do keep in mind you're only playing this game with him because he -lets- you. he could have easily changed his nick and you would have no clue as to who he really is, no? </strong><br><br>Actually that not entirely true...he can change his nick to whatever he wants but his true character always surfaces..he has done that in other forums before and he is easily picked out from the crowd.. not by me only but by everyone else as well..<br><br>I am glad that you have such a forgiving heart, the problem is, I wonder if you would feel the same if you were the target of his tirade..and before I get accused of being SC again.. I am not. Who hasn't been dumped..but who actually goes on a wild rampage as well...<br><br>Think about it..<br><br></div>

FireIce may be the moderator here, but I think abit of courtesy is still good to have.</blockquote>i did note that you mentioned over and over again that you think informer should be banned, though fireice kept saying she knows what she's doing and that she'll ban him if she sees fit. if that's not being pushy, what is?<br><br>everytime he posted something since he was told to stop posting replies about the SC thing, all i saw was that he was adherring to the rules of the forums and was heeding the advice of the various moderators.<br><br><blockquote>This is a very unusual response. You mean that the moderators reply because they are being nice or because they have something to say ? And the don't like it here, get out mentality is whats wrong with Singapore today also. Instead of staying back and trying to correct any faults, many just take the easy way out and leave. Are you saying that SGFORUMS only wants people who will say what SGFORUMS wants to hear. You can't be serious right.. how can that be a forum then. I really don't mind Informer saying all those things actually...in fact, he was quite entertaining in ICERED..until he started posting details. I am sure you felt that way too... or don't you. And I agree, I can place my vote my not participating in the discussion..and I really don't see how saying only what the moderators want to hear is good..</blockquote>no what i mean is that you should know your place as a non-moderator, and not try to play the role of one. this is in relation to you being pushy about getting informer banned, and not being able to take no for an answer.<br><br>i never meant to imply that i support the current singaporeon practice of stifling free speech or new ideas. as to how i feel about what i posted, its irrelevant here but lets just say i try to keep an open mind about what he had to say.<br><br><blockquote>Actually that not entirely true...he can change his nick to whatever he wants but his true character always surfaces..he has done that in other forums before and he is easily picked out from the crowd.. not by me only but by everyone else as well..</blockquote>well, he didn't change his nick here in sgForums so what he did in other forums doesn't really apply here.<br><br><blockquote>I am glad that you have such a forgiving heart, the problem is, I wonder if you would feel the same if you were the target of his tirade..and before I get accused of being SC again.. I am not. Who hasn't been dumped..but who actually goes on a wild rampage as well...</blockquote>if i was a target of his tirade, no doubt i would harbour ill feelings against him but i would leave it up to the discression of the moderators to do as they see fit. in this case, i don't think adopting a "wait and see" approach is wrong.<br><br>in any case, if he does subsequently violate any of the rules set forth, he will be banned as promised by the admins/moderators.</div>
