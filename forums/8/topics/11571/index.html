            <div class='col-md body'>My strange encounter at OBS was at the main jetty .We were the bunkies (not mobile ,sadly so =(  ). And we had RnR ard 11pm so my friends went to the jetty for some fishing(Sneaked my rod inside hehehe)<br>When we reached the jetty, We saw whar supposed to be a black figure of a man sitting on the break water.We thought it was one of our instructors and walked towards his direction .<br>The whole freaking place was deemly lit,when we reached there. "He" was gone, anyway we thought that maybe he heard our footsteps and moved somewhere else.hmmmmmm..... nevermind so we turned back headed for the main jetty.But when we turned our heads,we saw "Him" again sitting on the steps of the jetty but now with another person!!! It's was only like few seconds lapse and he could travel that quick!? We were totally freaked out and headed back to our bunkers.<br>Strange but true =(<br></div>
