            <div class='col-md body'>My services for both phone numbers have been disrupted recently. Upon calling 1627 and speaking with the manager who could only refer to herself as Rose, she advised that I should pay up to $300 right away in order for services to be restored. I have been with M1 for almost 8 years now and I have never encountered a more uncompromising customer service office before. I told her that an amount of $100 will be paid over this weekend and the remaining to be paid over at the end of the month. I am counted upon by my ailing grandfather whom I can call regularly to check if he needs any help, this disruption of services has caused so much inconvenience for my family. ALL BECAUSE M1 cant wait 1 mth for me to pay the $200!!!<br><br>(Please read on to check how they overcharge me on the previous plan and does not list incoming and outgoing airtime so that customers are not aware of that there are better plans for them and continues to overpay to M1.)<br><br>Rose insisted on having the payment of $300 right away to have services restored.<br><br>Is this how you reward your loyal customers???<br><br>On a separate incident, when I return from Australia, I came to Paragaon M1 to be advised on the plan which I should be switching to. The CSO said that M1 will be monitoring my incoming and outgoing calls fer the next month and advise me on the best plan. 3 mths went past before I had to go to M1 at paragon because I felt I was overpaying but the bill does not reflect the amount of incoming/outgoing airtime used. Only after making the enquires did I find out that I had been overpaying ($100 to $200/mth) because there is a plan more suited for my call pattern. But I wasnt informed by M1 as promised, nor did the bill reflected my call usage. Everyone out there with M1 please go check your usage pattern.<br><br>DUN OVERPAY LIKE WHAT I DID!!! M1 does not have the customer service for that.<br><br>M1 has let me down after 8 long years, and I will do my utmost to ensure that my associates and people around me will get to know that this company cannot be relied on to provide honesty, reliability and good service. I will advice them to switch carriers to Starhub or Singtel which I heard provides better services and value for money for their plans.<br><br>I perused this complaint over and realised that I repeated my points a few times. Thats how much anger I have and will be pasting this complaint in every forum in print or on the web to let the public know that M1's services cannot be relied on for loyalty.<br><br>Please, anyone who thinks that he or she is paying too much for your plan, please go and check cos M1 will not do it for you. They'd rather you keep paying them more and more..<br><br>In Angst...<br></div>

I've seen M1 usage plan leaflets at many mobile phone outlets. The service staff are usually able to help explain the packages if you aren't sure which is best for you.<br><br>M1 used to be more inflexible with monthly bill payments, at least they give alittle grace period now.
