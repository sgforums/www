            <div class='col-md body'>If you have defaulted on &gt;300 bucks of bills, then surely M1 has the right to pull the plug until you pay up.<br><br>Alternatively, they could cut your line completely after 3-4 warning letters. Then you have to pay another activation fee to re-start again. How would you feel then?<br><br>On the other hand, if you have been a regular customer who pays the bills on time, you can ask under special circumstances to hold payment for 1-2 months, especially if you have a clean track record.<br><br></div>
