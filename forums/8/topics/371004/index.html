              <h1>MSN poll: only 18% of Singaporeans will celebrate National Day</h1>
              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>In an online poll conducted by MSN (Singapore), only 18% of the
              respondents indicated they will go to a parade to celebrate National
              Day on 9th August 2009. (source: <a href="http://www.sg.msn.com/">MSN</a>)</p>
              <p>28% of those poll will prefer to stay at home to play manjong while
              26% will leave the country for a quick holiday, with the most likely
              destination being Malaysia just across the Causeway:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/themes/church_10/images/thumbnails/msnpoll.jpg" alt="" width="417" height="253"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This year’s National Day is on a Sunday which means that the following Monday will automatically be a public holiday.</p>
              <p>The government has embarked on a drive to beef up the National Day
              spirit by hanging flags, banners and other decorations along the roads,
              public places like the markets and community centers as well as
              institutions such as schools and neighborhood police stations.</p>
              <p>The mainstream media also tries to create a buzz with non-stop
              updates about the parade previews, speeches of ministers and the usual
              timely reminder of the “arduous journey” Singapore has been through
              since achieving independence 44 years ago.</p>
              <p>In spite of the publicity blitz in the local media and the
              relentless efforts of the government to instill a sense of patriotism
              in its people, most Singaporeans are nonchalant about National Day.</p>
              <p>To many, as the polls have shown, it is simply an extended holiday
              to be spent with family and friends. Even amongst those who attend the
              National Day parade, they are there to watch the performance rather
              than to “celebrate” the day with the country’s top leaders.</p>
              <p>Young Singaporeans born after 1965 have no bitter memories or
              experiences of the tumultuous events leading to the nation’s birth.</p>
              <p>Singapore was wrecked by a communist uprising, communal riots, and
              fractious internal politics in the pre-independence years including the
              traumatic 2 years under the Malaysian Federation from 1963 to 1965 when
              it was eventually ejected by then Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul
              Rahman.</p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans are politically apathetic and ignorant after 40
              years of continuous one-party rule. Many do not even know the
              identities of their MPs.</p>
              <p>“National Day” is soon becoming a farce with less than one-fifth of
              the population celebrating it on the island and more than a quarter
              choosing to spend the day elsewhere.</p>

              <h1>An amusing paradox: hanging national flags in HDB estates</h1>
              <p>August 2, 2009 by admin  </p>
              <p><strong>From our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>Every year as 9 August approaches, the grassroots machinery of the
              ruling party will move into high gear to decorate their respective
              neighborhoods with the national flags.</p>
              <p>Extra workers will be employed to hang the flags along the roads, on
              the decks of multi-storey car parks, at the markets, shops, schools and
              at every visible corner of the estate. Of late, banners depicting
              photos of PAP MPs “celebrating” National Day with the residents hung on
              roadside lamps are ubiquitous throughout the island. <em>(has anybody
              wondered how much taxpayers’ money has been spent on these ostentatious
              displays of “patriotism” to ‘celebrate’ national day?)</em></p>
              <p>Grassroots volunteers will come knocking on every household urging
              them to hang the national flag at their balconies. The community clubs,
              schools, government buildings will be completely awashed with the
              national colors of white and red.</p>
              <p>The mainstream media will trumpet the achievements of leaders of the
              ruling party ad nauseum, remind Singaporeans of the “long” way we have
              since independence and to get the nation into a celebratory mood with
              daily coverage of the national day parade previews.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the few people who seem to be ‘excited’ about National
              Day are those from the ruling party and its auxillaries. For ordinary
              Singaporeans in the streets, it is simply another public holiday and
              for some, a family trip up north to Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Malaysia celebrates its national day three weeks after Singapore’s
              on 31st August and the difference cannot be more obvious. You will see
              many families displaying the Malaysian flag proudly outside their
              homes, on the roof of their cars, along the roads and at the stalls.
              The outpouring of national pride and joy is spontaneous and not
              orchestrated.</p>
              <p>If the degree of patriotism can be judged solely by the number of
              flags displayed by citizens, then a majority of us will be
              “unpatriotic”. Just take a look around your neighborhood and you will
              not fail to realize that you can count the number of flags hung per HDB
              block with two hands. There are hardly any flags seen hanging outside
              the units of condominiums.</p>
              <p>Some argued that Singaporeans are shy people who seldom reveal their
              love for the nation openly. Others attribute it to a gradual erosion of
              civic consciousness and sense of belonging to the country.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s demographics has changed radically in the last decade
              with the unremitting influx of foreigners which now made up one third
              of the population, a quarter of which are PRs. How many of them will
              take up Singapore citizenship? Are they truly loyal to Singapore or are
              they merely making use of it as a springboard for greener pastures
              elsewhere?</p>
              <p>The continued political hegemony of the ruling party and exclusion
              of ordinary citizens from participation in nation-building has led to
              widespread public apathy and indifference with deepening rifts between
              the ruling elite and the people. Are we really celebrating 44 years of
              nationhood or 50 years of PAP rule? (The PAP started ruling Singapore
              effectively in 1959 when they won 43 out of 51 seats in the Legco
              elections.)</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With each passing year, the number of flags being displayed by
              Singaporeans outside their homes are getting less and less. </strong></span></span> Patriotism
              cannot be instilled overnight by the government, grassroots
              organizations or mainstream media. It is spontaneous feeling of pride
              and joy emanating from a deep sense of connection with the land of
              one’s birth.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We started out as a nation of immigrants and now we are being
              flooded by new migrants. The British colonial government is replaced by
              another nanny state run by a small exclusive group of elites
              disconnected with the suffering of the masses. Singapore is still far
              away from attaining real nationhood.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>As we can see from the photos, the multi-storey carpark is
              completely decorated with the Singapore flags which is obviously the
              work of grassroots volunteers.</p>
              <p>In stark contrast, the HDB blocks in the vicinity of the car park has few flags hung.</p>

Somehow or rather they have worked hard for the nation through different ways, like studying to ensure singapore's future talent pool or to work and contribute to the economy.</p>
              <p>NDP is not about how many flags put up, its about how the citizens are rewarded.</p>
              <p>The NDP is not used to thank PAP, its used as a stage, to help Singaporeans celebrate their achievement. Its precisely why our NDPs are so "family-oriented" compared to the communists'.</p>
              <p> True patriotism can only be displayed during times of hardship. Not in times of celebrations. I don't give a fuck when the Msians display their flag, no one gives a damn really.</p>
              <p>If you can turn such a simple and joyous event to make it look as if Singaporeans are not patriotic, nice try. Nice try trying to make people hate PAP too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Get your dick sucked fucker. Time to get that little baby turtle out of it's shell and look at things from multiple perspectives, no matter how short it is.</p>
