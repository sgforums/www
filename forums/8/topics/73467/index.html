            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.talkingcock.com/html/images/stories/SecretLee.jpg"><br><br>by Pak Cham Kai<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed during the Budget debates last week that he is a Â“mystery customer auditorÂ” for civil service online services, i.e. that he goes online to pose as a random customer in order to keep civil servants on their toes.<br><br>However, people are suspecting that the extent of DPM LeeÂ’s online masquerades may be greater than he has let on.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m pretty sure that was DPM Lee lurking in my chatroom last night,Â” said Mr. Teo Pak Leow, who moderates a chatroom on sexual topics. <strong>Â“He was this guy who didnÂ’t type anything for a really long time, and then when the conversation strayed to S&amp;M, he suddenly burst in and asked if there was anyone who got turned on by being slapped. </strong>Everyone immeelly siam the room.Â”<br><br>Â“Lan eh,Â” said Mr. Sam Leong, the head of SammyboyÂ’s Al Fresco Coffee Shop. Â“I suspect that he regularly posts on the message boards. I think I know who it is. ThereÂ’s this guy whoÂ’s always calling Singapore Â‘sillyporeÂ’ and making all these veiled references to the MIW, you know, the Men in WhiteÂ… Maybe itÂ’s a place he feels he can vent his true feelings about the country. Or maybe heÂ’s just trying to provoke others into slamming the Gahmen so he can go and whack them.Â”<br><br>TalkingCock.com editor Supreme Cock also believes that some articles may have been posted by the Deputy Prime Minister under a poultry-related nom de plume. Â“You know, at one point there was this influx of photoshopped pictures of BG Lee. We kept wondering, how did the artist get so many different pics of BG Lee? He must have connections to some secret archive. We also note that a number of photos depict BG Lee as having this solid body, with abs that look like durian biji. There was also this animated gif showing him with a really huge schlong. Wah lan, maybe heÂ’s actually writing all the Secret Diary of the Dragon Prince columns! Basket, I think weÂ’ve been infiltrated!Â”<br><br>When asked if there was any concrete evidence beyond mere suspicions, however, the three online respondees merely replied, LOL, LOL, LOL with the occasional ROFL.<br><br>DPM LeeÂ’s lurking has certainly ruffled feathers in the civil service. TalkingCock gathered several civil service customer officers at a kopi tiam to poll their views.<br><br>Â“Chia lat,Â” said Ministry of Manpower helpline operator Mr. Theah Kao Peh, Â“We all now damn scared the person calling is actually DPM Lee. We so scared until dun dare go toilet, in case he call and no operator answer. But then, if itÂ’s him, we also scared we hear him only will pee in our pants. Both ways also die.Â”<br><br>Â“Eh,Â” said Mrs. Chin Ah Kia, a customer officer for the CPF Board. Â“<strong>The other day I got this call, hor, and the person didnÂ’t say anything, just breathe-breathe-breathe very heavily. You think itÂ’s BG Lee, meh?Â”</strong><br><br>Â“Maybe,Â” said Mr. See Suah Kong, who works for Singapore Immigration. Â“<strong>HeÂ’s very atas, one. And I hear that the air at very high altitudes is very thin, so maybe he has difficulty breathing.Â”<br></strong><br>Â“Then, hor,Â” Mrs. Chin continued. Â“Got another time someone ask me what IÂ’m wearing, leh. You think itÂ’s him also?Â”<br><br>Â“Aiyah, dun scared, lah,Â” said Mr. Theah. Â“As long as you tell him youÂ’re wearing all white can oreddy.Â”<br><br>Meanwhile, the Deputy Prime MinisterÂ’s Office has denied all the rumours of DPM Lee lurking around the Internet. Said a spokesman, Â“The rumours are completely baseless and out of touch with reality. <strong>ItÂ’s not like Singapore has a culture of maintaining covert surveillance on its people.Â”<br></strong><br>Â© http://www.TalkingCock.com 2001-2003.
