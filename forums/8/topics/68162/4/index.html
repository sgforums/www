One thing Sydney had different to the other cities was a higher crime rate, and it's climate. It's level of humidity was worse than Melbourne's."<br><br>Victorian Tourism Minister John Pandazopoulos said the award was based on a survey of a city's infrastructure, access, education levels, crime rate, focus on the environment, culture and events, its diversity and how connected it was with the rest of the world.<br><br>Mr Pandazopoulos said even Melbourne's weather rated better than Sydney's.<br><br>"It's a brilliant pat on the back for Melbourne, particularly for two years in a row," he said.<br><br>"We already promote ourselves as the world's most liveable city, we can continue doing that."<br><br>Mr Pandazopoulos said the award backed Victoria's record as the only Australian state in which international visitor rates grew for the past two years.<br><br>He said Melbourne was also a very affordable city, where people got value for money for great products, including top fashion and restaurants.<br><br>He said the government would continue to work hard to meet the balance of stimulating a vibrant economy and social standards to ensure Melbourne remained one of the world's best cities.<br><br>The London-based EIU assessed the level of hardship for expatriates in the 130 cities, using 12 factors including housing, education, recreational activities, health, climate and terrorism.<br><br>Cities were rated one to five in the 12 categories, with one meaning there was no hardship and five indicating extreme hardship.<br><br>Melbourne received the perfect one in each category, including its unpredictable weather, to give it an overall score of one.<br><br>The other Australian cities were all given a two for climate, while Adelaide also received two for housing, Brisbane and Perth scored two for transport and Sydney for its crime.

Besides, getting grease under them nails is therapeutic.  All I want for Christmas is an arc welder and an engine hoist!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yeah, Laksa King is good mindless food.  I used to stop by for dinner all the time because it was on the way home from work.  Oh, and Seddon?  Most Melbournians haven't heard of it - it's a sliver of a suburb between Footscray and Yarraville.  Have you ever been to the Gravy Train?  That's where Seddon is.<br><br>Broadmeadows lines?  I don't know which is worse - the thugs they call passengers or the shaved apes hired by M-Train.  I drive all over the place myself.  The city's OK for Chinese food - Singapore Kopitiam on Russell Street is about the only place you can get something resembling real chicken rice.  I like Victoria Street as well - Minh Tan is good if you've got a couple of people together for dinner, and while Mekong is good, I prefer the Vietnamese beef noodles at Phoung (at least that's what I think it's called) - it's just down the street from the clock tower.  For Japanese, though, it's got to be Izakaya Chuji - I'm not loaded enough to go to Gu on a regular basis!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

HAhaha.. there's now Num Long 2 along the side lane at the Westpac Bank on Lt Bourke.<br><br>The shanghai place is called Shanghai Dumpling. And it's at the end of the second or first lane if you're walking from Swanston towards Spring on the left. I think the lane is called Tattersalls Lane. It used to look dodgy but they have renovated it recently. Be prepared for bad service and annoying habit of sticking strangers on the same table. There are two dumpling restaurant on that lane. It is one closer to Lonsdale St that is better.<br><br>Hmm.. with fish n chips.. just going to your local fish n chippery is cheaper and probably better. It's like $10 for two people at my joint. Don't forget the potato cakes. Hmm.. yum</div>
