On Dawson St, which becomes Puckle in Moonee Once.. like long ago. Now i'm In kensington. Even though i work in Chadstone, there's no way i will live in "the other side of the yarra". Westies is so dodgy but great, down to earth!!<br><br>I didn't have trouble with student visa, c'mon these guys know that we spend lots of money here. And education is their biggest export.. up there with dairy. ahahha.<br><br>man.. you got ripped off. I did it myself so i only paid for application -&gt; which killed me $1,700+, medical, police checks.. I think i spent $2,500.. of my own money which killed me even more. At the same time i had to spend $1100 on my car to repair all those dents that people kicked in. It was more of a horrible time for me. I was trapped between grad visa and not being able to apply for perm roles cos i was afraid that i would be checked. But most of my friends don't even think that I grew up in Singapore. They presume that i've been here all my life.. which is lucky for me. Cos no one bothered to check my visa.<br><br>Anyway i've just got my PR in Sept.. waiting for two years to renew it! Where do you live now ??</div></blockquote>Right now I'm in Singapore for a year - got a couple of family matters to sort out.  However, coming 2005, I'll be nagging the pilot to firewall those goddamn engines all the way back to Melbourne.<br><br>My last place was at Evans Street, near Glenlyon road, and before that it was Davies Street - yeah, Brunny's a great neighbourhood - been there for 7 out of 10 years.<br><br>I went through skilled migration, and I got my approval in October.  I have to admit that it's nice to see the words "Permitted to stay in Australia indefinitely" at the bottom of the visa!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Yeah, Immigration Effie just had a real attitude problem.  Her supervisor was great, but by the time she came along, Effie had already canned my visa - it took me 3 months to restore it.<br><br>Yeah, the the application burned a big hole in my pocket (my own cash too), but, damn, I wasn't taking any chances after the Effie episode.<br><br>Besides, I do all the work on the car myself - saves a couple of grand every year in normal maintenance alone! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Kensington, huh?  I used to have lunch around there a lot - my office was in Seddon.  Hell, I used to walk into Laksa King and the staff would say "The usual?".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway, we have to catch up when I get back - I may pop by at some point this year, and if I do I'll be crashing at my girlfriend's place in Glen Huntly - Chaddie's just a stone's throw away from there.</div>
