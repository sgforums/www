Yeah I know about the costs - all up, I shelled out about $5600, although the lawyer was worth it.<br><br>Moonee Ponds, huh?  My last place was in Brunswick - IMHO that side of town is the best.  Once I get back, it's back to Brunswick for me -I'll have to see if I can get my girlfriend to move out of Glen Huntly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>For me, it's Melbourne itself rather than the independence that I love.  The people are great, there's live jazz and salsa aplenty and space for good weekend drives.<br><br>I can't say that I've ever had much trouble with discrimination - the moment I open my mouth I'm taken as a local.  The only time I ever felt discriminated against was when a Greek girl at the Immigration Department gave me a hard time about my student visa.  Go figure.</div>
