            <div class='col-md body'>today i had this sudden thought, i miss melb life very much. it just came out of the blue.<br>6 weeks after returning from Melbourne for my ITP,I dont seem to feel anything for singapore anymore. in other words, i dont like staying here for the rest of my life. i very much miss the life i had in melb (6weeks). I miss every moment of it, the cooking, buying of groceries in Safeway( name of a supermarket we always visit), swanston street (the street where the Uni and our apartment were located and many other shops), yarra river, crown casino, russell street, great ocean road, etc.<br>i miss the cooking, the climate, the culture,the lecturers taking us for the ITP,the fact that i had to make every cent count, wash yr own clothes, having to stay in a small apartment and sharing it with 2 other occupants which are complete strangers(same poly diff course) though eventually getting to know them well.<br><br>The fact that you are able to live well and independant of your parents where help is a 7hr journey away is nice. abit like you are in ctrl.<br><br>there are also other things i miss abt melb that i cant put into words or describe properly.<br><br>i miss the place there so much that i dont want to stay in sg and migrate there the moment i turn 21 or something.<br><br>if u ask me abt what i miss here, i would say nothing.<br>not that i dont like some ppl because of conflict but it's i dont miss sg as a whole. at the most i miss the food at home that's all.<br><br>in the last 2 days in melb, i dont seem to be eager to come home at all. in fact, i was slightly sad and i found the plane right home very uncomfortable and long. way longer than going there.<br><br>i just dont seem to miss singapore anymore.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
