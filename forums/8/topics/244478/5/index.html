Can you think of something that is cheaper compared to 10 years ago? Yr last sentence whom u refer to they, are u referrin to politicians? Well, its better for the government to expand their treasury as big as possible because in times of financial crisis, we will be better prepared for it. We dun want our economies to end up like those in south america, rite? if u think that some taxes will decrease when some taxes are increased, u are being wrong, or naive. In sg, everyone wants a car, so y decrease taxes on something that is popular? Well, if u dun want yr offset package, u can give them to me if u dun need $$$, lol.</div>

Maybe this will come at the next recession, to stimulate the economy.<br><br>GST, like capital gains tax, is designed to target the wealthy, non-working population - think retired baby-boomers. Our demographics is shifting in the coming decades (aging population) so the tax system must adjust to distribute the tax burden more evenly. Without GST, the tax burden would have to fall entirely on a smaller percentage of younger workers, resulting in higher income tax for them.<br><br>So who suffers most from GST? People who are retiring now without enough savings. Put simply, Singapore will not be a nice place for poor people who don't or can't work...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Who is to blame?
