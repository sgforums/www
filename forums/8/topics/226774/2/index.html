AMIP was initally set up to regulate pricing for a whole suite of modelling activities in order to prevent undercutting, which resulted in the rapid decrease in Modelling fees over the past few years.<br><br>However, after the inception of AMIP and the on going price wars between agencies who are not in AMIP and AMIP ones, I have these observations to make:<br><br>* AMIP currently regulate Editorials and Fashion show pricing among member agencies only, other modelling fees such as TVC, Print Ad etc are not under regulations as they just cant compete with those who dont follow the rules and regulations.<br><br>* The Singapore market has preference for Pan asians and Caucasians as compared to locals. Most clients will hire local models via special deals with agencies not within AMIP which gives them better value with the same quality. Moreover, there is a increasing trend to hire Freelance models/talents for flyers, promoters, events etc which is a further cost cutting measure deployed by most clients here. Therefore, if you are contracted to a AMIP agency, you might not even get enough jobs to sustain yourself if your forte is just Editorial or Fashion shows. A better option would be a non-contracted association with the top agencies but choose the one you wanna be wisely as you still need to demonstrate some exclusvitiy and loyalty.<br><br>* Some of the established top 8 agencies are not in AMIP and are apparently doing much better than those in AMIP with more market shares in certain segments of the modelling industry<br><br>* Most AMIP agencies will import Foreign models into Singapore. As such, a huge sum of money is spent on bringing them in and maintaining them while they are in Singapore. Hence, these agencies will give priority to promote these foreign models as compared to local ones, in order to recoup the amount of money spent.<br><br>Hope these will help the guys here to understand the modelling industry here.<br></div>

Hence, its always hard for local models to be sent for test shoots with established teams.<br><br>Most pro agencies in Singapore, minus those like Ave, Perspectives... (which has a top fashion photographer as boss and those with in house production facilities) will require our local models to pay for their portfolio to get them started. However, if the model has great potential, the agency might offset by footing the bill first and then deduct from the money earned later.<br><br>However, since you are footing money for your own folio, its your right to decide whether u want to proceed with the team assigned to ya. A top fashion team will cost around $500 onwards (special deals with model agency)<br>for top notch fashion and lifestyle portfolio shoot with pictures like what you see in magazines and print ads.<br><br>Havign said these, there are still some agencies, who will also arrange for Test shoots (FOC) with budding photographers and magazines to help the models build up their portfolios. Another venue is www.clubsnap.org where there are many aspiring photographers looking for FOC models.<br><br>Hope this will clear some doubts about the current situation for local models</div></blockquote>just out of curiosity.. what are pan asians..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
