            <div class='col-md body'>Plans to Capture 'Nessie' Under Fire From World's Largest Animal Rights Organization; Scottish Natural Heritage Admonished to Protect Her as Endangered Species<br><br>For Immediate Release:<br>February 15, 2001<br><br>Contact:<br>Matthew Penzer - 757-622-7382<br><br>Edinburgh - People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), an international animal rights organisation dedicated to protecting animals from the irresponsible and destructive acts of humans, has faxed a letter to the Scottish Natural Heritage's chair, John Markland, and the UK's Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, John Prescott, asking them to prohibit a planned 'fishing expedition' to capture the rare Loch Ness 'monster'.<br><br>In the letter to Markland (following), PETA cites Scotland's obligation to abide by the guidelines established by the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, as well as various national animal laws, all of which include a solemn responsibility to protect endangered and vulnerable species.<br><br>15 February 2001<br><br>John Markland CBE<br>Chairman, Scottish Natural Heritage<br>Edinburgh, Scotland<br><br>Dear Chairman Markland:<br><br>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an international nonprofit organisation with more than 700,000 members worldwide. PETA-Europe is headquartered in the United Kingdom. For the past 20 years, PETA has fought for, among other things, the protection of animals from the irresponsible and destructive acts of humans. This letter is to address concerns regarding a ‘fishing expedition’ that is to be carried out in Scotland. I am bringing this matter to your attention so that you can help to stop an injustice.<br><br>This year, as in years past, teams are undertaking plans to capture the legendary Loch Ness ‘monster.’ Among these plans is one dubbed Operation Clean Sweep. Led by Jan Sundberg, the expedition will ‘sweep’ a giant net across the loch in an effort to capture the animal commonly referred to as ‘Nessie.’ Although Nessie’s existence is speculative at best, if he animal does exist, he or she is certainly a rare species (even Sundberg believes there are only about 60 individuals in the world). It is inconceivable that the Scottish Natural Heritage would authorise the intentional capture of a species that is so obviously endangered. Certainly, such an animal, if his or her existence were ever proven, would immediately be placed on every protected species list in the world.<br><br>The United Kingdom is a member of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. By agreeing to that convention, the UK accepted a solemn responsibility to protect endangered and vulnerable species. Such responsibility is further contained in such national laws as The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981, the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act of 1912, and others. Although Nessie is not yet specifically listed under these laws, that surely is attributable only to the lack of a definitive classification and not a lack of need for protection. Surely any species of animal whose numbers are down to only 60 must be considered endangered and in need of scrupulous protection. Permitting Sundberg, or anyone else, to make deliberate efforts to capture such a rare animal, violates both the word and spirit of the convention and every animal protection law to which the UK has pledged its commitment.<br><br>Additionally, consideration must be given to the other lives at risk because of the undertakings of Sundberg and others. Sundberg may not ultimately be successful in capturing Nessie, but a giant net such as the one he plans to employ will, in fact, ensnare a great deal of unintended victims currently known to exist in the loch. There is no legal or moral justification for permitting Sundberg, or anyone else, to engage in this type of irresponsible and destructive action.<br><br>We ask the Scottish Natural Heritage to exercise its authority and immediately deny authorisation for Sundberg, or anyone else, to intentionally capture rare animals, such as Nessie. Ensuring that people act responsibly toward animals is a serious issue. We look upon the Scottish Natural Heritage to lead the effort to protect wildlife.<br><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Matthew Penzer<br>Legal Counsel<br><br>15 February 2001<br><br>Rt Hon John Prescott, MP<br>Deputy Prime Minister<br>Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions<br>Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions<br><br>Dear Minister Prescott:<br><br>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is an international nonprofit organisation with more than 700,000 members worldwide. PETA-Europe, a related entity, is headquartered in London. For the past 20 years, PETA has fought for the protection of animals from irresponsible and destructive human acts. This letter is to address concerns regarding a ‘fishing expedition’ that is to be carried out in Scotland, ostensibly to capture the Loch Ness ‘monster.’ I am bringing this matter to your attention to ask for the assistance of your office in preventing a hideously damaging scheme.<br><br>This year, as in years past, teams are undertaking plans to capture ‘Nessie.’ Among these plans is Operation Clean Sweep. Led by a man named Jan Sundberg, the expedition plans to sweep an enormous net across the entirety of Loch Ness in an effort to capture Nessie. Although Nessie’s existence is speculative at best, if this animal does exist, he or she is indisputably a rare species (even Sundberg believes there are only about 60 individuals in the world). It is inconceivable that any government would permit an effort to capture a member or members of a species so endangered that its very existence is uncertain. If the existence of such an animal is shown, then such species would immediately be placed on every protected species list in the world.<br><br>The United Kingdom is a member of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats. By agreeing to that convention, the UK accepted a responsibility to protect endangered and vulnerable species. Such responsibility is further contained in such national laws as The Wildlife and Countryside Act of 1981, the Protection of Animals (Scotland) Act of 1912, and others. Although Nessie is, of course, not specifically listed under these laws, and would not be until found, that is attributable only to the lack of a definitive classification and not to a lack of need for protection. Any species of animal whose numbers are down to 60 or fewer, worldwide, must obviously be considered endangered and in need of scrupulous protection. Permitting Sundberg, or anyone else, to engage in a plan to capture such a rare animal violates both the word and spirit of the Convention and every animal protection law to which the UK has pledged its commitment.<br><br>Additionally, consideration must be given to the other lives at risk because of the undertakings of Sundberg and others. Sundberg may not ultimately be successful in his mission, but a giant net such as the one he plans to use will, in fact, needlessly ensnare an enormous number of unintended victims whose existence is not in doubt. There is no legal or moral justification for permitting Sundberg, or anyone else, to engage in this type of irresponsible and destructive action.<br><br>We ask the government to exercise its authority and enforce the laws to which it has committed itself by stopping Sundberg’s actions immediately and prohibiting any further attempts to capture rare animals, such as Nessie. Ensuring that people act responsibly toward animals is a serious issue, as your ministry has acknowledged. We look upon the UK to lead the effort to protect wildlife.<br><br>Respectfully,<br><br>Matthew Penzer<br>Legal Counsel</div>

Those scumbags just want to make money. if they can prove Nessie's existence, it's mistque novelty will be gone.
