              <p>I somehow injured my palm about 2 mths ago and never fully recovered.  I guess that was due to my sports activities.  I did take about 2 weeks break in between to hope that it would recover, but it did not.</p>
              <p>Recently went down to one of the Branches of Ma Kuang TCM to see a chinese physician about this.  The doctors at the clinics here simply told me that i need to rest it, and didn't even prescribe me anything.</p>
              <p>Anyways, the physician recommended acupuncture proceeded to set up the needles.  From what I hear, acupuncture is not supposed to be painful, but when the physician inserted the needles, i nearly jumped and screamed out.  So three needles in all, painful as hell, and she toasted my palm with some kinda heating lamp.</p>
              <p>After consultation, she gave me a whole bunch of koyo, and some herbal bandage thing to wrap around when i sleep... the bandage was quite shiok due to the cooling effect.  The scary part was that i was told i need to go back for another round of acupuncture on the affected area....  I was like O.O mortified....cos it was such a painful experience.</p>
              <p>So I'm left wondering, is acupuncture supposed to be that painful? Even though the injured muscle might have been inflammed for quite some time?</p>

              <p>Actually usually acupuncture are not usually that painful, that you jump up.But then it have to depend on the skill of your doctor, the type of injuries and location of the injuries. If it your palm, then it may be painful as there is least meat there, lots of sensitive points. For your case think you did not seek instant treatment thus the injuries was inflammed, yep that will be painful. </p>
              
              <p>The question to ask yourself is the affected part feeling a lot better, usually you can feel the different. If yes good go for another time, it will do wonder to totally cure your injuries. If you don't feel better or feel worse - go see another acupuncturist !!! Usually if the first session is done properly, the 2nd time you do it will be a lot less painful as the imflamation is gone.</p>

              <p>once upon a time I went for acupuncture....the sticking-in of the needle is not very painful...like ant bites...but its one of the needle that goes into the back of my knee that's the most stressful...cos it involves turning the needle to stimulate the nerve there...so my knee will jerk up one...and U do tend to anticipate it when U do it often enough....its not painful....just....I dunno how to describe it....but FYI....it does work...just that U need the determination and patience to stick with the treatment.</p>

              <p>Acupunture show not be perform on sprained, swollen or injured parts. It is only good for release of Wind, and stimulation of muscles and nerves for better mobility and energy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IT SHOULD NOT BE PERFORM ON INJURED PARTS?POSITIONS. Becaue injured parts nerves and muscles are all jammed up, the TCM doctors cannot detect the exact nerve spot anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A specialised TCM doctor will only encourage you to talk medication with bandage, if really want to do an acupunture, he/she will perform on other parts of the body and not the injured part. Such as the Brain or back nerve that is connected to the injured palm so as to release pain and stimulate the nerve to generate more attention to deliver more blood flow into the palm</p>

              <p>I just got accupuntured last week. It's not as painful as anyone might think because the needle is not thicker than a strand of hair. But of course the physician needs to apply some alcohol to kill germs and also minimise the sensation when the needles goes in.</p>
              <p>If everything goes well, you should only feel "suan" only. I got 6 needles at 1 go on my right hand.I heard a lot of people getting "blue-black" after accupunture. I'm not sure why but I'm guessing maybe they poke the wrong area or hurt the blood vessels.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p>Actually usually acupuncture are not usually that painful, that
              you jump up.But then it have to depend on the skill of your doctor,
              the type of injuries and location of the injuries. If it your palm,
              then it may be painful as there is least meat there, lots of
              sensitive points. For your case think you did not seek instant
              treatment thus the injuries was inflammed, yep that will be
              painful.</p>
              <p>The question to ask yourself is the affected part feeling a lot
              better, usually you can feel the different. If yes good go for
              another time, it will do wonder to totally cure your injuries. If
              you don't feel better or feel worse - go see another acupuncturist
              !!! Usually if the first session is done properly, the 2nd time you
              do it will be a lot less painful as the imflamation is gone.</p>

              <p>Yeah, i was wondering if it really was the skill of the doctor or just that its an injury thats gone untreated for too long.  </p>
              <p>Another guy came in for a neck ache after me... like from bad sleeping posture that kind.  He was poked also.. but he didn't seem have any reaction.... really like ant bite.</p>
              <p>Mine was like... super intense that my calves was sweating thru my 20mins.  Im not sure... I'm thinking of risking again this monday.... n see if it helps.  Sekali they just trying to suck money.... </p>
