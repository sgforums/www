Ok a short description about my channel.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>Who are we actually?</strong><br><br>We are a group of people, or i'll say IRC addicts whose hobby are sharing Mp3s, MTVs, and Mpeg files. This channel was started as a hobby, with my close friend v|n, and never did we expected flourish the way it is today. We are running a Non-Profit Organisation, so if you want to complain about something, give us a break and take it nice and easy. All our files are for evaluation purposes and must be deleted within 24 hours.<br><br><strong>				How we started?</strong><br><br>This idea came when 1 day in class, out of the blue, we just thought of starting a mp3 channel as I just got my broadband connection and v|n got his SCV Maxonline a few weeks earlier than me. We had alot of ideas and started planning that day, like our channel's name, and our tags, and how we are going to get and distro our albums. We thought of Mp3Broadband, Mp3Junction, MusicJunction and a few which I've forgotten. But the other 2 were taken up, so we have to take Mp3Junction. We even have a help channel #Junction which we have abandon it as we don't really like the channel's name. Our tag started as [MJ] and due to the complaints from servers saying that there's not enough space for their nick, we have to change our tag to something short and sweet, which is mJ- <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. CorracteC, gave us an overview on how an Mp3 Channel management works, thanks to him. Both me and v|n never joined any Mp3 Serving team before and we know nuts about these stuff. (He was the previous Mp3Junction's Owner.)<br><br>We started with only the 2 of us, me and v|n in the channel. The channel was in +s mode to prevent any takeovers. At that time, I started scripting mJ script and it was called Mp3Junction Serving Script Version 1.  It was a very simple script with only spr Jukebox addon and many simple Script functions and some nice interfaces. We improved on the script later but was ripped by many users!<br><br>When the script was done and was able to be release, we open our channel to all users.  I was sharing ringtones and mp3s at that time, loading 2 clones in total and v|n was sharing mp3s and ripping! Both me and vincent tried very hard to keep the channel going by ripping &amp; sharing albums with our fellow mJ servers, and we have to leave our computer overnight to keep the channel going. We got about 10 servers at that time before Q came in. The channel took us about 1 - 2 months to be registered as the application failed several times.<br><br>When Q came in, there were already 35 Users! We started to recruit more servers from other channels. At that time, we even recruit 56k users! Liore, (Our Head Distribution), [N]elson, (Our Senior Op), were our distributors at that time, up till now. Nelson is inactive right now and only share mp3s. We have promoted Liore from a normal server, to a distribution server and now, Liore's the Head Distributor for our channel, Congrats! Sam^-^ joined us and was very active and I gave him the post as a Asst-Distributor to assist Liore. Both of them did a very good job up till today.<br><br>We had alot of obstacles over time, v|n getting bored as the number of users doesn't seems to increase, and me, had the same feeling as v|n and I didn't want to log on to IRC. But It was v|n all the time who thought of revamping the channel, we had around 2 - 3 revamps. We did mass recruiting of servers from freelance servers serving in our channel.<br><br>Our team of servers grew gradually over time and we hit the 100 barrier, and 200, and 300 on 13th December! I did actually put up a poll on a community website saying will mJ break it's 200 barrier and we did it, we even broke the 300 users barrier! We didn't expect it to flourish the way we want it to be. We even have 2 sponsors sponsoring us with the xdcc bot and webhosting, I would like to thanks the 2 of them! www.unix-sg.net and www.h2production.com .<br><br>Currently, we have a team of more than 70 servers in our channel. We hope to see it grow the way we want it to be. We ranked 6th in Mp3 Channels and 12th in the number of users. And I'll end my story here..<br><br>Hope you have enjoyed the long story here. =P Invite your friends over to  join us as a server, a downloader or even try out our Mp3Junction Script which will become a serving and chatting script soon!
