            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Que Sera Sera first Korean mega television series to be filmed under STBÂ’s Film in Singapore</strong><br><br>After wrapping up a whirlwind five-day film shoot in Singapore from 18 March to 22 March, the star-studded cast of the Korean television series Que Sera Sera made their first appearance to media and fans at Bar Opiume in Singapore today.<br><br>Another highly anticipated series from acclaimed producer Kim Yun Cheul, who was also behind the popular Korean drama series, My Lovely Samsoon, Que Sera Sera also promises to be a hit, headlined by popular Korean boyband ShinhwaÂ’s Eric Mun as well as Jung Yoo Mi, Lee Kyu Han and Yoon Ji Hye.<br><br>Singapore provided the backdrop for two sequences of the television series, which will be featured in three of the serialÂ’s 16 episodes. Unique locations such as Shangri-LaÂ’s Rasa Sentosa Resort, the Cartier boutique at Takashimaya S.C., The Scarlet Hotel, IndoChine Waterfront at Empress Place, Asian Civilisations Museum along the Singapore River, Changi Airport, Little India and Stamford House have been filmed over a period of five days amounting to at least 80 minutes of screen time set in Singapore.<br><br>Que Sera Sera is the latest project to be supported by the Singapore Tourism BoardÂ’s Film in Singapore! Scheme, which also facilitated last yearÂ’s Bollywood blockbuster Krrish starring Hrithik Roshan and Priyanka Chopra, as well as the 40-episode China dramedy Super Mates, due to air in 2007 and marketed and distributed in America, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Taiwan and Singapore.<br><br>To date, 10 projects, ranging from movies and television series to documentaries and music videos, have been filmed in Singapore under the scheme since its launch in 2004.<br><br>Said Mr Ken Low, STBÂ’s Assistant Chief Executive (Brand and Communications), Â“The STB is excited that more film-makers from all over the world such as China, Germany, Thailand, India and now Korea, are choosing Singapore as the location for their productions. Korea has a growing film and television industry and we are glad to partner notable producer Kim Yun Cheul on the Que Sera Sera production.<br><br>Â“Singapore offers a unique blend of the east and west, the best of the modern world and rich multi-cultures and traditions. We are excited that Korean drama enthusiasts will be able to sample a taste of Singapore as presented in Que Sera Sera and we welcome more of them to come and have a unique experience of Singapore themselves.Â”<br><br>Que Sera Sera revolves around the lives of four young people. One of the characters is a girl from the countryside who comes to Seoul to look for her brother. While working as a salesgirl in a department store, she falls in love and fights through difficult odds to be with her true love.<br>Released on 17 March 07, the drama will be broadcast until 6 May 07 on South KoreaÂ’s Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), one of the countryÂ’s major TV stations. Korean viewers can catch a 70-minute episode of the series on prime time on Saturday and Sunday, from 9.55pm Â– 11.05pm. Past episodes will also be aired on IMBC.com and MBC drama cable TV channel.<br><br>This television series continues STBÂ’s strong relationship with the Korean film, music and arts scene having supported TV Drama " Wonderful Life" starring Mr Kim Jae Won and Ms Yoo Jin in Feb 2005, a popular Korean movie, "Sweet, Brutal Lovers" in Oct 2005 and a Korean music video with celebrity Won Woo.<br><br>In 2006, a record 455,000 South Korean visitors came to Singapore, making South Korea SingaporeÂ’s eighth highest visitor-generating country in that year. In January this year, Singapore received 47,000 visitors from South Korea, 15% more than in January 2006. South Korea has the potential to be a key market for the tourism sector in Singapore.<br></div>
