            <div class='col-md body'>After hearing Callan's heartfelt words in his "retirement" thread, I feel it is time for me to say something.<br><br>Firstly, Callan is my buddy in this forum. I still remember the first time I met him, it was at the 1st big bbq. He was still full of buaya then, and I was thinking to myself, that this guy was full of crap.<br><br>As the days went on, and we met up, I realised that Callan was not what he appeared to be. As his friend I'm proud to say that Callan is a man of principle, of honesty, and of integrity. I am extremely grateful that I have such a friend.<br><br>Callan, I'm going to miss you in the forum. Not to worry, cuz we still meet up often ya? I'll never forget the time when you and tetrutetrumon counselled me at the bridge that night, urging me never to give up.<br><br>Callan's retirement is a loss for this forum, I'm sure of it. I only wish I could make him stay, but this is his decision and I respect that totally.<br><br>Gals, the buaya king of Sgforums is no more. Its so sad isn't it, that the forum is losing one of its most colorful characters, one of the reasons that its so popular today.<br><br>Callan, as your friend, this is my tribute to you.<br><br>Everyone has their own reasons for being in the forum, and I am no exception.<br><br>I have not been posting much to this forum lately, and I feel it is time to justify that, to bear my guts as Callan has so done. I won't say I will be retiring *grinz*, but I hope that this disclosure will lead to a very meaningful thread, one that has been started by Callan.<br><br>In sgforums, we are but faceless nicknames. Who can tell what we are truly like inside? Through words we become acquaintances, through words we joke, we laugh, and we comment. But it is only through sharing of feelings, of ourselves, that we become friends, and that understanding is something that can never be replaced by words alone.<br><br>Here is my story....<br><br>A short time after NS.....<br><br>This computer geek surfed the net and found a site called Sgforums. He was amazed by the amount of interactivity inside, and the interesting issues being discussed.<br><br>Soon he began to post regularly, and the time came for him to see some of the faces behind the names. He was excited, this was something he did not think possible, that an interest in something on his beloved Computer world could actually have an effect in real life.<br><br>This geek made many new friends, and even today, some of these are his closest. Maya, Tetrumon, Callan, FireWire, Chief, Willa, Awe, TDG, Errie, EastPark, Petridish, Scarlett, Dakar, Bochup, Alex, Asure, Lex, IO, Eck, NgKaiHoe, and SeCreTS, u know who u are.<br><br>Now, this geek had always been confident of himself and his abilities, but he just didn't know how much. He'd thought himself worthy of the best things, and so he tried to be the best he could be, sometimes to the point of impracticality. He would try so hard for things he believed in, purely based on blind faith.<br><br>This geek became overconfident. And being nominated Mr Sgforums didn't help things either. It added fuel to his ego, and being the Leo that he was, the geek loved the atention that was shown on him. While he basked in the limelight, he refused to take heed of what his inner self was telling him, that this was all wrong.<br><br>For a time, he lived not for himself, but to uphold the image that others had of him. Some would describe him as an egoistic man, easy on relationships, and unafraid to emphasize his good points.<br><br>After a while, the novelty wore thin. The stress of keeping up to this image wearied the geek. He realised that he could not live for others anymore. He realised that he had to be both honest to himself and to others, that this was the right path in life to take. He would search for things that were not the best in a general sense, but for those things that suited him, that would make him a better man.<br><br>"The best things in life might not be the best for you."<br><br>"The best things are those that are the best for you alone."<br><br>This Leo wanted to be strong, and he realised that the only way to do so would be to come face to face with his weaknesses.<br><br>Thus, the SuperSonic at present is just that. Nothing more, nothing less than himself. Honest to himself, and (hopefully) honest to those around him as well.<br><br>The experiences I have had as a result of this forum cannot really be described. It has resulted in friendships being made, bonding, maturity, and something which I had never ever dreamed as being possible. These are things which are very dear to me, and to my close friends: Do not worry, for I know exactly what I'm doing.<br><br>For the numerous friends I have here: I am grateful for the friendship, and I am proud to have u all as my friends. For those that I have not met, I hope to see u all someday. I know that among you there are friends waiting to be made, and I hope that you would not mind me as a friend.<br><br>------------------<br>Waiting...for something. What is it?<br><br>It is something called HOPE, and is what makes SuperSonic alive.</div>
