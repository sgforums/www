They want employees who have stretched themselves through co-curricular activities (CCA) or community work, speak well, think on their feet and ask good questions.<br><br>There are important gaps to be plugged but there is no need to overhaul the system, Mr Tharman told about 1,200 school principals, teachers and education specialists at the Ngee Ann Polytechnic.<br><br>Singapore students emerge from the rigorous, competitive system with top grades, but still lack critical skills that are valued by employers.<br><br>Mr Tharman, delivering his first major speech on education, polled several employers and industry leaders for a sense of the challenge facing Singapore schools. The picture which emerged was consistent.<br><br>In the workplace, Singaporeans demonstrated some key strengths: integrity and trustworthiness, a dedication to work and meeting targets, and they are analytical, methodical and focused in getting the job done. The weaknesses covered hard and soft skills, which will continue to be prized in the workplace.<br><br>One employer, Glaxo Smith Kline vice-president Tan Kay Yong, said he found Singaporeans able to 'deliver to promise, but unable to dream beyond the established or to advance the frontiers'.<br><br>Another boss, Venture Corporation chief Wong Ngit Liong, said: 'Singapore staff are more conforming than independent. They are generally not curious enough about most things. If there is no money to be made, most staff do not spend much time on an issue.'<br><br>As one industry leader phrased it: 'Many Singaporeans are put in a position of leadership, but remain taskmasters, not leaders.'<br><br>The system needs to produce people who have more than outstanding academic results. Often, it is people with excellent CCA achievements who generally do very well. It is these activities, done outside the classroom, that provide the best chances to develop resilience, team spirit and leadership, said Mr Tharman.<br><br>The way to go is to boost the CCA experience without adding to students and teachers' workloads.<br><br>Shell's chairman here, Mr Lee Tzu Yang, told him that the best performers after five years on the job are those who are very interested in areas outside their immediate responsibilities. 'They have strong reasoning skills, lateral thinking abilities, and the ability to network with and influence others.'<br><br>Mr Tharman said: 'Every student should have a grounding in the humanities. It will help them develop an ability to deal with ambiguity and situations where there is no right answer.'<br><br>So a high-level committee chaired by a senior education official will study how recognition and rewards can reinforce these directions.<br><br>The committee of principals, teachers and ministry officials will review and enhance the ranking of secondary schools and junior colleges so that it better reflects education's mission and 'the importance of holistic education'.<br><br>Ranking is a vital tool for evaluation and informed action, but it 'only a means and not an end to what we do', and shouldn't be confused with the goal of education, said Mr Tharman.<br><br>Significantly, while he sounded optimistic about the task ahead, underlined in the text of his wide-ranging 18-page text was this: 'We should avoid hubris at all cost, in education as with everything else we do in Singapore.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Copyright @ 2003 Singapore Press Holdings.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Employers have told Acting Education Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam that straight As alone are no guarantee of success in working life.</strong><br><br>Yes, good grades are no guarantees for working success. There are many other factors to be considered for advancement in any career; such as race (important factor in US/UK), religion, connections (family/bribery or both), legal blackmail as well as special talents (Creativity, thinking out of the so-called box, critical and analytical thinking haha and many other fashionable buzz words.<br><br>However not all people are Gods, there will be the higher orders and the peasants, there will be the insects and the higher-ups.<br><br>TO avoid rebuttle, but then again, Fascism is such a plague to society, all people are equal and democratically equality should be the key to harmony and job success in our world.<br><br><strong>CCA achievements who generally do very well. It is these activities, done outside the classroom, that provide the best chances to develop resilience, team spirit and leadership, said Mr Tharman. </strong><br><br>I seriously doubt this... I don't see how (i) doing pushups, (ii)shouting at lower ranking guys to boost my ego, (iii)being shouted at by higher-ranking guys to boost their ego, (iv) Marching day and night in some backwater camp (Amoy Quee). (v) Losing my hearing to the sounds of M-16 S1 fire etc etc    have contributed to my success now or ever in my possible future working life.<br><br>To avoid rebuttle, but than again I have yet to see my future working life, so I had better just sit and wait to see if my NCC career will ever help.<br><br>My point is that, CCA groups (however fun they maybe) do little for creativity/entrepreneurship/, especially NPCC and NCC, they do however, make very good/loyal grunts.<br><br>To avoid rebuttle, but then again NCC/NPCC are instrumental in fostering social cohesion and harmony in Singapore, and help to instill nationalism into young Singaporeans, this is true for other CCAs like Library and the nerd...no... the Computer Club, as well as the Chess club.<br><br><strong>The committee of principals, teachers and ministry officials will review and enhance the ranking of secondary schools and junior colleges so that it better reflects education's mission and 'the importance of holistic education'.</strong><br><br>HA! I dread what this foreshadowing paragraph spells out for your future generations of Singaporeans. This indirectly means that there will be even more ridiculously stressed time-tables, more subjects and higher cut-off points, lesser time for anything non-education related etc etc... ALL in an effort to artificially-social-engineer the student to be just like "Bill Gates", "LKY" or even "MIke Jackson", so that in the long run Singapore will have a famous firm chain to call its own or "Home-grown" for political prestige.<br><br>To avoid rebuttle, but then again the MOE is truly an efficient integrating unit for Singapore. MOE has and will always continue to mould the future of the nation positively, to mould young Singaporeans to contribute to the growing nation destined for greatness.<br><br><strong>'Singapore staff are more conforming than independent. They are generally not curious enough about most things. If there is no money to be made, most staff do not spend much time on an issue.'</strong><br><br>True, most of us are conforming, blame that on the conformist governement and the education system, with its ridiculous rules on hair length etc. Therefore conformist-thinking is being socially engineered. Times have changed money makes the world go round, if the boss wants to waste time on something that won't make money, he is a fool.<br><br>To avoid rebuttle, Singapore is a multi-racial society with many weak gaps for tension. Rules and a stable government with good governance are essential for peace and harmony, the PAP practices meritocracy, transparency, pragmatism and hindsight!<br><br><strong>The way to go is to boost the CCA experience without adding to students and teachers' workloads. </strong><br><br>Students and teacher's workloads being increased is inevitable in this system, as it has for the past god knows how many years.<br><br><strong>'Every student should have a grounding in the humanities.
