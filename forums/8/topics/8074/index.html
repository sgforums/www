            <div class='col-md body'>This is an attempt to describe a fictionous future, it is written in a form of timeline. Pls comment after reading it.<br><br>Falling Stars<br><br>AD2067: A huge alien vessel entered earth from outerspace, astronomers shocked, it went into the pacific ocean.<br><br>AD2068: Impact of collision fully realized, huge tidal waves, storms, coastal cities of usa and philipines flooded and destroyed. Global Comms affected badly. North and South of the world cut off comms. Year designated Apocalypse.<br><br>AD2070: Rain and storms all over the tropics. No power in many cities, agriculture severely impaired. People dying in urban areas. Many people move north and away from tropics.<br><br>AD2075: Comms re-established. Governments Scientists and scholars wondered about the space comet. Where did it come from? What is it made of? It must be very large, is it carrying life? Studies begin, need to send well prepared investigating team.<br><br>AD2077: USA caught in civil strife. Country wont be active for many years. Majority of World's Food imports had to come from Africa.<br><br>AD2080: SubUrbanites and their worries create all sort of theories. Some religious, many didnÂ’t know what to attribute to the phenomenon. Evolution of ThinkGroups, underworld comms that are hidden from government. Beginning of Espionage and Spying around the world.<br><br>AD2095: Japan sends a scout submarine, it was never recovered(captured by a thinkgroup)<br><br>AD2096: Recognised existance of TotemX.<br><br>AD2100: Data regarding comet retrieved from Space Satellite sorted out and beamed back to Governments' agencies, thinkgroups get hand of data.<br><br>AD2109: First Aircraft designed to fly in the "new" climate came out in Europe. G1000 ThinkGroup becomes legalised, came into power, controlled all of Europe.<br><br>AD2110: 1st BioGen Soldier prototype out in Australia. It was designed to fight against "Aliens". UN renamed TIARR, its beliefs and values adopted worldwide.<br><br>AD2111: ThinkGroup sends out secret submarine into pacific, it was destroyed by Chinese ships.<br><br>AD2115: Unravelling of underworld comms. Unsanctioned ThinkGroup members persecuted worldwide.<br><br>AD2117: 1st InvestigatingTeam from Australia sent to Comet landing site. Went into spacevessel, saw human like figures in lifesupport systems, its AI turned on,first contact between vessel and australia team established. Alien vessel designated by australia team as: FSV1-49<br><br>AD2118: 2nd InvestigatingTeam from Australia sent to comet landing site. Vessel AI grants team to extract human figure from alien life support. Human figure has human female characteristcs, she was sent back to Australia, she is abbreviated by Aussie Government as The Falling Star. Puppet government created. It is unknown to the author what alien powers she possess.<br><br>AD2119: Protection of landing site through human-alien AI agreement<br><br>AD2153: 1st Duplicate Falling Star bioengineered by Chinese Scientists. It has male characteristics. Start of  "Elite" Rising Star Dynasty in Greater China.<br><br>Organisations: (information correct as at AD2105)<br><br>When the alien vessel was discovered, world governments came up with a same plan: to hide this fact from the rest of humankind and create excuses for governments to stay in power. Among the people, suspicions arose of their governments' motives, among the unsatisfied, they formed ThinkGroups or secret organisations and through their activities to try to find an explaination for the Apocalypse. Here are the major thinkgroups:<br><br>TotemX: name of a illegal revolutionary thinkgroup, consists of ex-soldiers in cohorts with ex-scientists. Core beliefs: comet was carrying an alien vessel, alien vessel carries aliens out to conquer the world, its members believe their activities benefit humankind, and they seek to exterminate the aliens, does not trust world government activities, believes world government agents was "brainwashed" by aliens. Agenda: Steal BioGen code from Australia to build their own SuperSoldier to combat the aliens and wipe out all human resistance.<br><br>G1000: name of a secret thinkgroup with political links based in europe, former hightech industrialists band together to find a way to benefit from the Aftermath of the Apocalypse. It has many topsecret projects, among it, to harvest alien technology. Its members believe what they are doing benefits mankind.<br><br>TIARR: Abbreviation for "There Is a Religious Reason". A mysterious, loose organisation with unknown number of members around the world, other ThinkGroups believe it is in cohorts with aliens. May have religious background. Strong World Government Links.<br><br>Afterword:<br>Towards the end of the 22nd Century, TotemX gradually became the military wing of World TIARR government. G1000 became the industrial wing much earlier. Many of the world industries are in europe, food came from africa, and TotemX soldiers are everywhere to spread/reinforce TIARR faith. A brand new generation of children grow up with no knowledge of the Apocalypse because the TIARR government hide this fact from them. Older, biogenetically longer lived, thought TIARR is a puppet government controlled by Aliens. The true name of the aliens are not yet known. Some suspect the alien vessel are sending out aliens to mingle into human populations, some suspect they have already brainwashed government agents, some suspect they are out to destroy humanity, some suspect they are out to make humans as slaves, but many children will have no knowledge of the ApocalypseÂ…<br><br>Quoting Poem by R. Lee:<br>The children stood by the window and stare out into sky<br>..admiring the storm, or being eaten by its coloursÂ…<br><br>------------------<br>----------------------<br>If they plant a bomb,<br>we can plant trees<br>If they send spies,<br>we will grow flowers</div>
