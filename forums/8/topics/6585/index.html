            <div class='col-md body'>A man is driving down the road and breaks down near a monastery. He<br>goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "My car broke<br>down. Do you think I could stay the night?"<br>The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car.<br>As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. The next<br>morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "We<br>can't tell you. You're not a monk."<br>The man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his<br>merry way.<br><br>Some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same<br>monastery. The monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. That<br>night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years<br>earlier.<br>The next morning, he asks what it is, but the monks reply, "We can't<br>tell you. You're not a monk."<br>The man says, "All right, all right. I'm *dying* to know. If the<br>only<br>way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I<br>become a monk?"<br>The monks reply, "You must travel the earth and tell us how many<br>blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When<br>you find these numbers, you will become a monk."<br>The man sets about his task. Forty-five years later, he returns and<br>knocks on the door of the monastery. He says, "I have traveled the<br>earth and have found what you have asked for. There are<br>145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand<br>pebbles on the earth."<br><br>The monks reply, "Congratulations. You are now a monk. We shall now<br>show you the way to the sound."<br><br>The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says,<br>"The sound is right behind that door."<br><br>The man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked. He says, "Real<br>funny. may I have the key?" The monks give him the key, and he opens<br>the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The<br>man demands the key to the stone door. The monks give him the key,<br>and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demands<br>another<br>key from the monks, who provide it. Behind that door is *another*<br>door, this one made of sapphire. So it went until the man had gone<br>through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, amethyst...<br>Finally, the monks say, "This is the last key to the last door."<br><br>The man is relieved to no end. He unlocks the door, turns the knob,<br>and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange<br>sound.<br>But I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were<br>to success when they gave up ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Cheng is a lecturer in forensic sciences and pathology. On the first day of his lecture, a corpse laid flat on a metal trolly in front of a large student turnout. He started by saying, " There are two very important traits a person must have in order to become a top forensics expert. Firstly he or she must have NO FEAR." Upon saying that he flipped the corpse over and shoved his finger into the rectum of the body, pulled his finger out and licked his finger, causing stifled gasps in the audience. He invited all who were still interested to do what he did to prove their sincereity in learning this subject. All the students one by one went up on stage and did the same. When the last student finished, he went on to say,' Now, the SECOND thing a person must have is a very keen sense of observation. How many noticed that I put my MIDDLE FINGER in the anus and licked my INDEX FINGER?"................</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Young 13 years-old Jenny woke up one morning wondering about her age. Her grandparents have been staying at her house for a week, and so she went to her grandmother.<br>"Grandma?" said Jenny. "Yes Dear?" replied her grandmother.<br><br>"How old am I?" asked Jenny. "Well, honey..." replied the grandmother, and after a few moments of thinking she answered - "You're 13."<br><br>"Wow grandma! How did you find that out?" wondered Jenny.<br><br>"Well, Jenny, last year you celebrated your 12th birthday, so I made the math and reckoned you're now 13."<br><br>"Thank you grandma! You're so smart!" Said Jenny, and headed off to her grandfather.<br><br>"Grandpa, grandpa, how old am I?" asked Jenny.<br><br>"Well, Jenny...." Said the grandfather, and after a few moments of thinking said- "Take off your blouse...". So Jenny took off her blouse.<br><br>"Now take off your pants." said the grandfather. Jenny took off her pants with a bewildered look.<br><br>"Now your bra" said the grandfather. Jenny took off her bra, staying topless.<br><br>"And your panties" said the grandfather. Jenny took off her panties, now completely naked.<br><br>The grandfather examined her for a few minutes and then said- "Well, Jenny, you're 13!"<br><br>"Wow grandpa!, " Said Jenny, amazed, "How could you tell?"<br><br>"I heard grandma." said the grandfather.<br><br></div>
