Dun worry that she will be pissed off... ... I forget girls' names all the time... Sometimes girls smile at me then I smile back at them (wondering do I know her?)... ...<br><br>Jus approach her with a smile... Apologizing that you had kind of forgotten her name... Do it under a light n casual atmosphere... ... The only thing is to act blur n cute... Hehehehe... ...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think it would be most appropriate for u to just shyly admit that her name has slipped by ur mind rather than trying to act as if u noe it.
