            <div class='col-md body'>6 years ago, a girl know a guy thru IRC.. they started chatting and eventually.. they exchange number.. since then they started tallking on the phone.. they had arguments and the girl thought she will nv fall this guy at all but they are actually falling for each other but the guy keep himself aloof becos he thinks that a relationship out of IRC will nv work out. The guy nv intend to meet the girl at all, he jus wanna talk to her  thru the phone but who knows one fine day the girl suddenly ask the guy out.. he rejected but the girl persisted becos she wanna see this guy who doesnÂ’t give in to her this guy who makes her feel frustrated, happy, sweet, silly and a lot of other emotion. The guy finally drop his defenses and went out with the girlÂ…..<br><br>Their first dateÂ…. ItÂ’s a sunny Sunday afternoon, he drove to fetch the girl.. they met and sparks flies. The guy jus have the sudden urgh to hold the girl in his arm but he didnÂ’t they didnÂ’t talk for awhile both keepin quiet and they started walkinÂ… then the girl suggest a movie and they went for a movie.. at the very moment the guy ask the girl .. Â“ Can I Hold your Hand?Â” The girl nodded and he hold her handÂ…to the girl its so sweet.. itÂ’s the starting of their relationship.. he was her first bf . After the movie, they went back for the car and the girl wanna go to the beach. Off they went to the beach.. walkin under  the moonlight.. Their relationship grew but problem arises .. they lasted for abt 2 yrs.. finally the guy wanted a break up.<br><br>The girl was devastated, her world was revolved ard the guy and now that he has left.. she is lost.. she cried, slowly she cut herself off the world, isolated herself from her frens Â… she jus wanna be aloneÂ… but her frens drag her out wan her to face reality.. finally she crawl out of the hole of self pity. From there she went out with lots of guys, change lots of bf but none manage to heal the hole in her heartÂ… she misses the guy. Sometimes the guy would call her and that was when she is really happyÂ… when they meet sparks flies.. but still they couldnÂ’t get back togetherÂ…..<br><br>2 yrs past since they broke up.. the girl met a guy, he treat her like a princess.. give her everything she want.. she feels that she can trust this guy she thought maybe this guy can fill up the emptiness in her heart..  the guy is there for her no matter wat she do.. she can throw her temper, be unreasonable but still the guy carry on caring for her. And stay by her side Â… although the guy has some shortcoming that the ger hatesÂ… she feels that he is too possessive too protective and they have a diff mentality lvl. But still she stays on becos he stable.. she is sure he will nv break her heart cos he love her more than she love him..<br><br>now comin close to their 2nd yr anniversary together, the guy she loves appear back into her lifeÂ… they went out like normal fren outing but it make her realise that she still loves him, the feelin nv fade, she jus manage to bury it so well that she convince herself that she dun love him orediÂ… the guy says that he still feels for her and tell her that sumtimes when 2 ppl love too much too hard, it gets painfulÂ… and thatÂ’s when 2 ppl in love will nv be togetherÂ…<br><br>Is it true?? Will they be together? Should they girl take a  risk and give it a try.? Or should she jus stay in her stable relationship with the guy who loves her a lot???<br></div>
