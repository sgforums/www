            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by RETARDED_MORON:</div><div class="quote_body">First of all, let me clarify that I am completely straight, and I masturbate to women for sexual gratification.<br><br>Here is what happened yesterday: I was shopping at Wisma Atria at a clothes store when I found a piece of cool t-shirt. I proceeded to try it on in the fitting room, taking my own sweet time while admiring my awesome physique (admit it; girls are much more guilty of this). Anyway when I wasn't done yet, someone pulled apart the curtain (albeit slightly) and peered into the fitting room. "Hold on, I'm in here," I told whoever who was standing at the door.<br><br>I quickly finished my business and stepped out to see a rather decent-looking man standing at the door, flashing me a somewhat polite smile. I then bought the shirt and went to the washroom to take a leak.<br><br>Back in the washroom, I saw the exact same man again, washing his hands at the sink. I just went ahead and let loose at the urinal while he meticulously soaped his hands and fixed his hair. I did likewise after I was done, and I realised that he was taking an unusually long time to "freshen up" but I did not bother much anyway. Here is what started to bother me: he left right after I finished with my hair.<br><br>I tried to assure myself that he just *happened* to take the same route as me, but when I saw him again at Takashimaya, the truth was inescapable -- he was bloody stalking me all around Orchard Road. I was in a mild panic; I had to react fast to lose him. I promptly stepped out of Takashimaya towards Cineleisure, with him trailing me less than 2 metres.<br><br>Then all of a sudden, he came close and spoke.<br><br>Idiot: Hi. Can I know your nationality?<br>Me: *stunned* I'm Malaysian.<br>Idiot: Oh. 'Cos I thought you looked like my friend.<br>Me: (thinking) Yeah right. You just wanted to chat me up, that's all.<br>*slight pause*<br>Idiot: You look really handsome.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Me: Yeah, okay.<br>Idiot: Really.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Me: ...<br><br>I quickly walked away and kept my distance. That encounter alone was enough to tell me that I was dealing with some messed up deranged asshole. I made my way to Cathay Cineleisure but he just kept tracking me, so I had to go all the way up to the sixth floor, then take the elevator down. And throughout the journey up he kept waving and smiling to me whenever I made eye contact with him. Talk about hell. Thankfully I lost him thereafter; I hailed a cab just to be on the safe side. Never could be too sure.<br><br>Seriously, now I understand how it feels when girls are being stalked by unknown persons who just creep up behind you sending the wrong signals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>after a long post. I think you are the idiot</div>

If you wanna admire, admire at home lah... At home you can stand naked in front of the mirror for the whole day and be a full-time narcissist... (Luckily you didn't admire your "awesome physique" in the Delta Swimming Pool changing room... Skali the sick uncle comes to rape you..)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>And why tell everyone in the world that you have an "awesome physique"? I know you are proud of your physique, but adding the word "awesome" just makes me sick and you sound as if you're telling all the gays: "Come and rape me, sodomize me and f**k me!"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

The gay guy must be very lonely... Haha<br><br>I also had a scary experience.... I went to a shopping centre toilet to do my "big business". Then halfway, someone from the next cubicle throws a ball of toilet paper into my cubicle. At first I thought it's a prank, so I ignored it. But the guy next door kept throwing toilet paper balls into my cubicle. Feeling curious, I picked up one of the balls and uncrumpled the paper.

Haha<br><br>I also had a scary experience.... I went to a shopping centre toilet to do my "big business". Then halfway, someone from the next cubicle throws a ball of toilet paper into my cubicle. At first I thought it's a prank, so I ignored it. But the guy next door kept throwing toilet paper balls into my cubicle. Feeling curious, I picked up one of the balls and uncrumpled the paper. To my horror, I saw a written message "Want someone to suck your c o c k?" I immediately wiped my backside and then ran away as fast as possible!!! </div></blockquote> u shld throw the tissue u wiped ur backside at him,....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
