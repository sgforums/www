            <div class='col-md body'>I dislike censorship.<br><br>That said, I think I know what adrian's talking about. Just wanted to ask, are there any die hard anime fans here who just <strong>MUST</strong> go to see the movies on the big screen ?<br><br>Right, now, when you frequent stores which sells VCDs, you would notice that there are a coupla those $9.90 a piece VCDs, of some really nice anime ? Okay, after watching the contents of that $9.90 piece (anime title, Spriggan.), and comparing it with the one that I saw off the big screen, there's worlds of differences.<br><br>Basically, to put a long story short, the censorship was so bad that one can't really tell what the heck happened, due to the cut. In one singular VCD, I counted like, 8 cuts. Now, if I didn't see the uncut version, I would have absolutely no idea what happened in between the interval that was snipped.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Right... that's the end of my rant.... *phew* Erm.. at the same time, I hope I've provided enough of an example here too.<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heya adrian,<br><br>I was re-reading this thread again just so that I could clarify certain issues with the Sloppy Thoughts thread.<br><br>Upon reading your reply a second time, it was especially promising to find the same sort of indefinate and misunderstood usage of the common lexicon of the English language.<br><br>"ok, censor is to decide with power whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity, threat of security etc."<br><br>Let's try to recuperate your original thoughts from this jumbled piece of mess.<br><br>How do you "decide with power"? It should be "the power to decide".<br><br>"whether to show the viewers things that r on the grounds of obscenity". Perhaps this should be rephrased as to be unambiguous. Currently, it is in fact suggesting that it is the role of the censor to show viewers footage that is obscene. *laugh*<br><br>Lastly, "threat of security ".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> This elicited guffaws for a non-stop 5 min. The threat of security???!!! Heh! Gee, most girls want to be threatened with secuirty then.<br><br>In ONE SENTENCE, you have managed to confuse all your thoughts and confuse the reader too ; meanwhile suggesting a totally contrasting stance to your "attempted" point.<br><br>I'm sure adrian wants to portray himself as a steadfast "Singlish" type... If any "Singlish" thread readers are reading this, this is perhaps what so dangerous abt the uncritical acceptance of Singlish into the national consciousness. Bad English simply gets muddled up with the overarching "positive" terminology of Singlish and thus is excused and *gasp* celebrated.<br><br>Dun misquote me out of context : I'm not saying that Singlish is bad but that it's very dangerous to leave ourselves a convienent hiding place for our inadequacy and inarticulateness.<br><br>In another post, Mateo commented that 12 Storeys was too "arty-fartsey". In a similar vein, what was engendered here was a discourse of the same rationale as Singlish. We resort to simplicity to articulate our lack of ideas and understanding. Proddy mentioned quite rightly that, instead of striving to understand better, we tend to dumb down. We want easy, piece-meal solutions and anything that requires a stretch of imagination or critical thought is to be considered "cheem", "artsy" and "intellectual" (there terms that are have bad currency in the capitalist Singapore).<br><br>I'm sorry that I am writing this in a movie thread. I think I shall post this under "Sloppy Thoughts" and "Singlish" too, for coherence sake. Thank you for taking ur time to read this.<br><br>SINGA the courtesy lion strikes again. *irony dammit*<br><br>cheers.<br><br>------------------<br>No universal history leads from savagery to humanitarianism, but there is one leading from the slingshot to the megatonne bomb.<br><br>Adorno</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have to agree that sg's censorship board is a little too strict for my taste. many impt social issues, and signs, that feature in our everyday lives, have been censored, or rated R(A). homosexuality would be a good example. the first wives' club and birdcage was rated R(A) 'cos both films had a theme of homosexuality (in the former, one of the main character's daughters was a lesbian, and they visited a lez bar). sometimes, i really wonder how old our government thinks we are. it's true that sometimes, it might be acceptable for them to decide on certain issues for us, but isn't this going a bit too far? i think sgreans are sensible and logical enough to be able to judge for themselves, and not mindlessly accepting everything we see on the screen. do they honestly think that we're that stupid??<br><br>------------------------<br>PS. adrianxtc:<br>i have to agree with barclays, that although the subject of your threads can sometimes be rather interesting, you should contribute more. your comments (if you give any) are excessively vague. you just state your point and expect us to fill in the blanks. at least, if you give us a decent post of your thoughts regarding the subject, we can have something to start on. or else, you're just wasting everyone's time by posting for the sake of posting.<br><br>[This message has been edited by xue (edited 11 March 2000).]</div>

He asked for details about the alleged pornographic children's magazine, and assured the House that censorship controls remained strict. VIRGINS<br><br>I INSISTED ON GOING.
