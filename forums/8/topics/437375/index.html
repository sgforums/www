              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Hi all I am at the crossroads of my education life now. I intend to continue the course which I did for diploma. I got offers from a few universities to continue my studies but I am not sure which one to choose.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"><span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Here are some of the offers:</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Pros: Familiar environment, shortened study time.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Cons: I don’t really want to study in Singapore as I feel I might be able to get broader and different experience doing it overseas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Pros: Different experience overseas while studying and Internship period.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Cons: New environment, longer study time (as compared to local institution)</span></p>

It’s a “through-train” course as I will study there for 4 years and I will be awarded both bachelor and master degree.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Pros: No need to apply for masters after degree, save time as I will need it much for my final project. Different experience overseas while studying and Internship period.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Cons: New environment, longer study time (as compared to local institution)</span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Personally wise, I would really want to experience studying overseas as my course is not much focused in Singapore and the industry is small here.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">I would end up getting taught by the same people again, I don’t really know if it will be affecting me in long way but I am quite sure the teaching would be much the same as before. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">I would love to do post-graduate studies as I love research and writing reports and there is currently no institutions offering post grad in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">I believe if I go overseas for my degree I would have more time to accommodate to life there rather than jumping in for my masters. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">I don’t really mind the time spent, as long as it’s worth spending. I am willing to adapt to life anywhere. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">My parents are supportive of my decision whatever it is, morally and financially. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 13pt;">Currently I really have no idea of which route to take. I hope if anybody have the experience of living/studying overseas and/or been through this path could advise me. </span></p>

              <p>actually i always had wanted to take the step out of singapore as i wanted to go the academic way. for this i have to take my post grad studies and thereon i hope that i would have the opportunity to continue my research in the university.</p>
              <p>but i just wanted to not be overly optimistic about it and start to hear neutral views</p>
              <p>i heard stories of unjust racism and difficulties to adapt to life overseas from people. my dad may put up a front of supporting me in whatever i chose, but i know deep down he wanted me to stay in singapore.</p>
              <p>i just hope i could hear from people their views and which path they would choose if they are in my position and why.</p>
              <p>probably in this way in whatever step i take, i might have better confidence to move...</p>

              <p>On the research part, all 3 Uni (and the upcoming SUTD) all offer post grad both in Masters and PhD so I believe you are saying that it does not offer the course you are studying?</p>
              <p><br>If you really is interested in research, try to understand the nature of research (especially in your field). Google "PhD" or "research" to get some idea of a research based post-grad study. It is best that you go take a look at the level of work done by your professors in your future course of study. One easy way is just go to any professors in the listed department that you are intended to take. See their published works in conferences/journals, if possible, download and briefly go through it. Why? Because research requires you to publish. Then ask yourself, is it what you expected. Because there is always a discrepancy of what you perceived in that topic and what actually goes on in the actual research (which can be very daunting).</p>
              <p>Next going into post-grad is simply meritocracy, meaning grades, your bachelor degree must be above the average, meaning you must get a 1st class or at least a 2nd upper honors (in local terms) to make the cut. You would also need to secure a scholarship for further studies, if you cannot, you can forget about doing a PhD unless you are rich. If you are heading overseas, do take note of the system, example UK and US PhD system are different, hence the length and the way of study is also different. Lastly, my advice is go do the degree first, your goals and aspiration will naturally change and you might end up doing something else. The above just serve as a hint of what you should do for your undegrad should you want continue on to do a research nature post-grad.<br></p>

              <p>i was reading through the other topic of private degree vs local degree...</p>
              <p>and i realise that there are quite some other things for me to consider</p>
              <p>- i would need first class or 2nd upper honours to enter the masters course in uk. most uk universities offer that but the local institution (if i am not wrong) does not provide honours program. it would not be good if i finished my degree here and realise that i have much difficulty entering a masters course in uk. and also the competition i faced in entering.</p>
              <p>- someone mentioned that it might be difficult to explain to future boss how come i did my degree in short span of time. on top of that, the credibility of my certificate might be "discounted" by the boss as he might feel that i did not learn as much as the rest who did the full term.</p>
              <p>- adaptation as i mentioned above. the teaching methods might be different overseas so if i get to enter the post grad studies there, i might have alot of difficulties adapting</p>
              <p>- also, i guess if i want to eventually do my post grad overseas, i might want to start climbing the ladder from degree</p>

              <p>yeah all 4 of the local universities do not provide post grad studies for my course. what i am doing is not what the singapore universities focus on like IT, science, engineering, business and accountancy, humanities. it is also a small industry for work. SUTD is in fact a IT-science-engineering technical based university putting on an exterior of design university.</p>
              <p>actually what i meant is that i have the aiming to do post grad studies in future, but i also understand that i would need to get a degree with good grades. probably i might not want to do the post graduate studies after completing degree, but then i will start real considerations when i reached my final year.</p>
              <p>in terms of the course i am doing and my industry, the other alternative way is to start a business. as i realised, most people who start a business will not consider doing post grad, because degree is already enough to equip them with the skills. but so far i have not thought of starting a business yet as i do not have enough contacts. so i guess the other alternative is to continue studying and hope i can be a lecturer.</p>
              <p>so far i have not heard of any scholarships for my course in singapore or overseas. it will be quite a sum for me to do post grad, and most people who have reached that state would rather put the money to do business than doing post grad studies.</p>
              <p>whether i am continuing my studies or starting a business, my parents are supportive of my decisions morally and financially.</p>
