            <div class='col-md body'>This is just a follow up on the incident where a VSC died in a freak accident in Nov last year. For those who are concerned. The VSC, Ben Hur who died was my friend's very very close relative. Mr Ben Hur was a very good, responsible man who loved his wife and son alot. The day after the accident, my friend called me and told me what had happened. At night we rushed to the funeral.The little boy was unable to express his sadness so he kept silent(later we found out he did not want his mum to be worried but he cried every night into his pillow)How is a boy able to take the pain of losing person he love so much..Every weekend they would do sports together. Anyway,back to the funeral. The mother was uncontrollable. I mean, imagine the man who stuck through thick n thin for 20years, juz gone.And having 2 see him die in front of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> On<br>The scene of the burial is something i will never ever forget. AS reported, there were alot of police etc attending. When Mr Ben's coffin was about to be put in the dug hole, his wife (they only allow her 2 watch from a distance as they knew she would be incontollable..She was allowed 2 watch the ceremony from a van while some policewoman held her). She was screaming;''Why u leave me and baby(the son) and go 1st?Why??''<br><br>At that point of time i guessed my perception of life changed. I felt stupid for crying for breakups, getting sad when cannot get what i desire etc.What was all that compared 2 what i was witnessing?<br><br>Now, my friend tells me every night before the child sleep, he will have a conversation with his daddy 1st. A happy picture has been torn apart. Hope everyone is safe and well. Cherish life</div>
