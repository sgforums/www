              Coincidentally, nair could have given people an impression that there are some anti-establishment people who just want to destroy the gonmin by creating lies and spreading rumors about them.
                                                  
              I think this side effect is coincidental because i suspect nair did not intend to create this impression on people. That this is just a foolish act he committed without the intention to create this bad impression. So, his article could have indirectly, coincidentally, unintendedly given a bad impression on people who hold Anti-Establishment views.
                                                  
              What a pure coincidence to have created such a side effect. I am sure no one asked him to do this act of foolishness.

My last post about Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew was a hoax. However it was deliberate.</span></span></a> </strong><br><br><br>Updated:March 07, 2010, 1715 hrs, Pacific Standard Time. <br><br>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br><br>My last post in this blog, Saturday, March 6, 2010 "<em>Singapore strongman 87 year old Lee Kuan Yew suffers massive heart attack</em>", was a hoax. But the hoax was deliberately written by me. It was a deliberate attempt to highlight how tenuous Singapore really is, with all power in the island vested in one man, and the dire consequences to the island of his parting.<br><br>And especially so as he is 87. <br><br>I have received no less than 40 comments to it, with so many readers really bowled over as to what will happen. What calamity, what disaster, what misfortune! In fact it appears the Singapore General Hospital had its security tightened and the stock market is vary and keeping a watch on developments!<br><br>Is it not stupid that a mere blog like mine, which is not a major newspaper and not a news source of any major importance can be taken so seriously and cause such worry and uncertainly. I must say the overwhelming reaction to my humble blog about the Dear Leader is gratifying.<br><br>I wonder whether the recently sacked Lee Kuan Yew's Attorney General Woon Seong Ming, who is going to teach law in Singapore University, to which position he is amply qualified since it is a Singapore University after all, and not one in a democracy; will be coming out with his swan song of a lawsuit or a prosecution against me of some kind? <br><br>You never know, if he does a good job of suing me or prosecuting me this time, Lee may allow him to keep his job. <br><br>This overwhelming reaction is characteristic not among the democracies of the world which can weather the death of anyone but of Stalinist dictatorships. <br><br>You will see the same agitation and worry when Kim Jung Il kicks the bucket and so will the Cubans when Raul Castro or Fidel does the same to it. <br><br>This is what I have been telling Singaporeans all along. I do not really know one way or the other whether Lee Kuan Yew has had any heart attacks because even if he did, as is the custom in Stalinist closed societies, you are not going to be told of it. <br><br>At the same time, I do not know if the 87 year old octogenarian had run the mile in under 3 minutes yesterday. <br><br>In fact I don't know anything. And neither do you. And that my friends is the story of living in Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. <br><br>And let me tell you something. Even though I made up everything I said about Dear Leader about his heart attack, and none of it is true, I can assure you that the scenario that I painted assuming that he dies is completely correct. <br><br>And even if he did not have the heart attack yesterday and is not housed in the Intensive Care Cardiac Unit of Singapore General Hospital at present, if in fact that had happened, which I am sure is likely to happen this week or next, given his being a tottering old man of 87 years of age, all that I said is going to happen very soon. <br><br>Noone can live forever. <br><br>Those with money will begin transferring it abroad, there will be a run on the banks, his corrupt friends at the top will be leaving with their money and their lives, there will be demonstrations at the junctions of Geylang Road and Mountbatten Road and Orchard Road and Patterson Road. There will be mayhem. And it will happen soon.<br><br>My advice to those in Singapore with their cerebrums intact is this, if you can stand and protest the system, do it for your own good. Bring about a new Singapore. One that does not rely completely on an 87 year old tin pot. <br><br>If not pack up your belongings and your families and fly Qantas to Australia or some other safer country. Singapore is not longer safe.<br><br>And now, as someone had intimated, since this report of his having a heart attack was a deliberate fabrication, I have been advised that Lee Kuan Yew, as is the custom of Stalinist strongmen around the world, will either sue me or if he cannot do it, shoot me. <br><br>I am holding my breath.<br><br>Postscript: I think my writing the hoax about Dear Leader Lee Kuan Yew may in fact contribute to his demise sooner, due to the stress of it. Stress and tension contribute to heart attacks, especially in 87 year old men. <br><br><em>Gopalan Nair</em><br><em>39737 Paseo Padre Parkway, Suite A1</em><br><em>Fremont, CA 94538, USA</em><br><em>Tel: 510 657 6107</em><br><em>Fax: 510 657 6914</em><br><em>Email: <a href="mailto:nair.gopalan@yahoo.com"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">nair.gopalan@yahoo.com</span></span></a></em><br><em>Blog: <a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;"></span></a><a href="http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">http://singaporedissident.blogspot.com</span></a>/</em><br><br><em>Your letters are welcome.
