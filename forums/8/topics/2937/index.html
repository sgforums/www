            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Nerv,<br>Welcome to the forum! I have to say, the question you have posed is quite difficult. There are so many different types of love that it can be difficult to differentiate them.<br><br>True love isn't something you see on the streets everyday. When you love somebody, you'll always want the person to be happy. To provide the best for that someone. Unfortuantely, this is quite similar to infatuations. If you really love someone, you'll love him for what he is. You even love him for his bad points. You only look at the good points when you have a crush.<br><br>I believe true love and mature a person. It will make people want to be a better person.<br><br>Well, that's just the tip of the iceberg. No one can really tell you what is true love. You'll have to feel it for yourself.(sounds familiar....)<br><br>Merry Christmas<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...thanks everyone for the response. As i am not very experience with Love itself, it is quite hard for me even to define what love is. So I would like to quote some verses that I hear while watching jap drama.<br><br>"Love is to love him more, to care for him more, to like him to love you more, to like him to care for you more"<br>"When apart, wanted to be close"<br>"Can't wait to see each other"<br>"Get jealous if he is not worried about you, jealous if he is with someone else"<br><br>I also agree with what Crab has provide me with.<br><br>Jaa ne.<br>NERV.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love....... Such a small and simple word yet it means so many different things. The truth is that you do not know what love is until you have actually experienced it. You canÂ’t read about it and expect to know what it feels like. You canÂ’t be told what it is and expect to know until you have experienced it yourself.<br><br>So how do you know if you are in love? Well you donÂ’t. Not until it is over anyway. Like many things in life, people take love for granted. You donÂ’t know how important someone is in your life until you have lost them.<br><br>Being in love with someone is an experience everyone should go through, because everyone can fall in love. Love is not a Â‘thingÂ’ it can not be bought by money. So yes you can fall in love even if you are not a rich bastard.<br><br>If you truly love someone you will give them anything they wish to have, you can give up the most important things in your life just to make them happy. Finding love is never easy for anyone, because one person always loves their partner more than their partner loves them.<br><br>Love has nothing to do with appearance but people often think that it does. People may think that if you are a scruffy so and so you will not find love. Not true. The problem with love is that when you finally find it, your whole world wraps around them. Everything you do from then on must fit into their world and you will make sure that it does. Because you love them.<br><br>This may cause frustration between you and your friends as you will be paying a lot more attention to your partner than them. When you lose your love, the world around you crumbles like thereÂ’s no tomorrow. Â‘ItÂ’s the end of the worldÂ’, Â‘ThereÂ’s nothing to live forÂ’ are phrases which are used when love is lost. The fact is, is that love lastÂ’s forever, if you truly love someone, you will love them forever.<br><br>So are you in love with someone? And have you ever told them that you love them? It is often hard for guys to tell their partners that they love them, because of the Â‘macho imageÂ’ factor.<br><br>But guys......if you do love your partner, tell them, they may not already know. Forget about the image, Love's more important.<br><br>------------------<br>One line has no meaning, another line is needed to give it expression.<br><a href="http://zhaoyun.cjb.net" rel="nofollow">Homepage</a><br><a href="mailto:zhaoyun@onebox.com" rel="nofollow">zhaoyun@onebox.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, Merry X'mas and Happy Millennium.<br><br>So far from all the topics that I have read in this forum, I know that when you love someone, you are willing to give them everything. So my question here is when he/she is going to leave you and go for another guy/gal, being the current bf/gf, will you be willing to give up this love. Did anyone think of the poor guy/gal who have to give up?<br><br>Like let's say there is this couple who have just voice their love for each other but the next moment the gal gets to know another guy and wanted to break up? What would anyone of you think, the feeling of both of them?<br><br>Jaa ne.<br>NERV<br><br>------------------<br>God in his world, alright with the world.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WEll, reading all the above opinions, I still feel that it is hard to define the word 'love'.<br>Love is different for everyone... There is no universal definition of love. So there isn't any point trying to figure out what is love. You'll know what love is when you experience it. That's true love...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for me, I had fell in and out of love... puppy love, one-sided, triangle-affair,etc... For me, I think what I'm experiencing now is love, maybe not true love yet... but I know it's love. It's blissful and I feel contented. We can pick on each other and know that we mean only good. We understand each other even without words and seldom quarrels.<br><br>It's quite hard to explain my definition of love... dun want to sound as if I'm boasting  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually for me it was a pretty scary thing when i realised that i was in love. as in, really TRUE LOVE.<br>ever since i found basketball, it's been my true love of my life. i literally couldn't and wouldn't want to live without it; it's the one constant in a life where everyone and everything i care about leaves me or betrays me or simply disappears sooner or later. with hanwei, i just kinda realised that he's even more important to me than basketball - where it used to be more important to me than anything else. it's still more important to me than life itself, by the way.<br>it was like my world was shaken to its foundations - if he'd asked me to give up basketball and it was a reasonable request, i would have at least thought it over seriously, if not given it up outright.<br>another key sign is that, well, i'm a very cynical person, and i have a lot of walls and defenses up. (doesn't everybody?) anyway, all my life has served to reinforce the lesson that if you open up, you get hurt. (your opinion may be different, but anyway, this is what my life has taught me.)<br>the thing is, my walls and cynicism were hurting the guy i love, and he felt that i was shutting him out. we had a long talk when he brought it up, and i thought about it long and hard. in the end, he became the only person in my life who i've allowed to get to know me at my most scared and vulnerable, without all my walls and defenses.<br>in the end? he realised that he didn't really love me after all..... so i'm sure that the above description helps ppl who've been asking me a lot of questions or flaming me for trying to kill myself after he broke up with me to understand, maybe, a little of what i've been going through and why i made the choices i did......<br>not that i actually have to explain myself, just that i don't like people thinking that i'm the kind of person they seem to think i am. *sigh*<br>i loved my hanwei very much.... still do as a matter of fact..... but i for one ascribe to the theory that you can love more than one guy at a time, since a girl loves every guy differently....... but of course, i'm talking about true love here........<br>i will always love hanwei, and that's the truth. does that mean that i cannot love another guy again? i think there's something seriously wrong with the logic there.<br>personally, i think that as long as you heal and have accepted that the one you love there's nothing wrong with falling in love again. otherwise, it's like saying that having eaten from one lavish banquet you'll never attend another again. feast on the abundant love that your loved one gives you, and return the love abundantly without feeling guilty: if it's true love, then what's there to be guilty about? and no matter what other people say, only you can know whether it's true love or not - who are they to judge? it's YOUR feelings, so only you know what it is or isn't. true love doesn't follow any rules; haven't you heard the saying, "love transcends all boundaries?"<br>well anyway that's how i feel.... *sigh* hope i don't get flamed again for my way of life..... sick of defending my way of life when itz just a way of illustrating WHY i think the way i do...... feel free to flame my ideas, but not my life - who the hell are you to judge the way i live?<br><br>sorry, just a little upset by some other ppl's responses to some of my posts.......<br><br>amelia a.k.a. kat<br><br>------------------<br>"They say it's a river/that circles the earth/a beam of light shining/to the edge of the universe/it conquers all/it changes everything/They say it's a blessing/they say it's a gift/they say it's a miracle/and i believe that it is/it conquers all/but it's a mystery/Love breaks your heart/love takes no less than everything/love makes it hard/and it fades away so easily/In this world we created/in this place that we live/in the blink of an eyelid/the darkness has ceased/love lights the world/it lights the world for all eternity/Love breaks the chain/love aches for everyone of us/love takes the tears and the pain/and it turns it into/the beauty that remains/..." - Love Is, by Vanessa Williams and Brian McKnight (one of my favourite songs - the lyrics are very true if u can understand what it's actually saying)</div>
