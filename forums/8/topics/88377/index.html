            <div class='col-md body'>IN May, Centro Concepts made the news when it had difficulty paying its rent.<br><br>Now, some former and current employees say they're owed money too.<br><br>They claim the company, which manages nightspots Centro 360, Lola and Embargo at One Fullerton, owes them several months' wages.<br><br>Some have left in frustration, while others still hang on, hoping they will eventually get paid.<br><br>Ms Juliana Lee, 28, who was a full-time serving supervisor at Embargo for four months, was one of a few disgruntled employees who have lodged complaints with the Ministry Of Manpower. She resigned in June.<br><br>MOM confirmed that they are investigating the complaints. (See report below.)<br><br>'When I first started work there in March, they paid me a whole month's salary. But I didn't experience (pay delays) till May.<br><br>'They paid me half a month's pay only, and it was delayed by about two weeks. They said they would pay me the rest at the end of the month, but the next time I was paid was 1 1/4 months later (at the end of June). And that was only pay for the second half of May,' Ms Lee said.<br><br>Today, she claims that Centro Concepts still owes her a full month's salary.<br><br>'We all have bills to pay... It's so frustrating. Some people I know have had to borrow money just to tide themselves over, and all the Centro people can say is, 'We'll get back to you'.'<br><br>Mr Felix Gwee, 23, has worked on and off as a server for Centro Concepts over four years. He said he's experienced delayed payment from the start.<br><br>'Initially, payment delay was for days or weeks, but to make me wait for two to three months is too much.'<br><br>Mr Gwee, who is waiting to start a university course, said he didn't really need money urgently but continued to work because of the friends he had made there.<br><br>He quit the company for good in June after registering a complaint with MOM, claiming that the company did not pay him for the months of April, May and June.<br><br>AFRAID TO LEAVE<br><br>One staff member, Nancy (not her real name), is still working for the company despite not being paid.<br><br>'I'm so afraid that they might not pay me the balance (about $500), and I need the money. For the last month they have switched to paying a daily wage, and even though it's $1.50 less per hour for the same job, I have to hang on,' she said.<br><br>She said that staff warn newcomers what to expect: 'Whenever someone new comes in, we tell them about the pay situation, so they have a choice whether they want to take the job or not.'<br><br>Like Nancy, 22-year-old Terence (not his real name) initially stayed on despite not being paid.<br><br>As a part-timer, he worked from 5pm to 3am to earn some money before he enlists for fulltime national service in September. Together with Ms Lee and Mr Gwee, he lodged a complaint with MOM.<br><br>Last week, he told The New Paper: 'They owe me about $1,200, and I want to be here until they pay me.'<br><br>But on Monday, Terence told The New Paper that he was asked to leave his job.<br><br>He had earlier attended an MOM conciliation meeting between the Centro Concepts' accountant and some staff on Friday.<br><br>Terence claimed: 'I went back to work, and my supervisor told me the management had indicated that they didn't want me to work there any more. They said I could carry on for a few days until they found a replacement.<br><br>'Now they claim that they'll pay me back in parts all the way till after August. I'm angry that there's no lump sum.<br><br>'If I didn't complain, I'd have no pay. Now, I complain and still have no pay. How to survive till end August with no money?'<br><br>ONE WHO GAVE UP, ONE WHO DIDN'T<br><br>Former part-time server, Mr Tan, who did not want his full name published, told us he's given up on ever getting his pay.<br><br>Mr Tan, 21, quit in March, and claimed the company owes him about $1,000.<br><br>'I've been chasing them for six months and so many times they said they would look into it but nothing happened, so forget it.<br><br>'I understand from the newspapers that they have problems so I've given up hope. I think my pay is not their top priority.'<br><br>Mr Hairul Nizad, however, refused to give in.<br><br>The 28-year-old recently succeeded in recovering everything that Centro Concepts owed him.<br><br>He worked at Centro for two months from February, then moved to Embargo for three months before resigning in June.<br><br>Like the rest, he said that his pay was always delayed, and after working for a month, he was paid for two weeks.<br><br>Mr Hairul said he was only paid the other half of February's salary at the end of April.<br><br>He said: 'I just basically called them every single day for three months, including the time that I was still working there.<br><br>'They kept telling me that the management hadn't signed it so they couldn't hand the cheque to me.<br><br>'I pestered and pestered them.'<br><br>He said they settled his pay in full just two weeks ago.<br><br>MOM: FILE WAGE CLAIMS EARLY<br><br>MOM confirmed it is currently investigating allegations that Centro Concepts owes its workers wages.<br><br>MOM spokesman Joanne Mitchell added that in such situations, swift action helps: 'Workers who do not get paid promptly or regularly should file their claims with MOM early and not allow the salary arrears to accumulate to a huge sum.<br><br>'Companies that have severe financial hardship will find it difficult to raise sufficient funds to pay off a huge salary debt.'<br><br>Ms Mitchell explained that on receipt of a salary claim, MOM will arrange a meeting for the employee and the employer concerned to verify the claim and to seek an amicable settlement.<br><br>In cases where the dispute cannot be resolved this way, the worker can bring it up to the Commissioner for Labour.<br><br>If an order for payment made by the Commissioner is not complied with, the claimant can apply to a civil court for help to recover the payment with MOM's help.<br><br>From January to December last year, 93 per cent of salary claims were resolved and $7.1 million in unpaid salaries was recovered.<br><br>'Some workers cheating company of money, booze'<br><br>CENTRO Concepts' general manager, Mr Eng Jeng Hwee, initially said his company may have been 'holding' certain 'terminated' employees' pay 'because they were cheating the company's money'.<br><br>He claimed: 'At times, when they collect customers' money, instead of putting the change back, they keep it for themselves. They also take home half-opened bottles belonging to customers, and as a result I have to open new bottles for the customer.<br><br>'They can write to MOM, but we have every reason to hold their pay till our investigations are done.'<br><br>He could not tell us how many employees were being investigated.<br><br>He also said the management did not call in the police because 'they are still so young, we have to think of their future'.<br><br>Allegations of theft? Not true, said a former employee.<br><br>The bottles are all expired bottles, said former supervisor Juliana Lee: 'When a bottle is opened by a customer, it expires after one month. But the bottles accumulate so you have to tidy up.<br><br>'We had bottles from as far back as last year, so I put all expired bottles in a corner for the kitchen staff to use for cooking, or for staff gatherings. Normally, they would have been thrown away.'<br><br>Ms Lee told us she hadn't heard of any case where staff members had pocketed change or stolen money from the company.<br><br>What of the staffers who claimed they hadn't been paid in the months of April, May and June?<br><br>Mr Eng claimed: 'Some of them are being paid. There's some delay because of a change of manager.'<br><br>But later, he said: 'To be frank, at some point, our cash flow was tight and there was delay.'<br><br>Added Mr Ong: 'We have met with MOM about the staff members not being paid. Cheques are in the process of being sent out, or we will contact staff members to come back and collect them. Everything is resolved,' said Mr Eng.<br><br>All the employees are getting their pay?<br><br>'Yes,' he replied.<br><br>Centro Concept's cash flow problems surfaced in May, when it was reported that it owed landlord One Fullerton several months' rent for 2,040 sq m of space.<br><br>A last-ditch agreement to pay part of the arrears and settle the balance on a payment schedule saved the company from having its assets sold in an enforced auction.<br><br>source: np</div>
