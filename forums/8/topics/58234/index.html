            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of them are doing it, particularly the young and educated, but even more would rather meet friends, read or watch TV<br><br>THERE is plenty of sex in the city. Almost half of Singaporean singles have done it. And among them, more than half have had multiple sexual partners and around a quarter have had one-night stands.<br><br>The ones most often jumping into bed? Young, educated Singaporeans. The numbers are highest among men in their 20s and 30s who have at least A-levels or polytechnic diplomas.<br><br>These are some of the findings of a survey the research arm of Singapore Press Holdings did this month to find out the attitudes of 335 singles, aged between 25 and 49, towards marriage, dating and sex.<br><br>To encourage truthful answers on sexual behaviour, the singles were asked, during the face-to-face interview, to complete a separate questionnaire which was then sealed in an envelope and handed to the interviewer.<br><br>The first part of the survey, on singles' attitudes towards marriage and dating, was published in The Sunday Times yesterday. It reveals they are not keen on marriage and would cancel a date for work.<br><br>But they are less unwilling when it comes to having sex.<br><br>The findings, reflecting present-day norms, hardly raised an eyebrow.<br><br>'Sex has already been delinked from marriage - in Singapore as in other places, such as Hong Kong and Japan, of the same development level,' said sociologist Alfred Choi.<br><br>'Sex in Victorian times was for procreation, but sex today is for recreation,' he added.<br><br>Marketing executive Adrian Lee, 26, who lives with his 32-year-old air stewardess girlfriend whom he hopes to marry in three years' time, agreed: 'To many, sex is no big deal. It's for the thrill and there are no strings attached.<br><br>'People also see it as their way of 'testing out' their partners before they marry.'<br><br>Other snapshots of sex in Singapore:<br><br>Six in 10 men have had multiple partners, compared to four in 10 women.<br><br>Three in 10 men have had one-night stands, while one in 10 women have done the same.<br><br>Three in 10 men have paid for sex. None of the women have.<br><br>About a quarter of both sexes said they had cohabited.<br><br>These attitudes worry Mr Chan Soo Sen, the 46-year-old chairman of the Family Matters! committee to promote family life.<br><br>'Now, you can have an active sex life without having to bear the responsibilities of married life. Society no longer frowns as much on it and technology gets rid of the consequence of pregnancy,' said the Minister of State (Education and Community Development and Sports).<br><br>On how this trend could be bucked, if at all, he said: 'We try to appeal to people to look back at the basics of a relationship - and to work towards the long term.'<br><br>But he may find comfort in another of the findings.<br><br>A relatively low 5 per cent believe in extra-marital sex - a vote cast in favour of the sanctity of marriage.<br><br>Miss Ling Sok Leng, 37, a television and film producer, voiced a typical comment among the singles interviewed.<br><br>'Premarital sex does not hurt anyone as it's between two willing parties. But I find it very difficult to accept extramarital sex - it's irresponsible and it's not fair.<br><br>'Marriage is about that oath you took.'<br><br>This attitude is reassuring, said Banyan Tree Gallery executive director Claire Chiang, who co-chaired the Romancing Singapore festival earlier this year. But she worries about the proportion of singles having multiple partners.<br><br>The 51-year-old said: 'It reflects a certain shallowness towards relationship commitments and a lack of capacity for self-restraint.<br><br>'Premarital sex has become merely a pastime.'<br><br>While many singles do not shy from doing it, most prefer doing something else.<br><br>Three-quarters would rather go out with friends, read or watch television.<br><br>Engineer P.T. Chua, 33, confesses to preferring computer games to bedroom games with his girlfriend of four years.<br><br>'Maybe it's because we have been together for some time, and the excitement is no longer there,' he said, with a sheepish grin.<br><br>'When I'm home from work, I'm quite tired and not really in the mood. I'd rather just chill out by playing my computer games.'<br><br>http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/to...212078,00.html?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
