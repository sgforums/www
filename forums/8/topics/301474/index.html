Mary chuckled.<br><br>"yes, those noobs cant handle big cases like this, all they ever do is hand out parking tickets." John said as he opened up a folder, "I've been tracking this case for months, and I've been watching the latest victim for the past few weeks, I have good reason to believe that her husband Jake is the murderer."<br><br>"why would you think that?" asked Mary, if she was concerned at all, she didnt show it, she just wanted to do her job and go home.<br><br>"for money, of course." John said with a sneer.<br><br>"money? but it says here in your documentation that Jake comes from a rich family, heh heh.

His bedsheets were drenched in his sweat, he was dreaming of his dead wife again.<br><br>The man, the one armed man, the murderer of his wife, his silhouette still vividly appearing in his mind . Jake was losing his mind, the murder of his beloved wife was too much to bear, he started sobbing.<br><br>"why is this happening?" Jake sobbed. His soft sobbing was suddenly and rudely drowned out by police sirens. There was a loud crash in his house, someone had broke down the door.<br><br>"THIS IS THE FBI!" screamed detective John, his handgun pointed at Jake.<br><br>"please help me, my wife was murdered, when I came home there was a man in my house, he had a..."<br><br>"shut the fuk up and put your hands where I can see them!" John screamed.<br><br>"are you suggesting that I killed my wife? how dare you." Jake replied in anger, he seems to be saying that alot the past few days, everyone seemed to think he murdered his wife. He had called the police but they didnt give him any answers, and now this, it was too much for him.<br><br>"THIS IS MADNESS!" Jake screamed in anguish.<br><br>"madness?" detective John said with a sneer.<br><br>"THIS IS SPARTA!!!!"<br><br>with a swift kick to the stomach John laid Jake low as he moved in to handcuff him.<br><br>"this is detective John, I have the situation under control, over." he said on his radio, but he was not prepared for what was coming.<br><br>with inhuman strength born from fury, Jake grabbed John's right hand and flipped his arm over, dropping his gun from his grip as he bent his arm.<br><br>"what the....suspect is resisting arrest!" John screamed into his radio. Being a seasoned detective, he was no novice to fighting, as the initial surprise died down, John did a sideways flip and loosened Jake's grip on his arm, as he delivered a sweeping kick to Jake's calf and brought him to the ground. John dashed for his fallen gun but Jake crept back up with incredible speed, an insane look on his face, an<br>kicked the gun away from John.<br><br>"I repeat, suspect is resisting arrest, need assistance!" John managed to say into his radio before a Round House Kick sent it flying out of the window. John managed to dodge the kick in time but Jake came on again with a tornado kick.<br><br>"whoa are you fuking kidding me, you pulling a 540 on me?" John was impressed and angry at the same time as he landed on his back from the kick. Jake moved to pick up the gun and pointed it at John, who raised up his hands.<br><br>"Do not shoot! I'm the FBI! you fool!" John threatened.<br><br>"I did not kill my wife!" Jake screamed in anguish. At this moment more footsteps sounded at his house. Jake realized what was happening, he was going to be arrested. with only a few seconds to think, he jumped out of the window of his 2 storey house.<br><br>"He went out the window, release the hounds!" shouted detective John.<br><br>Just then, a huge explosion lit up the nigh sky. and all went black for John.<br><br></div>

The innumerable buildings Ominously lining up the city streets at the only things that looks on at the passers by with sympathy. Tonight someone would be leaving the city. Jake drove past numerous firetrucks and police cars he figured was heading for the direction of  the explosion, luckily non of them noticed him, intent on getting to the scene.<br><br>"ouch what the bloody hell happened." John rubbed his aching head as he woke up from his coma, the last thing he remembered was a huge explosion leveling the house and sending him flying. "my head hurts so much that its as if I read a whole paragraph of meaningless metaphors, holy shit." As his vision managed to focus,  he realized that the entire FBI squad who came with him for assistance was dead in the explosion. "You will pay for this Jake, I swear." John said through clenched teeth.<br><br>Back at the FBI headquarters, the scene was chaotic, almost every agent was frantically keying in data or retrieving information.<br><br>"we have a fugitive on the run, he has murdered an entire FBI team, mobilize all available resources, Mary I want a list of all the locations Jake has lived in in the past 10 years, the rest of you issue a emergency code alert to all airports for the detainment of the suspect when his passport shows up anywhere in this country.
