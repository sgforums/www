            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>The Ouija Board is perhaps the most controversial method of spirit communication, mostly because it can be used by anyone and requires no special powers to navigate. This may be why most psychics discourage the use of the board. It enables the average person to produce “medium-like” effects without a psychic actually being present.<br><br>Regardless, the Ouija has been both condemned and praised in equal amounts as a way to communicate with the spirits and as a direct link to the dark side. Many people ask if these boards are dangerous, but I think that this depends on the person. In all honestly, I can’t offer many clear-cut observations on the power of the Ouija because my own experimentations with it have been uneven (at best). When asked, I usually just tell people that they probably shouldn’t mess with it unless they are prepared to handle whatever consequences may come up.<br>USING THE OUIJA BOARD<br>The Ouija should be used by at least two persons at a time and can be placed on the laps of the sitters, or on a small table within easy reach of everyone. The sitters place their fingers lightly on the edges of the planchette, being careful not to push down too hard. If you should ever take part in a Ouija session (or witness one) where you can hear the sound of the planchette scraping on the board, or it seems to be unusually loud as it moves, there is probably something fishy afoot. What this means is that someone is accidentally (or purposely) guiding the pointer and the session should be stopped immediately. Any information received from the board is bound to be false.<br><br>Once the session begins, it is recommended that the sitters invite a spirit to come through and speak to them. The sitters are advised to add that they wish to communicate with a “willing” spirit. The reason for this is that it’s been suggestedthat negative spirits will try to come through and confuse the sitters. For this reason, it’s best to state up front what you are looking for from the session.<br><br>Then, the questions should be asked and repeated in a slow and deliberate manner. Only one question should be asked at a time, and by a single person, to avoid confusion. The answers to the questions will be theoretically spelled out using the planchette.<br><br>But how does it work? Many feel that the answers provided by the board are simply the unconscious movements made by the people touching the pointer. If this is true, then the Ouija is operated by nothing more than the power of suggestion. But how can we explain the accounts of the Ouija providing information that none of the sitters could have possibly have known?<br><br>On that note, it has been suggested that the Ouija is actually powered by the psychic portions of the human mind, spelling out answers to questions either by precognition, telepathy or unknowing communication with spirits. By the latter, the board would be a mystical tool that is guided by the sitter’s unconscious movements, which are in turn manipulated by the spirits. On the other side of the same coin, many researchers use the Ouija as a way to experiment with the effects of PK, noting the movement of the planchette as it is propelled by the human mind.<br><br>Some people believe that it isn’t that complicated though. They believe that the planchette is actually moved by the direct force of spirits, guiding the hands of the sitters. The Spiritualists believed this, as do some ghost hunters today, feeling that the Ouija is an important tool in spirit contact, both good and bad.<br><br>And this brings us to the reputation of the Ouija, which has become pretty bad over the years, especially with parents and religious groups. They often cite the overwrought (and usually unsubstantiated) cases of so-called “spirit possession” that occur after teenagers use the Ouija. Apparently, malevolent forces, masquerading as good spirits, possess children and impressionable adults and cause emotional damage (and even suicide) among those who dare to use the board. (cue the spooky music!)<br><br>But how common is this really? Not nearly as common (and I have yet to see an authentic case) as our society watchdogs would have you think. However, I will say that I think it is possible for people to become dependent upon, or even obsessed with, the Ouija. Of course, with that in mind, it’s possible for people to become dependent on or obsessed with anything, like religion for instance.<br><br>In the end, I am not going to say that it’s impossible for spirits to come through the Ouija board and cause problems for the users. There is really no way that I (or anyone else) can make a definitive statement on that. At this point, there are simply too many variables as to how the board even works, let alone if it is a doorway to the other side.<br><br>But what do you think as a well-rounded reader? Is the Ouija a harmless toy or a way to way to communicate with the dead? You will have to judge that one for yourself for now, but I do want to leave you with a couple of thoughts.<br><br>Frankly, I don’t believe that the Ouija is as harmful as some would have you believe. I don’t believe there is any inherent danger in its use, especially as it does seem to be a way to test and perhaps even generate PK. However, I don’t recommend that it be used by teenagers, overly emotional people or anyone not equipped to handle what may occur as a result of the board’s use. There are many accounts of people using the Ouija and then discovering that “things begin to happen”. Some of these experiences are alleged voices and the movement of objects in their home. Those who believe the Ouija achieves spirit contact will say that the person used the board unprotected and thus attracted “lower entities”. It’s possible though (as mentioned) that the Ouija induces PK effects and that the lingering activity has more to do with the generation of psychic activity that ghosts. For this reason though, people who are overly excited should avoid the use of the board.<br>Click Here!<br><br>Troy Taylor is the author of The Ghost Hunter's Guidebook: The Essential Guide to Ghost Research - Click on the Book for More information!<br><br>It’s possible (and this is my own personal belief) that the Ouija works as a sort of “lightning rod” for activity. The forced concentration of the sitters incites a PK effect that possibly creates a directed energy, or perhaps even opens a sort-of “doorway” to the other side. I have seen the Ouija used as a way to stir up activity in a haunted location as the energies of the sitters are directed toward a common purpose.<br><br>So, yes, I do believe that the Ouija is a paranormal tool. However, I don’t think that it works as a legitimate tool to be used in ghost investigations. Be cautious with it, but don’t be afraid to try it out in your immediate circle of researchers. Keep careful notes of your sessions and you might be surprised what comes from them.<br><br>Just remember that the use of the Ouija will most likely not inspire confidence from anyone who contacts you about an investigation. With that in mind, I don’t recommend (no matter what you do on your own time) showing up at their house with a Ouija board tucked under your arm!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>by Dale Kaczmarek<br><br>The Ouija board has been used by thousands of people for spirit communication and is very similar to automatic writing, the only difference between the two being the absence of the board itself in automatic writing. Both forms of communication are very dangerous; as are seances, because they are usually uncontrolled forms of communications. In other words, the individuals that use these channels are usually novices and are unaware of the possible dangers that await!<br><br>A controlled situation would be where a psychic, medium or clairvoyant is present. This way the medium could sense if any dangers are present and close off the communication before any harm was done.<br><br>The Ouija board is just a piece of compressed wood, sold at virtually all toy stores and occult supply and book stores. Ouija is a combination of two words: "oui" and "ja" which mean "yes" in French and German respectively. The board itself is not dangerous but the form of communication that you are attempting often is.<br><br>Most often the spirits whom are contacted through the Ouija are those whom reside on "the lower astral plane". These spirits are often very confused and may have died a violent or sudden death; murder, suicide, etc. Therefore, many violent, negative and potentially dangerous conditions are present to those using the board. Often times several spirits will attempt to come through at the same time but the real danger lies when you ask for physical proof of their existence! You might say, "Well, if you're really a spirit, then put out this light or move that object!" What you have just done is simple, you have "opened a doorway" and allowed them to enter into the physical world and future problems can and often do arise.<br><br>I would strongly advise against the use of the Ouija, automatic writing or seances. If you don't happen to be lucky or unlucky enough (depends on how you look at it) to contact any ghosts, then if nothing else, you could become emotionally attached or dependent on the board's advice. This can be psychologically adverse on the psyche as you will attempt to get more and more information out of the board and you could actually just be using the board as an avenue to the inside of your own mind without realizing it. In other words, you could be asking questions of the board and then your subconscious mind would be using the planchette to answer your own questions! This often happens to those people who use the board by themselves.<br><br>I believe the following cases are true examples of what could happen to those who continue to use the board or become obsessed or possessed!<br><br>Ouija Board's Evil Spell Still Lives in Our House<br>(National Examiner, 31787 by Robert Stamper)<br><br>I invited a foul horror into my house with a Ouija board. My brother and I got no results when we started to use the psychic device, but suddenly the message indicator mysteriously began to move. The first thing the board told us was that the message was being sent by Seth. Then I made the tragic mistake of telling the board to prove it was real by doing something supernatural. The results were startling and scary. The board told us that the grandfather of one of my best friends would die in a week. The chandelier in the room began to shake violently and the chimes rang like pieces of metal being smashed together. The room became as cold as ice and we were shivering, though the thermometer read 70 degrees. The horrible stench of death filled the room and we couldn't stop gagging and coughing.<br><br>Suddenly, the noises stopped and the room was as quiet as a cemetery in the middle of the night. My brother and I looked at each other in terror. We opened the windows to get rid of the stink or rotting flesh and told each other we'd forget the whole thing. But a week later the grandfather of one of my best friends died just as the board has predicted! And from time to time the chandelier would rattle, the room freeze and that awful smell return. I couldn't take it any more. I threw the board away and told my mother about the experience. She told me that once you tamper with a Ouija board, its evil spell will remain forever. And to this day, those terrifying tremors shake the house and the stench of death fills the room.<br><br>To be con't.....<br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Ouija Board Summons Demons<br>(The Sun, 12986)<br><br>A simple Ouija board became a passport to Hell for a family that accidently summoned a demon into their living room. "I thought it might have been the Devil himself," says John Ravens, father of the tormented family. "When it was over, we were all bleeding and had severe burn marks. Our living room was a disaster area."<br><br>"It was supposed to be a joke," says Gloria, the girl's mother. "We were going to make believe we were talking with the spirit world."<br><br>Little Lynda, her nine-year-old brother Ronald, and their parents gathered around the board for what they thought was going to be an evening of fun at their home in a Toronto, Canada suburb. "We were just playing around with it when suddenly the planchette that spells out answers began moving by itself," says John. "We were all scared, but then I thought maybe one of the kids was up to tricks. We started asking questions, and this spirit began speaking to us. "Then it asked if it could visit with us. By this time, I was sure someone was playing a joke, and I said yes," he adds.<br><br>That's when the nightmare began. "The demon appeared within seconds," says John. "It spun around the room overhead, laughing and cursing at us. "It was surrounded by a ring of fire and the room became so hot, it was like an inferno from Hell." The family describes the demon as red and black with scaly skin and horns. It also had giant bat wings. "Then it suddenly swooped down and attacked us," recalls John, horror flickering over his features. "It started biting each of us on the face and arms. "We tried getting up and running for the door, but every time we did, the creature started clawing us. It was so fast, we couldn't escape from it."<br><br>Lynda and brother Ronald were picked up repeatedly and hurled across the room. As they lay helplessly on the floor, the creature pounded on their chests and heads. "It had hooves that dug into my children's faces and skin, marking them badly," says Gloria. The attack lasted for more than an hour before the horrifying demon vanished as quickly as it first appeared. The children were screaming and crying as John pulled them out of the house and drove to a nearby hospital, where they were treated for cuts and burns.<br><br>Demons Use Ouija Board As Gateway To Take Over Soul<br>(The Sun, 22884) by Lewis Clifford.<br><br>Terrifying demons freed from other dimensions are preying on helpless human victims. And the gateway used by the grotesque monsters is being kept open by innocent toying with Ouija boards and other tools of the occult, top medical and religious experts caution.<br>"They are vile creatures of the night," warned Dr. Alberto Gonzalez, of the Pan American Institute of Health. "They exist. They can possess the bodies of their victims and cause normally gentle, nonviolent people to commit outrageous crimes. They can assume other forms some quite ghastly.<br><br>"And they are among us in many instances solely because of these sinister toys called Ouija boards." Gonzalez, a psychiatrist and parapsychologist, claims he has found demonic links to several cases of cattle mutilation and human vampirism in Central America.<br><br>Says the Rev. Morris Cerullo, president of World Evangelism and author of The Black Side Of Satan, Creation House, Carol Stream, Illinois, 1973. "Many people have related to me weird tales of answers given by the Ouija board. This and other occult games may seem intriguing, but the implications are serious and not to be tampered with. They can lead to dangerous waters indeed.<br><br>"Use of a Ouija has even led to violence and even to murder..." Dr. Marta Prohazka of Fairfax, Virginia, is also convinced that spirits can play terrifying destructive games with human behavior. During her practice as psychotherapist and psychoanalyst, she realized that many patients she had considered "hallucinating paranoid schizophrenics" might instead merely be in touch with something invisible to her but visible to them."I came to understand that another plane, or dimension or existence interrelated with our plane or visible manifestation," she said. "By training and expanding consciousness, some individuals gain entrance into that invisible dimension. It seems to some like a window into heaven.<br><br>"I also learned that contact with the other dimension can be dangerous, especially if a psychically sensitive person loses his emotional harmony. The window into heaven can then become a window into Hell."<br><br>Millions of the plastic oracles are in use in American households, nevertheless. And the eerie messages from beyond they have spelled out have been credited or blamed for marriages, divorces, sickness, misery, mystery or murder. Psychic and medium Anne Rose told the Sun: "Horrible demons have definitely been released by the Ouija board.<br><br>"The Ouija board is a vehicle which makes it easy for negative spirits and demonic forces to enter this plane of existence." The Merrillville, Indiana clairvoyant cautioned that evil spirits or demonic forces often gain the trust of people experimenting with Ouija boards by answering several questions truthfully and providing predictions. "Once they have gained the trust of their victims, it is easy for the entity to move in and take over either by strongly influencing that person, or by outright possession," she said. People who are untrained and unsophisticated in the field of the paranormal and supernatural should never play with devices such as the Ouija board, according to the clairvoyant.<br><br><img src="http://www.horrorseek.com/horror/dracula/images/ghostface.gif"></strong></div>

The sitters are advised to add that they wish to communicate with a “willing” spirit. The reason for this is that it’s been suggestedthat negative spirits will try to come through and confuse the sitters. For this reason, it’s best to state up front what you are looking for from the session.<br><br></div></blockquote>wat de heck iz “ to 8217?!<br><br>4D numbers ah?</div>
