            <div class='col-md body'>A superpower? Yes and no. A lot depends on how you define superpower. If you are talking about dollars and cents such as GDP, economic growth, population (talent pool), n.o of industries, trade and commerce etc then yes, India will one day become a super power.<br><br>There is another definition of a superpower, which depends on the quality of life the people in a country lead. Whether basic amenities such as food, water, education, shelter, safety etc are available to the common man. Going by this definition, India can never become a superpower. Among the 1 billion population only a selected few are doing very well, the rich are getting richer and the poor are, well, staying poor. There are still million of people who consider food, water and shelter (things we take for granted) a privilege. There are millions who die of diseases, out of poverty, have no access to education.<br><br>Corruption is highly rampant, can be found at all levels of the society. From politicians to the traffic police man, to the bank clerkÂ…every one expects bribes (in one form or the other). Public sector (Telephones, postal service, electricity, water et etc) is worst. The urban infrastructure such as public transport, airlines, sanitation etc are rudimentary. The Indian railways (largest network in the world) is antiquated and one of most non-safe in the world. India has a dozen or so nuclear reactors that produce power but power cuts are something that has become a part of every day life.<br><br>SafetyÂ…thatÂ’s unknown. People would rather keep quite when a crime is committed than report it to the police because the police force is considered to be worst than gagsters. Law and order is haphazard. ItÂ’s not unusual for murder trials to last for 10 years. Its' even not unusual for murderers to roam the streets freely because they managed to Â“buyÂ” the legal system. Do you know that in some states of India, certain M.Ps (minister of parliament) have criminal records, like murder, theft etc?<br><br>India has umpteen numbers of religion, caste, tribes etc. Each of this ethnic group places their own agenda in front of national interests. Do you know there are political parties that come into power just by making use of religion and caste as a propaganda tool? Communal riots are not unheard of.<br><br>I can just go on and on and onÂ…Â…Â…<br><br>To put it simple, life for the common man is how it has been for the past 5 decadesÂ…Â…..a total struggle. So will India become a superpower? In my eyesÂ…..not until the common man can lead a safe and decent life. Corruption has to rooted out brutally, law and order restored with an iron-hand, public infrastructure has to be improved, basic amenities have to made easily and readily available to the masses, superficial trailts such as religion ,caste have be weeded out from nationalpoliciesÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….so much has to be done before India can become a true superpower.<br><br>And who the hell am I to comment on IndiaÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â…someone who was born and bred in India for 17 years.<br><br></div>

India is set to receive $12 billion this year as against $8.3 billion in 2005-06," Commerce Minister Kamal Nath told reporters in New Delhi at the weekend.<br><br>In July this year, FDI inflows increased by a record 259 per cent to $1.16 billion as against $324 million in July 2005. Nath said, adding these investments were only equity components and did not include reinvested earnings by the companies.<br><br>The single largest FDI so far this year was by Barclays Bank of Singapore, which brought in $380 million.<br><br>Quoting Reserve bank of India data, Nath said India has received $50.1 billion of FDI since 1991. of this, $16 billion has come in since April 2004.<br><br>The RBI figures include both equity investments and reinvested earnings, he added.<br><br>The Minister, who was upbeat about FDI flows, said manufacturing sector was the major recipient of FDI and the growth in inflows were an important element of government’s plan to increase the share of the sector in the economy to 25 per cent from 17 per cent. In manufacturing, $668 million has come in as equity from abroad so far this fiscal.<br><br>Nath said all organs of the government must work in cohesion to make India an attractive investment destination so as to compete with other countries such as China, Thailand and Malaysia.</div>
