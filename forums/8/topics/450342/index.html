              script writing is an art...but it can be learnt as well....
              
              first, u start by selecting and reading a good script that you are familiar and interested with (preferably one that has won awards).....highlight any memorable lines u come across..how each scene/plot, each character develops, how each flow converge with one another..write down afterthoughts if u have any....
              
              next, u find an award winning film that was based on the script...its ok if they are adapted...to get the feel of how the script was played....never mind about the styles of director, acting dynamics, costumes, props...focus on the differences between the film and the script that you have read....this is very useful as you write your own script once you have some ideas and how you would like it to flow in real life....
              
              keep developing, find all ways to develop till each scene achieved your heart's desire...till the end of the script....
              
              This will not make you an overnight genius, but it is one of the best way to begin script writing...best of luck!

              <p>Freelance writing can be creative , fulfilling and a lot of fun, with excellent money to be made as well. What's more, anyone can become a writer. No special qualifications or experience are required.</p>
              <p>The market for writers is huge. In Britain alone there are around 1,000 daily. Sunday and weekly papers, and more than 8,000 magazines. Many of the stories and articles that they publish are supplied by freelances. Then there are books, theatre, flims, TV radio...</p>
              <p>With such demand, there's always room for new writers. But as Susan Metcalfe, Chairman of Britain's leading writing school The Writers Bureau, explains, "If you want to enjoy the rewards of seeing your work in print,one thing you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must</span> have is proper training." </p>

              <p>Students receive one-to-one guidance from tutors, all working writers themselves. From the start they are shown how to produce saleable work. 'At the Bureau our philosophy is quite simple' says Susan Metcalfe. 'We will do everything in our power to help students become published writers.'</p>
              <p>The course comes on fifteen days' free trial. In addition, the Bureau offers a remarkable money-back guarantee - if you haven't earned your tuition fees from published writing within one month of completing the course, your money will be refunded in full.</p>
