            <div class='col-md body'>To love someone and not being love in return is painful.. but to have that person keep mentioning about her ex is even worst.<br><br>When she needs you, you are there for her.. yet she tells you that she hope you can be the someone to comfort her. Is this an act of selfishness??<br><br>Woman with their frequent change in mood, attitude and whatever.. how can guys go about to tolerate their multi-personalities? When you give them concern, she feels that you are stepping overboard as a friend. When you stop giving them the attention, she thinks that you have a flickle heart. What is it exactly that woman wants?? We guys are also human being and we have our needs and wants. To show love and concern for that special someone whom might not be your gf yet, is that wrong? What is this love game all about?<br><br>At times, it might be good to love no one other than yourself. To pamper yourself with all the goodies that you want. To live life without a care.. the need to be concern of someone else's welfare. There would be no heartache, no worries, no pain and of coz no gain.. life is not suppose to be this way, but is this the best solution to healing all the heartaches??<br><br>Does anyone knows how to just love yourself and close your heart to others??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahahaha.........I totally understand how you feel. Once loved a woman so deeply that I could hardly forget about her. Yes....It was painful to love someone and no get back the love in return. But then......at least you tried your very best to work things out.....and I DID!!!....so I just felt that maybe she dun deserve my love at all if she dun appreciate it. It takes both hands to clap.<br><br>Just carry on loving others.....and one day u will find someone who will return the love to you. Well....that is what i am trying to do at the moment......kind of hard at first.......but it will be unfair to others to hold back your love because of one failed relationship.<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</div>

Because it's silly!<br><br>Then why hide yourself from love?  You don't think it's worth it?!

            <div class='col-md body'>I share your sentiments, after two times, and realizing that I still have thoughts of my ex-gfs. I learned that love is not about finding a person to relieve you from the sorrows of losing someone or to give you those concessions of kissing, hugging or caressing, and I would hope that love is about finding back myself and tell myself that I can devote myself to loving another person again. Because there is hope, we should seek to find true love....<br><br>That is why I wrote the Thus Speak Prodigal Part II, for it is dedicated to those who had lost faith in love and hope that they would find true love someday...<br></div>

If she doesn't love you, all you can do is to hold back your feelings for her &amp; not shut your heart to other gals.<br><br>i think i used to love this guy, i'm not sure if i really loved him at all because he don't love me or whatever. i noticed we've grown apart &amp; i don't like certain character traits of his &amp; mainly because he simply doesn't care for me in that manner. do i wait for him to come around? what happens if he doesn't? stay single &amp; shut all opportunities &amp; possibilities from other guys? that would be the height of stupidity for me. he doesn't love me, period. it took me a long while to accept the fact, my heart grieves a little but it will learn to accept it &amp; hope springs eternal that i'll meet someone else. even after i meet someone special, i'm sure he'll still have a place in my heart unless he becomes someone so hideous in moral character.<br><br>so Luf, stop feeling so melancholic, weekend's here, cheer up!  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette..<br>Thanx for your concern.. I appreciate that. I had done something I regretted.. declaring my love for her. Now while waiting for her reply.. I am beginning to regret having done it. Do I really love her.. can I really bear to give up on her when I said I have love her. I feel that I am just in need of someone to fill the emptiness in my heart.. as someone point out to me. This is not really fair to her.. I feel that I am using her. I hate myself.. but then again, she have yet to tell me her side of the story.<br><br>Yes, I have decided that I am not one who can love someone else.. at least not right now. I am embarking on my career, I have got a great job. In a stressful job.. I do not wish to burden someone else with my problem. I rather isolate myself, bury myself in my job. If possible, I would rather leave this place, away from my family, my friends.. everyone I know and start my life somewhere.. somewhere where no one knows me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey Luf,<br><br>i just like your nick so much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> why never "test, test" waters first before giving her a straight declaration of love. well, now's the awkward period where you awaits her reply. i'm no expert on love, but i think you should treat the matter lightly, tease her a bit but watch your step, you wouldn't want to go overboard with the "light" technique. find a way to lessen the tension, let her know that you're still willing to go with the status quo if she can't accept you as her boyfriend, that's if you think you can take it.<br><br>call her to chat about things you would have chatted before your "i love you" bombshell.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> hee hee ... ..., give her some breathing space, make her feel at ease, that you're still the same good reliable friend she had for years. sometimes the shock of a love declaration from a good friend can shock the living daylights out of a gal. who knows? once she get used to the idea of you loving her, she may find that she loves you too. if that didn't happen, please remember it is not the end of the world, believe me there's an ocean of fish out there just waiting for you.<br><br>again, best of luck &amp; shut your heart if another opportunity comes knocking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Colette..<br>I had test water already.. and she had expected this to come, but perhaps a bit too soon. The problem is not whether she can accept me or not. It's with me.. I dunno my true feeling for her. To love her, be committed and be faithful.. am I able to do all these? If not what rights do I have to tie her to me? To tell someone you love her, you must be willing to accept the person as she is, the goods and the bads, be there for her, to care and be concern about her. The word is a commitment by itself.. which I am unsure if I can standby that commitment. I wish for her to reject me.. to clear my guilt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>darling Luf,<br><br>sorry couldn't resist, your nick is just so ... ah, i don't know how to put it. it's a happy nick, just typing it with various adjectives in front of it is enough to make me laugh.<br><br>okay, now you're confusing me. you tested the waters, she expected it but not so soon, then you get COLD feet? huh?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>well, i guess it's just that you would want the relationship to work if she's interested in you too, but you don't know if you can be committed to it. hey Luf, you're dating to find out if you're compatible, it's not a life sentence to date. yes, you've feelings of love for her, whether these grow into full-fledged mature adult love or dies a natural death when you find out that both of you aren't so compatible after all, i don't think it's wrong to end it, amicably preferably of course.<br><br>you know, nowadays, people don't usually let others get close to them, we'll let others get as close as we want them to. furthermore, sometimes we project an image that we know others will approve but it's simply isn't us. so, dating allows you to really get to know each other &amp; if you can't accept the new things you're bound to learn about each other, i think it's better to let go rather than compound the initial mistake by marrying.<br><br>anyway, i think you're too far ahead of yourself, why look for problems where none exists yet? if she accepts you, enjoy the first flush of love for once this honeymoon period is over, you ain't getting it back. and if your love each other flourishes, you'll be hearing wedding bells soon. or am i making things worse for you by mentioning the "Marriage" word?<br><br>my apologies if i sound flirty with your nick.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 11 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>audlenelee,<br>since one fallen for his/her good friend and the feelings are mutual, go for it! No need to worry about the friendship going sour should the r'ship dun work out. Isn't it the case that when a couple gets together it is because they like each other and started off as friends? Or am I too out of touch with the way most relationships are nowadays? Anyway I will go for it if it happens to me. No point letting go of a potentially good match.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What a girl really wants ? Subjective but most of my girl friends have very simple requirements  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In fact I find that it is me who expect too much.<br><br>And some girls are just too confused with what she wants. I met this girl who told me she wanted to concentrate on her studies, who told me army guys are immature, those in army should not go into r/s blah blah blah. But after 1 month, she was attached to an army guy ! hahaha And when I asked her why, she replied, "Try lor, see how long we last"<br>??????? I really dunno how much I can trust her when she is telling me things now.<br><br>Love.<br>Personally, I think it is difficult to differentiate between Love and Lust for us guys, hahaha, maybe only me. Sometimes I just wish that I am blind, so that I can see things with my heart and not my eyes. And one way which i find effective to differentiate between Love and Lust is to ask yourself, "if you are blind, will you still love her ?" If the answer is no, it is Lust. If the answer is yes, well you are on the right track  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But dun lie to yourself.<br><br>Luf, I personally think that you should not express yourself before you can be sure of your own feelings. I made the same mistake myself once. I really regretted expressing myself. My brain had been telling me that this girl is not for me, but my hearts just wanna try ..... she is pretty and very attractive .... *sigh* how i wish i am blind.<br>And i understand how you feel when you say "hope she will just reject me", me, like you, sometimes just cannot make the move ... and need her to say "no".<br><br>When 2 persons come together, it is about the sharing of each other's life togather. I finally understood what love is  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I had also discovered that when we are in love, all problems do not seem to be problems. All problems seem to have perfect solutions. When this girl has this shortcoming, you think she will change, you think you can change her, you think she will grow out of it ..... you will find excuses to make it not a problem. Until the honeymoon period is over .... all problems become bigger problems ...<br><br>So I am now more careful  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I not only listen to my heart but also me brain. I am sick of the trial and error ... it's tiring to get in and out of love. Maybe I am too logical now ... i will ask my brain first (i used to ask my heart first), if it says "yes" then I will ask my heart  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck !</div>
