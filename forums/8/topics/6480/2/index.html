            <div class='col-md body'>If you love someone, you'll want the best of everything for that someone.<br><br>Men who perceive women as 'emotional creatures' or having multi-personalities do not realize the reason behind it. Women are more prone to expressing themselves as compared to men who think that it is a sign of weakness to do such a thing. Essentially, both men and women want similar things in life. All living organisms want to be able to survive, feel secure etc. And everyone has different views about that. The thing is to understand and not to be critical of other peoples' actions or feelings.<br><br>Loving yourself is critical in one's life. Being able to do so is magnificant. However, JUST loving yourself is not enough. One of the hardest things to accomplish is to both love yourself and others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What is the different between a guy friend and a guy who is after you. Why is there a need to change your attitude when you know he is after you? Why can't you behave in the same way as before.<br><br>Pride.. that is one reason why some guys just won't accept some girl. We want a girl who is intellectual, pleasant looking and good in character. If no one in that category is around, no point settling for anything less. For me, I would also rather dun get attach unless I can find someone in that realm. Anyway, for guys, no hurry.. so long you can be successful in life, enjoy life the way you want it.. why the hurry to be tied down??<br><br>Sometimes when love is not featured in life.. it might be not too bad an idea to just flirt around, play a bit. I believe some innocent fun is alrite.  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Man<br>Most probably you already know what u wanted and gals are very emotional creatures and maybe contradicting. I once told myself that I will only get my first bf when I am only18 but I got my first bf when I am barely 17 after I went to the tertiary institution such is an irony of life when love has its twist and turn. Still at the end of the day, it is the attraction and chemistry of the other one that makes u change ur mind.<br>Having expectations I think is good so u have guideline to know what u want to avoid heartbreaks. Dun go into a relationship because u are lonely or you want someone to love and love you, it is a wrong mentality all in all. Just stay the way you are and if u believe in fate she will be there for u and no one can take away from u.<br><br>Luf,<br>I do hope that this incident have not disheartened u in finding the gal u want. Give yourself sometime to settle down and know what u really want..It is not just the feeling but the overall package. If true love is so easily attained there will not be any heartbreaks in the world...I once ask myself why fall in love if u feel hurt all the time...Now then I realise that is only when u love then U will be hurt by ur loved one. You are still in the midst of building a good career, dun screw it up becos of a woman. Behind every successful man is a woman but a woman as well can bring a downfall of a man. Look at our dear Mr.Sim Wong Ho....he is happily single and so successful that any man will like to be his shoes...set a goal in your life and you will feel satisfied at the end of the whole course of survival...<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>
