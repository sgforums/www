            <div class='col-md body'>Security issues a key priority for Singaporeans according to benchmark Unisys Security Index<br><br>Singapore, 03 October, 2006 - More Singaporeans are concerned about identity theft such as misuse of personal information and credit card theft than they are about terrorism, war and epidemics, according to the benchmark Unisys Security Index.<br><br>Conducted by Synovate for IT Services company Unisys, the survey has been developed as regular measure of levels of concern held by Singaporeans towards a range of security issues across four areas of National, Financial, Internet and Personal Security.<br><br>Â“The nature of security has changed dramatically over the last decade.  In order for businesses and governments to respond to this changing environment it is important to understand the levels and types of concern in the community towards security issuesÂ”, said Scott Whyman, Vice President and Managing Director, Unisys Asia South.<br><br>The benchmark Singapore Security Index indicates that the number one concern is misuse of personal information, followed by other people obtaining credit or debit card information, and thirdly, concerns about a serious health epidemic occurring in Singapore.<br><br>Â“The benchmark Singapore Unisys Security Index stands at 173 out of 300. With a mid-way point of 150/300, the Singapore Index suggests that levels of concern are somewhat elevated.  That said, this is the benchmark Index and we need to see future comparative data to put this rating in contextÂ”, he said.<br><br>In comparison, the equivalent Index results for Australia and New Zealand were 126 and 114 respectively however it was the same as Malaysia which also scored 173.<br><br>The index is achieved by averaging the results of the four key survey areas.<br><br>The individual indices and their results are as follows:<br><br>Â•	National Security Â– 186/300<br>Â•	Financial Security 184/300<br>Â•	Internet Security Â– 136/300<br>Â•	Personal Security Â– 187/300<br><br>Some of the key results for the inaugural Singapore Unisys Security Survey and Index include:<br><br>Â•	81% or an estimated 1.9million people said they were extremely or very concerned about unauthorized access to or misuse of their personal information.<br><br>Â•	80% or an estimated 1.9million Singaporeans said they were either extremely or very concerned about unauthorized access to or misuse of their Credit/Debit card details.<br><br>Â•	73% or an estimated 1.8million Singaporeans were extremely or very concerned about a health epidemic.<br><br>Â•	66% or an estimated 1.6million people said they were extremely or very concerned about the threat posed by war or terror attack.<br><br>Â•	59% or an estimated 1.4million Singaporeans said they were extremely or very concerned about meeting their essential financial obligations including housing rental and other bills.<br><br>Following release of the initial benchmark result, the Singapore Unisys Security Index will be undertaken three times annually from 2007.<br><br>Â“The Unisys Security Survey and Index is a direct reflection of Unisys strategic focus on secure business operationsÂ”, Scott Whyman said.<br><br>Â“Collaboration on security initiatives can create convenience for consumers, reduce costs, promote commerce and improve delivery of public servicesÂ”, he said.<br><br></div>
