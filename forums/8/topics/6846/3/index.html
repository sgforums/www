Kind of more like a ghost story.<br><br>When I was working in this place in ChinaTown in one of those shophouses, there were a few nights I hear the door sensor beeping "ding dong~" when the door wasnt opening at all.<br>one night around 8pm when I was all alone in the office after my boss and his friend went out to eat dinner, I continued my work. At first everything was ok, but then I start to hear the door sensor beeping "ding dong~" every 1-2 minute. Sometimes 2 consecutive beeps. The door didnt opened at all.<br><br>I was starting not to feel right. Then I hear soft voices coming from nowhere.<br>It was like an echo of nonsensical laughters, voices which sound like male yet sound like female, which goes "Huuuu HUuuuu      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> hErr HERr HERr  $%%#@$!@^&amp;^#@".<br>It was like laughing and talking.<br><br>I stood up and walk around to check it out. But I couldnt find the source of the voices. It doesnt seem to come from outside because my office was enclosed and on the third floor. To make things worse, the door sensor keep beeping.<br><br>At first I thought the voice seem to come out from toilet, I went there. The toilet was covered with a big black curtain, and as I started to move closer I feel the tense and fear to find out what maybe behind if I remove the curtain. However my curiousity overruned my fear, and I squeezed all remaining courage to sweep aside the curtain. There was nothing.<br><br>Thinking that I maybe too stressed up, I went back to work.<br>Then the soft laughter came again. And it seemed to come from the air, yet it sounded like coming from behind the wall. It just doesnt have any source direction, unlike sound energy where you know exactly where a sound come from. The laughter just can be heard without knowing where it came from. It went on for a few times.<br><br>Fear gradually grapped me, and I couldnt concentrate my work because I have to worry for what's behind me if I keep looking at the monitor. I stop working and lean myself against the wall, looking out for any unnatural movements, however the laughter and the door sensor beep continued.<br><br>It was then I suddenly hear sounds coming from the main office - Things were being thrown about and chair being pushed around, knocking against the cupboard. I ran to the main office to look inside - still I see nothing. No movements at all.<br><br>I decided that I couldnt take these shits  anymore and I ran downstairs to wait for my boss.<br><br>When my boss came back, he asked what I ws doing downstairs and I told him what happened.<br><br>Then he told me "you're too stressed up. Should go back and rest lah. I have been here for a few years, I didnt feel anything wrong. The door sensor is malfunctioning and tend to go haywire."<br><br>With his reassurance we both went back to the office. Everything returned to normal.<br><br>A few months later we shifted to Aljunied. one day we were fixing the door sensor which was functioning okay, suddenly he told me what I experienced back in ChinaTown was true, and the door sensor wasnt malfunctioning at all. He too experienced many times when the door sensor beeps out of sudden and has heard the laughter I heard and things being thrown about.<br>Worse still he told me that sometimes when he stay overnight sleeping in the office, he hear people speaking to him, and everynight there's an "old man" coming to visit him, then his mind will go blank, as if being possessed. Then during this moment he feel as if he has gone through many conversations yet he is not sure what he is talking about. There were many of them he spoke to, but he just cant remember what he said to them.<br>He said other times he saw someone standing at the staircase sometimes going up the stairs when in fact all the office are locked. He wonder where that person could  have gone to.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 27 February 2002).]</div>

For evil spirits exists in the air and they fake themselves as soul of the dead taking the chance to possess people.<br><br>anyone who has faith enough is allowed to cast out demons in Jesus's name. It is Jesus in authority, not blurblop himself.<br><br>It is Funny to me that you believe the whole hell of the world - ghost, ufo, voodoo,  psychic power, buddhism's power over evil spirit but you refuse to believe exorcism in the name of Jesus.<br>You see you're really narrow-minded, or rather against Christianity.<br>So much for you,who want to know about the "force" of the world and your so called "open-mindedness ".<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 27 February 2002).]</div>

As for blur, i am not if i can believe you, because casting out of demonic forces is like very easy for you. I always know that only people with high authority or very strong in their faith then you can performed this deed. of course i do not know you and your age and other stuffs, but there are other doubts like...<br><br>1. it happned in a house, it should be in a church or holy grounds<br>2. you alone do the casting, a group of people are unable to hold a possessed person let alone you<br>3. reading of bible, there are certain passages to be read and not just any pages you flip to<br>4. she crouched on the floor, funny why she didnt jump at you, unless you are really very blessed and pure in your heart and faith<br>5. it lasted 20 minutes, if i am not wrong the one i saw lasted hr plus and needed alot of ppl to casted it away<br>6. suddenly she went limp and you shook her and she open her eyes and it was her again, this is the worst lie i ever heard, please for god sake, dont lie, the one i saw, the person sleeps for hrs and days in hospital and the person usually don't know what happened to herself.<br><br>Please, dear christians, i am not a believer, but please let me know if what blurblop said is true or is he lying. although i have not the gift of casting demons out, but thank god for giving me a brain.<br><br>As for blur, please think again before posting this type of things, it is very wrong and is a blasphemy and god will take into account of what you have just post. I have seen real ritual before and the way you put it is like you are a very gifted, blessed and holy person. gifts like that don't come easily and what you said really make me doubt about you and whatever you post next time.<br><br>sorry, forget to add this quote...<br></div></blockquote>Dear Obiwan,<br><br>That was what happened.<br><br>The gifts of the Holy Siprit is given to any believer who wants to exercise it and want to recieve it.<br><br>There are many types of demons, some powerful some not so. Yes, if you do not have spiritual foundation, it could attack you too. That too was in the scripture.<br><br>There are some weaker spirits that even before you come because you are a man of God, they will run away first even without you physically casting them out.<br><br>What you have seen may be a powerful one that was in that person a long time and refuse to give up.<br><br>Anyway, Christ's commandment was simple "In my name, you shall cast out demons." That's all.  He did not say must have rituals, you must quote here and there in the bible, must be in holy places etc.<br><br>In the scripture, demons were being cast out everywhere and need not be in Holy Places only. If you want to see more of these phenomenons in real live, invite you to visit LightHouse Church in Tampines on Saturday nights for their healing services.<br><br>Anyway, the experience was a personal matter and whether people believe or not its not my concern as I brought up this matter to tell MCD that it is dangerous to meddle with the other world.<br><br>What do I gain to tell lies?  So if people think I am lying, fine with me too.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> DuH<br><br>------------------<br>yeah yeah yeah, boogie woogie spit it out at <a href="http://www.my77thstreet.com" rel="nofollow">www.my77thstreet.com</a><br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 27 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by blurblop (edited 27 February 2002).]</div>
