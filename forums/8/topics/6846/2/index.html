Got Chiobus (and my secret admire!) wanted to go but NOT FREE?<br><br>4. Meet SHARP DOWNTURN in life. Became a THINKER. (Not very 'FREE' yet, that time 'O' Level... Hehheh... ) And subsequently a RUPTURED DEVIL.<br><br>5. Became a FREE-THINKER because it was 'cool' and inline with my PHILOSOPHICAL THINKING.....<br><br>6. Realised that TAOISM has SO MUCH MORE MEANING to it than just 'PRAY PRAY' and started to READ UP on its STUDIES.<br><br>7. ALMOST BELIEVE I might become a TAOIST, and bump into BUDDHISM. READ up on BUDDHISM and GOT RID of 'DEVIL'. FELT COMPLETE PEACE.<br><br>8. REMINDED as a FREE-THINKER and often DEBATED with OPEN-MINDED CHRISTIANS.<br><br>9. MERGING the INSIGHT of TAOISM, CONTROL of BUDDHISM and OPEN-MINDEDNESS of FREE-THINKER. TRYING to UNDERSTAND the 'path to GOD' through CHRISTIANITY. AS a DEVIL for NOW....</div>

All screaming in pain, but donch know what happened and slept thru the night only when next day the ambulances start arriving.<br><br>Don't mess around with the other side my friend.<br><br>Well, some people might say its my imagination. How can that be if my best friend landed in hospital in burns? My gf challenging my faith in a voice I've never heard b4?

Normally there are 3 types of people who can feel or see this things. 1 being a senior person in their faith, 2 being a person gifted with the powers, 3 being you are having bad karma.<br><br>What blurblop see is of visible events, that mean if you are around, you will be able to see it. I have seen it in a few places.<br><br>1 in a church where the person is possessed is screaming, shouting, and is able to twist like a snake, and of course the pastor and a few others is trying to calm him down by praying, and saying, if i remember correctly, in the name of jesus, i cast you out.<br><br>The 2 event also happened in a church, but i am not sure if it is true for this, the pastor is chasing out so called demons in ppl bodies, and a lot of believer went down to the pastor, and the pastor just placed his hand over their forehead and said something similiar (or speak in tongues) and they all seem to fall over, kind of like fainted.<br><br>3 event from the national stadium, where a pastor heal the crippled, and the blind. Of course, I am not sure if the person is ready blind, or crippled, but seems true to me as the crowd wow in amazement.<br><br>Then of course, there are those invisible to naked eyes stuffs, this i have a few chances seeing them and the most terrible that happened to me is in Pulau Ubin. It was around 5, just before day-break. me and my few friends are walking back to the jetty after a long night of fishing. we were talking and suddenly, i saw something, running fast towards me and past over me, right thru my body. I was sort of stunned and stopped and cold sweat run all over me. the next thing i know is that my friend asked me what happened, why i just stand like that for a few minutes and not hearing them. Until now, I still dun know what happened to me that few minutes.<br><br>I have talk to many people and be it whatever faith they have, they have something uncommon happened or heard before. There are many stories I heard, some i just treated it as stories, others i really believed because the ppl who said are not a person who lied.<br><br>Sorry, took so long to said so many things. What I am trying to said is never ever doubt the existance of the other side, be it they are good or bad. remember "wu feng bu qi lang"...</div>
