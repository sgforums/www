            <div class='col-md body'>Just purely a discussion...<br>Don't argue....<br>Damn, why am I posting so much today lol...<br><br>Heres it....<br><br>- This really pissed me off. A friend showed me a webpage called <a href="http://www.cprxtreme.com" rel="nofollow">www.cprxtreme.com</a>  (not cprextreme.com - the well known gaming site). It was Christian Pirate Radio. No offense to any christians out there -I, afterall, was born a Catholic- , but it's HARDCORE christians like those that make me sick. Why? Cuz everything they do is "Christian". Christian Rock. Christian Radio. Christian website. There's even a ChristianSuperStore.net (I saw the banner while I pondered over <a href="http://www.cprxtreme.com)." rel="nofollow">www.cprxtreme.com).</a>  I MEAN, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DROP THE STUPID CRUSADE. They make people feel like outsiders. If there are any racists left in the world, it's them.<br><br>Your pointers?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I see the potential of this thread to end up as a flaming thread whereby everyone starts throwing verbal abuse on one another, so if there ever is an urge to do that, please don't. Flaming is okay, but not on a sensitive issue like religion, so for those really tempted, please think twice in the name of proper discussion.<br><br>Anyway Tango, I believe that it is really alright for there to be a pirated radio station of that sort. They just happen to be a bunch of enthusiasts who embrace what they like with their entirety, so I don't think there is anything wrong with it. How about I put it this way, if a group of people are very enthusiastic about, maybe an area of science. They are so enthusiastic about it that they have this pirated radio and talk about all their findings and revelations (  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ), and they invite correspondences and similar enthusiasts to join in discussions, contribute and things as such, would you have thought that there was something wrong with that?<br><br>Anyway, the world is like a big bee-hive subdivided into many cells. It doesn't really matter what happens in these individual cells, does it?? As long as the bees can work together effectively and in mutual harmony for the common good of the hive, I think whatever happens inside the individual cells should be made transparent to us.<br><br>Just my pence of thought....<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Ticonderoga:<br>if i kill somebody today and then become christian tomorrow.. will i be forgiven?<br></blockquote><strong>The Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard</strong> (Matthew Chapter 6, Verses 1 to 16):<br><br>"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard.<br><br>"About the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing.  He told them, `You also go and work in my vineyard, and I will pay you whatever is right.' So they went.<br><br>"He went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing. About the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, `Why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing?'<br><br>"`Because no one has hired us,' they answered. "He said to them, `You also go and work in my vineyard.'<br><br>"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, `Call the workers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first.'<br><br>"The workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius. So when those came who were hired first, they expected to receive more. But each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. `These men who were hired last worked only one hour,' they said, `and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day.'<br><br>"But he answered one of them, `Friend, I am not being unfair to you. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the man who was hired last the same as I gave you. <strong>Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous?' </strong><br><br>"So the last will be first, and the first will be last."<br><br>___________________________________________<br><br>* scripture in bold added for emphasis by me, colette<br><br>Notes from the Life Application Study Bible:<br><br>Jesus further clarified the membership rules of the kingdom of heaven Â– entrance is by GodÂ’s grace alone. In this parable, God is the landowner and believers are the labourers. This parable speaks especially to those who feel superior because of heritage or favoured position, to those who feel superior because they have spent so much time with Christ and to new believers as reassurance of GodÂ’s grace.<br><br>This parable is not about rewards but about salvation. It is a strong teaching about <strong>grace</strong>, GodÂ’s generosity. We shouldnÂ’t begrudge those who turn to God in the last moments of life, because, in reality, <strong>no one</strong> deserves eternal life.<br><br>Many people who you donÂ’t expect to see in the kingdom will be there. The criminal who repented as he was dying (Luke 23:40-43) will be there along with people who have believed and served God for many years. Do you resent GodÂ’s gracious acceptance of the despised, the outcast, and the sinners who have turned to him for forgiveness? Are you ever jealous of what God has given to another person? Instead, focus on GodÂ’s gracious benefits to you and be thankful for what you have.<br><br>___________<br><br>Er, please read part 2 below   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> thanks<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 30 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>... Part 2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As most of you know, there are always qualifications in the bible, so here goes:<br><br>from Matthew Chapter 7, Verse 21 to 23:<br><br>Â“Not everyone who says to me, Â‘Lord, Lord,Â’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, Â‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name and in Your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?Â’ Then I will tell them plainly, Â‘I never knew you. Away from Me, you evildoers!Â’ Â“<br><br>______________________________<br><br>Notes from the Life Application Study Bible:<br><br>Some self-professed athletes can Â“talkÂ” a great game, but that tells you nothing about their athletic skills. And not everyone who talks about heaven belongs to GodÂ’s kingdom. Jesus is more concerned about our <strong>walk</strong> than our <strong>talk</strong>. He wants us to <strong>do</strong> right, not just <strong>say</strong> the right words. Your house (which represents your life 7:24) will withstand the storms of life only if you do what is right instead of just talking about it. What you do cannot be separated from what you believe.<br><br>Jesus exposed those people who sounded religious but had no personal relationship with him. On Â“that dayÂ” (the day of judgment), only our relationship with Christ Â– our acceptance of him as Saviour and our obedience to him Â– will matter. Many people think that if they are Â“goodÂ” people and say religious things, they will be rewarded with eternal life. In reality, faith in Christ is what will count at the judgment.<br></div>
