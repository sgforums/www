Do not worry so much about other Christians. If other Christians do not forgive you, pray for them, and hopefully they will realize their mistake and forgive you eventually.<br><br>"For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your Heveanly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins." Matthew 6:14-15<br><br>God will not forgive Christians if they do not forgive others because then we are denying that we are sinners just like everyone else. If you have Christian friends that are not forgiving, alert them to this verse in the Bible and they should be convinced. But remember that we are all human and sometimes forgiving someone is an extremely difficult thing, even if you are a Christian. But the most important thing is to forgive in the end... it does not have to be immediate (better sooner than later though).<br><br></div>

Hey!<br><br>Surprisingly maybe to you, all these threads about Christians are started by those non-Christians u know?<br><br>The following threads :<br><br>"Serving the Lord",<br>"What is Christianity, Really?",<br>"God=Satan, Satan=God?"<br>"Is it good idea to dicuss religion here?"   etc<br><br>These threads  were first started to bombard the Christians.<br><br>TELL ME WHO WAS IN THE WRONG NOW??<br>When they kept telling the Christians to stop it , why don't u tell them to stop it IN THE FIRST PLACE ??????????<br><br></div></blockquote>PoopooMoon...... I think the objective of the forum is for discussion. No doubt some might go one step further and might say something more aggressive. And I don't see those threads as threads started to bombard Christians, why should it? For the most extreme case, the topic on "God=Satan, Satan=God", well, that topic was started off with a rather flawed argument, and after discussion, you are supposed to end up with the conclusion that no, it is not true. Over-reaction will never help in an argument, and it will only tend oil to the already flaming fire. Furthermore, by reacting in such a way, you are actually inviting more people to "flame" you. So my advise, do tone down a little bit, it won't do you good and it won't do any discussion good for anyone to be so agitated......<br><br>Just my pence worth of thought......<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>
