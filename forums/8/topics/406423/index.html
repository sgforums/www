              <p>There is no relation between your being an employee of the company and the alleged theft. They are separate issues.</p>
              <p>The boss can report to the police if he believes you are the thieve. Whether you are still an employee or not is irrelevant.</p>
              <p>What stock is TS referring to?</p>
              <p>The company cannot sue you privately in a civil court because theft is a criminal matter. The prosecution will have the burden of proof to prove that you are guilty of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Just because you were working in the office that day is not very solid proof that you were the thief unless you were the only staff and no one else was there.........</p>
              <p>On your employment issue, since there was no letter of employment given to you, there should be no necessity for you to furnish a resignation letter if you wish to leave the company as well. Just make sure they pay you hor....... If not, then good luck!</p>

              <p>No employment letter, means no contract signed that you are obliged to bear the responsibility for lost stock. Want to quit, just leave. He can't do anything to you.</p>
              <p>If you didn't steal, as a matter of fact, he's slandering you and insulting your morals. That itself is an offence.</p>

              <p>What company is that? The boss never bother to give you employment letter... how long have you been working? stealing the stocks and kena caught via the CCTV is = u gonna go to jail.</p>
              <p>but if you never steal the stocks so your conscious is clear, even he want to sue u or report u to the police, there is no proof so you are safe.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>During the supervisor still around he ask us to void sales to cover for those lost items, and a few staff listen to what the supervisor say, as I'm one of them, after the supervisor had been fired, boss check system ... a lot of items is lost, now boss wanna count everything on me....</p>
              <p>As is like so call I took over this supervisor job, and suddenly all those things lost and all the lose the company made, the boss wanna count on my head...</p>
              <p>Boss even say he got the video showing proof that I'm the one voiding the sales during that time, but not only me still got others staff did and capture in video...</p>

              <p>Just leave. If your boss want to look for anyone, he will have to look for the previous supervisor that left.</p>
              <p>Let the boss decide if he wants to spend even more $$ to fight a court case. You did nothing wrong if it was on the instructions of the previous supervisor.</p>

              <p>Hey, did MOM reply you? My friend also ran into a big bully boss, she and all the fellow workers worked for him to sell some nets card in stations. In the end the boss and supervisor accuse the workers saying that cash vouchers are missing and they sort of use the same tactic like your boss. Threaten the worker with all sorts of bullshit.</p>
              <p>My friend they all went to MOM. Halfway through procession, already preparing for a formal lawsuit, they had no choice but can do nothing because there is no black and white document. They work for the boss thinking it was a formal one, but the boss told them there is no need for document for temp jobs. In the end, the workers worked for nothing. No black and white, no justice.</p>
