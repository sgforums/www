More than 4 weeks ago I returned<br>a faulty RAID controller card to FONNY. The card was less than 6 months old and<br>fully covered by warranty. I was told, that they can not provide an exchange<br>and the card has to be sent in to their distributor as it was not new. Fine,<br>no temporary solution available. I was forced to buy a new card to be able to<br>get access to my data on the harddisk including important work files. They<br>promised me to give me a phone call as soon as they have more information.<br>I gave them my business card.<br><br>So far so good. Today I found time to go to SLS and inquire the status of the card.<br>The one staff at FONNY took a look at the receipt they gave me, then looked in<br>their shelves only to tell me that the card would be still with the supplier.<br>Well, I just asked for the name and the phone number of the "supplier" and what<br>the heck, the same time I saw my box at the shelf behind the desk!!! This<br>damned MF was lying directly in my face. I asked him to give me the box and the<br>card was still the same. Untouched for more than 4 weeks.<br><br>No wonder that this guy disappeared somehow fast and left his colleague talking<br>to me. I was already quite pissed of and asked him for an explanation... The only<br>thing he could tell me was that he did not sign the receipt from 4 weeks ago and<br>the guy who did it will maybe come in 1 hour! I asked him to call his colleague<br>and the next lie: he would not have a mobile phone. Unbelievable! Now that was enough.<br>I asked him if he is the boss and as he declined I asked where I could the boss.<br>No answer. He said he doesn't even have the phone number or name of his boss!!!<br>If the shop would burn down he could not call his boss?! Bullshit! So stupid<br>liars there... I took the broken card together with the receipt and left.<br>This case will go to CASE!<br><br>So beware to buy anything from FONNY. Their warranty is not worth the paper they<br>print it on.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reminds me of a shop i went to.. it's just outside nearest the steps at the traffic lights just under the bridge...<br><br>he quoted me $1250 for a cam... so i said i'll be back the next week and to keep one for me.. i'd pay him cash.. he said okay..<br><br>well, next week, i went and he tried to hit me for "full price" of $1499 (he probably forgot me and thought i was a tourist).. i told him in hokkien that he said he'd keep one for me for $1250 last week and gave him back his business card..<br><br>i went to Hai Chew and bought the same camera for $1290 but they gave me a whole lot of freebies..</div>
