            <div class='col-md body'>Problem is, we often think that pluralism is widely accepted in our society, we think<br>all men have a right to worship what gods they wish, thereby when Christians say<br>there is but one God and push for that, they get clobbered.

We may say that we<br>have a right to worship what gods we will, and that no one has a supreme claim to<br>which is right, yet the teacher in the class would not have the patience towards a<br>child who says that he has an open mind as to whether the capital of France is<br>Washington or Paris. Open-mindedness in every aspect? I don't think so.<br><br>And perhaps that is our division of what is values and what are facts.

I could feel the trees have eyes<br>I used to know this road so well, many a time i was here before<br>But now it seemed so different, the road was no more<br>I was lost, I stopped and looked around<br>I had this eerie feeling, that I was being watched<br>In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"<br>I knew I was not alone, and it wasn not that crazy moon above<br>Oh no... I could feel the trees have eyes<br>Watching me<br>The trees have eyes, watching me<br>Then the sound I didn't wanna hear, howling at the moon<br>Eyes I didn't wanna see, I should have turned around<br>So much louder, the howling was chilling my bones<br>One wolf grown to a dozen, and here I was alone<br>Yellow eyes... they were everywhere... yellow eyes... as I prepared to<br>die<br>Suddenly there she was, in a halo of light<br>Suddenly there she was, silvery black and white<br>The bluest magical eyes staring right into mine<br>Never ever had I seen in a wolf, such a beautiful beast<br>In what is known as "The Devil's Hide"<br>I knew I was not alone, and it was not that crazy moon above<br>Oh no,,, I could feel the trees have eyes<br><br>The morning slowly came, my life about to end<br>Then the wind would change, all but one had left<br>The angelic wolf had stayed, without a word she said<br>Follow me, follow the wolf<br>And so i followed the wolf, up the wooded mountain side<br>Close to the top... she suddenly stopped<br>Sun to the East, man and beast<br>Just two silhouettes... in a landscape never to forget<br>Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the village beneath<br>A few and distant roads all leading away from here<br>Nobody in the streets... decay<br>I must follow the wolf again, I must follow her till the end<br>The end<br>The Wolf had turned around, facing higher ground<br>And there it was... The House of God<br>In awe I looked as time had stopped<br>Follow me<br>I had never seen a church like this before<br>"This Place is terrible" inscribed above the door<br>Like dark decaying teeth, I saw the church within<br>A few distant thoughts, inviting me in to sin<br>Nobody in the church... decay<br>Shrouded in a gloomy light, as if my final night<br>I wonder if God was ever here<br>Or did he turn away in fear, did he turn away in fear?<br><br>Once inside, everything would change before my eyes<br>No more decay<br>Glorious beauty had taken its place<br>But in horror... I watched as the wolf... began its skin to shed<br>I grabbed a silver crucifix expecting evil to be next<br>To the floor it fell, the crucifix, the wolf was no more a beast<br>Instead a lady only dreams can create<br>Creeping deep into the heart I never had<br>"I'll love you forever... never leave"<br>It was love at first sight, in true love there is no wrong or right<br>I didn't care from where she came, just her name...

Yet this pluralist<br>thought is not really prevalent in every aspect of our lives. We may say that we<br>have a right to worship what gods we will, and that no one has a supreme claim to<br>which is right, yet the teacher in the class would not have the patience towards a<br>child who says that he has an open mind as to whether the capital of France is<br>Washington or Paris.

Just as the moon is there although I don't touch it, but at least I see it everyday. As for god, it is basically a blind faith as Devil1976 have put it. Blind not by god or the bible, but blind by your own perception of the world and your own thinking.<br><br>As for faith that is used in normal day life, true, I did not question my teacher or the bus driver, I trust them using my faith in them. But if they make a mistake, i would have find out later. For the teacher, I will inform the school that she is not good. As for the bus driver, I might have died already because by blind faith I trust in him to have a proper license to drive. Imagine god as this bus driver, how sure can you be that he has a license to drive, is god there himself or herself? You trust god is there because of the book which called the word of god is writen by man? You trust by blind faith, that the bible is writen by god-inspired writers? How sure is that, 100%? You trust only because a certain part of the bible moves your soul, touched your heart.<br><br>Don't assume that the bible is the answer to your own weakness and suffering.

But you FORGOT to ADD that SCIENTIFIC BACKUPS or LOGICs are USUALLY the CRITERIA to AUTHORATIVE FAITH? Having BLINDLY adhere to an 'Authorative Belief' doesn't make it much of a DIFFERENCE as to whether you believe in YOUR GOD or MY LORD....? 'A' or 'B'... If BOTH shows AUTHORITY then what's your CHOICE my friend?     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sometimes following one with a STRONGER or HIGHER AUTHORITY doesn't necessarily means the 'right choice'....<br>FACT of LIFE, we cannot do EVERYTHING but live on certain amount of FAITH because otherwise life would be too tedious to move forward... Like you'd said, imagine having to cook your own food, buy your own vegetables and grow your own plants.... You would be LONG DEAD before you get your fruit... Such is the VALUE of URBANISATION and YES, is of FAITH... But NOT BLIND faith... BASED on the CREDIBILITY of SCIENCE and LOGIC, they EXIST... Just imagine yourself boarding a bus where a 3 years old kid is the DRIVER... Would you just casually ride it? Or would your LOGICAL INSTINCT stir up some doubts in you...? THEN I tell you, DON'T THINK... Just BELIEVE.... WOULD YOU? SUCH is the POWER of LOGIC over FAITH... We don't do MANY physical checks for events and things that happen in our lives... And VERY OFTEN those are the SOURCE of ERROR which MIGHT even cause the DESTRUCTION of ONE or MANY others.... BUT we STILL do believe in 'faith'... WHY? Because we need STRONGER LEAP in life... ADVANCEMENT... NOT because of BLIND Faith... NOT GOD.....<br>The 'boards' and 'authorities' we CHOOSE to BELIEVE in.... Depends on the CREDIBILITY of the INDIVIDUAL AUTHORITIES which is a DIFFERENT ISSUE altogether....<br><br>SHEER LUCK? SHEER FAITH? IF I were to throw you into the SEA and you're NOT a SWIMMER.... And NOTHING is to come to your rescue... You can have FAITH that you CAN SWIM... Do you THINK you'll SURVIVE? Or would be the technique of PROPER SWIMMING SKILLS be of BETTER USES to you...?<br><br></div></blockquote>What is Science, what is logic? Aren't they all dependent on faith? Case in point, many years ago, the definitive Science was that the earth is flat. Is the earth really flat? But ppl then embraced that as a fact and stood by it fervently. Now, Science has proven that the earth is round. Is the earth really round? Have u seen the earth in all its round-ness? How sure are you that photos of earth is really earth?<br><br>You are right. Authoritative belief does depend on a very large extent the creditability of the source of information. The fact I am trying to bring out is that there is NO difference between Christians believing in Jesus and you believing that the earth is round. Both stem from authoritative faith.<br><br>You swimming example is very good. If I dun know how to swim, even if I have faith, I will still die. But if I KNOW that I can swim, and have faith that I will make it. I will. Similarly, if you KNOW how to swim but lack the faith the try, you will still die.<br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 19 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 19 February 2002).]</div>

If I believed that Mr Abc is god when nobody has ever heard of him. Now, that IS blind faith. But to believe in someone whom millions have heard about, whom countless have written about, and believed is God. Now that is authoritative faith.<br><br>Case in point. Do you believe Lincoln was once the president of the United States? Why? Were u there when he was the president? Did you get to participate in his presidential campaign? So why do u believe (or know) that he was once the president of the United States? Because millions have heard about him, countless have written about him being the president of United States.

Even if i die in a accident, I know that is something i can't predict. Things do happen, but not neccessary to involve god. What is god anyway, it is just a term to describe something or some beings that we do not know which has control of us human? To christians, of course it means Jesus and company. To buddhists, it means higher beings. To Muslims, another meaning. So who is right? Everyone said they are right, who to believe? If I believe christ, buddhists will said I am wrong, If I believe in Buddhist teaching, christians will said I will go to hell. Are you so sure that god is what the bible said, or the buddhists said?<br><br>I can be 100% sure that your god is not the god of the universe cause I have encounter before. There are things that happened that not god theory can explain everything. Do you know anything about the stealth? Do you know anything about the Roswell incident? Do you know why scientists are trying to sent people to Mars? Do you know why they are building a space station above our planet earth? Do you know about UFO and vistors? Do you know that in the world, people sometimes just go missing?<br><br>I am not saying religion is no good, it is good. You can believe what you want, no one is stopping you. But take a moment tonight and think about the whole universe and human, you will find the universe is so vast and human are just so small. If you think that life only exists on earth, then I am sorry to tell you that your mind and brain is restricted and closed, but maybe to you is good. At least you will be happy living on earth for 70 years and not knowing what you are doing.<br><br>------------------<br>In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.</div>
