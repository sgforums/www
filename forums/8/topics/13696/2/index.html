Case in point, many years ago, the definitive Science was that the earth is flat. Is the earth really flat? But ppl then embraced that as a fact and stood by it fervently. Now, Science has proven that the earth is round. Is the earth really round? Have u seen the earth in all its round-ness? How sure are you that photos of earth is really earth?</strong><br><br>You are CLOSE to hitting the NAIL there... Years back during my younger days, I had PONDERED over these questions (or more like this CONCEPT).... And little did I REALISE that SOMEONE was already WORKING on this CONCEPT.... I LOVE your SENSIBLE STYLE... I shall divide your questions into TWO BRANCHES for now...<br><br>To speak of a TRUTH, SCIENCE just like RELIGIONs COLLAPSE once in a while along HISTORY... Small ones, MAJOR ones... You NAME it, it'd seen them...<br>And YES... The IDEA of SCIENCE is STEM by FAITH... VERY STRONG FAITH.... Just like SOMEONE who might just wake up one day realising that his bed is GONE... Furnitures, family, friends... ALL GONE... He STARTS to PONDER... WHY? SCIENCE faces the SAME NIGHTMARE... Just like in the PAST HISTORY of SCIENCE, the STEM of FAITH within it had been BROKEN.... It SNAPPED, people PANICKED... It's just a matter of how high up the STEM it SNAPPED... And HOW READILY can people learn to ACCEPT IT ONCE AGAIN... Sounds FAMILAR? YES... This is FAITH....<br>And just like MOST RELIGIONs, SCIENCE has its OWN STORY.... SCIENCE's mother is NATURE and father is PHILOSOPHY.... NATURE who gave birth to it.... And a FATHER who shown it the ways.... UNLESS other religions though, SCIENCE has a WEAK STORYLINE... No INTERESTING CHARACTERS like you would see in stories, dramas and fairy tales... No one who would bother to tell you things and talk to you EXCEPT humans...<br>I must ADMIT its WEAK storyline make it one of the most non-user friendly LANGUAGE... But people still 'worship' it just like the SAME REASONS as other RELIGIONs.... 'FRUIT' and 'FAITH'.... BUT UNLIKE other RELIGIONs, its WEAK STORYLINE allows it to be OFFICIALLY BROKEN and RECONSTRUCTED... OVER and OVER again... Not ONLY MINOR ones... But MAJOR ones... RELIGIONs have to ADAPT with TIME too... But they can just make MINOR SHIFTs and COVER-UPs... And when such a situation CANNOT be REACHED? DRASTIC things happen.... FOR it CANNOT fall... It's NOT only about a RELIGION... It's NOT ONLY about EGOs... It's about the POWER and STATUS of SOME.... The HOPE and LIVES of MANY OTHERS.... By the way, what makes human believe that GOD would actually speak of ONLY their LANGUAGES? It's BECAUSE of this SELF CENTRALISTIC mind of theirs... Why don't they REALISE that they are NOT PERFECT creatures...? And they ain't PREFECT NOT because they're NOT GOD.... It's because they don't wanna admit that they AIN'T GOOD ENOUGH....<br>SCIENCE in a sense is a VERY BEAUTIFUL PORTRAY of 'GOD'.... I'd THOUGHT over its SYSTEM... It's just like a HIGHWAY to reaching 'GOD'.... (Half of it... This PASSAGE is AT LEAST a BILATERAL SYSTEM to consider... SORRY... DETAILS shall NOT be DISCLOSED.)<br><br>SORRY.... Very LONG answer to the 1st PART of it... Would try to keep the 2nd PART SHORTER?<br>In my 1st PART I mentioned SOMEONE... That SOMEONE is none other than EINSTEIN and his LAW of RELATIVITY... Prospective things as you see it, can DIFFER from individuals... But ULTIMATELY the IDEA should be the SAME within a SAME REFERENCE SYSTEM.<br>How do you 'REALLY' know this and that...? You DON'T... What is 'REALLY'? What is 'REALITY'? I BET MANY had PONDERED over this before me and GONE BERSERK (eg. is a fish..)... But LUCKILY for me, Einstein was there to SAVE my DAY... He BROKE FAITH, he DARE THINK, only from there he see 'light'? Ok.. Enough COMMERCIAL for him.... Back to your QUESTION... 'REALITY' in the ULTIMATE SENSE, holds NO LIMIT... And is actually a POINTLESS question... Cause for every second as I'm typing now, the TIME is MOVING, things are HAPPENING and the UNIVERSE is EXPANDING.... If you're talking about HUMAN CONCEPTS however, that's the SYSTEM of REALITY we'd SET UP for ourselves? And our 'Universal Agreement'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> SCIENCE... Go out on the STREETs today and tell someone his/her religion is a FAKE, he/she would DEBATE it out with you... Try telling someone that SCIENCE is a FAKE.... The person UNLESS can't achieve a certain level of MENTAL ABILITY or have LIMITED EDUCATION would be 'SIAO' (benefit of non-Chinese, non-Hokkien.. This WORD means CRAZY...) to DEBATE this with you....<br>Try telling a BIRD where PLUTO is, do you THINK it'll appreciate this FACT in its REALITY WORLD?<br>In our REALITY we just CHOOSE to BELIEVE in WHATEVER we WANT to... And RIGHT or NOT only time(?) can tell....? According to the Law of RELATIVITY MANY people should be DEAD before the ANSWER is OUT and HENCE, NOT within the REFERENCE SPHERE... UNLESS, according to SOME religions you would be called upon from the 'somewhere' or HELL or TOMBs for some light snacks and refreshments (???).... But BEFORE that can happen all DEAD people should just rest in peace and enjoy some peace and quiet?<br>Learn to be more like the birds... Put RELATIVITY to USE... Sure would make your life more PRACTICAL in sense?<br><br><strong><br>You are right. Authoritative belief does depend on a very large extent the creditability of the source of information. The fact I am trying to bring out is that there is NO difference between Christians believing in Jesus and you believing that the earth is round. Both stem from authoritative faith.</strong><br><br>BINGO!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This I would have to KINDA AGREE with you..?

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, lots of interesting points.<br><br>1)Devil76, I do not have an overly idealistic view of science. You echoed my sentiemnents when you say science is flawed and constantly evolving. But the standards of comparisons are very real and rigid, to minimise the level of subjectivity. Some basic requirements of scientific facts:<br><br>repeatability-it is only a FACT if the experiment is repeatable under a known set of parameters. The slightest of deviations, it becomes theory, estimation, empirical deductions. Science, unlike christianity, does not claim perfection.<br><br>Science---&gt;Results + errors<br>Errors is feedback to refine science.<br><br>the process refines itself, and unless there is no errors, it is never claimed a fact! And because of this feedback, the constant quest is to identify more paremeters, until it is possible to map accurately the outcome w/o fail, then it is fact. Many people assume all things that comes out of texts and studies as facts, but no, if you carefully read, you will realise in science, only the irrefutable is termed fact. Gravity exists (fact). Einstein's Relativity (THEORY).<br><br>The concept of authoritative belief sounds temptingly right, but think carefully, behind EACH authoritative belief, must stem reason (basic req) and evidence (if the claim is truely fantastic) beyond reasonable doubt. For example, if the US president claims he is actually a Green Beret and took part in Afghan field action, will the world believe? No, not without very very solid evidence (even 'real footage' will not suffice) Why the doubt? Because we assess with logic. In Religion, we give up this best tool we have to survive.<br><br>2)Pluto exists because it is independantly verifiable and a repeatable process. No, I may not see it with my puny telescope, but with the right eqpt, I can. And on top of that, an array of eqpt can detect prescence of it, and they all mutually agree with each other as well as the human observer's optical obserservation.<br><br>3)Next, I cannot say the bible is 100% wrong, but can christians insist it is 100% true? However, the way christianity is preached, it makes this RIDCULOUS assumption as a fact (recall previous, fact must be independantly verifiable), which is why so many people have an issue with christianity! Recognise this: Anything that claims to be the ULTIMATE truth crumbles at the slightest establishment of false, does NOT matter how slight, because it strikes at the ROOT of the claim to absolute accuracy. That is why christians defend their belief so vigorously, it does not tolerate the slightest establishment of doubt. Christianity that evolves and cover up is a false christianity, the ultimate truth does not need to be corrected! Yes it happens! The believers have found a whipping horse: Flawed interpretation. My my, I ask, how you know your interpretation now is the correct one? Yet you insist it is the ultimate truth! 2nd requirement of a factual truth: It is not open to interpretation, if it is, it is subjective, hence, not a fact.<br><br>4)Belief of masses: I laugh at this example. Just take a look at those boyband fanatics, millions of them all think their boyband is the greatests, and at a concert, EVERYBODY thinks along the same lines, does that transform to fact? Duh. Same for something on a larger scale. Humans are emotional and subjective, even the best trained scientists can exert good objectivity under clinical conditions, hard to achieve this in ALL aspects of life. And because of this, we can be ingrained to believe ANYTHING, just need enough time.</div>

No, not without very very solid evidence (even 'real footage' will not suffice) Why the doubt? Because we assess with logic.

Or will you said that it is I, science who said it, no proof. Or do you need proof to believe? If you need proof to believe, then in the first place, why do you believe god since god is not there.

Life is not just believe in god and go to heaven after to enjoy life that simple, or becoming a "buddha" or "enlightenment". That is religion, some people needs it so that they will feel better with it. They will live better, but is this life what it is?<br><br>I am not denying religion, please go ahead and believe what you want.<br><br>------------------<br>In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble reasoning of a single individual.</div>
