I speak three languages.<br><br>However, employers seem to have a different concept of the word bilingual. For them, bilingual means I must be able to speak Mandarin.<br><br>I am not against certain jobs requiring employees to be able to speak Mandarin. With China's economy growing steadily, there needs to be people who can work in China and speak the language. I can fully understand that.<br><br>When I was looking for job vacancies, an advertisement caught my eye.<br><br>It stated: 'US MNC looking for candidates to fill vacancies. Must be Chinese speaking.'<br><br>I guess the Americans too have jumped onto the bilingual bandwagon.<br><br>Head-hunting companies that advertise on the Internet also state that they want candidates who are able to speak Mandarin. That means all the Malays and Indians will have to brace themselves for a tough time ahead.<br><br>Recruitment agencies should encourage clients to hire people based on merit and not on their mother tongue.<br><br>I am not the only one who has met with disappointment after applying for jobs because of this bilingual requirement. Many of my non-Chinese friends too have been equally frustrated.<br><br>I would be glad if any one of the 173 firms could offer me a job, based on my qualifications and my experience.<br><br>Hire me on merit, please.<br><br>Stewart Sanjay<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You stressed a lot on merit, but what is its defination to you?<br><br>It is supposed to be something which can best serve the employers. What is always on the employers' minds is which one of the hundreds of candidates can bring in the most money for the company.<br><br>Since the local mass are Chinese, and China's development provided huge business oppotunities, it is safe to say that employing a mandarin-speaker tends to benefit the firm much more.<br><br>Seeing this situation as racial discrimination is childish and senseless. Only if you were able to speak fluent mandarin, yet was time and again rejected, then your are being treated unfairly because of your race.<br><br>Some might say that it is unfair to ask other races to give up mother tongue just to learn chinese and find jobs. But think again, people all over the world are learning English to meet up with the expectations and competitions. Why didn't you complain about that?<br><br>Congratulations that you know 3 different languages, but it just so happened that what is most needed now in the society might not necessarily be what you have learnt.<br><br>Unless you have a communist belief, if not in this capitalist society, it is all about competition. And to me, including languages into this competition is definately not racism.</div>
