            <div class='col-md body'>Well...in a relationship, there's a lot of giving and taking. We need to comprise, many sacrifices now and then. Well, you can try to learn but if you really cannot, maybe can accompany him? Well...it's not easy to learn how to communicate properly...me last time also dunno how to play pool...now me quite good at it...always go play with my bf...even a member at one of the pool centres. If you love him alot, and if he's worth it, then making a little sacrifice, trying a little harder to build common interest is worth all the effort. If there's little common interest, the distance between you and him will start to widen. And the time you spend with him will be shorten cos he'll find other friends go play pool since you won't go...or he'll find other people to go exercise with him. Well...that gives him more chances to know gals outside...especially places like pool centres...lots of different kinds of people there. At least if you both share common hobbies, can do alot of things together mah. Anyway, I find that there are not much things we can do in Singapore...pak toh also dunno go where and do what. Always hang around town also quite boring. Going for a basketball game together or play pool or a walk in the park in the afternoon is quite good for a change. Anyway. exercise is good for you too. But if you really dun like, you can compromise with him, like do it once or twice a week together...maybe after some time you may start to like it afterall.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You can on the other hand, get him to do things you like....this is compromising with each other...you give a bit, I give a bit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that's because they fail to grapple with the fact that total opposites can actually make it in the real world.<br>they are attracted to their opposites, because they are intrigued that they never had a chance to know a character like that...<br>But that is their emotive engine working.<br>their logical thinking suppresses this idea, thinking that total opposites cannot get together in a relationship...<br><br>maybe that's why?<br><br>total opposites doesn't reallie matter... what matters is you both love each other and enjoy each other's company, right? i think i will agree with dotandcross on the 'improving' bit.</div>
