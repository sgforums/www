            <div class='col-md body'>i guess people here like to digress. the question here is what will you do if you find out that you are pregnant at 18. obviously, this isn't the time to talk about contraceptives or what nots, but focus on discussing what to do/what will you do.<br><br>first and foremost, be moral. although being pregnant at the tender age of 18 is not very common, sometimes not even accepted in some cultures, you should still bear with the pains and hardship of having a baby in your womb for 9 months. why? the main reason is that the baby is yours and thus you have a responsibility towards it. a 3 year old is a human, so is a fetus. if one feels that one has to take care of a child for life, then the same sentiments should be applied to a fetus. like the 3 year old child, a fetus also has a heartbeat, so the option of an abortion is intrinsically no different from cruelly murdering an innocent young child.<br><br>keeping the baby is one thing, planning for his and your future is another. planning for his future involves deep thinking. you have to take into account the baby's possibility of not having a father and the effects of that, and the age difference between you and the baby in the years to come that will lead to friction. you also have to take into account you future. how will you be treated in future, how you plan to overcome the challenges posed by your familiy, the society (friends), and even your baby.<br><br>taking on such challenges as an 18 year old is, i believe, an uphill task. this is probably one of the reasons why abortion is so popular in the world. humans are intrinsically selfish, in that ultimately, everything is done for their self-interest. here, it is shown by many that if having a baby creates a problem, it is discarded. sadly but truly, these irresponsible parents make use of the fact that abortion is not legally wrong to take away the life of another in the name of convenience and "thinking about the future". no matter what advocates of such frivolous arguments say, such careless actions should be condemned.<br><br>to the audience out there, when faced with a question like what our dear BaBy_JaP_WaWa has posed, do not callously answer, "go for an abortion lah". abortion is not the solution. it will pacify your emotions temporarily, but think of the repercussions, the chronic psychological effects of this irreversible decision.<br><br>look into the mirror, and give someone else a life.</div>

Dun becos some ppl or whatever things said that you cant abort the baby cos they have a choice if they want to be born. Thats bulls*it. They nv think that if you are unable to support the baby in the future, what can you do? Do you want ur child to hate you when they grow up to know that you cant support yourself, let alone them? There are already a lot of kids in the world who are suffering, dun add one more into it.<br><br>A word of advise, if you want to do it, pls use protection, although its not 100%, its 99.98% safe, its better then nth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why would a child hate you for bringing him into this world? if you have tried your best to bring him up (which includes giving birth to him), he should be contended already. after all what's the best thing that can happen to you? it's being born, so that you can interact with the world, and let what happens happen to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jenn_y:</div><div class="quote_body">i guess people here like to digress. the question here is what will you do if you find out that you are pregnant at 18. obviously, this isn't the time to talk about contraceptives or what nots, but focus on discussing what to do/what will you do.<br><br>first and foremost, be moral. although being pregnant at the tender age of 18 is not very common, sometimes not even accepted in some cultures, you should still bear with the pains and hardship of having a baby in your womb for 9 months. why? the main reason is that the baby is yours and thus you have a responsibility towards it. a 3 year old is a human, so is a fetus. if one feels that one has to take care of a child for life, then the same sentiments should be applied to a fetus. like the 3 year old child, a fetus also has a heartbeat, so the option of an abortion is intrinsically no different from cruelly murdering an innocent young child.<br><br>keeping the baby is one thing, planning for his and your future is another. planning for his future involves deep thinking. you have to take into account the baby's possibility of not having a father and the effects of that, and the age difference between you and the baby in the years to come that will lead to friction. you also have to take into account you future. how will you be treated in future, how you plan to overcome the challenges posed by your familiy, the society (friends), and even your baby.<br><br>taking on such challenges as an 18 year old is, i believe, an uphill task. this is probably one of the reasons why abortion is so popular in the world. humans are intrinsically selfish, in that ultimately, everything is done for their self-interest. here, it is shown by many that if having a baby creates a problem, it is discarded. sadly but truly, these irresponsible parents make use of the fact that abortion is not legally wrong to take away the life of another in the name of convenience and "thinking about the future". no matter what advocates of such frivolous arguments say, such careless actions should be condemned.<br><br>to the audience out there, when faced with a question like what our dear BaBy_JaP_WaWa has posed, do not callously answer, "go for an abortion lah". abortion is not the solution. it will pacify your emotions temporarily, but think of the repercussions, the chronic psychological effects of this irreversible decision.<br><br>look into the mirror, and give someone else a life.</div></blockquote>Ya, but have you think what will happen if they are unable to support the baby? Give up of adoption? As a parent, do you think they will want to give up their own flesh and blood? What you said its only for the 10 mths till the baby is born, but what about the rest of the 75 years that a human can live? have you think for that? You may think that ppl who support abortion here are only thinking of short term results, when in fact its for the long term results.<br><br>In the animal world, some animals will eat their own young who they think they cant survive in the harsh world, so that those stronger ones are able to survive. Thats is the no 1 rule in surviving.<br><br>You said about planning for father, mother and the baby involve a lot of challenges. I post the 1st challenge, where will you find money to buy milk and other baby stuff? BaBy_JaP_WaWa said she is not working so there is no income, and since she said she is not on gd terms with her bf family, so dun put much hope on there. Not sure how old is her bf, but I guess he is still in NS or studying, so no income there too. Ask help from own family, ya, but how long can you ask them to help?<br><br>There are no right or wrong in here, my 2 cents worth<br><br></div>
