Just live in your own little world, where there is no worries. 5 years down the road, you will have a diff view of the world. Anything can happen, maybe the whole of sg was wipe out by bird flu?<br><br>If I dun understand, I will not give her any advise. Since you think that you are right, its fine with me, cos my advise is not to you anyway.<br><br>And I advise you to think it thru, if BBWW have not even completed her studies, what kind of jobs do you want her to find? In SG, O lvl is nth, diploma is nth, even a basic degree now is nth.<br><br>BBWW has already made the decision to keep the baby, so lets just wish her all the best. Btw, BBWW, dun just think that being together for 4 years means he will not leave you. He is only 21, and the world outside is full of temption. I have friends who have been together for 5 - 6, 7 - 8 years who break up becos they find that the 1 beside them now is not the 1 that can stay together forever. And that include gals who ask for a break cos they found some1 better. So make sure you tied up ur bf ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I hope that you will have a gd and lasting marriage  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>This will be my last post in here, as the debate is going nowhere.</div>
