As you said, human are selfish. But do you think they wun be sad and sinful? You are killing your own flesh and blood. But if you are unable to support yourself and you wan to support a kid, dun you think you are over rating yourself?  Where do humans evolved from?  Humans? I quote the animals is to highlight that all living things in the world are selfish.<br><br>Dun talk about future when the present is still moving. Nobody know how the future is like.<br><br>AS alexkusu said, "For those that decide to keep the baby, they have unhappy marriages, felt the inconvenience of having a baby and getting married at such an early age." Den in the end what happen, the parents devoiced. Both fight for the child. Who really suffer in the end??<br><br>BaBy_JaP_WaWa, since you have already said that you dun wan to have a abortion, den you have already make your decision. I really hope that you will find your happiness in this marriage. Prove to the world that by keeping this child, you are doing the right thing.<br><br>The best thing know is to let both of your parents know that you are preg and want to get married. Dun delay in telling them. But make sure you and your bf have a plan on how are you all are going to support your child. Let your parents know that there is a plan.<br><br>I rest my case</div>
