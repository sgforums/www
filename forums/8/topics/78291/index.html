            <div class='col-md body'>stepping aside was a unilateral decision made by the principal and i believe under the circumstances, it was the right one.<br><br>While i agree that a measure of restraint must be exercised, i also feel that parents should be somehow made responsible for their children's actions. It's not enough that a parent sends his child to school and feign ignorance at his/hers progress and discipline thereafter.<br><br>If indeed that is the attitude of parents nowadays, then i think it's time for them to re-evaluate their position.<br><br>MOE should also not turn a blind eye to the happenings at ground zero. It seems the style of management at gahmen bodies remains aloof and poorly respected. Working in a GIC myself i have experienced first hand the management approach of 'world-class' scholars who grind out every drop of blood from the workers and foremen at production level while remaining perched up in those shiny towers, constantly contemplating new and fantasy theories to 'improve' the company, all of which are scoffed by us practical engineers during canteen breaks and lunch times.<br><br>If the ministry continues to adopt a conservative methodogy with ministers assigned to education like the aloof LG Lim Chuan Poh, i seriously think Seah Gek Choo, the director general of schools should take the lead and forge the right teacher-student-parent ties.</div>
