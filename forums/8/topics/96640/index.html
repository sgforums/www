(some parts of that are true.) she found their original drummer, helman, on soft.com.sg, and recruited fadhly whom she knew way back in her jc days. she also found juan through the ad she posted on soft.com.sg, and the rest, as they say, is literature. (don't change the subject!) after many changes in line-ups, being sorely disappointed by a number of musicians who came and left, bathroom acoustics played their first show at kovan INterchange with helman, who then left the band amicably to pursue his solo percussion career, with the warmest of wishes from everyone else. helman was replaced by ben, who also plays for the leaven trait. the band hopes to move towards creating more original songs and gigging more intensively in the near future.<br><br><a href="http://bathroomacoustics.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://bathroomacoustics.blogspot.com</a><br><br><img src="http://www.cynotion.com/basictheory/bandemot.JPG"><br><br><strong>eugene's moment of truth </strong><br>Their music can be described as a cross between the old and the new. a hybrid of what was being heard on radio then and now, and everything in between. an amalgam of their musical influences and inspired life events. e.m.o.t create songs to reach out to people. they have showcased their original music inspired by various genres to several audiences at events stated below. the current lineup is just about half a year old but the band itself has been making sound since mid 2003.<br><br><img src="http://www.cynotion.com/basictheory/bandblackducttape.JPG"><br><br><strong>black ductape </strong><br>Black-Ductape are: Iskandar Â– Guitars and Vocals, Noriman- Bass and Vocals and Trisno- Drums and some shouting. formed sometime in the 3rd quarter of 2003, black-ductape started out playing punk-rock and punk-pop in one of their bedroom cum jamming studio. since then, they have written some original songs. currently, their influences includes from blink-182, rancid, finch, green day and many other bands. these three 15 year old kids met in their secondary school where they played at school events such as TeacherÂ’s Day and their schoolÂ’s Talentime. on a larger scale, they also performed at local gigs, the latest being Tapestry 2004. since then, black-ductapeÂ’s catchy and edgy punk-rock has impressed and been enjoyed.<br><br><a href="http://takeoff.to/blackductape" rel="nofollow">http://takeoff.to/blackductape</a><br></div>
