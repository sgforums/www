            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting how people in this thread have written of Christianity being atrocious and unreasonable for the crimes committed by the Crusaders in the Crusades. While it is undeniable that Christianity has had a smudge in its history caused by people who claimed to crusade in the name of Christ, and were actually crusading for their own sinful desires.<br>yet I find it amusing that the very same posters of such reasons, claim that Islam is a reasonable non-oppressive religion despite what happened on September 11!<br>Yes, you are right not to infer the Sept 11 nutcases to represent Islam, why then use the Crusades to represent Christianity?<br>Think about it.<br>It is because you hate Christianity so much that you will just blindly draw any reason in an attempt to discredit it, but actually do not realise that it is the sinfulness of your souls that are reacting to the holiness of Christ's true gospel!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whenever we read the obscene stories, the voluptuous debaucheries, the cruel and torturous executions, the unrelenting vindivtiveness, with which more then half the BIBLE is filled, it would be more consistent that we called it the word of a DEMON that Words of GOD.<br>it is a history of wickedness that has served to corrupt and brutalize mankind; and for my own part, I sincerely detest it, as I detest everything that is cruel.<br><br>as to the Christian system of faith, it appears to me as a species of ATHEISM - a sort of religious denial of GOD.<br><br>it professed to believe in man rather than GOD. it is near to atheism as twilight to darkness.<br><br>it introduces between man and his Maker an opaque body, which it calls a Redeemer, as the moon introduces her opaque self between the earth and the sun, and it produces by this means a religious or irreligious eclipes of the light.<br><br>it has put the whole orbit of reason into shade.<br><br>------------------<br>There are only two kinds of Chinese: those who give bribes and those who take them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i agree totally, you live in a world deem true by your beliefs. But to me it doesn't. Perhaps to some others, it dosen't to. Yes, i agree you are trying to get people to get into your world where one can see the 'light'. However, some people like us choose to stay in our own world. SO why can't it be that you respect this decision of ours and stop propoganting your world? Is it really such a hard point to get across to people in this forum..<br><br>Similarly to those naysayers, you can't choose for people. They make their own decisions. When you try to influence them, it is akin to them influencing us.. DOn't you guys just see the point..<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I cOnSiDeR MySeLf aN ExPeRt tOmAtO gArDeNeR sInCe aLL oF mY FrIeNdS TeLL mE I hAvE tHe mOsT CoLoUrFuL aNd sWeEtEsT tOmAtOeS.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></span></div>
