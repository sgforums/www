            <div class='col-md body'>What was the rationale they gave for this move? It seems to me that they are telling us that *We are not interested in serving the guy who doesnt have too much money in his bank account for us to play with.* This from a national bank??? I find it upsetting that while our banks keep upgrading themselves to transform Singapore into the future financial region of Asia, it is neglecting the needs of its people.<br><br>I used to think that Singapore's banking system was good compared to America's and Canada's systems. These foreign banks charge for every transaction and enforce a service charge for different plans. I really liked the way our banks encouraged people to save by catering to those with small accounts too. POSB was our national bank and I do recall those 80's campaigns to encourage school children to save. Now after the merger with DBS, there is a perfect rationale for every change they make. However POSB is drifting further and further away from what it set out to be -- a bank for the people.<br><br>------------------<br>You are my first star at night, I'd be lost in space without you<br>I'll never lose my faith in you,<br>How will I ever get to heaven if I do</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I also read about this in newspapers. One of the reasons the bank gave was that they hope by doing so they can reduce the number of poeple holding multiple accounts. Fair but have they thought that many ppl in Singapore like the poor, students above 21 yrs old, NSF may not have so much $$$ in the bank. So what can they do? Carry on depositing the $$$ in the bank and suffer a $2 fine just becoz they are poor??!!?? Or do we ask they to take out thier $$ and keep it at home? These decision must have been suggested by those working in the higher levels and as they are the ones who have tons of $$$, they will not be affected by this new ruling. And if they are not affected, why will they bother if it will affect others or not? Finding excuses for having this new system is easy like reducing the mulitple accounts excuse. If U really want to encourage ppl to just have one account, then just charge the $2 to those having more than one POSB account. Don't gie excuses to exploit the poor!!</div>

And yes, your account becomes negative but they do not expect you to pay back, they simply close your account.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically, the response from EVERYBODY (be it from this forum or from newspaper) is against the idea of this whole thing. YEah...it's inevitable since DBS is a commercial bank and this is what other banks are doing.<br><br>BUT!!!<br><br>POS Bank is the people's bank. It's part of our history - Singaporean's saving history. If we dun have POSB, you think we have so much reserve for Singapore ???<br><br>(For those who dun know what is reserve, every country has to have a certain sum of money for storage and emergency...only president, who is safe-guarding our money, can allocate use for it. We have a lot of reserve...make other country jealous)<br><br>Many people have multiple account...I also have... one with OCBC and one with POSB. The money iun OCBC cannot touch one...mother has my PIN and she can check my balance. My POSB account is for me to pay bills and spend whatever money I have. Usually, not much money in the POSB account... I think now only have enough money for one transitlink card top-up.<br><br>Have multiple account also no big deal... they think they can discourage people from having multiple accounts by implementing these charges? If I'm damn rich, I won't even choose to bank with DBS or POSB...other banks offer higher interests and things like internet banking. Usually, it is poor people (like me) who can't afford the minimum $500 in other banks, then open account in POSB  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Everyone I know is really upset about it and I'm glad the Union has spoke up about it. If the government can reverse the decision for merging, I really hope they reverse that decision (but I dun think they will). Merge already only not much use... only have more atm to draw money from (well not much money to draw out also).<br><br>Luckily I'm still a full-time student, not affected by it until I graduate... but I'm really pissed off by what DBS is doing... HOpe people will make a lot of noise until they give in ;p</div>
