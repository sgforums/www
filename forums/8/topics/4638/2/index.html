            <div class='col-md body'>Well... things aren't really as bad as it seems, although I do agree that it was rather sudden and drastic.<br><br>Basically I'm against POSB's decision to implement a $500 minimum charge, however, it would be noteworthy to state that if statistics are anything to go by, many Singaporeans can afford the $500. And those who do appear in this forum definately can afford the $500. Basically if you have internet access and a PC, I don't see any problems.<br><br>However, I do really pity those from the low income families who are struggling to get by, maybe they should be some concessions for this new ruling. Like exemption for households earning less than $1,500 a month, or some other figure?<br><br>Maybe POSB are doing this to increase their net worth? To have a larger reserve? I don't know... I'm not a banking person.. Whatever it is, it's too drastic.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dbs said that it was not for profit, coz it costs them $4.50 to maintain an account every month. but isn't that part and parcel of business? don't all businesses incur some kind of costs? the right way to go about this is to increase their own efficiency and productivity so that they can cut down their costs, and not to pass on such costs to the customers. and i thought with all the financial liberalisation, banks should become more competitive and provide customers with the best services at a lower cost than before? why are all the banks going backward and imposing charges on everything instead?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To put things in perspective...<br><br>All the other banks have similar charges and requirements, and I believe I'm right to say that POSB's charges are among the lowest in the banking sector.<br><br>Nobody seemed to complain when the other banks did it?<br><br>From the news today, POSB have assured us that they will look into problems which may arise from families with low income, so they really isn't all that much to complain is there?<br><br>Maybe it's time we tightened our belts a little and start saving? Stop foolish spending and indulging in ostentatious goods and services. Eat less at fast food and more at hawker centres and food courts. Cut down on the urge to take taxis, spend less on tidbits.<br><br>The problem isn't so great really. What truly saddens me is that POSB is no longer the bank it used to be. I remember myself opening my first account close to 20 yrs back. I was still a little kid then, they gave out real cute saving banks and stuff.. it was really a family bank, and now it's all lost in this world of over-commercialization....<br><br>oh well....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for my view into this is that.......<br>If the Banks find it inevitable to maintain the individual accounts and place a new policy of $500/- as a minimum amount, I think that it is "RIDICULUS". If they Find it notworthy then they shouldn't be possing such a big amount -- They should reconsider the amount to let say maybe about 200/- which sounds more practical and not heart wreckening...............<br><br>But For Rich ppl like "EGNIMA" I think $500/-is not a big amount, cause still don't realise the value of money...<br>(Correct me if I am wrong)<br>open for ppl's view..............</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Enigma:<br>Saw your post. Just something to comment on... Now, DBS is the bank that is making all the decision. Like what you say, POSB is no longer the bank it used to be... I can still remember the first time I went to open a joint-account with my mother... had to do that thumbprint! So Black!<br><br>To All:<br>I dun really believe they will come up with any good plans to help the really poor people. It's DBS that is making the decision. They think in terms of DBS and not POSB, and bankers only think of money. They won't really care whether you can afford the $500 requirement 'cos your small amount of saving doesn't matter much to them. That's why they come up with this crappy plan to flush out people with multiple accounts and accounts without money... that way, they can consolidate the money and make investments and make more billions.<br><br>Have you thought of this: why is DBS actually doing all this? Well, they are poor. I didn't know about DBS &amp; POSB Yishun, but I know DBS Bishan is closing down... can't afford the rent at Junction 8 combined with high overheads... my friend used to be working there... she told me so...<br><br>DBS should be working on account-holders under DBS and not POSB... POSB doesn't get to use internet banking, telephone banking, or other sophicated stuff, yet we are suffering this time becos of these, What we want is just plain simple banking...go bank queue and deposit money, draw money from atm... no need internet banking or phone banking... use nets also can pay bills what... like that also electronic banking...<br><br>That's all I want to say... for now... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me think there's a conspiracy going on. First, the government suck up the people's money by making them 'save' for old age -&gt; think CPF. When you retire, you cannot get all out, and you get paid monthly. Got so much foreign reserves still so stingy!<br><br>I had an account with OCBC back. When they implement the minimum $500 in the account, I closed the account immediately coz' I only top up my account after the month, so effectively, I still lose $2 a month although I have &gt;$500, just that I'm a few days late!<br><br>So, looks like I have to do the same thing now! The only thing is I need to change all my GIRO-paid bills -&gt; damn troublesome! What the hell is going on here! Are they trying to push us to the brim!? Issit because we don't protest then they just do whatever that fill their fat pockets and beer-bellies!?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My assumptions are that - All this issues are pre-planned way long. If not why is that 1 by 1 all the banks should come up with the same policies? Regardless of the $4.50/-to maintain the individual accouts. These banks have been making profits for more than 15 million/yr. Why do these?<br>Todays issue!<br><br>The CPF Board is looking into this matter now for the lower income members. What the Hack? They wants to transfer the CPF funds to the Deposit accounts so that the lower-income earning members could meet the needs of the Bank.... I think it should be the other way around........ The banks should be meeting the needs of the Citizens.......<br><br>Any other Views............<br><br></div>
