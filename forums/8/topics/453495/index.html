              <p>what makes u think SMU grads won't start their own business?</p>
              <p>what makes u think their pay remain at $5000? Those top 20% are potentially directors of big firms with multi-million salary. These directors owned several businesses and investment too. Where do u think their multi-million goes? in bank earn low interest?</p>
              <p>Do u know Havard Uni breeds the best entrepreneur?</p>
              <p>You need to have good knowledge of business before u can actually start a good business. Of cuz, there are some exceptional case.</p>
              <p>How can you start a business without capital? The TS can't even pay for the uni fees without taking a loan.</p>
              <p>Sorry if I sound rude, but u just insulted many SMU grads</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Im talking about the exceptional ones. And not all SMU grads become directors. Again an exceptional case. You dont have to graduate from Harvard or any equivalent good business schools, not refering to SMU* ofcourse to be successful. If its in your blood, all you gotta do is work it! Capital wise, there are many ways to raise the funds! Microloans and many others. You just have to be good at what you sell! </p></div>

              <p>To gain access Havard Business School MBA programme, you need to have a good degree too. Havard recognises SMU.</p>
              <p>Even if you are not exceptionally talented uni grads, you earn a 
                  decent income too. With a few years exp, 7k-8k salary is easy. A level 
                  holder salary are stagnant, with little career path. And if ur business 
                  failed, u have a back-up route too....</p>
              <p>If u compare entrepreneur with good degree vs entrepreneur with 
                  little education, you will notice the failure rate of those with little 
                  education is way way higher. They simply lack knowledge, experience and capital</p>
              <p>What are the probablities of a good degree holder becoming a millionaire vs one with little education.</p>
              <p>To
                   have mircoloan or angel investor, u need to have a business that is on 
                  going with good prospect. Are u aware of the application and approval rate? Do u know the education background of the owners are being scrutinized too.</p>

              <p>Go confirm if the so called 'private uni' is refering to singapore ones. Some claimed to graduate from private uni but are actually refering to Havard or Yale those type of private uni.</p>
              <p>As far as I know, the average SIM fresh pay is slighty around $2500. I
               know many with $3000+ jobs esp if they work in banks; banks tend pay a 
              premium.</p>
              <p>If u compare average pay(same course) of SMU vs SIM, I have no doubt that SIM pay is lower.</p>

Also, you must be Excellent! Dont have to revere business graduates so much!  Ofcourse, if you have Harvard or an equivalent degree it'll boost your business knowledge. Say, you start your business and it becomes successful, the uneducated employer can always employ an educated employee eg. With a harvard degree to work for him. Im saying that a degree isnt the only avenue for success. Look further! </p></div>

              <p>i thk part time study is a good alternative for ppl who need to support themselves . However , not everyone is capable of juggling between a full time job and a part time study i thk..it takes up most of your time and energy..although it might help u save some years to be used in pursuing a full time degree..But i thk it depends on which uni/college ur taking par time studies in..private colleges / uni curriculum would be more relax compared to public uni like nus/ntu which requires 5 years to complete a part time deg! n it cost even more than its full time degree fee....actually,i wonder what is the difference of holding a degree from private college/uni and a degree from public uni in sg. the duration iso much different!</p>
