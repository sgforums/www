            <div class='col-md body'>Read this incident in a newspaper. It went like this:<br><br>On Saturday 21 Feb 2004, at Thomson Plaza, a lady and her husband went into a furniture shop. In the shop, the lady noticed that her husband kept looking in the direction of a salegirl, the lady then scolded him and turned to the salegirl and said: "You are a b!tch."<br><br>The salegirl, hearing this, felt insulted and humiliated. A quarrel started between the salegirl and the lady. When the lady walked out of the shop, the salegirl picked up a stone and threw towards the lady. The stone did not hit anyone. The lady called the police and the salegirl was arrested.<br><br>The 22 years old salegirl was sentenced to one day in jail and a fine of $250.<br><br>I'm puzzled. Why was the salegirl given a jail sentence, since the stone did not hit anyone and no one was hurt? Do you think she was given a fair sentence? What about the lady who made an insulting remark in public, did she broke the law?</div>

In fact, the judge already took the insulting remark in consideration otherwise the punishment will be worse but you must understand the "action" was commited by the salesgirl and not the lady. Secondly, the salesgirl is still working, getting so angry over a customer doesn't seem very professional either.<br><br>If the salesgirl had handle the situation better, the lady will be liable for slander.. after all, its public place, but its a civil case that means the salesgirl will have to do alot of work over this small issue. This is my 2 cents lar, how true is that, don't look at me.</div>
