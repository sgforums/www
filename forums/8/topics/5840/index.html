(most prolly if i go off, I won't be coming back) so anyone who are really interested in the kitties, pls let me know. If you are lucky, you will be one having all of them. but no guarantee though.. this is juz if i really can't pass her all the kitties by next week. den it's either go to the lucky pick, or for any of my friends..<br><br>if need to contact me, juz post a msg, i will read this forum every 2 nites...<br><br>Hope you all have a good valentine's day.
