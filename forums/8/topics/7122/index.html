            <div class='col-md body'>i cant speak for all girls, but this is the case with me.<br><br>im a vain creature.  "having guys around me", or being able to catch the attention of a guy (hopefully in a good way) is flattering.  its a boost of ego, just as if someone comments on a guy's nice toned body or biceps.  n we're all suckers for compliments, arent we?<br><br>this may seem lame n shallow, but hey, its a v basic kinda feeling, and just bcos it aint politically correct doesnt make it wrong, or make it go away.  i enjoy being a girl.  n i feel happy when someone appreciates how i look.<br><br>of course, being unfaithful is a whole different matter altogether.<br><br>- joelle<br><br>[This message has been edited by joelle (edited 28 April 2000).]</div>

Some girls naturally clicked with their guy pals, hence giving others the wrong impression of wanting to *keep* the guys around despite not being available.[/quote]<br>Yes....I agree.....some gals naturally clicked wif guys pals....as of many of my gal frenz....including my ex....!!....so i am able to tell if they are jus frenz or not!! Personally, this thread isn't meant for me but rather for all pple here to discuss abt this matter. But when you sensed that an "extra-ordinary" frenship is going on and approached ur gf abt it....it may jus become an excuse for her to blow things up saying that you are too sensitive....you are over reacting....you dun trust me....that sort of stuffs....when actual fact is that they is really something going on and they felt guilty abt it!!!<br><br>In any case.....this type of gals doesn't deserve our love.....rite..??<br>[quote]<strong><br>How about the guys? Dont you *keep* the girls around despite having a girlfriend of your own? And some even go around misleading other girls by confiding in these innocent girls about *problems* with their own girlfriends?? I am not saying you guys are like that... but sigh, my friends have been victims.. so..<br><br>I guess this issue of being friendly with members of the other sex (when you are not available) is really subjective. As long as everyone has some good clean fun, why not?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>Orite...I must admit i clicked better wif gals than wif guys...but so far, i haven't got any complains from my exs that I am keeping gals around me....so i guessed i had done pretty well in letting her know that i am fully committed to our relationship and oso to other gals that we are purely frenz...!! What I am saying is that shouldn't they do the same....as in give a sense of security to the one that they are wif???<br><br>Where is the sense of commitment....and security...??!! and by saying that....I doesn't mean the gal should start thinking abt marriage or promises....!!!<br><br>------------------<br>You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling.....!!!</strong></div>
