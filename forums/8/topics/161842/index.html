            <div class='col-md body'>Half-naked, I had no choice but to agree<br>Woman claims she was pressured to buy more products from slimming salon while in underwear<br>By Kor Kian Beng<br><br>November 08, 2005<br><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2005-11-07/02nakedt.jpg"><br><br>LYING on a slimming centre's bed waiting to start her first treatment session, she felt vulnerable clad only in her bra and panties.<br><br>Ms Ng Sau Khim (above), who did not want her face to be shown. --MOHD ISHAK<br>So when, in her state of semi-nakedness, she was told she had to buy more products, she felt she had no choice but to agree.<br><br>Ms Ng Sau Khim, 29, claimed she didn't get the big picture at the outset when she signed up at the Orchard Road slimming salon.<br><br>The figure-conscious Singaporean now wants a refund as, she alleged, she was pressured into buying extra products.<br><br>Is this a case of a customer who changed her mind?<br><br>The New Paper tried repeatedly for a month to get a response from the slimming centre. But it has consistently declined to comment. The centre is not being named for legal reasons.<br><br>Is this slimming salon using unfair sales tactics?<br><br>Yes, claimed Ms Ng and other customers.<br><br>The Consumer Association of Singapore (Case) said it has received 17 complaints against this particular salon this year, of which 10 were on alleged pressure-selling.<br><br>Ms Ng said she felt pressured when the therapist told her that she had to buy some products in order for the treatment to continue.<br><br>'I refused at first because I got the impression earlier that the $8,888 slimming package I had signed up for would include the cost of all products,' she said.<br><br>Ms Ng claimed she was asked to buy about $2,000 worth of products while she was on the treatment table.<br><br>She claimed the therapist resumed treatment only after she agreed to buy $1,200 worth of the products.<br><br>After her treatment, she claimed she was talked into buying an additional $3,800 worth of products.<br><br>You may ask: Why didn't she just get up and walk away?<br><br>Ms Ng, who's in between jobs, said: 'It's easier said than done. It's not easy to know how to react properly when you've never been caught in that sort of situation.<br><br>'Also, I had already paid for more than 30 sessions and I wasn't sure if they would refund me if I had refused to buy the products.'<br><br>After the session, she lodged a complaint with Case.<br><br></div>
