            <div class='col-md body'>This is the thing I've realised about my life... Since I've thought of answering your question still finally... There seems to be more naturally occuring 'transition phases' in my earlier life than now... Now they're mainly self-initiated ones... Or sort of...?<br><br><strong>Early question on Death :</strong><br><br>Primary 3 while playing some games. The concept of 'death' popped into mind, creating a frightening question of "Why people have to die?"<br><br>Primary 6. One of my dearest god grandma passed away. It was shortly after my god grandpa passed away. The impact of the former was much deeper because I actually attended the funeral. Realised how 'powerful' being alive can potentially be... And how vulnerable a life can be... On the 3rd day was laughing and joking at the funeral... Sad? But life has to go on....<br><br><strong>BGR :</strong><br><br>1st time loving someone was in Secondary TWO. The girl didn't know anything about it until I was advised by my buddy to express my feelings for her. Told her over the phone and was rejected. Cried. Hmm... Wonder what the hell was I thinking about? Success rate was directly proportional to probablity?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>1st time courting someone. JC's 3 months' stay. There was this really sweet girl. Had a rival from among our group also going after her. That guy was a flirt (but can really sweet talk &lt;- I haven't master this skill back then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) and he wasn't as good looking as me...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  .....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  OK... I was TOLD by 2 of my friends among the group that he wasn't as good-looking as me...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Maybe it was just for console... I don't know..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>In the end, I LOST.... I left her a drawing by me as a birthday present in the canteen together with a birthday card. Later I found the drawing in the dustbin next to the table. Ever since then I barely draw again. I felt sorry for the puppies I've drawn. They were adorable. But yet I can't even protect my own work. I felt ashamed that I wasn't a good 'creator' and had let them down....<br><br>Later I managed to find out that the girl I love didn't get to see the drawing. My rival dumped it in the dustbin. My rival was also a friend of mine within the group. After that I didn't hate the girl that much anymore. She asked to have the drawing but I refused to give it to her. she asked what happened to the drawing too. I didn't tell her a thing. I didn't wish for her to hate someone she loves. I know that'll be a torment for her.<br><br>My friends arranged for me to meet up with my rival. He constantly apologised to me but I didn't accept it. He asked me what I wanted him to do then. I remember giving it quite a thought. I told him to treat the girl I love well and I'll forgive him. If he doesn't? I told him not to worry, I'll get back to him if he doesn't.<br><br>My 1st relationship was with a real beautiful girl. She was also a flirt. The main thing is we clicked on an emotional and intellectual level. She has a complicated love relationships background. As she was like everything to me back then, I treated her like a QUEEN. I let her have all the says. Planned programmes and surprises for her on special occasions. She left me after 3 months for no obvious reasons. I did asked why. She said "You'll know one day." For years I'd tried to figure out. From nothing to that sentence was only a stupid excuse. Today I probably would know. For various reasons. Reasons that she might not even know. That's why her love life was in a mess. We continued to write mails to each other for a while. I'll send her white roses (she love white roses) on the 21st of each month at her place. The day of the month we met. That was until I bumped into my next gf while I was about to send my white rose. In the end the rose didn't reach her. Because I've came to realise... It actually doesn't really matter anymore... From that point on... I've slowly started to transform into a FLIRT myself.<br><br>The next relationship made tremendous changes to my life and myself. But it won't be discussed further here.<br><br>Another worth mentioning was a girl which had extraordinary 'ESP' connection with me. Things which somehow made me believed that it could have been about our previous lives. She was the one who taught me to love again. And also the one who taught me to be as heartless as I can.<br><br><strong>Intellectual: </strong><br><br>Secondary 3 when I repeated my year. TOO MANY things happened. Realised how meaningless the word 'friends' can be. Seen too many ugly faces. The world, ain't really what it <span style="font-style: italic;">APPEARS</span> to be... Quickly underwent intellectual and philosophical changes....<br><br>This phase is considered as the 'PEAK of Devilism'.... A time which I've start to make self-discoveries and explorations... To the string of 'growth' that is running through me today as a Devil....<br><br>Was also a time where I've became an 'anti-human' once....<br><br><strong>TODAY: </strong><br><br>Transition phases?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
