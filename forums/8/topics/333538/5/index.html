              <p>3. Even if longer prison sentences did result in an increase of
              the offenders' chances of being recidivous, I would like to point
              out that they also spend more time in prison, hence their chances
              of committing a crime in the society is also reduced. But no, I'm
              not advocating that they should stay in there longer. In fact,
              personally, I'm more in favour of plans to re-educate and
              prepare them to integrate back into and contribute to the society

              <p>Gendreau and company in fact agree with you that a legitimate function of prisons is to take criminals off the street and keep the population safe.  However, if you read their literature review, you'll see an argument supporting the "schools of crime" view, where prison stretches may in fact enchance criminality.</p>
              <p>Well and good for the deterrence argument, but presenting the threat is a useless gesture if you're not willing to go through with it, and if you do go through with it, you could well end up producing a bigger criminal than you started out with in the first place.  It's a lose-lose proposition.</p>

              <p>Oh, I got precisely what your point was, and the question still stands.  You do the crime, you do the time and everything's squared.  You pay COE once for each car and everything's squared.  Why should something that's already been settled be dragged out again?</p>
              <p>Yet another example.  As a student, you take out a personal loan and pay it back with 7% interest.  Later you take a loan to buy a car and pay that back with 7% interest too.  When it comes time to buy a house, the bank tells you that the interest is 21% because you've taken loans from them twice before.  It's your fault because you keep borrowing money, and because you're a repeat borrower, you should not be able to get away with the same interest as a new borrower.  Does that make sense?</p>

              <p>I'm glad you got my point.</p>
              <p>My story was to illustrate that if there is no criminal records kept, then first time offenders would receive the same punishment as repeat offenders and because there is no deterence of a heavier penalty for repeat offenders, there will be more likelihood for them to commit crime again, knowing they would be dealt with, like a first time offender, each time.</p>
              <p>The question here is whether there should be a criminal record and I'm saying yes. (can be erased if conditions are met)</p>
              <p>You should not compare COE's and bank interest rates here.</p>

              <p>And if you've read the thread since then, you'd have noticed that we've already gotten into addressing the deterrence issue, and research shows that it doesn't work.</p>
              <p>I get your point and I still disagree with you, both on the unjustifiably punitive approach of increasing sentences for recidivists and on your refusal to see the parallels with the COE and interest rate examples.  Put simply, if you've already paid once, having to pay again simply does not make sense.</p>

              <p>It's more of a win-lose situation. Don't forget to account for the increased deterrence which will result in a smaller number of ex-offenders become recedivists. Between having more, but "smaller" criminals, as compared to having lesser, but "7% bigger" criminals, I would prefer the latter for saving more ex-offenders from their lives being destroyed by the very own crime they commit - again.</p>
              <p>By the way, I've done some Googling over this topic, and many researchers mentioned that increasing the certainty of the punishment after a crime has been committed is a very effective source of deterrence. (I can back this one up in a short 15 minutes with many sources - just let me know if you're still as hard up on requiring proof for every statement I make in our casual debate.)</p>
              <p>I have read the short excerpt regarding spent records earlier in this thread, and I'm pondering over whether the idea of placing a globally locatable tag on first-time offenders for the same length of time required to make their records spent (five years) in exchange of spent records from the moment they're released from jail would be viable.</p>
              <p>Let me get this clear before you pounce on me and start calling me an inhuman control freak, Old Mr Gedanken. I'm suggesting this idea not because they need to be fully monitored and controlled by the authority due a mistake they did in the past, but the tag is meant as a form of deterrence via increasing the certainty of punishment, thereby making the ex-offenders aware that they're more than likely to be apprehended and punished if they ever do commit a crime in the next five years of their lives. The question is, would ex-offenders be willing to exchange their freedom in the present for their freedom from their past?</p>

              <p>There's nothing to account for - you still haven't demonstrated that increased sentences reduce recidivism.  It's still lose-lose until you can provide proof (not just subjective propositions and assumptions) that increased sentences work.</p>

              <p>By the way, I've done some Googling over this topic, and many
                      researchers mentioned that increasing the certainty of the
                      punishment after a crime has been committed is a very effective
                      source of deterrence. (I can back this one up in a short 15 minutes
                      with many sources - just let me know if you're still as hard up on
                      requiring proof for every statement I make in our casual
                      debate.)</p>

              <p>You see, here you get careless.  Are we talking about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>increasing lengths of sentences, </strong></span>or about increasing the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>likelihood</strong></span> of getting caught and sentenced?  If it's the latter, I have no disagreement that increased risk of getting caught will reduce the likihood of the person to decide to commit the crime.  The former, on the other hand, is an entirely different issue, and one that I have yet to be convinced of.</p>

              <p>I have read the short excerpt regarding spent records earlier in
                      this thread, and I'm pondering over whether the idea of placing a
                      globally locatable tag on first-time offenders for the same length
                      of time required to make their records spent (five years) in
                      exchange of spent records from the moment they're released from
                      jail would be viable.</p>

              <p>First, what would knowing their location do?  If a convicted fraudster is stealing from the office petty cash box, how does a locator help detect and prevent it?  Second, why global?  If a person commits a crime in another country, it's out of the SPF's jurisdiction anyway.  Third, would regular (e.g. weekly) reviews and random spot checks by probation officers not be more effective in ascertaining what the ex-con has been doing, with the possible benefit of the opportunity to provide guidanceand keep the ex-con on the straight and narrow?</p>

                      meant as a form of deterrence via increasing the certainty of
                      punishment, thereby making the ex-offenders aware that they're more
                      than likely to be apprehended and punished if they ever do commit a
                      crime in the next five years of their lives. The question is, would
                      ex-offenders be willing to exchange their freedom in the present

              <p>No, I don't think you're a control freak.  As I wrote above, I agree that increased risk of getting caught is a step in the right direction.  I'm not too sure that the loactor tag would contribute too much to this goal, but the general intent is sensible.</p>

                  lengths of sentences,</strong></span> or about increasing the
                  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>likelihood</strong></span> of
                  getting caught and sentenced?  If it's the latter, I have no
                  disagreement that increased risk of getting caught will reduce the
                  likihood of the person to decide to commit the crime.  The
                  former, on the other hand, is an entirely different issue, and one
                  that I have yet to be convinced of.</p>
              <p>First, what would knowing their location do?  If a
                  convicted fraudster is stealing from the office petty cash box, how
                  does a locator help detect and prevent it?  Second, why
                  global?  If a person commits a crime in another country, it's
                  out of the SPF's jurisdiction anyway.  Third, would regular
                  (e.g. weekly) reviews and random spot checks by probation officers
                  not be more effective in ascertaining what the ex-con has been
                  doing, with the possible benefit of the opportunity to provide
                  guidanceand keep the ex-con on the straight and narrow?</p>
              <p>No, I don't think you're a control freak.  As I wrote
                  above, I agree that increased risk of getting caught is a step in
                  the right direction.  I'm not too sure that the loactor tag
                  would contribute too much to this goal, but the general intent is
                  sensible.</p>

              <p>Anyway, thanks for the offer for tuition. But I can't afford tuition fees of $300/day, let alone $3,000/day. When necessary, I'll just consult my sister who will be graduating from university with a psychology major later this year.</p>
              <p>And yes, in the later parts of my post, I'm referring to increased <span style="font-weight: bold;">certainty</span> of punishment. No careless mistakes there - not to worry.</p>
              <p>The locator is not meant to detect and prevent crimes, but rather to deter ex-offenders from committing crimes thinking that they have a chance of escaping from punishment. In the case of the cash box theft, the ex-offender should realize before he commits the crime that there's no way of escaping once they discover that the thief is him. And in the case where the crime is committed outside Singapore, the locator can still be used to assist the law enforcers in the respective country to locate and apprehend the criminal, thus deterrence from increased certainty of punishment remains in effect.</p>
              <p>Regular reviews from probation officers for the first few weeks after release to help the ex-offenders to re-integrate back into the society would be a good idea, but doing so over five years for every ex-offender would not be cost-effective. Here, deterrence wins but only for being a cheaper alternative to re-education. Of course, as deterrence and re-education are not mutually exclusive, it would be the best to implement both whenever possible.</p>

              <p>Actually, you don't even have to read the rest of the article - the sentences following your quoted bit from the abstract state: "However, this effect depends on the time<br>previously served in prison: the behavioural response to an additional month of expected sentence decreases with the length of the prison spell.

              <p>The data in fact tells the opposite story to Drago's proposal.  It's not the threat of greater sanctions that reduces recidivism - the bigger the break that the person gets (i.e. sentence reduction), the more the ex-con appreciates it and stays on the straight and narrow.</p>

              <p>Pfft.  Buy me a kopi-o the next time I'm in town and we'll call it even. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>The difference between something like a disqualified-persons list and the job application for question is when and in what circumstances the inquiry can be made.  For example, if someone has been convicted of fraud, a potential employer in the financial sector can make the enquiry under both systems.  On the other hand, if the same person applied for a job at the at a McDonald's counter, the disqualified person's list would be inaccessible to the employer because, frankly, it's none of his business.  In contrast, the McDonald's manager can ask the jail record question, which could put the applicant at a disadvantage.</p>
