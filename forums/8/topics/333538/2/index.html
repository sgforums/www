              <p>Oh, I got precisely what your point was, and the question still stands.  You do the crime, you do the time and everything's squared.  You pay COE once for each car and everything's squared.  Why should something that's already been settled be dragged out again?</p>
              <p>Yet another example.  As a student, you take out a personal loan and pay it back with 7% interest.  Later you take a loan to buy a car and pay that back with 7% interest too.  When it comes time to buy a house, the bank tells you that the interest is 21% because you've taken loans from them twice before.  It's your fault because you keep borrowing money, and because you're a repeat borrower, you should not be able to get away with the same interest as a new borrower.  Does that make sense?</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">Lai sit down relac and have a glass of kek huay.Why you
                                      got tatto izzit? I wouldnt employ anyone who doesnt know how to
                                      hide his tattoos during an interview.By the way, I do have tattoos
                                      on my body and If I could turn back the clock I would just stand
                                      outside Brass Basah 'Johney 2 thumb' and listen to my classmate's
                                      advice against having my first one.Records are like tattoes even if
                                      you erase them,the mark is still there.</span></p>
              <p>--------------------------</p>
              <p>what's "kek huay"? bean curd? and no lah, i don't have tatoos, but i know and seen people who have, and what happened to them when they find jobs, so i know how they feel.</p>
              <p>and if records are erased, nobody except the guy himself will know, so it's good.</p>
              <p>also, from what i know, most companies don't even bother to check whether you got prison record or not......on the interview form, under the "Offences" section, there's questions like:</p>
              <p><br>-have you committed any crime before?</p>
              <p>-have you been in jail before?</p>
              <p>-do you have tatoos?</p>
              <p>-do you plan to kill, murder or rape in the next 3 years?</p>
              <p>if you answer No to all the questions above, who will know the truth, other than yourself?</p>
              <p>anyway, regarding tatoos, i wonder why some people want to tatoo the entire body..........if tatoo a dragon on the back or on the arm, i can understand, but entire upper body? that's crazy.</p>

              <p>I don't see anything wrong with increasing the length of the jail term if the offender is not a first-timer. A jail term is not only meant as a punishment to the offender, but also a form of deterrence. Simply put, the additional two years is meant as a form of deterrence to ex-offenders from committing a crime again once they return to the society, and NOT because that guy is an ex-offender and thereby deserving a heavier punishment as compared to a first-time offender for the exact same crime.</p>
              <p>And why does it matter to the ex-offenders who have turned over a new leaf even if the jail term is quadripled? Not as if they're going to commit a crime again, right? <img src="http://latecomerx.com/images/emoticons/icon_win.gif" alt=""></p>

              <p>Well, OBS, that's the problem with maintaining a record, isn't
              it?  Some poor bastard's trying to get back on his feet after
              serving his time, but nobody's going to give him a break because of
              his record, and then what?  Is the criminal fraternity going
              to be the only environment that he can turn to just to make a
              crust?  What happens then?  Even if he doesn't return to
              prison, there's always the issue of contamination - he starts off
              as a burglar and moves on to armed robbery through the influence of
              the criminal community that the system has forced him to gravitate
              towards.  If he stabs and kills someone in a robbery, is he
              exclusively to blame?</p>
              <p>The problem with records is that they create a self-fulfilling
              prophecy.  Well and good for the sanctimonious to say that
              it's preventive, but take a step back and you'll see that it's
              short-sighted.  Any good strategy will account for a failure
              to achieve the ideal outcome, in this case prevention of crime -
              what happens when the crime is not prevented?  It is a failure
              of the system that the doors to recidivism and further forays into
              criminal activities are not only opened by the system itself, but
              that the system gleefully shoves the poor bastard through the
              doorway.</p>
              <p>It leads to the simple question: what kind of uncivilised
              society treats its people as write-offs?  The goody-two-shoes
              treat citizens as pieces of tissue paper to be scrunched up and
              thrown away, and the government is encouraging relatives to pull
              the plug on people on life-support.  Just what the fuck is
              going on?  Is this the shape of the promised Swiss / First
              World standard of living?</p>

              <p>Well and good, but let's flip things around.  If a banker got out of jail after a sentence for fraud, would it be right if he applied to be a waiter and was refused because he had a record?</p>
              <p>I'm glad you raised the issue of sensitive positions.  It becomes a moot point when someone is convicted of fraud, since the convict becomes a disqualified person.  Now, you may ask, given that the person is disqualified by the court, how is this different from a prison record?</p>
              <p>Simple.  The "disqualified person" status precludes the person from holding a financially-sensitive position, but if the person applies for an unrelated position, he or she is not disadvantaged by the criminal record.</p>

                      just done a quick-and-dirty literature review and in the twenty

              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Anyway, first,
                      Gendreau, Goggin and Cullen (1999) performed a meta-analysis of 222 studies
                      involving 68,248 cases to examine the relationship between length of
                      prison sentence and recidivism. While weighted samples showed no
                      effect size of sentence length of recidivism, unweighted analyses
                      showed that longer prison sentences had a 7% higher chance of
                      producing repeat offenders.</span></span></p>

                      be frank, Gendreau, Goggin and Cullen's results were iffy - there's
                      really no point looking at results until you've cleaned your data and
                      created a level playing field.  On to the next tidbit.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">In
                      a study of prison inmates in Pensylvania, Nadia Frederique (2005)
                      examined the specific research question: “Are offenders who are
                      given longer sentences less likely to recidivate, more likely to
                      recidivate or equally likely to recidivate than those given shorter
                      sentences for violent offenses?”. Examining 206,233 Bureau of
                      Prisons files dating from 1940 to 2004, Frederique found that the
                      likelihood of recidivism increased with sentence length for up to 13
                      years, holding constant for “sentence length, minimum sentence,
                      1991, 1994,1997 guidelines and Asian offenders”.</span></span></p>

                      hang on a minute - recidivism actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>increases</strong></span> with
                      sentence length?  Not only that, the case particularly applies
                      to Asian prisoners?  What the hell's going on here?  Do we

                      be it for me to imply perfidy on your part, Latecomer, but I do put
                      it to you that your assumption of an inverse relationship between
                      sentence length and recidivism, while intuitively sensible, is shown

              let's say you have kids. the kid skipped homework. you punished him
              next day, the kid skip school.
              
              do you think 
              ==&gt; should punish this kid more since he did not learn his mistake the first time.
              ==&gt; just punish him normally, and try not to remember this is one defiant kid?

              <p>Oooh, I'm scared.  You wanna play prison yard rules, tough guy? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You don't have the slightest idea what tough is, punk.  You wanna mix it up with me, make sure you money's where your mouth is.  If you really want a dick-swinging contest, feel free to take Short Ninja on - I suggest you do a search for his online conversations with me before getting into anything, okay pumpkin? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You've got the depth of a puddle, so run along and play.  The adults are talking serious issues here.</p>

              <p>In the ancient days criminals were forcibly tattoed so anyone
              could easily identify them.I strongly recommend records for
              hardcore criminals and the incorrigibles, they should be also given
              jobs at certain places  to be tagged and monitered.For those
              who can be reformed I say give them a clean slade and welcome them
              back to society.</p>

              <p>Quite true. Though there must still be some form of "reminders" left for those who had reformed to remember their past and to prevent them from committing crime again. A record is a good example..</p>
