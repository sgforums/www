              <p>I presume you are only refering to one kid.</p>
              <p>I would punish him more as well as talk to him to make sure that he understands his mistake and why he hate been punished.</p>
              <p>The increased punishment is to teach the kid to know that the more he don't repent, the heaviler his punishment would be, and also to prevent him from continuing being late.</p>

              <p>However, I think it is more of a social stigma rather than the record that causes potential employers to not hire him. Its like the first thing everyone feel for a child rapist would be pure disgust, as he had harm an innocent being for his own pleasure.</p>

              <p>Well and good, but let's flip things around.  If a banker
              got out of jail after a sentence for fraud, would it be right if he
              applied to be a waiter and was refused because he had a record?</p>
              <p>I'm glad you raised the issue of sensitive positions.  It
              becomes a moot point when someone is convicted of fraud, since the
              convict becomes a disqualified person.  Now, you may ask,
              given that the person is disqualified by the court, how is this
              different from a prison record?</p>
              <p>Simple.  The "disqualified person" status precludes the
              person from holding a financially-sensitive position, but if the
              person applies for an unrelated position, he or she is not
              disadvantaged by the criminal record.</p>
              </div>

              <p>actually i was thinking more along the lines of "employer decides whether the person in question is disqualified" if a bank still wants to hire someone known for fraud they had better come up with a very good explaination. though extremely unlikely i'm willing to accept that choice if convinced by a very very good good reason.</p>
              <p>at least for me the record's for me to judge whether the guy's trustworthy, if he ended up being unable to work as a waiter, i really do not think its the fault of the restaurant or the police records. it is the guy's fault in the first place for getting the record.</p>
              <p>not to mention if the restaurant do discrimate and found out much later he commited fraud before due to a lack of police records the backlash might be worse.</p>
              <p>while open to giving a second chance, i honestly feel its up to the person involve to fight to convince us its worth it rather than giving it to them straight away. i honestly cannot accept allowing people  to pretend they've never commited a crime and hope no one digs it up and life goes on happily ever after.</p>
              <p>when you're talking about human society in general, we're not god, there's no jesus dying for you and as long as you repent you go to heaven forgiven of all sins. maybe for a small number of us there is but not for most of us.</p>

              <p>The short answer is a child rapist's analogue to the disqualified-person's list.</p>
              <p>The ex-con's specific crime is sexual assualt against a child, so put him on a "don't let this guy near any kids" list that any child-oriented organisation can refer to when they hire staff.  Hell, you can even advertise it as a condition in the recruitment ad - "if you're on tis list, don't bother applying".</p>
              <p>If the guy's applying for a job that doesn't bring him anywhere near kids, it won't stigmatise him.  This performs the role of keeping society safe and at the same time lets the guy get on with his life after he's paid his dues.</p>

              <p>only chance of longer jail sentances working as a deterrent is jailing someone 30years for just about anything. littering, spitting, wanking then people would be worried about jail sentances.</p>
              <p>with short sentances people are more worried about police records .</p>

              <p>To a certain extend, what you say makes sense. However, an electrician will have to make his way into a person's house to change his lights. There will be time when the owner is out and theres only perhaps your teenage daughter or your maid to "jaga" the house while he work. i think you can picture the scenario. What makes you 100% sure that he won't recommit his crime?</p>
