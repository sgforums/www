              <p>actually i was thinking more along the lines of "employer
              decides whether the person in question is disqualified" if a bank
              still wants to hire someone known for fraud they had better come up
              with a very good explaination. though extremely unlikely i'm
              willing to accept that choice if convinced by a very very good good
              reason.</p>
              <p>at least for me the record's for me to judge whether the guy's
              trustworthy, if he ended up being unable to work as a waiter, i
              really do not think its the fault of the restaurant or the police
              records. it is the guy's fault in the first place for getting the
              record.</p>
              <p>not to mention if the restaurant do discrimate and found out
              much later he commited fraud before due to a lack of police records
              the backlash might be worse.</p>
              <p>while open to giving a second chance, i honestly feel its up to
              the person involve to fight to convince us its worth it rather than
              giving it to them straight away. i honestly cannot accept allowing
              people  to pretend they've never commited a crime and hope no
              one digs it up and life goes on happily ever after.</p>
              <p>when you're talking about human society in general, we're not
              god, there's no jesus dying for you and as long as you repent you
              go to heaven forgiven of all sins. maybe for a small number of us
              there is but not for most of us.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>OBS, we have no point of disagreement here.  If a company insists on hiring the guy for a financial role despite his being a disqualified person, they've got nobody to blame but themselves if he takes off with a stack of hundreds.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you keep the guy out of non-finance-related work and drive him to bankruptcy, well, you're to blame if he turns to crime to just get by.</p>
              <p>If you're placed in a system where a criminal record follows you around, and you're treated like a rapist when you were only convicted for being a pathological litterbug, would you not lie just to avoid the hassle?</p>
              <p>Fair's fair.  Do the crime, do the time and stay out of what got you in trouble in the first place.  A system geared toward these ends would be fair.  A system that makes you out to be a rapist when you only dropped a few cigarette butts too many on the street is unfair.</p>

              <p>Cheers, mate - we're good.</p>
              <p>Well, your electrician scenario would apply in any case, wouldn't it?  Would you ask for any electrician's police record if he came to your house to fix the lights?  What if he was in fact a rapist but hadn't been caught yet?  If we go down this track, we'll find ourselves getting into a series of imponderables that'll keep us awake at night.</p>
              <p>Where high-risk situations can be identified and prevented, hey, go for it.  Where they can't, you either take some basic precautions and leave it at that, or drive yourself crazy covering every possible contingency real or imagined.</p>

              <p>Yes, and then some.</p>
              <p>For example, let's take a kindergarten.  It is the Ministry of Education's responsibility to set the rules such that kindergartens (and all schools) must check that they are not hiring sex offenders, penalties for not doing so being their deregistration as a kindergarten.</p>
              <p>It is then the school's responsibility to refer to the list of "do not put anywhere near kids", presumably compiled and maintained by the Ministry of Home Affairs, to ensure that job applicants are not on that list.</p>
              <p>It is the Ministry of Home Affairs' responsibility to ensure that the list is easily accessible and up to date.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that there are other responsibilities to be covered, but these are the key ones, it's 2.40 am here and I'm off to bed.</p>

              <p>Yes, and then some.</p>
              <p>For example, let's take a kindergarten.  It is the Ministry
              of Education's responsibility to set the rules such that
              kindergartens (and all schools) must check that they are not hiring
              sex offenders, penalties for not doing so being their
              deregistration as a kindergarten.</p>
              <p>It is then the school's responsibility to refer to the list of
              "do not put anywhere near kids", presumably compiled and maintained
              by the Ministry of Home Affairs, to ensure that job applicants are
              not on that list.</p>
              <p>It is the Ministry of Home Affairs' responsibility to ensure
              that the list is easily accessible and up to date.</p>
              <p>I'm sure that there are other responsibilities to be covered,
              but these are the key ones, it's 2.40 am here and I'm off to
              bed.</p>

              <p>OBS, we have no point of disagreement here.  If a company
              insists on hiring the guy for a financial role despite his being a
              disqualified person, they've got nobody to blame but themselves if
              he takes off with a stack of hundreds.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you keep the guy out of
              non-finance-related work and drive him to bankruptcy, well, you're
              to blame if he turns to crime to just get by.</p>
              <p>If you're placed in a system where a criminal record follows you
              around, and you're treated like a rapist when you were only
              convicted for being a pathological litterbug, would you not lie
              just to avoid the hassle?</p>
              <p>Fair's fair.  Do the crime, do the time and stay out of
              what got you in trouble in the first place.  A system geared
              toward these ends would be fair.  A system that makes you out
              to be a rapist when you only dropped a few cigarette butts too many
              on the street is unfair.</p>

              <p>in the light of what happened in the states i would rather keep guys like those out of any type of work that would affect the same amount of people. who knows maybe a life of crime would affect less people.</p>
              <p>i don't believe jail to be the final punishment of one's crimes, social stigma would be a better one. i know some of you here think forgiveness comes after punishment(jail) one shouldn't be punished further after what's given by the state, but thats not the way with everyone. i feel you can ask for forgiveness but to expect it to be given after causing hurt? if jail can solve the problem as the final punishment should the victims be allowed to choose what the jail sentance is provided they're willing to forgive the culprit?</p>

              <p>Oh no, take it easy, old man. If you're looking for someone who would be willing to spend hours researching for data and statistics for a casual debate, I'll give it a miss.

              <p>By the way, a few notes for your last reply to me:</p>
              <p>1. My original argument is about increasing the jail term for ex-offenders as a form of deterrence, so I don't really see how two articles discussing about the chances of an offender becoming a recedivist AFTER an increased jail term has been served relate to the argument.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; "><span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">2. "<span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px; ">longer prison sentences had a 7% higher chance of producing repeat offenders<span style="color: #000000; font-family: arial; font-size: 16px; line-height: 19px; ">"<br>You can't directly correlate longer prison sentences to recidivism. It's no better than saying that, noting the longer prison sentences, those who commit a felony are more likely to be repeat offenders as compared to those who commit a misdemeanor.</span></span></span></span></p>
              <p>3. Even if longer prison sentences did result in an increase of the offenders' chances of being recidivous, I would like to point out that they also spend more time in prison, hence their chances of committing a crime in the society is also reduced. But no, I'm not advocating that they should stay in there longer. In fact, personally, I'm more in favour of plans to re-educate and prepare them to integrate back into and contribute to the society as soon as they're ready to. What I'm standing for here is the enhancement of jail term<span style="font-weight: bold;"> to deter ex-offenders from becoming repeat offenders</span>.</p>
