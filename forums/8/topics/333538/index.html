              <p>but thats the point right? i mean seriously if you've a record for something and your future employer hired you and didn't know that wouldn't be too good right?</p>
              <p>as for job, money and respect . its kinda screwed up if you still expect respect after commiting a crime, its harder to gain those things but not impossible. if you're capable you'll still make it in life but harder now.</p>
              <p>anyway on the same topic, one of my friends actually has a police record but didn't announce it while he applied for a job. he mentioned it didn't matter since no one would actually go and check it up.</p>
              <p>turns out he was correct though. it made his life easier and his boss wanted to make him a supervisor because he thought highly of my friend as compared to his previous job where the boss picked on him for his police record and education.</p>

              <p>Well, OBS, that's the problem with maintaining a record, isn't it?  Some poor bastard's trying to get back on his feet after serving his time, but nobody's going to give him a break because of his record, and then what?  Is the criminal fraternity going to be the only environment that he can turn to just to make a crust?  What happens then?  Even if he doesn't return to prison, there's always the issue of contamination - he starts off as a burglar and moves on to armed robbery through the influence of the criminal community that the system has forced him to gravitate towards.  If he stabs and kills someone in a robbery, is he exclusively to blame?</p>
              <p>The problem with records is that they create a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Well and good for the sanctimonious to say that it's preventive, but take a step back and you'll see that it's short-sighted.  Any good strategy will account for a failure to achieve the ideal outcome, in this case prevention of crime - what happens when the crime is not prevented?  It is a failure of the system that the doors to recidivism and further forays into criminal activities are not only opened by the system itself, but that the system gleefully shoves the poor bastard through the doorway.</p>
              <p>It leads to the simple question: what kind of uncivilised society treats its people as write-offs?  The goody-two-shoes treat citizens as pieces of tissue paper to be scrunched up and thrown away, and the government is encouraging relatives to pull the plug on people on life-support.  Just what the fuck is going on?  Is this the shape of the promised Swiss / First World standard of living?</p>

He must not be detained or placed under police supervision under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, and he must not be subject to supervision or admitted to a drug rehabilitation centre or other centre for drug or inhalant abuse.</p>

              <p>So what happens for that five years, then?  Does the ex-con go knocking on doors to be met by holier-than-thou twats like crimsontactics who say, "Well, you've had a three-year holiday at the taxpayers' expense, so it's time for me as the taxpayer to punish you personally"?</p>
              <p>Amendments to the penal code are a step in the right direction, insofar as they provide redress for an archaic approach to manhandling the citizenry in the first place.  It's not a solution until the prissy members of society get knocked off their little soap boxes and genuine efforts at rehabilitation are reciprocated by fair chances.  Until then, we're still living in the dark ages and simply pretending to be enlightened.</p>

              <p>as for job, money and respect . its kinda screwed up if you still expect respect after commiting a crime, its harder to gain those things but not impossible. if you're capable you'll still make it in life but harder now.</p>
              <p>anyway on the same topic, one of my friends actually has a police record but didn't announce it while he applied for a job. he mentioned it didn't matter since no one would actually go and check it up.</p>
              <p>turns out he was correct though. it made his life easier and his boss wanted to make him a supervisor because he thought highly of my friend as compared to his previous job where the boss picked on him for his police record and education.</p>

              <p>someone said they have been punished already,so we should give him a break, because he serve his time already. And do we need to make a mark in his face, so everyone could know that he is a criminal immediately, it happens in ancient times,</p>
              <p>criminal are just ordinary people like us, they make mistakes, i believe people are evil in nature, is not so much, so the idea of imprisonment is to re educate them, hope that they won't do that again, that's say they come back to the society, found out everyone look at him with hostility, is it a bit over? if he regret for what he have done, and have we take the only hope, that he want to rehabiliate in the society again?</p>

              <p>I think is simply whether the employers willing to give them a second chance in finding job. When they claim to society looks down on them, which part of the society are they refering to? It's too vague.</p>

              <p>actually, for first-time petty offences like fighting, theft, shoplifting, vandalism etc., the records should be erased away to give them a chance.</p>
              <p>if they commit the offences 2nd time, then only do you make it a permanent record.</p>
              <p>of course, major crimes like gun robbery, murder, terrorism, rape etc should have records.</p>
              <p>i think yesterday (monday) got this Christopher lee and Quan Yifeng where they interview this tatooted guy who was jailed 2 years for fighting, and he has a wife and 2 baby kids.....now he cannot find job even though he wants to change....</p>
              <p>i despise employers and bosses who, upon seeing you have a tatoo, immediately dismiss the idea of hiring you.</p>
              <p>come on lah........people got tatoo doesn't mean they're bad.......some might used to be bad but now they change liao cannot meh?</p>
              <p>in fact, some of these guys are even more hardworking and have better character than us, because they're more eager to prove to the world they have changed.</p>

              <p>Rokkie in your example has already served six months for the first crime and a year for the second.  Are you saying that Rokkie should serve more time than Noah, even though they both committed the same crime?</p>
              <p>Let's apply the same principle to a different situation.  Nikar is buying his first car, and he pays $10,000 COE on it.  Darkknighthuang, on the other hand, has bought and sold two other cars, but has to pay $30,000 COE because it's his third car, even though he's already paid $10,000 COE on each of his previous cars.</p>

              <p>In the ancient days criminals were forcibly tattoed so anyone could easily identify them.I strongly recommend records for hardcore criminals and the incorrigibles, they should be also given jobs at certain places  to be tagged and monitered.For those who can be reformed I say give them a clean slade and welcome them back to society.</p>
