I believe there is different degree of being submissive. Submissive until like a slave is the extreme. Demure and solf-spoken are other forms of submissive which is much desired.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I think the modern definition of submissive is giving face.

Not to say that woman dun have ego... they have their own pride.<br></strong></blockquote>I agree to some extent that this will work. However, i think this is too fake. For example, some woman really like their husband to have the upper hand making decision for them and not faking it to give face. that's where the word "Xiao nu ren" come from? "Mei ge cheng gong nan ren de bei hao bi you yi ge Xiao nu ren zai zhi chi zhu"<br>Actually i think this is also an extreme statement cause i think some capable man can also do without a "xiao nu ren" behind him. But that only mean that he got more pressure and will not have anyone to pacify and support him.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Anyway, I think all man likes submissive woman.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Kyo23<br><br>Girls from the land of Sony &amp; Hitachi, DON"T bring your slippers anymore. I am talking about "this generation" from where you got this impression from, I will not second guessed you. FEW Japanese might still be doing that, but then,,, they might be from smaller prefecture or kinda like from the village. once they seen they city lights..they think again about fetching your slippers or heat your bath. If Japanese guys have BIG ego, then wrong again, they are losing it quickly because they know too that Girls now has better terms as i did mention in my earlier post. They are Independent in their $cash$ with LV, Prada, GUCCI so on.. they wanna travel and have fun, they wanna work even after marriage. BUT still it's not acceptable to abandon the family, women have to balance work and the household. In asian context, we look at it as a Role or value of a woman. Man who comes home and become a human vegetable, wanting to be serve upon is slowly melting off. I can't say about being boyfriend and girlfriend, but if it's husband and wife, i think both the eastern and western point of view can come to comprimise. The roles that YOU play in the Family. Guys worked for the bread and woman tends to the family. both east and west shared this long time ago, not just Asian or Japan. Just that man abused their ego so bad that it becomes a norm to our society.<br><br>As the topic was more focus on asian man, why hasn't anyone talk about India or Pakistan, who has the worst man and poor woman now, further up the map you have the middle east. They have so similar culture and values as us in asia. why didn't anyone made a study on that? To me fetching slippers is not a measurement of asian values, as the country develop, the individual's values and self-worth changes.<br><br></div>

I agreed that they have the similar culture and values as us in asia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I had being to japan and stayed with families there for my university cultural exchange. The couples i am exposed to are only around 20++ maybe closing to 30, but most do really still preserve the traditional ways of thinking. i pity the girls over there. They don't get recognised in their workplace at all.<br><br>yes, fetching slippers is not a measurement of asian values. It's just an extreme example that i had made. The discussion is whether most asian guys like submissive girls. I am sure the answer is obvious. When there is submissive girls around, preference will be given. When the society is full of superwoman, guys have to lower their ego to compromise if they have no other choice. However, i believe singaporean guys still have choice since singapore is a multi national country where foreigners come in free and easy. The society has shaped the mind of modern woman that career occupy the first place and hence family value degraded.<br>All these maybe contribute partially to the singlehood problem for female graduate in singapore.</div>
