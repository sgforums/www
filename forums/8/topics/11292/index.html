            <div class='col-md body'>Jing lets not say asian man likes submissive woman. Let's say that WE just have a BIG EGO problem and would like a woman who has a switch label "demure" that we can flip when we need our medication. I think ALL &amp; ANY man liked a woman like that at some point of time. Just don't treat her like a doormat and remember to turn off that switch to avoid overdose(unhealthy)<br><br>Girls &amp; woman now gets better Paper quali and are earning better salaries than before. I think if a woman in that position can be willingly submissive, that is truely worthy of my respect. But in the light of man, If we see submission as being a progression to being subversive then we have taken a step back to Feudalism. You can kick our head for that   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>over to you jing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with mishima. I do like demure girls who are submissive (Actually who you can push around) but that just invites a sense of rebellion sooner or later within her.<br><br>Most Asian cultures, and even some western ones hold the man in more respect and this creates a sense that girls should be demure, polite and wait on men rather than the opposite.<br><br>However if a man can learn to live with and accept a woman who is supposedly more intelligent and domineering than he is, he will not only find new aspects in the relationship, but will learn the meaning of "Hen-pecked" (Just kidding)<br><br>Good point Mishima!<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The singlehood problem that we face for female graduate is mostly due to the social culture pressure that the girl must find a husband who command equal or more salary than them. Just ask the question , firstly does any of the female graduate in singapore will accept a bus driver as their boyfriends not even to say their husband. The reason is very simple. The idea of breaking singlehood is to settle down with a family and by social culture the man should be the one paying for most of the thing, the house, bill, taxes etc.<br><br>So when a guy is earning so little to support the high level of standard of living in singapore, practically most of the graduate girl will avoid them. they want to search for man who earn alots to be able to support them with car etc etc. And all this qualified man of course are mostly attached with a chiobu who is or pretend to be submissive to win their favour. yup, to some extend most asian guys PREFER to have submissive girls as their partners but not all. And those who can afford to choose are mostly those in the qualified category of man in the graduate level. that's why the percentage of single graduate man is generally low.<br><br>As the educational gap between male and female in singapore get wider, i believe the problem will be more serious. Maybe we should ask what caused these educational gap? is it the educational system in singapore or some other stuff like extra commitment in NS etc etc? think about it...</div>

That's why not every guy would like to befriend mi. yeah, yeah, I am a partial feminist which not many guys with a big ego would like. Ha...ha....That's me<br>Anyway, back to discussion....<br>How many of the guys especially Asians would willingly to share housework, do errands, bring kids to sch , cook , take leave at home when the kid is sick stuff like that? I mean being fair and square in almost everything.....How many of the Asian guys willingly to do that?<br>Yeah I do agree with kyo23 about the graduates...Especially when Asian guys were being pampered by their mamas who practically do everything for them ...prize males as jems....I can bet with u ppl in most Asian household, The mothers will always ask the daughter to do housework and not the sons...if the sons did not step into the kitchen or do housework, the mothers didn't even care but if the daughter ...hehe...she would be nagged . It's true even happen nowadays...I heard a lot of such cases ..true life accounts....<br>But most westerners are not like that..Their kids are generally independant when young.....<br>The mentality of Singaporean guys had not changed for so many decades. Whereas for we girls, this has progressed rapidly......with a higher education, a lot of opportunties are opened for us..........<br>We girls wanted to see the world, wanted equality<br>They also wanted SuperWoman...Got to work then got to cook then got to take care of kids ...etc....Pao Ka liao (Everything)<br>Like that the girl old very fast.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IO: i have to disagree with your point.<br><br>To some girls, yes maybe thats what they thought, but not to most girls. I understand how guys suffered in NS. But why compare? Although we ask for equality, but in terms of physical, we are definately on the weaker side. A guy who knows how to see the whole picture will not pose this as a reason.<br><br>ok back to the point:<br><br>Submissive ?<br>What is your defination of submissive?<br>Agree on everything you say? Do everything you ask her to do ? Never oppose whatever you say? Is this the woman you want ? Why don't you find yourself a dog. You ask the dog to sit it sit, ask it to fetch your slippers it fetch.But even a dog has its temper sometimes,and we are human beings.<br><br>Nowadays there is no submissive woman around anymore, yes they may appear to be, but they have a hidden motive behind. A woman can be understanding, but not submissive, I seriously don't understand why guys are not wise enough to see through the point. You want us to suffer in silence just because of your ego ? We are not the ancient woman anymore, you want submissive woman, by all means, just be sure you really found one.<br><br>Guys, you are selfish for wanting a submissive woman.<br><br>------------------<br>Devilish is my name<br><br>[This message has been edited by Devilish (edited 27 March 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, personally i am willing to share housework with my partner. Even now, i do my own laundry etc. True, i agree that in asia, the traditional thinking still linger about. Yes the bet is a wise one that in most Asian household, the mothers will always ask the daughther to do housework but didn't even care if the son did not step into the kitchen or do housework. This is all due to the asian tradition and conservative thinking that the woman manage what's inside the house while the man manage what's outside the house.<br><br>however, our society is changing fast now. Even though the mentality of some esp the older generation still preserve the old ways of thinking, we are still evolving. The mentality of singaporean guys changes too with the girls. Most guys knows that modern girl with their higher education and their strive for equality are no longer the traditional submissive woman that we can see in the olden days. Hence, some guys are willing to accept and compromise while some maintain their stance that girl should stay in the kitchen etc. So it's wrong to stereotype that the mentality of singaporean guys had not changed. If you ask around the asian world. Singaporean man is the most prefered partner for most asian woman because most asian man esp Japan are having the serious problem of being MCP. The degree of mcp for singaporean guy is lower.<br><br>Submissive and slave? I believe is different. Slave is being forced while submissive can be self-willingness. The difference i observe of singaporean girls and other asian girls is this word "submissive" and the word "caring". When the man got home in japan, the wife will bring the slipper for the husband etc. How many of singaporean girls will do this?well there is nothing wrong with singaporean girl here. but how come guys like to make such comparison? The reason is because guys also likes to be pampered just as girls do.<br><br>Naturally, when other asian girls are looking forward to have a singaporean guy as husband while some singaporean guy are on a look out for foreigner girl as a more submissive wife, Singaporean girls are left on the shelf. This is the theory of demand and supply.<br><br>However, not all singaporean girl are left on the shelf. but the percentage of single female graduate is higher than the rest. Why?<br>The reason i had stated in my previous post. Female graduate with their higher education tentatively will have higher expectation for partner to match them. The ego problem of man and the security problem of woman contributes to the uneven match. More and more of the singaporean female graduate are left on the shelf when more and more singaporean male graduate settled down with a more prefered submissive wife of their choice either locally or from other countries. The theory of supply and demand.<br><br>Who is to be blamed? Girls, you want the best and yet you want to be in control? I suggest something, why don't female graduate lower their expectation and get a bf with a lower educational level or status. You can control as much as you want, you can be a superwoman in your work place while your hubby stay at home to do your laundry and look after the children.<br><br>Well, i believe singapore is having more and more superwoman. This has to do with our education system and all the woman right that our society has emphasized. Our economic hence had being strengthened by the increased capability and performance of woman in their career. Stronger economic support, higher standard of living etc etc. Well all this can be say the great work of our competent leader or government. Well, the economic is doing well, the people and government have more money. Our city has urbanised and everyone is getting more materialistic. the girls are no longer submissive and always put up a good fight having great demand etc. hence come all the problem of singlehood esp for female graduate. The ego problem of the man and the equality fight of the woman contributed to the world of singlehood.<br><br>Low birth rate and greying population become the most deadly killing agent in our country. Lots of reasons contribute to these problem.<br><br>Well, all i can say is this, the people brought all these problems to themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, personally i am willing to share housework with my partner. Even now, i do my own laundry etc. True, i agree that in asia, the traditional thinking still linger about. Yes the bet is a wise one that in most Asian household, the mothers will always ask the daughther to do housework but didn't even care if the son did not step into the kitchen or do housework. This is all due to the asian tradition and conservative thinking that the woman manage what's inside the house while the man manage what's outside the house.<br><br>however, our society is changing fast now. Even though the mentality of some esp the older generation still preserve the old ways of thinking, we are still evolving. The mentality of singaporean guys changes too with the girls. Most guys knows that modern girl with their higher education and their strive for equality are no longer the traditional submissive woman that we can see in the olden days. Hence, some guys are willing to accept and compromise while some maintain their stance that girl should stay in the kitchen etc. So it's wrong to stereotype that the mentality of singaporean guys had not changed. If you ask around the asian world. Singaporean man is the most prefered partner for most asian woman because most asian man esp Japan are having the serious problem of being MCP. The degree of mcp for singaporean guy is lower.<br><br><strong>* I have to agree that if you compare singaporean guys with asian man they are better in terms of being a MCP, but seriously if you want to compare, why not compare with the Americans or the Dutchs. I believe that we shouldn't be making comparision here. Let me ask you this, on what grounds are you making this comparisions? From a singaporean male point of view? * </strong><br><br>Submissive and slave? I believe is different. Slave is being forced while submissive can be self-willingness. The difference i observe of singaporean girls and other asian girls is this word "submissive" and the word "caring". When the man got home in japan, the wife will bring the slipper for the husband etc. How many of singaporean girls will do this?well there is nothing wrong with singaporean girl here. but how come guys like to make such comparison? The reason is because guys also likes to be pampered just as girls do.<br><br><strong> Did we request that our man should bring our slippers for us? No we don't. As we don't, thus we don't expect them to request for it either. Fair and square.We don't request our husband to cook nor do any housework, and yet they have this type of expectations on us ? Both the husband and wife needs to work, thus shouldn't the husband do its part for the family too? Do you think its being fair to us? Guys need girls to pamper , what about us ? What have you guys done to pamper us? Earn money for us to spend? Well, save it, we can earn them ourselves. * </strong><br><br>Naturally, when other asian girls are looking forward to have a singaporean guy as husband while some singaporean guy are on a look out for foreigner girl as a more submissive wife, Singaporean girls are left on the shelf. This is the theory of demand and supply.<br><br>However, not all singaporean girl are left on the shelf. but the percentage of single female graduate is higher than the rest. Why?<br>The reason i had stated in my previous post. Female graduate with their higher education tentatively will have higher expectation for partner to match them. The ego problem of man and the security problem of woman contributes to the uneven match. More and more of the singaporean female graduate are left on the shelf when more and more singaporean male graduate settled down with a more prefered submissive wife of their choice either locally or from other countries. The theory of supply and demand.<br><br><strong>* Well, i can't help but think you are a MCP too, what makes you think that Singaporean guys are really that good and there are many choices out there for them? Why guys want a submissive wife? Because this can help to booast their so called ego ? You are looking for a wife, who should be someone you love and not someone who can booast you ego problem. * </strong><br><br>Who is to be blamed? Girls, you want the best and yet you want to be in control? I suggest something, why don't female graduate lower their expectation and get a bf with a lower educational level or status. You can control as much as you want, you can be a superwoman in your work place while your hubby stay at home to do your laundry and look after the children.<br><br><strong>* Well look whos sterotyping here. I think you do have a big problem. What makes you think that a man with a lower educational level has no ego ? what makes you think that those with lower educational level can only stay at home. And what makes you think that only those with lower education will allow their wife to be in control? I just think that your opinions are really shallow. * </strong><br><br><strong> * My Dad is turning 50 years old already, but he stills helps my mum to do housework. I believe a relationship should not be who should be in control but how to compromise with each other. Its takes 2 hands to clap, please don't push all the responsibility to us.*</strong><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>

Singapore percentage of single female graduate is increasing. Isn't this a known fact?<br><br>However, personally i think it's too extreme if girls are TOO submissive. Consider the case of my Project Manager who is in his 30s,  He's a china PR and his wife came over from china to join him as a PR working as a web-designer in a different company. He look damn mature with his big size body and we were all damn surprise when we asked him does he iron his own clothes. He said "NO" cos he had never done such thing and wouldn't care about such small thing since all these details are taken care of by his wife. Everyday he wake up to go to work, his clothing are ready and ironed for him, breakfast ready for him. Every evening when he got home, dinner is ready on the table for him to use. Then my colleague ask him, since he and his wife both work, why does his wife still do all the household chore? His answer is that his wife don't mind doing all these.<br><br>Personally, i am surprised that such a capable man don't or can't even do any of the small task at home but he had such a capable wife at home. Some man are just too lucky and pampered. Won't most guy wish to have such a capable lady as his wife? I don't think most of the singaporean female can do the same as his china wife. All the answer we get from them will be, "we are both working, why should we be the one to do the household chore???? man and woman are now equal etc etc" Well, i don think any of the singaporean guy have anything to say about this because the arguement make sense. Most just have to accept and compromise since they had chosen the singaporean girl as their life-time partner. It's the responsibility of both sexes to contribute in a family. However, with the comparison of local female and foreign female, wouldn't local female be left on the shelf. Who don't want the best for themselve?</div>

We can't deny that these problems are getting from bad to worse, but actually i believe the parents are responsible for most of the problem. Why some other kids are able to behave well and didn't get influenced by the bad company? Parents are a very important role model for the child, but nowadays many parents have the wrong conception that the responsiblity of guiding and teaching their children is the school. I would say, if all parents are able to manage their time and give their children enough attention, this problem can be solved. Both my parents are working, but they never fail to give me and my siblings enough guidence and advice, i would say they are always there when i need advices, thus i believe it all depends on how the parents handle their children and not pushing the responsibility to others.</strong><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.

All girls want to lead a good life, with no stress and worries about money,no boss to rush you on your project deadline. Those who are highly educated find it harder to be satisfied with the life they are leading. Subconciously, they believe that they deserve the best. Humans are greedy, the more you have, the more you wish for. Its just what do you want in life, so long they don't regret their choices</strong></blockquote>Well these high expectation girls made their choice, that's why we have singlehood problem for them in singapore. That's the consequences and problem of a materialistic society shaped by the government. They want money, well they got it. Happy? Hope they don regret it in their later life when they are alone.<br><br>well, now the government want to encourage pple to get married and bear children so that one thing, NS will not be lack of cheap labour. Now they even suggest getting NS for girls. 2nd thing there will be enuff local chinese citizens to vote for them instead of majority foreigners or other races. They want the citizen to do so much and yet they confer so much benefit to foreigner and make life so difficult for its citizen. I wonder whether is it the government themselve bringing all these problem to themselve and put singapore at stake or is it natural process fated to be this way due to urbanisation.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>if all parents are able to manage their time and give their children enough attention, this problem can be solved.

Benefits needs to be given in order to attract overseas talent. We can't deny that in singapore we are really lacking of talented professionals. The foreigner does play a part to the economic growth of singapore, however confering too much benefits to them is not a wise decision.I'm still schooling and have not step out into the society yet, thus i can't really understand whats the situation like with the foreigners. But my point is, the local talents should not be forgotten.</strong><br><br><blockquote>It's so fortunate of you that both your parent can be so wonderful, however how many of the parents in singapore managed to do that?

Its like what most people care about is getting a cert and earn more money. Lack of warmness unlike the old kampong days( Stories which my mom told me)<br><br>I would say you should earn money for the reasonable standard of living and not for luxury. Yes, in singapore, the goverment is our "daddy", whatever he say, we listen. We have always being a good child,listening to him all the time. Who should we blame? We didn't fight for what we think is right, now , are we in any position to say the goverment is wrong? Everyone is so afraid to speak up for our rights, thus everytime the goverment wish to impose some new terms, only a very minority citizens raised up their opinion. If you ask me, who is wrong, i would say, all are responsible for the building up of what singapore is today.</strong><br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.
