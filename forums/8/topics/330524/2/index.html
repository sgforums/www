              <p>Sorry, maybe I wasn't being very clear.</p>
              <p>I've never attended a
                  Chinese wedding at the Four Seasons before, and I've been asking around
                  about the ang pao market rate for weddings held there. But no one has
                  been able to give me an accurate range. I have no idea where else to
                  continue asking or how to start calculating wedding ang pao rates (if
                  there is even such a thing).</p>
              <p>I want to give a reasonable ang
                  pao for my ex-colleague, even though I belong to the "junior staff with
                  moderate income" category and not much balance left now in my savings
                  account to boast about. He belongs to the higher income group and well-to-do family, while I don't.</p>
              <p>That is all. I'm asking very nicely already. Just don't associate me with the one who started this thread. Thanks very much for your response, anyway, Mancha. Nice shot of sarcasm there, first thing in the morning, and not much information that might help me one bit.</p>
              <p>Four Seasons is 5-Star, isn't it? The range that people have
                  been giving me are like SGD 60-80 for a wedding lunch held there. Some
                  say SGD 80 is good enough. How do I calculate how much I should give?
                  This kind of information is good to know for a goondu like me. At the
                  end of the day I'll probably be slipping in something like between SGD
                  100-150 for him. After that I can forgo lunch until my next pay-day. Yes, it is that bad for me.</p>
              <p>So can anyone assist? If not then please save your respective snide remarks (if any) for others. Thanks very much...</p>

              <p>Contradicting then contradicting lah.</p>
              <p>I really, really, really don't know how to calculate Chinese wedding ang pao rates, and this kind of information is really good knowledge for "contradictory" people like me.</p>
              <p>At least from there and going forward, I can make a much more informed decision on how much I should and/or can really afford to give for Chinese wedding ang paos, especially during times when I'm on a tight budget. I'm getting tired of being constantly asked how much to give for a wedding ang pao, when I myself don't know. For once, I would like to know.</p>
              <p>The people who tell me that SGD 60-80 is good enough for today's event, may not really know what's a proper amount to give for weddings held at such venues. To them it may be a matter of personal view on how much one should give, not so much to do with market rate.</p>
              <p>But what is a "Chinese wedding ang pao market rate"? How do I calculate it? Is there a formula? Do I also have to consider the venue/s before I can make a judgement call how much I should give? What? I went straight to the point asking how much I should give for Chinese wedding lunches held at the Four Seasons Hotel, because I thought there were people who would understand where I'm coming from and actually respond proper without being so presumptious... So, again, very sorry if I wasn't being very clear at first.</p>
              <p>Yes, it's either I help my ex-colleague have a grand day or I don't. But like I said, my asking such things is also good information for me. I repeat - I. Really. <strong>Don't. Know.</strong> How. To. Calculate Chinese wedding ang pao rates.</p>
              <p>So can anyone help to answer that simple, general question of how much to give, or how to calculate, should I consider venue. Just give me a damn formula or something lah... Thanks.</p>

              <p><br>First, you must ask yourself, what is your status and your relationship with the person gettting marry. Like me, a lady boss, whenever staff getting marry and invited me, i have to slip in at least $200, I dun care whether it is a 5 stars 6 stars or no stars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The relationship determine your ang pow, if it is just mere frens, $80 will do, not to worry if it is a 5 or 6 stars, the couples must be capable and rich to invite at a 6 stars hotel, they dun expect an increase in ang pow, they just want a nice memorable and grand wedding, beside the credit crisis and the recession are here, dun expect too much in ang pow.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Thanks very much, viciouskitty74!!! Got formula...? :P</p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Formula: How much a table charge and then maybe you top up $20/-</p>
              <p>eg. table is $800 per table, so you as a member of the 10 person in that table contribute minimum $80.</p>

              <p>Sorry, maybe I wasn't being very clear.</p>
              <p>I've never attended a Chinese wedding at the Four Seasons before, and I've been asking around about the ang pao market rate for weddings held there. But no one has been able to give me an accurate range. I have no idea where else to continue asking or how to start calculating wedding ang pao rates (if there is even such a thing).</p>
              <p>I want to give a reasonable ang pao for my ex-colleague, even though I belong to the "junior staff with moderate income" category and not much balance left now in my savings account to boast about. He belongs to the higher income group and well-to-do family, while I don't.</p>
              <p>That is all. I'm asking very nicely already. Just don't associate me with the one who started this thread. Thanks very much for your response, anyway, Mancha. Nice shot of sarcasm there, first thing in the morning, and not much information that might help me one bit.</p>
              <p>Four Seasons is 5-Star, isn't it? The range that people have been giving me are like SGD 60-80 for a wedding lunch held there. Some say SGD 80 is good enough. How do I calculate how much I should give? This kind of information is good to know for a goondu like me. At the end of the day I'll probably be slipping in something like between SGD 100-150 for him. After that I can forgo lunch until my next pay-day. Yes, it is that bad for me.</p>
              <p>So can anyone assist? If not then please save your respective snide remarks (if any) for others. Thanks very much...</p>

              <p><br>No worries, mate.</p>
              <p>Will you be attending alone or with a partner? If you're going alone, $60 will suffice. While it's good that you're gentlemanly and all, do spare a thought for your own basic needs.</p>

              <p>My understanding from reading your posts is that you are quite unwilling to go.</p>
              <p>In this circumstances, I think u can consider the option of not going.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can politely come up with a white lie as an excuse.</p>
              <p>I think you will be fine with that. And they will also be fine. My feeling is that people will be forgiving of other people who do not like to attend gatherings or parties, etc.</p>
              <p>So just think about this.</p>
              <p>Or....if you think that you "must" go and the option of delicately excusing yourself is not going to be positively received....well...just go then...just go and enjoy your time, listen to the music, eat good food, spend time there relaxing...hmm? Dont think too much about it.</p>
