            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest if the dog is in pain and have no cure for it ..I am all for it..but it is really so cruel....I love dogs a lot..My favourite will be the Alaskan, those huskies make my heart melt...I think I will get an Alaskan pup once I move to Vancouver in April! If there is no cure for it ... I guess putting to sleep is the best solution.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well...normally..dog owner won;t put dogs to sleep...i ahve 6 dogs in my life..the last three have been with me for a long time....noe i still left one more...the last two died of heart attack and we let them die naturally...those 2 who died got the leg problem..but they managed to carry one...for wht i  know, dogs endurance is alot more stronger than humans and other animals.  If they really suffer, tht means their endurance is abt to give in.  U should ask yuour friend to consult the vet. Still remmeber how my mum cried.....If your friend see tears in the dod's eye..i think u shouldput him to sleep. Else carried on until the last days.....Ask your friedn to accompany the dog more.  Maybe can ask the vet to give injection to stregthen the leg for awhile..but only awhile more...Anhyway, my dogs died at the age from 13 to 15....<br><br>b.regards,<br>patie</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I once had a dog who died of old age. He was a silky terrier, extremely jumpy when he was young. But when he got old, he couldn't even walk or see properly. He often had nightmares and would whimper in his sleep. My mum had to spoonfeed him because he had problems eating. It was really heart-breaking to see him suffer like that.<br><br>Frankly, I think it's less cruel to put the dog to sleep if he's suffering horribly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes I think that the emotional attachment in pet ownerships can be very strong. And as usual, emotion is always that irritating thing that clouds the issue and makes decisions (a simple Yes or No) a real trial.<br><br>Presently I am also reaching that stage of my dog's life. If my calculations are correct, my dog is already 13-14 years old; blind in both eyes. Even so, she is still able to move around, eat and chase away the occasional cat  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But when it comes to the day when she is unable to move on her own free will; I think putting her to sleep will be the most humane thing we can do.<br><br>If you feel bad about it, I don't think you should. After all, if you have given your dog a very good life and treated it very well, I think putting it to sleep will be more of a deliverance to your pet than a barbaric act.<br><br>Of course, talk is cheap and its a whole different story having to act on that decision. To be honest I don't know if I would have the courage myself to make that call when the time comes, even though logically I know that decision is the correct one.<br><br>As for your friend you mentioned, I believe that she already knows what to do; its just that she does not dare to do it.<br><br>------------------<br>I do not embrace my dark side, but I do acknowledge it;<br>else I can never be whole</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm....<br><br>Why you bother to ask us? Ask the dog lah.<br><br>I remember when my dog was really into old age and was so weak that we had to take care of all its needs, we ask him whether he wanted to die with the needle, he replied that he wanted to stay with us until his last moments with his sad doleful eyes.<br><br>When he died on one fine afternoon, my mum brought him to the river opposite and buried him there. With tears in her eyes, my mum never regretted taking care of him until his last breath.<br><br>Haiz....<br><br>If your friend really love your dog, she will not ask such a question....<br><br>------------------<br></div>
