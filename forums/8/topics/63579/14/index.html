Just that he doesn't know how to joke tactfully.<br><br>Makes some sense, but I still feel that Yiliang didn't do it very well, even if he has good intentions. Somehow when he talked about the zoo thing, "Wo jing gao ni...(I warn you)"....there is a sense of geh-siao geh-siao kind of tone. He trying to exaggerate and create a fuss, but probably meant no harm.</div></blockquote>I think he don't know how to express himself in words carefully.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Drama, drama night! </strong><br><br>With its tears, catty snipes and upsets, the Star Awards 2003 was an excellent reason to stay home<br><br>by Elisa Chia<br><br>AWAY from the bright lights of the Star Awards ceremony on Sunday, a celebrity couple was found bickering backstage. "She's always complaining that my cologne is too heavy," Li Nanxing griped to reporters.<br>.<br>In protest, Zoe Tay retorted: "Do you know that he can come for filming in the same, unwashed outfit for three straight months? It stinks!"<br>.<br>"Well, that's why I piled on the cologne!" replied Nanxing.<br>.<br>"But couldn't you have sent it for washing? There's free laundry service here."<br>.<br>Tongue-in-cheek, their squabble sure was.<br>.<br>Still, it's not what most of us would expect from a pair who had just been bestowed the Most Popular TV Partners, a newly-introduced title at MediaCorp TV Channel 8's version of the Emmys.<br>.<br>They were also named the Most Popular Actor and Actress in Malaysia.<br>.<br>"We're just too comfortable with each other," Zoe explained with a laugh. "We see each other all the time Â— at work only, lah. This man always disappears mysteriously after recording. He doesn't really hang out with the cast."<br>.<br>Zoe and Nanxing's partnership dates back to <strong>1994</strong>, when they were cast as lovers in The Unbeatables. They beat four other pairs Â— Huang Wenyong and Xiang Yun, Xie Shaoguang and Huang Biren, Jack Neo and Moses Lim, as well as the other hot favourite couple, Christopher Lee and Fann Wong Â— to the award.<br>.<br>When asked about the loss, Christopher made no attempt to hide his disappointment. <strong>"Fann and I are a little disappointed. We had some good dramas together in the last six years," </strong>he told Today.<br>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>They can console themselves with their Top 10 Most Popular Male/Female Artistes awards.<br>.<br>Other upsets at the event were Chen Liping, who slipped out of the popularity category, and Chew Chor Meng who, once again, came so close but missed out on the Best Actor and Best Comedy Performer awards.<br>.<br>He lost to Xie Shaoguang and Mark Lee, respectively.<br>.<br>"This is just a game, as some would say," an upset Chor Meng told Today. "But to put it crudely, it's also an artiste's annual report card. So maybe I've not performed up to expectation."<br>.<br>On stage, there was also enough straight talk (intentional or otherwise) to give managers heart attacks (and make journalists happy).<br>.<br>Example: Phyllis Quek, when accepting her award, told everyone how she worked hard for the recognition, unlike some of her colleagues who don't do much and get all the plum roles.<br>.<br>And then there was Michelle Saram's backstage gushing. "It's totally unexpected," she said. "I'm beginning to think: 'Wow, what have I done to deserve such good friends and good fans?'"<br>.<br>She wasn't alone. When she was announced as one of the 10 most popular Female Artistes Â— her name was read out last, though there was no particular order to Top 10 Â— <strong>there were cries of "kelong!" from the press area.</strong><br>.<br>Then, Gurmit Singh broke down on stage again, following Thursday night's Asian Television Awards Â— his father passed away two weeks ago. It was a touching moment that moved many other stars to tears.<br>.<strong><br>He certainly moved Fann Wong, who in sympathy, (though a little tactlessly) said in her acceptance: "I'll also like to wish my parents a long and healthy life."<br>.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Such drama.<br>.<br>Which is the reason why we keep tuning in every year, isn't it?<br>.<br>For the record, this year's three-hour show had more than one million Chinese television viewers captivated. According to TNS, ratings for the Star Awards 2003 Â— which will have a repeat screening this Sunday at 3.10pm on Channel 8 Â— peaked at 35 per cent from 9.45pm to 10pm.<br>.<br>More to come next year? You bet. And more squabbles between Zoe and Nanxing, we hope.<br>.<br><a href="http://www.todayonline.com/index_home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todayonline.com/index_home.htm</a><br><br>[/quote]<br><br>so once again we see who r the bimbos  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>
