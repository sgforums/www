              <p>The first person shot couldn't have shot anyone, so the 4 remaining people each shot 1 person. The second person shot had to have shot the first person, otherwise someone else would have to shoot 2 people. For the same reason, the third person shot had to have shot the 2nd person. The 4th person shot the 3rd person, and the standing person shot the 4th person.</p>
              <p><br>If Toparnis is truthful, then all others are lying. If Jake is lying, then Toparnis shot Drake. This is impossible since Toparnis's statement implies that Drake was the first person shot. The first person shot could not have been shot by the last person standing. To avoid contradictions, Toparnis is lying and Drake shot someone.</p>
              <p><br>If Jake is lying, then Toparnis shot Drake. Drake would also have to be lying since he was shot. If Glebb is truthful, then the order shot is: someone-Drake-Toparnis-Jake. The someone would have to be RJ, but then Drake's statement is contradictory (he's calling himself a liar). In that scenario, Glebb cannot be truthful and RJ is the only person left to tell the truth. The order shot would then have to be: Glebb-Drake-Toparnis-Jake. There is another contradiction because now Glebb's statement is true. Glebb's statement is contradictory whether it's true or false, so Jake cannot be lying to begin with. Jake has to be the winner to avoid contradictions.</p>
