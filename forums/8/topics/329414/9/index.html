              <p>Pirate 5 being the most senior knows that he needs to get 2 other
              people to vote for his solution in order for him not to be executed. so
              who can he get to vote for him, and why would they choose to vote for
              him? if you start thinking that pirate 4 will never vote for him,
              because he would rather have 5 die and then be in charge and take it
              all for himself, you are on the right track. but it gets more
              complicated.</p>
              <p>lets consider if there were only 1 pirate. obviously he would take it all for himself and no one would complain.</p>
              <p>if there were 2 pirates, pirate 2 being the most senior, he
              would just vote for himself and that would be 50% of the vote, so he's
              obviously going to keep all the money for himself.</p>
              <p>if there were 3 pirates, pirate 3 has to convince at least one
              other person to join in his plan. so who can he convince and how? here
              is the leap that needs to be made to solve this problem. pirate 3 realizes that if his plan is not adopted he will be executed and they will be left with 2 pirates.
              he already knows what happens when there are 2 pirates as we just
              figured out. pirate 2 takes all the money himself and gives nothing to
              pirate 1. so pirate 3 proposes that he will take 99 gold coins and give
              1 coin to pirate 1. pirate 1 says, well, 1 is better than none, and
              since i know if i don't vote for pirate 3, i get nothing, i should vote
              for this plan.</p>
              <p>now we know what happens when there are 3 pirates. so what
              happens with 4? well pirate 4 has to convince 1 other person to join in
              his plan. he knows if he walks the plank then pirate 3 will get 99
              coins and pirate 1 will get 1 coin. pirate 4 could propose giving
              pirate 1 two coins, and surely pirate 1 would vote for him, since 2 is
              better than 1. but as greedy as he is, pirate 4 would rather not part
              with 2 whole coins. he realizes that if he gets executed, then pirate
              3's scenario happens and pirate 2 gets the shaft in that scenario (he
              gets zero coins). so pirate 4 proposes that he will give 1 coin to
              pirate 2, and pirate 2 seeing that 1 is better than 0 will obviously
              vote for this plan.</p>
              <p>a common objection is that pirate 2 is not guaranteed to vote
              for this plan since he might hope for the case when there are only 2
              pirates and then he gets all the booty. but that is why i said that the
              pirates are extremely intelligent. pirate 2 realizes that pirate 3 is
              smart enough to make the optimal proposal, so he realizes that there
              will never be 2 pirates left, because 3 doesn't want to die and we just
              showed that 3 has a winning proposal.</p>
              <p>so lets sum up at this point</p>
              <pre>Pirate 1  2  3  4  5<br>    5. ?  ?  ?  ?  ?<br>    4. 0  1  0 99  -<br>    3. 1  0 99  -  -<br>    2. 0 100 -  -  -<br>    1.100<br></pre>
              <p>once you see the pattern it becomes very clear. you have to realize
              that when a pirate's plan does not succeed then that means you are in
              the same situation with one less pirate.<br>1. pirate 1 needs 0 other
              people to vote for him. so he votes for himself and takes all the
              money. 2. pirate 2 needs 0 other people to vote for him. so he votes
              for himself and takes all the money. pirate 1 gets 0. 3. pirate 3 needs
              1 other person to vote for him. he gives 1 coin to pirate 1 for his
              vote - if we are reduced to 2 pirates, pirate 1 gets 0 so pirate 1
              knows 1 is better than none. pirate 3 takes 99. pirate 2 gets 0. 4.
              pirate 4 needs 1 other person to vote for him. he gives 1 coin to
              pirate 2 - if we reduce to 3 pirates, pirate 2 gets 0 so pirate 2 knows
              1 is better than none. pirate 4 takes 99. pirate 3 gets 0. pirate 1
              gets 0. 5. pirate 5 needs 2 other people to vote for him. its clear now
              that the 2 people he needs to convince are the 2 who get shafted in the
              4 pirate scenario - pirate 3 and pirate 1. so he can give them each 1
              coin (which is better than 0 - what they would get otherwise) and keep
              98 for himself.</p>
              <pre>Pirate 1  2  3  4  5<br>    5. 1  0  1  0 98<br></pre>
              <p>what happens if there are 15 pirates? pirate 15 needs 7 other people
              to vote for him, so he recruits pirates 13,11,9,7,5,3, and 1 with 1
              coin each and keeps 93 coins himself. those pirates will all vote for
              him because they know that they get 0 coins if he dies and pirate 14 is
              in charge.</p>
