            <div class='col-md body'>Just wondering will TP or ROV catch the driver if the back passenger didn't put on seat belt. What i mean is by taking note of their car number plate and send a summon later? Or sure must be on the spot as he need to fine both the back passenger and driver. Hmmmm........<br><br>Actually, was out for lunch with 2 colleagues just now. The passenger at the back forgot his seatbelt (not entirely his fault cos when we go he did put, but when coming back forgot). We travel pass a TP/ROV officer hiding at the pavement. Only then did he realise he never put on his seat belt.<br><br>The TP saw us of cos, but didn't stop us lar. Cannot spot his bike also. So i presume things will be fine. Just that dunnoe why the TP hide there, cos its not a bus lane nor big road, its a small road. Maybe just a ROV waiting to book commercial vehicles with black smoke.<br><br>Sign anyway another thing i like to point out his for ages, back passengers dun need to on seat belt, and think it will also take ages for them to remember to put on, haha.... jia lat.<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"<br><br>[This message has been edited by Atti (edited 23 May 2002).]</div>
