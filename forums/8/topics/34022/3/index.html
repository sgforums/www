            <div class='col-md body'>something interesting about the vietnam that was revealed recently was that, till this day, the US troops still didn't know where the vietnam base was. then the general reviewed that actually they dug themselves under the us base and stationed themselves there.<br><br>and about germany, it was because they used good tactics, they didn't manage to hold off most of europe for nothing u know, manpower can only do so much. i believe it was called the blitzkreig, which is the tactic the US used against al qaeda and is planning on using against iraq. they send the planes in to disrupt the enemy lines, and just as they're recovering, in come the foot troops. it won germany most of europe. it's proven, and it works. if i'm not wrong, it's the same tactic the japanese used as well.<br><br>no point having a large army when most of them are just cannon fodder.<br><br>there was a certain national day few years back prob 98 or 95, where tons of reservist and troops were called back. within 2 hours, you could see almost the entire army of singapore getting ready to attack malaysia. everyone was there drawing arms and ammo, getting ready to lift off in those chinooks at any minute. among 1 of them was my friends, his mission was to fly up KL and scout all the way back to singapore.</div>
