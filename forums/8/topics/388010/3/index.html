              <p>People pay taxes to government (and we pay alot mind you) and government employ cleaning companies, however that doesn't means government is paying more than what it's needed to employ maybe, for example, 500 cleaners.</p>
              <p>Why would you pay more than $1 for an item when you can just get them for $1? You are not dumb, are you? Even if you are, PAP definitely is not.</p>
              <p>Even if the government is so kind-hearted enough to give out more, that doesn't means the cleaner companies will increase the pay of the cleaners.</p>
              <p>Besides, when we talk about cleaners, we talk about cleaners in general. For example, including cleaners in shopping center, food courts. These cleaners are not directly or indirectly employed by the government, therefore your argument of people having to pay more taxes to increase cleaner's pay do not stand.</p>
              <p>We all know in our heart our government (aka PAP) is not generous. They will rather increase their salary than to give it out to help the poor and spent their time devising a plan on how to better "extract" more money from us, the citizens.</p>
              <p>Heck, they don't even need to spent time to come up with a better reason since they know majority of the citizens are so gullible that we will just shove in any cockbull reason down our throat without mumbling a word.</p>
              <p>"Increase GST to help the poor" my ass. Anyone with a little bit of common sense will know it's bullcrap. In the end, it didn't help the poor but instead caused an inflation. Great help indeed.</p>
              <p>Right at the start of the new year, they already start throwing crap towards us which is increasing the cost of electricity.</p>

              courts. These cleaners are not directly or indirectly employed by
              the government, therefore your argument of people having to pay
              more taxes to increase cleaner's pay do not stand.</p>
              <p>We all know in our heart our government (aka PAP) is not
              generous. They will rather increase their salary than to give it
              out to help the poor and spent their time devising a plan on how to
              better "extract" more money from us, the citizens.</p>
              <p>Heck, they don't even need to spent time to come up with a
              better reason since they know majority of the citizens are so
              gullible that we will just shove in any cockbull reason down our
              throat without mumbling a word.</p>
              <p>"Increase GST to help the poor" my ass. Anyone with a little bit
              of common sense will know it's bullcrap. In the end, it didn't help
              the poor but instead caused an inflation. Great help indeed.</p>
              <p>Right at the start of the new year, they already start throwing
              crap towards us which is increasing the cost of electricity.</p>

              <p>People pay taxes to government (and we pay alot mind you) and government employ cleaning companies, however that doesn't means government is paying more than what it's needed to employ maybe, for example, 500 cleaners.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why would you pay more than $1 for an item when you can just get them for $1? You are not dumb, are you? Even if you are, PAP definitely is not.</span></strong></p>

              <p><br>Isn't that the exact reason that the PAP "employs" more foreign talent? Why pay more for a Singaporean when I can just employ immigrants at a cheaper rate?</p>
