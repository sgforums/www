Even if they do not yearn for more, they have a sense of greediness and adventure that beckons them to dabble in the "open market" for something better, and if no such thing exists, then they would still have someone stable to lean on.<br><br>Otherwise, the person in question, say your ex-girlfirend in this case, could just be playful and attention-seeking. All girls like to know that they are attractive. And not just their bodies. Prehaps, if a guy could take interest in a girl, communicate and convice the girl of his interest without having first known what her physical appearance is like, then I suspect any girl would feel glad, to say the least.<br><br>You know, they say while a couple is courting, the guy puts in more effort. But after the chase is over, it is the girl that puts in more effort sustaining the relationship. The attention and dedication put in by the guy gets somehow diminished and oftentimes the girl would ask herself whether it is because the guy has stopped loving her or whether there is something wrong with her, or both. The problem you mentioned about your ex-partner giving out numbers to "strangers" over the net expounds the fact of the need she has to be reassured that she is still as attractive to the male gender, and that the problem lies with her boyfriend, and not her. It's an act of self-preservation.<br><br>If you can search deep down and tell yourself that you have been the same loving and attention-giving gentleman since day one, then you can ignore the previous paragraph. I don't know about you, but I, together with countless men out there, fail in this respect. We just have an uncanny ability to forget how to "woo our women even after they have been wooed". The bane of many a relationship.<br><br>So, I feel that if you know how to continually woo your woman, be the same loving gentleman that she feel in love with, then you're home free, and without worries if she does log onto IRC. If you do all that and she's still fluttering around like a butterfly, then dump her (which you did) because you deserve someone better.<br><br>To those girls out there who may be toying with the idea that your boyfriend is great, but still want to find out if there is someone better out there, then go ahead. No one, certainly not I, is going to blame you for fighting for your happiness. However, if I may use an analogy, you should always step from one boat to the shore, then from the shore to another boat, usually bigger and better. Hopping from one boat to another just isn't right. If a bigger boat is worth the risk of forgoing the stable, smaller boat, then it's worth stepping on the shore first to grab a sandwich and orange juice before embarking on another voyage.</div>
