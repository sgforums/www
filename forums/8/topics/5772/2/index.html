            <div class='col-md body'>Mercury, while posting a topic and substantiating it with a personal point of view is not the same as answering the poser's own question, this is obviously not the case here with pathetic ng. It's obvious this pathetic individual (prob with a bruised ego) is trying to put on an "intellectual" image. He asks a standard txtbk question (go read his first post) that has already been debated over millions of times even before his time. The limitations of Adam Smith's model is obvious by now...just debunk the assumptions behind the theory like for eg there is no such thing as zero cost of exchange etc. There is nothing new left to say about it that hasn't been said by someone else before. Repeating these stuff and starting the sentences with "I think..." is nothing but fart. I mean hey, when u wanna discuss something, it'd help if the topic is fresh and not stale shit like this. More than half the time (see for urself), MoronNg is busy trying to show his "superiority" over individuals like ShaolinBoy. ---"Guys like us who are 26 or 27, can tell a lot of things just from the way you carry yourself, talk or write. We are tempered with fire, made strong by experience."----(HAHAHA! oh man this is killing me!).....or telling pple what Taoism is (or isn't). I'm just putting this loser in his place. Anyway, he follows up by trying to worm his way out of the fix he got himself into, trying real hard to rephrase his question but ends up making a big mess outta it by contradicting himself. In addition, he knows shit about Econs. ----"When I talk about a free market, it is more than just purely the symbiotic relationship between demand and supply."---<br>Wonder who the fuck taught him dd and ss have a "symbiotic" relationship. HAHA! gosh what a joke!<br><br>Another pt....of cuz I can choose not to participate in this thread!!! Funny how pple like to tell me the obvious(mebbe it's not so obvious to them). But this site entertains and amuses me though....i've even got it in my bookmark and guess what i named it? It's called COMIC RELIEF. I am not entertained in the same way as the others who take this oh-so-seriously, discussing dumb topics with equally dumb brains. So in case u think i'm upset by what goes on in here...well now u know better.<br><br>Lemme show u what MoronNg is more suited to discuss: (quoting from MoronNg from another thread he started) "If a girl wants to have sex with you, but you are not ready, how do you tell her?" &lt;---HAHAHAHA!!! Oh dear, 26 or 27 yr old he said?? gosh what more needs to be said? And he says I do not know about his reputation?? (pathetic english but just following in his tone in case he doesn't follow) HAHAHAHA WHAT reputation? So u see? This tragedy called NgKaiHoe really deserves some sympathy. Sad loser said I am "unable" to point out logical faults of A. Smith's Invisible Hand theory. Guess the moron doesn't know that I'm not even interested in engaging with a discussion with him (it's obvious but well, some are just slow u see?).<br><br>MoronNg: Do urself a favour by not trying to act smart lah. "Let's discuss about Economics instead" HAHAHAHA!!!!! Every fucking econs model is based on a set of assumptions (which do not reflect the real world accurately) and can easily be critisized based on that. So get real, stop acting smart discussing limitations of whatever model. If u were truly interested in learning more about it, u'd be reading books instead of bringing it to this forum. Cut the act yah?<br><br>---"Do you think you can even be on par with me?"--- BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!! gosh u're such a Joke!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh dear, a lame attempt by MoronNg to cover up his attempt to put on an intelligent image. U want an eg of an "unfalsifiable" hypothesis? ok lah just to satisfy MoronNg... an eg would be the hypothesis "The egg came before the chicken".<br><br>Anyway as to why i did not answer ur question...well the reason is pretty simple really. Because again, it's a stupid question. Hope u are able to see, despite your intellectual handicap, that the gist of the Wealth of Nations revolves around the Invisible Hand Theory. And this particular theory is OBVIOUSLY not entirely applicable nor totally reflective of how the economy works. Even an A level student can tell u that it fails to address many of the imperfections in the real world economy. So what the fuck do u mean by it being "unfalsifiable or unverifiable"??? it's already been "verified" to be untrue that the economy is entirely ran by this mechanism. we are still studying it only becuz it shows a model and models are best when it comes to teaching it, in a simplified world where all assumptions are correct. Like i said, this is a fucking stale topic and there is no "debate value". If u were genuinely interested u could easily get all the answers off txtbks (much better answers than u can get from this board too!) but u chose to "talk about economics instead" here....basically u just wanna fucking tell the world here u know two cents worth of econs.....*sigh* get a life yah?<br><br>Think i've made my pt pretty clear over here. *yawn* guess i'll drop by when someone tries to act smart again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ng, I know what you would say to this, but you are seriously ignorant and under-read. People like you dirty the gene pool. "Unfalsifiable hypothesis" indeed! Please go read a dictionary.<br><br>But just to humour you and not giving you an excuse to claim that i am nit-picking, let's accept "unfalsifiable" to mean "not false".<br><br>False means not true. "Not false" means "not not true", which is true. When it is true, how can it be unverifiable? Let me be more gracious and take on your meaning as "cannot be proved false". If that is the case, then the argument defaults to a hypothesis which cannot be proven false. A hypothesis, by definition, is taken to be true for purpose of argument. If you are unable to prove it to be otherwise, then it takes on its intended meaning. Adam Smith's "The invisible hand" is NOT a hypothesis. It is a "theory", defined as "an assumption based on limited information or knowledge; a conjecture".<br><br>Of course, at your level you're not expected to understand what I am talking about. I don't think even you yourself know what you are talking about, using big words that are way over your standards.<br><br>But the real reason I am writing is that I cannot stand the way you talk about &lt;An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations&gt;. Have you even read through Adam Smith's paper before? Can you honestly say that you actually know anything about it? By my reckoning, you don't even know the basics of macro-economics to do a positive economical evaluation, much less to hold a thorough discussion about it.<br><br>Asking a seemingly complex but stupid question and trying to impress the young here is what a poser might do, and that's what you are. All fluff and no substance. And to add insult to injury, you mentioned how "well liked" you are in another forum. A man lets only his deeds speak for himself. Not only did your feeble attempt at showing off fail to impress me, you have publicly shown yourself to be a shallow person. And your arrogance reached new depths when you claimed that "Girls find guys like us sexy ..." Delusions of grandeur. Quit dreaming. It's guys like you who give the rest of us a bad name.<br><br>My advice to you is to read more. And perhaps grow up. People of your age should be more mature, and yet you're here mixing with teenagers barely in their 20s and not even matching them in terms of general knowledge, worldliness and intelligence.<br><br>If I actually knew you in person, I would indubitably despise you. For now, I would just take it that you're being stupid for the fun of it.<br><br>P/S: I could educate you by giving you a primer in economics. But on second thoughts, why waste effort on someone who is not worth my time? Don't amuse me further with your dull-witted replies. Use your time to do some catching up. And boy, is there quite a distance.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Dork (edited 27 January 2000).]</div>
