            <div class='col-md body'>oi...another GBM..or are they the same person?......<br><br>Anyway back to your quote from the economicist...kekek...<br><br>He supposes that witht the free economy, everything will just fall into it's place if anything should go wrong...because everyone is in it together and working on the premise of supply and demand(which is a great force in itself), he must mean that balance will be restored (in theory) if any one situation creates an imbalance in the world economy....<br><br>But I think that the problem is that people and governments are unpredictable...(unless u deal with gov like singapore or usa)...based on the unpredictability factor of the people involved in this free market economy, it's pretty safe to say that some people and governments will get carried away and a bit too overzealous in their endeavors...Now this can lead to financial crisis in their own country or others...but eventually it leaks out and affects other countries anyway...especially if their economic legislations and lawas are shitty and hidden behind closed doors...<br><br>or lets say that one country has a product that everyone wants and makes it better than another country who's only source of national income is that same product(but manufactured and developed in less than high standards)... Quite possibly the first country could overshadow and cripple this small guys economy if the bigger country has the upper hand(which they often do)and is overzealous in pushihg their products onto the marketplace....<br><br>I know I am getting off point here but i write what come to em as I speak...<br><br>It's difficult to keep the equilibrium because of the imbalance of powers among nations and states...Yes the free market and open economy is a great idea...And contrary to those anti WTO people, it will help to raise satndards for people and move people from one class to another more swiftly and in greater numbers than if we were to leave it at it's present status.....thoguh many will still be left behind...but it's still bettter than the situation w ehave as of this moment when only a small number of people are enjoying class advancement<br><br>this system is supposed to put everyone on equal footing in the international stage, but like I said, it's unstable and needs a centrasl body to make sure that things are moving in the right direction...Basically what is happening is that we are moving from a series of thousands of comapnaies and organisations and putting it under the powers of one governing body who has overall executive CEo like powers to steer this collective planet sized company into the next stage of growth..and the next and the next...This globalisation thing is bringing us closer to each other ina way...by putting us unde the blanket of a common shared goal...<br><br>But ubless there is a strong, effective, and fair handed governing  body, then the system will work but on a far less effective scale than it can be.....For instance...maybe one country can make policies that may be unfriendly to international competition or may make themselves less transparent to ourtside investors....then this affects everyone and creates negative ripples that eventually engulfs other ares...no country is safe now if one country decides to make non-prudent fiscal policies....or even internal governing policies can greatly affect a region as a whole...we are seeing the case in point from channel newsasia...won't name names here....<br><br>Shit I seemed to have deviated greatly and said not much...hmm...will have to collect my thoughts more and focus on a point for the next session...<br><br>see what everyone else says afirst...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In a free market, prices are determined by forces of demand and supply. When dd increase or supply decrease, prices rise, and v.v. (the invisible hand thing..) Guess anyone who have had any basic contact with Econs will know this. Well, in such a market, there is always the pros and the cons. Pro coz the consumer is the king. Those who have the demand and can afford to pay for it will get what they want. However, this makes it difficult for those who cannot afford the product unable to consume what they would like to. If say it's only a luxury good, then doesnt really matter...can do without. But what about necessities such as education?? Suppose the government does not intervene and provide cheap education to the public and let the private sector set the equilbrium price for it, most probably we'll end up seeing that many pple would not be able to afford education. Which then leads to illiteracy, poor standard of living, poverty, no economic growth...and it goes on.<br><br>Another example would be "free" things like our beautiful parks...in such a case, nobody will be willing to pay a price for it, coz they know that if they dun pay, they still get to use it...so in the end when consumers are not willing to pay, there will be no suppliers.....there will be no parks..so, such a case is also when the govt needs to intervene to provide a better standard of living for its people......<br><br>all in all, we cannot let the free market forces determine everything. In certain cases, the government will have to intervene.<br>What if we consider the case if the government intervenes in everything. It may be possible that in such a case, there will be equitable distribution of wealth, however, if u were part of such a system, would u be willing to work hard?? everybody will just sit and "kiao kar" (shake legs) since no matter how hard u work, u get to enjoy only that much. Also, such a system is extremely difficult to implement...how to determine what is equity??? if it's possible to determine, how to go about implementing it?? so there's actually lotsa problems with this system...<br><br>so conclusion is both systems will have to work hand in hand.......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is no market in the world that is either free market or a control market...it usually a mixed economy....a certain degree of a control from the GOVT.....which ensure a market free of monopoly...but the invisble hand of DD and SS also comes to play to ensure that that economy of the country can grow and prosper..therefore the two must work together or else it will fail...example is the OLD U.S.S.R</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm in my honnest and humble opinion so what if ur old and ummm 'worldly' ,to me the arrogence of the old is as good as saying im blah blah years old i know everything in comparasion to someone who is younger than me ........<br>Doesnt that indicate a closed mind and lack of a greater understanding of the workings of humans? So yes one may be young and may be lacking in experiences of life but one can be old and still lack the experience to understand and take into consideration other's points of view and perspectives. I think personally a with an open mind would understand and respect everyone elses points of view whether they agree with it or not.</div>
