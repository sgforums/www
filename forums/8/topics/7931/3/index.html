            <div class='col-md body'>Why original games cost as much as they do ?<br>Well, it is true that original games have a higher price tag due to the need to cover up loss due to piracy.<br>But there are other factors.<br><br>1. Research and development costs are high.<br>It requires an average of 2 million to do the research, writing, designing and programming. The costs includes, Wages, Equipments....<br><br>2.Packaging and marketing costs are high too.<br>Without the makers' advertisment on gaming magazine, press conference about the game, would anyone know about the game at all ???<br>In addition, money is required to provide the beautiful packages the games are in, to manufacture the wondeful CDs and to ship the games to different locations.<br><br>3.License to make and sell.<br>You need a license to make a game. Some times, when the game involve the ideas of another company, (example : Wolverine from Marvel Comics), you need to pay to that company for the right to use the characters.<br>In addition, you have to have a license to ship games to different countries and satisfy their censorship laws. You need a license and a decent shop to sell games.<br><br>4. Further Improvement to the product.<br>When the game is sold, the company still need to please the consumer by researching and releasing Patches, Webpage, Strategy guides, walkthroughs....<br>Games like Starcraft have their own world-wide gaming Server and therefore requires money.<br><br>Therefore, original games will never be able to compete with Pirated counterparts.<br>While pirated ones can go for $3 each, the best price original softwares can go is around $30. (Which is what original games are going for right now...well some of them.)<br><br>REASON WHY PIRATED CDS ARE CHEAP<br><br>1. They ignore everything.<br>They do not have to buy license, they do not have to put effort in to make the game, they do not have to ship the product, they do not have to ensure the quality of the produce, they do not have to rent a shop space.<br>In fact, pirated CDs are so poorly manufactured that they are around 70-100% less durable than original ones.<br>Its like profiting from someone else's hardwork.<br><br>For those who say "Pirated is cheap, so I buy" are VERY SELFISH people.<br>You only think of your own benefit and has no morals values whatsoever.<br><br>For those who say "they are big companies, they can afford the loss" are VERY IGNORANT people. You know how tough it is for computer programmers to survive in the current world ? Do you know how many small companys have fold due to piracy problems ?<br>You don't know the suffering until you know the people. Meaning : You think no one is suffering 'cause you can't see any visible effect of buy pirated CDs. You are a fool.<br><br>For those who says they are poor.<br>I have nothing to say.<br>I hereby apologise to all the poor people out there for the misuse of our name.<br>I myself is part of the "poor" population.<br>I have not bought a single pirated game ever.<br>I am a hardcore gamer.<br>However, unlike those who buy pirated games, I do not NEED every single game out there to survive.<br>I have bought the games like Starcraft and Halflife 'cause they are fun.<br>I have not bought any games for MORE THAN A YEAR. I have saved enough to buy the next "big" game coming out.<br>So those who say they are "poor" are NOT poor. They are GREEDY. They want all the games in the market. If they are so poor, they should be working hard to support their family, not wasting $3000 plus on a computer. I don't see why buying an original game per year is a problem. Save $10 per month and you will have $120. More than enough. But nooooo, you want to buy FIVE GAMES VERY WEEK.<br><br>So before you buy pirated CDs, think about it. Think about the REAL reason why you buy it, instead of blaming Poverty, Prices....<br>Piracy has ruin the gaming market.<br>If not for piracy, gaming would have became a national sports by now.<br>You "heck-care" attitude towards copyright laws shows the government nothing but how "childish" gaming is.<br>If our attitude towards gaming is not serious, NO ONE WILL TAKE US GAMERS SERIOUSLY.<br><br>Phew.<br>Just my 2 million cents.<br></div>
