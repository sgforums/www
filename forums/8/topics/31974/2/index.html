            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jOhO:</div><div class="quote_body">yeah i guess different couples are different. my last reln we never had joint accounts, but since i was working and she wasn't (she was studying, we were both overseas, her mum was supporting her) she would get money maybe only once a semester and sometimes when she was tight i'll just ask her to grab the cash from my wallet or take my atm card since she knows the pin anyway.<br><br>then when she get money sometimes she will pay more or even put some money back into my account. but i dunno man, as a guy, somemore working, i had to ensure that "we" never ran out of money. i took that responsibility upon myself becos we had to pay rent, i was driving (no loan on the car cos my dad bought it) but still had to pay for petrol and food and all that necessities lor.<br><br>anyway no rush, i wouldn't say money is the root of all evil in a reln, but i guess it can cause a big headache if not approached properly and in a timely manner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>currently we are both working, so it makes sense to have a joint account for future if both are committed to the relationship. i suppose it makes a big diffeence whether one is schooling or working since the expectations are different.<br><br>for your case, its slightly easier since u are financially stable on your own (with help from parents for your vehicle), so u do not need to worry that much.<br><br>so are u still with her?<br><br>i suppose people just have different concept of how to handle money, some save for a rainy day (like me or i try to), some argue that if u dun use it when are u going to use it? (like my gf), and thats where problems come in. hoping for at least 2 more years to let her get *mature* in the working world</div>
