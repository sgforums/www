I had to use heat pads all over my thighs to relax my muscles.<br><br>'Maybe next year then.'<br><br>When we suggested she host next year's show, Zoe declined.<br><br>'I don't think I'll be suitable. I'm very emotional and if I start crying, I don't want people to think I'm playing with their emotions too.'<br><br>The plight of the sick children tore at many hearts last night, taking donations to $1.03 million - $10,000 more than last week's show.<br><br>But the show was not without its funny moments - like the one where two of MediCorp's 'biggest' stars took to the air.<br><br>The Bouncing Chef and his Lady had the audience in stitches - and in awe. Would the fragile-looking harness hold all 120kg of the rotund Moses Lim?<br><br>It didn't help that the actor had had just one rehearsal - on Friday - before taking the stage for real.<br><br>The audience held their breath as Moses, 54, hurtled towards the studio ceiling.<br><br>Then it was Chen Liping's turn - on a bungee cord.<br><br>Asked if he was going to do it again, Moses joked: 'Let's not make it a habit!'<br><br>Liping - who said she weighed less than Moses but refused to reveal her exact weight - said she couldn't remember when was the last time she was so wired.<br><br>The 36-year-old star said: 'It was not as easy as it looked - I had to stretch a lot and my legs and arms are aching.'<br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-07-19/yenkf-061848.jpg"><br>But she said she is game to go for it again next year, to which Moses retorted: 'I didn't say anything!'<br><br>Funny man Mark Lee raked in nearly 260,000 calls in four acts - the most by one artiste that night.<br><br>Said Mark, who was having a late dinner when we called him just past midnight: 'For the first time in two weeks, I'm having a good meal!'<br><br>But in his typical style, he joked about his efforts.<br><br>'I'm 36, but still can tahan lah!'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><strong>YUMMY COAL DISH FOR JACK </strong><br><img src="http://newpaper.asia1.com.sg/mnt/media/image/launched/2004-07-19/yenkf-061755.jpg"><br>THANKFULLY, the night went by with no major mishaps.<br><br>Jack Neo, however, burnt the inside of his left cheek from swallowing 10 sticks of fire and chewing on hot coals.<br><br>'I was rinsing my mouth, when I realized it was smarting. It was then I knew I was burnt,' he said. 'My tongue is numb now.'<br><br>Jack, 44, said he also singed his lips and burnt his chin during a rehearsal two weeks ago. And, according to him, there really is no skill involved in the act.<br><br>'There is no technique to this, just getting the courage to put it into your mouth.<br><br>'I was only worried that the kerosene might drip into my eyes, but luckily I was wearing my glasses,' he said.<br><br>Kids, don't try this at home!<br><br>Copyright Â© 2004 Singapore Press Holdings Ltd.
