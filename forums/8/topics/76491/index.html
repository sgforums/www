I dun drink, smoke or drink coffee... I only drink tea sometimes.<br>I always wanted to go to see a doc, but on the day (weekend), I really feel normal or it does not happen. hence, I thought its ok.. but this is on and off every 2-3 months. Under no stress, I make-up my mind to go for a polyclinic checkup this coming weekend and see how the doc says.</div>
