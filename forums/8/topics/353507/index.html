              <p>I love Singapore and visit often! About 2 weeks ago, I was in your lovely country and saw a beautiful Tissot men's watch in the display window of one of your stores. It was either in The Bencoolen or the large mall (Chinatown Point) on North Bridge Road...just up the street from the Chinatown MRT station; I can't remember which one but I think it was the one on North Bridge Road.</p>
              <p>The display in the window (inside the mall) was featuring Tissot watches and the one I'm interested in was a small men's watch with day/date/month, metal band and moonphase...it may have also had some diamonds. It was very elegant and I feel certain it's still in the window.  If someone can give me more information on that watch and which shop has it for sale, I will gladly buy you a wonderful lunch or dinner when I visit next...which will be soon. Thank you for your help!!</p>

              <p>Thank you all for your responses. People from Singapore always seem so nice and helpful so I'm not surprised. I can't find a picture of it on the internet so I'm guessing it's a very rare model or limited edition or something like that. I'm not certain where I saw it but I was only in Singapore for a few days on this last trip so I've got it narrowed down to the two places I mentioned.</p>
              <p>It was in one of those small windows where watches are displayed and should be easy to spot since it had a sign featuring Tissot. I'm sorry I don't remember better where it was.</p>
              <p>I really wish I would have enquired about it while I was there. By the way, I really am an American and I live near Sacramento, California. I would have no reason to say so if I weren't!!! Thanks, again, for any information you can provide.</p>

              <p>As I said....."small men's watch with
                                      day/date/month, metal band and moonphase...it may have also had
                                      some diamonds. It was very elegant and I feel certain it's still in
                                      the window. "  I also think it was 2 tone.</p>
              <p>If you know of a Tissot with all these features, I think it will be the one. I looked on Tissot's website and it isn't there. I have one that's very similar....and it's not there, either.</p>

              <p>YES, 2 friends went up to Sugar Bowl yesterday and said it was great. It was bright and sunny but there's been quite a lot of fresh snow within the last several  weeks...it won't last much longer!</p>

              <p>Thank you all for your responses. People from Singapore always seem so nice and helpful so I'm not surprised. I can't find a picture of it on the internet so I'm guessing it's a very rare model or limited edition or something like that. I'm not certain where I saw it but I was only in Singapore for a few days on this last trip so I've got it narrowed down to the two places I mentioned.</p>
              <p>It was in one of those small windows where watches are displayed and should be easy to spot since it had a sign featuring Tissot. I'm sorry I don't remember better where it was.</p>
              <p>I really wish I would have enquired about it while I was there. By the way, I really am an American and I live near Sacramento, California. I would have no reason to say so if I weren't!!! Thanks, again, for any information you can provide.</p>

              <p><br>Can you at least visit the Tissot website to find out the model of the watch that you are after and post the link in here?</p>
              <p>And would you like us to buy the expensive watch for you first and mail it to you and you can send us the money later after when you have received that expensive watch?</p>
              <p>Please let us know as soon as possible.</p>
              <p>I am looking forward to your kindest reply as I am willing to do the most needful to assist you.</p>
              <p>Thank you and please come again. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
