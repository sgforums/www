              <p>"YES, 2 friends went up to Sugar Bowl yesterday and said it was
                                      great. It was bright and sunny but there's been quite a lot of
                                      fresh snow within the last several  weeks...it won't last much
                                      longer!"</p>
              <p>Yeah, a bunch of guys I know made the long drive from Livermore 2 weeks ago and said the white stuff was still coming down pretty hard.</p>
              <p>I almost made the move to Sacramento myself back in mid '05, actually Folsom. The potential employer touted it as being a place where you could "surf in the morning and ski in the evening!". Housing prices were way too crazy for me back then to justify the move though...and it was hot in summer,  like 105F over July 4 weekend!</p>

              <p>I'm sure you would have took our wonderful MRT when you are here. Since local bros have tried helping you already but identification of the correct watch seems futile, why not you call up the store yourself.</p>
              <p>I'm sure if you really want the watch bad enough, you will be ready to part with abit of international call time.</p>
              <p>Oh btw, it might just be me, but Singaporeans are quick to spot fakes. Even if you are not a fake, don't sound as if you are trying to convince.</p>

              <p><br>So what makes you think you will get the HELP you have requested by telling us you are a nice Amercian guy?</p>
              <p>Oh I see.....you included a free lunch to sweeten this deal. How tempting!!! Which part of your brain tells you that we cannot afford to buy lunch for ourselves or even buy our lunch on our own?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately we are not even close to those invalids which you have imagined of us. If you have decided to phrase your topic in such an offensive manner and expects to sit back and wait for a rush of eager replies placed at your disposal, then I'm have to tell say that you are just plain naive and retarded and obviously knew nothing about Singaporeans and you have very poor communication skills with strangers.</p>
              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate you for being the first member of your own Naive and Retarded Club in your home town.</p>
              <p>Why do you tell us that you are screwing with the Mayor's daughter? I am not interested in that and you should also tell us that with enough money in America, even William Hung can be a Mayor too.</p>
              <p>Too bad your Father-in-law didn't provide you with an air ticket to visit Singapore again and use your wasted life to do something meaningful such as looking for your mysterious Tissot watch which you have claimed non-existent in their websites. Note that there should be more than one Tissot website on the internet, and you should look for other sources such as EBAY or other online stores around the world if you are really zealous about that watch.</p>
              <p>Is it because you have failed to provide the same amount of love for your Father-in-law that you have provided for his daughter?</p>
              <p>Moreover, Tissot isn't that great deal of a watch for anyone to spend a return ticket and travel to Singapore to buy it. I hope you know maths and you can calculate the entire cost figures and find out for yourself.</p>
              <p>So now do you understand how silly and retarded your HELP request is? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Classy people aren't as dumb as you in their thinking, so please don't try to fool anyone around here. At least you won't fooled me.</p>

              <p>Here are my 2 cents. I still reckon that some of you peep are a lil too paranoid. Was this place swamped with trolls who post fake posts that isn't even amusing before?</p>
              <p>I thought its only natural to indicate where you're from to clarify to others that you're not local first before moving on. Although I would not have require of it, the "free dinner" part is simply nothing more than a gesture of appreciation for the trouble.</p>
              <p>I suspect that he probably did already try to look online, for the watch since that is the rational thing to do. Although I would suspect that maybe he could have gotten the brand wrong, that's just one possibility, or maybe that model which he saw (in Chinatown) was a fake. I do not see how anyone (even a troll) would get anything out of this, and no where in his posts have indicated to me conclusively that he's a troll, so I'm giving him the benifit of the doubt.</p>
              <p>Besides, he did not indicate that he's coming here ONLY to get the watch.</p>

              <p><br> So what makes you think you will get the HELP you have
              requested by telling us you are a nice Amercian guy?</p>
              <p>Oh I see.....you included a free lunch to sweeten this deal. How
              tempting!!! Which part of your brain tells you that we cannot
              afford to buy lunch for ourselves or even buy our lunch on our
              own?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately we are not even close to those invalids which you
              have imagined of us. If you have decided to phrase your topic in
              such an offensive manner and expects to sit back and wait for
              a rush of eager replies placed at your disposal, then I'm have
              to tell say that you are just plain naive and retarded and
              obviously knew nothing about Singaporeans and you have very
              poor communication skills with strangers.</p>
              <p>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate
              you for being the first member of your own Naive and
              Retarded Club in your home town.</p>
              <p>Why do you tell us that you are screwing with the Mayor's
              daughter? I am not interested in that and you should also
              tell us that with enough money in America, even William Hung can be
              a Mayor too.</p>
              <p>Too bad your Father-in-law didn't provide you with an air ticket
              to visit Singapore again and use your wasted life to do something
              meaningful such as looking for your mysterious Tissot watch which
              you have claimed non-existent in their websites. Note that there
              should be more than one Tissot website on the internet, and you
              should look for other sources such as EBAY or other online stores
              around the world if you are really zealous about that watch.</p>
              <p>Is it because you have failed to provide the same amount of love
              for your Father-in-law that you have provided for his daughter?</p>
              <p>Moreover, Tissot isn't that great deal of a watch for
              anyone to spend a return ticket and travel to Singapore to buy
              it. I hope you know maths and you can calculate the
              entire cost figures and find out for yourself.</p>
              <p>So now do you understand how silly and retarded your HELP
              request is? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Classy people aren't as dumb as you in their thinking, so please
              don't try to fool anyone around here. At least you won't fooled
              me.</p>
