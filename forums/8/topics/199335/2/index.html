            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Time Never Goes Back</strong><br><br>Once upon a time, there was a teacher and his student lying down under a big tree near a big grass area.<br>Then, suddenly, the student asked the teacher,<br><br>Student : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Can you please help me?<br><br>Teacher : (Silent for few second, than he answer) Well, it's a pretty hard and easy question.<br><br>Student : (Thinking hard) Huh???<br><br>Teacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.<br><br>Student : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).<br><br>A few minutes later...<br><br>Student : I'm back.<br><br>Teacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.<br><br>Student : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Cause you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.<br><br>Teacher : That's what happened in real life.<br><br>What is the message of this story?<br><br>* Grass - is people around you<br>* Beautiful Grass - is people that attract you<br>* Grass Field - is time<br><br>* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always compare and hope that there will be a better one. By doing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember "Time Never Goes Back".<br><br>It applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the morale is LOVE &amp; grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A young man was getting ready to graduate college. For many months he<br>Had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing<br>his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.<br><br>As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his<br>father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation<br>his father called him into his private study.<br><br>His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told<br>him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift<br>box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed the young man opened the box and<br>found a lovely, leather-bound Holy Qur'an.<br><br>Angrily, he raised his voice at his father and said, "With all your<br>money you give me a Holy Qur'an?" and stormed out of the house, leaving<br>the Holy book. He never contacted his father again for long long time.<br><br>Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He<br>had a beautiful home and wonderful family, but realized his father was<br>very old, and thought perhaps he should go to him. He had not seen him<br>since that graduation day.<br><br>Before he could make arrangements, he received a telegram telling him<br>his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his<br>son.<br>He needed to come home immediately and take care of things. When he<br>arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his<br>heart. He began to search his father's important papers and saw the<br>still new Holy Qur'an, just as he had left it years ago.<br><br>With tears, he opened the Holy Qur'an and began to turn the pages. As he<br>read those words, a car key dropped from an envelope taped behind the<br>Holy Qur'an. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who<br>had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his<br>graduation, and the words PAID IN FULL.<br><br><strong>How many times do we miss God blessings because they are not packaged as we expected?  </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Hiding Your Feelings</strong><br><br>The lesson of this sad love story is: Don't wait to until the last minute to tell someone how you really feel. Because it just might be too late. And don't always go by what your friends say, follow your heart. Read this short sad love story to read what Billy did that he regret so much about.<br>Billy loved Katie with all his heart. But he never told a Single soul. Katie secretly loved him too. But she thought she would never have a chance with him. Billy asked his friends what they think of her and his friends thought she was gay. They didn't like her at all. So Billy just went along with them. They all made fun of her and made her feel really bad. Katie was so upset.<br><br>One day they followed her home from school making fun of her the whole way home. Once she got inside her house she dropped to the floor cringe. She had a crush on Billy since 3rd grade. She didn't know what to do. When Billy got home he felt real bad about what he had done. So he decided to go to Katie's house to tell her he was sorry and that he really loves her.<br><br>When he got there he knocked on the door no one answered.<br><br>The door was open so he walked in. He walked into the living room and found Katie lying dead on the floor. She had slit her wrists. Billy was so upset . He knew it was his fault she killed herself. And now he could never tell her how he really felt.</div>
