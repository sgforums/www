            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from a forum.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Tragic Love Story </span><br><br>Once upon a time, there was once a guy who was very much in love with this girl.<br><br>This romantic guy folded 1,000 pieces of papercranes as a gift to his girl. Although, at that time he was just a small executive in his company, his future doesnÂ’t seemed too bright, they were very happy together. Until one day, his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back. She also told him that she cannot visualise any future for the both of them, so letÂ’s go their own ways there and thenÂ…heartbroken, the guy agreed.<br><br>When he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, slogging his body and mind just to make something out of himself.<br><br>Finally with all these hardwork and with the help of friends, this guy had set up his own companyÂ…<br><br>Â“You never fail until you stop trying.Â” he always told himself. Â“I must make it in life!Â” One rainy day, while this guy was driving, he saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didnÂ’t take him long to realize those were his ex-girlfriendÂ’s parents. With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury sedan. He wanted them to know that he wasnÂ’t the same anymore, he had his own company, car, condo, etc. He had made it in life!<br><br>Before the guy can realize, the couple was walking towards a cemetary,and he got out of his car and followed themÂ…and he saw his ex-girlfriend, a photograph of her smiling sweetly as ever at him from her tombstoneÂ… and he saw his precious papercranes in a bottle placed beside her tomb. Her parents saw him. He walked over and asked them why this had happened. They explained, she did not leave for France at all. She was stricken ill with cancer.<br><br>In her heart, she had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want her illness to be his obstacle Â… therefore she had chosen to leave him. She had wanted her parents to put his papercranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again he can take some of those back with him.<br><br>The guy just wept Â…the worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them but knowing you canÂ’t have them and will never see them again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Missing Rib </span><br><br>Shared by Ruthie<br>For all the guys out there, letÂ’s ponder &amp; reflect about the message below, and for the ladies you can share this with your love onesÂ…<br><br>A girl in love asked her boyfriend..<br><br>Girl (g): Tell meÂ… who do you love most in this world?<br><br>Boy (b): You, of course!<br><br>(g): In your heart, what am I to you?<br><br>(b): The boy thought for a moment and looked intently in her eyes and said, Â“You are my rib. In the Bible, it was said that God saw that Adam was lonely, during his sleep; God took one of AdamÂ’s rib and created Eve. Every man has been searching for his missing rib, only when you find the woman of your life; youÂ’ll no longer feel the lingering ache in your heart.Â”<br><br>After their wedding, the couple had a sweet and happy life for a while. However, the youthful couple began to drift apart due to the busy schedule of life and the never-ending worries of daily problemsÂ….their life became mundaneÂ….<br><br>All the challenges posed by the harsh realities of life began to gnaw away their dreams and love for each otherÂ… The couple began to have more quarrels and each quarrel became more heated..<br><br>One day, after the quarrel, the girl ran out of the houseÂ…. At the opposite side of the road, she shouted, Â“You donÂ’t love me!Â”<br><br>The boy hated her childishness and out of impulse, retorted, Â“Maybe, it was a mistake for us to be together! You were never my missing rib!Â”<br><br>Suddenly, she turned quiet and stood there for a long whileÂ…. He regretted what he said but words spoken are like thrown away water, you can never take it back. With tears, she went home to pack her things and was determined in breaking- up.<br><br>Before she left the house, Â“If IÂ’m really not your missing rib, please let me goÂ….. She ontinued, Â“It is less painful this wayÂ… let us go on our separate ways and search for our own partnersÂ…Â”<br><br>Five years went byÂ….<br><br>He never remarried but he had tried to find out about her life indirectlyÂ…Â… She had left the country and backÂ…. She had married a foreigner and dvorcedÂ….. He felt anguished that she never waited for him.<br><br>In the dark and lonely night, he lit his cigarette and felt the lingering ache in his heart. He couldnÂ’t bring himself to admit that he was missing her..<br><br>One day, they finally metÂ…. At the airport, a place where there were many reunions and good-byesÂ…. He was going away on a business trip. She was standing there alone, with just the security door separating them. She smiled at him gently.<br><br>(b): How are you?<br><br>(g): IÂ’m fine. How about youÂ…Have you found your missing rib?<br><br>(b): No.<br><br>(g): IÂ’ll be flying to New York in the next flight.<br><br>(b): IÂ’ll be back in 2 weeks time. Give me a call when you are backÂ… You know my numberÂ…Nothing has changed.<br><br>With a smile, she turned around and waved good-bye..<br><br>Good-byeÂ…..<br><br>One week later, he heard of her death. She had perished in New York. In the event that shocked the world..<br><br>MidnightÂ….. Once again, he lit his cigaretteÂ….. And like before, he felt the lingering ache in his heartÂ…. He finally knew, she was the missing rib that he had carelessly brokenÂ….<br><br>Sometimes, people say things out of moments of furyÂ….. Most often than not, the outcome could be disastrous and detrimentalÂ…. We vent our frustrations 99% at our loved onesÂ…. And even though we know that we ought to Â“think twice and act wiselyÂ”, itÂ’s often easier said than done.<br><br>Things happen each day, many of which are beyond our controlÂ…. Let us treasure every moment and everyone in our livesÂ….<br><br>Tomorrow may never come; give and accept what you have today.<br><br>Â“Men stumble over pebbles, never over mountains.Â” - Emilie Cady<br><br>Flash - <a href="http://flash.jninfo.net/swf/m3398.swf" rel="nofollow">http://flash.jninfo.net/swf/m3398.swf</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loving An Imperfect Person </span><br><br>They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handles their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temper and always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her.<br><br>Today, sheÂ’s being willful again.<br><br>Her: Â“Why canÂ’t you be the photographer for my friendÂ’s wedding? She promised sheÂ’d pay.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“I donÂ’t have time that day.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Humph!Â”<br><br>Him: Â“Huh?Â”<br><br>Her: Â“DonÂ’t have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“IÂ… someone will definitely recognize my work some day.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Humph! I donÂ’t care, youÂ’ll have to do it for her!Â”<br><br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Just this once?Â”<br><br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br><br>NegotiationÂ’s broken. So, she gave the final warning: Â“Give me a Yes within three days, or elseÂ…Â”<br><br>First day, she Â“withheldÂ” the kitchen, bathroom, computer, refrigerator, television, hi-fiÂ… Except the double bed, to show her Â“benevolenceÂ”.<br><br>Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didnÂ’t mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets.<br><br>Second day, she conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, Â“Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences.Â”<br><br>HeÂ’s nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy, hoping that sheÂ’ll end this state. She doesnÂ’t give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.<br><br>Third day, night. On the bed. HeÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to one side. SheÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to the other side.<br><br>Him: Â“We need to talk.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Unless itÂ’s about the wedding, forget it.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“ItÂ’s something very important.Â”<br><br>She remains silent.<br><br>Him: Â“LetÂ’s get a divorce.Â”<br><br>She did not believe her ears.<br><br>Him: Â“I got to know a girl.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, thatÂ’s the only place she didnÂ’t go through yesterday. How careless.<br><br>Him: Â“SheÂ’s a nice girl.Â”<br><br>Her tears fell.<br><br>Him: Â“She has a good personality too.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart.<br><br>Him: Â“She says that sheÂ’ll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s very jealous because she said the same thing in the past.<br><br>Him: Â“She loves me truly.Â”<br><br>She wishes to sit up and scream at him Â“DonÂ’t I?Â”<br><br>Him: Â“So, I think she wonÂ’t force me to do something that I donÂ’t want to do.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s thinking, but the rage wonÂ’t subside.<br><br>Him: Â“Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Â…!Â”<br><br>He brings the photo before her eyes. SheÂ’s in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face.<br><br>He sighs. She cries.<br><br>He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.<br><br>He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. HeÂ’s asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him.<br><br>She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesnÂ’t want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.<br><br>She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh.<br><br>ItÂ’s a nicely taken photo. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.<br><br>He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep.<br><br>Â“You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.Â”<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A Â“LoveÂ” Story </span><br><br>Once upon a time there was an island where all the feelings lived. Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all the others, including Love.<br><br>One day it was announced to all of the feelings that the island was going to sink to the bottom of the ocean. So all the feelings prepared their boats to leave. Love was the only one that stayed. She wanted to preserve the island paradise until the last possible moment. When the island was almost totally under, Love decided it was time to leave. She began looking for someone to ask for help.<br><br>Just then Richness was passing by in a grand boat. Love asked, Â“Richness, Can I come with you on your boat?Â” Richness answered, Â“IÂ’m sorry, but there is a lot of silver and gold on my boat and there would be no room for you anywhere.Â”<br><br>Then Love decided to ask Vanity for help who was passing in a beautiful vessel. Love cried out, Â“Vanity, help me please.Â” Â“I canÂ’t help you,Â” Vanity said. Â“You are all wet and will damage my beautiful boat.Â”<br><br>Next, Love saw Sadness passing by. Love said, Â“Sadness, please let me go with you.Â” Sadness answered, Â“Love, IÂ’m sorry, but, I just need to be alone now.Â”<br><br>Then, Love saw Happiness. Love cried out, Â“Happiness, please take me with you.Â” But Happiness was so overjoyed that he didnÂ’t hear Love calling to him.<br><br>Love began to cry. Then, she heard a voice say, Â“Come Love, I will take you with me.Â” It was an elder. Love felt so blessed and overjoyed that she forgot to ask the elder his name. When they arrived on land the elder went on his way. Love realized how much she owed the elder.<br><br>Love then found Knowledge and asked, Â“Who was it that helped me?Â” Â“It was Time,Â” Knowledge answered. Â“But why did Time help me when no one else would?Â” Love asked. Knowledge smiled and with deep wisdom and sincerity, answered, Â“Because only Time is capable of understanding how great Love is.Â”<br></div>

Softly I answered, Â“If luckyÂ… oneÂ… I HAVE YOU!!!Â”<br><br>Pass this on and let your friends know that you care!!!<br><br>A Friend Is Always Special Because Friends Love You Because You Are You!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Korean sad love story - "I Love You" </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 1</span><br><br>I have a boyfriend who grew up with me. His name is Jin. I always thought of him as a friend until last year, when we went to a trip from a club. I found that I fell in love with him. Before that trip was over, I took a step and confessed my love for him. And soon, we became a pair of lovers, but we loved each other in different ways. I always concentrated on him only, but by his side, there were so many other girls. To me, he was the only one, but to him, maybe I was just another girlÂ…<br><br>Â“Jin, do you want to go watch a movie?Â” I asked.<br>Â“I canÂ’tÂ”<br>Â“Why? You need to study at home?Â” I felt disappointment grabbing me.<br>Â“NoÂ… I am going to meet a friendÂ…Â”<br><br>He was always like that. He met girls in front of me, like it was nothing. To him, I was just a girlfriend. The word Â‘loveÂ’ only came out from my mouth. Since I knew him, I had never heard him say Â‘I love youÂ’ before. To us, there werenÂ’t any anniversaries at all. He didnÂ’t say anything from the first day and it continued till 100 daysÂ…200daysÂ… Everyday, before we say goodbye, he would just hand me a doll, everyday, without fail. I donÂ’t know whyÂ…<br><br>Then one dayÂ…<br><br>Me: Um, Jin, I Â…<br>Jin: WhatÂ…donÂ’t drag, just say..<br>Me: I love you.<br>Jin: Â…Â…youÂ….um, just take this doll and go home.<br>That was how he ignored my Â‘three wordsÂ’ and handed me the doll. Then he disappeared, like he was running away. The dolls I received from him everyday, filled my room, one by one. There were manyÂ…<br>Then one day came, my 15th year old birthday. When I got up in the morning, I pictured a party with him, and stranded myself in my room, waiting for his call. ButÂ… lunch passed, dinner passedÂ… and soon the sky was darkÂ… he still didnÂ’t call. It was already tiring to look at the phone anymore. Then around 2am in the morning, he suddenly called me and woke me from my sleep. He told me to come out of the house. Still, I felt joy and I ran out happily.<br>Me: JinÂ…<br><br>Jin: HereÂ…take thisÂ…<br>Again, he handed me a little doll.<br>Me: WhatÂ’s this?<br>Jin: I didnÂ’t give it to you yesterday, so I am giving it to you now. IÂ’m going home now, bye.<br>Me: Wait, wait! Do you know what today is?<br>Jin: Today? Huh?<br>I felt so sad, I thought he would remember my birthday. He turned around and walked away like nothing had happen.Then I shoutedÂ… Â“WaitÂ…Â”<br>Jin: You have something to say?<br>Me: Tell me, tell me you love meÂ…<br>Jin: What?!<br>Me: Tell me<br>I put my pathetic self behind and clung on to him. But he just said simple cold words and left.<br>Â“I donÂ’t want to sayÂ…that I love someone so easily, if you are desperate to hear it, then find someone else.Â”<br>That was what he said. Then he ran off. My legs felt numbÂ… and I collapsed to the ground. He didnÂ’t want to say it easilyÂ… How could heÂ…. I felt thatÂ… Maybe he is not the right guy for meÂ…<br>After that day, I stranded myself at home crying, just crying. He didnÂ’t call me, although I was waiting. He just continued handing me a little doll every morning outside my house. ThatÂ’s how those dolls piled up in my roomÂ… everyday</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by babymac13:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Loving An Imperfect Person </span><br><br>They have been married for two years. He loves literature and often posts his work on the net, but nobody ever reads them. He is also into photography and he handles their wedding photos. He loves her very much. Likewise with her. She has a quick temper and always bullies him. He is a gentleman and always gives in to her.<br><br>Today, sheÂ’s being willful again.<br><br>Her: Â“Why canÂ’t you be the photographer for my friendÂ’s wedding? She promised sheÂ’d pay.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“I donÂ’t have time that day.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Humph!Â”<br><br>Him: Â“Huh?Â”<br><br>Her: Â“DonÂ’t have time? Write less of those novels, and you will have all the time you need.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“IÂ… someone will definitely recognize my work some day.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Humph! I donÂ’t care, youÂ’ll have to do it for her!Â”<br><br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Just this once?Â”<br><br>Him: Â“No.Â”<br><br>NegotiationÂ’s broken. So, she gave the final warning: Â“Give me a Yes within three days, or elseÂ…Â”<br><br>First day, she Â“withheldÂ” the kitchen, bathroom, computer, refrigerator, television, hi-fiÂ… Except the double bed, to show her Â“benevolenceÂ”.<br><br>Of course, she has to sleep on it too. He didnÂ’t mind, as he still has some cash in his pockets.<br><br>Second day, she conducted a raid and removed everything from his pockets and warned, Â“Seek any external help, and you bear the consequences.Â”<br><br>HeÂ’s nervous now. That night, on the bed, he begs for mercy, hoping that sheÂ’ll end this state. She doesnÂ’t give a damn. No way am I giving in, whatever he says. Until he agrees.<br><br>Third day, night. On the bed. HeÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to one side. SheÂ’s lying on the bed, looking to the other side.<br><br>Him: Â“We need to talk.Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Unless itÂ’s about the wedding, forget it.Â”<br><br>Him: Â“ItÂ’s something very important.Â”<br><br>She remains silent.<br><br>Him: Â“LetÂ’s get a divorce.Â”<br><br>She did not believe her ears.<br><br>Him: Â“I got to know a girl.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s totally angry, and wanted to hit him. But she held it down, wanting to let him finish. But her eyes already felt wet. He took a photo out from his chest. Probably from his undershirt pocket, thatÂ’s the only place she didnÂ’t go through yesterday. How careless.<br><br>Him: Â“SheÂ’s a nice girl.Â”<br><br>Her tears fell.<br><br>Him: Â“She has a good personality too.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s heartbroken because he puts a photo of some other girl close to his heart.<br><br>Him: Â“She says that sheÂ’ll support me fully in my pursue for literature after we got married.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s very jealous because she said the same thing in the past.<br><br>Him: Â“She loves me truly.Â”<br><br>She wishes to sit up and scream at him Â“DonÂ’t I?Â”<br><br>Him: Â“So, I think she wonÂ’t force me to do something that I donÂ’t want to do.Â”<br><br>SheÂ’s thinking, but the rage wonÂ’t subside.<br><br>Him: Â“Want to take a look at the photo I took for her?Â”<br><br>Her: Â“Â…!Â”<br><br>He brings the photo before her eyes. SheÂ’s in a total rage, hits his hand away and leaves a burning slap on his face.<br><br>He sighs. She cries.<br><br>He puts the photo back to his pocket. She pulls her hand back under the blanket.<br><br>He turns off the light, and sleeps. She turns on the light, and sits up. HeÂ’s asleep. She lost sleep. She regrets treating him the way she treated him.<br><br>She cried again, and thought about a lot of things. She wants to wake him up. She wants to have a intimate talk with him. She doesnÂ’t want to push him anymore. She stares at his chest. She wants to see how the girl looks.<br><br>She slips the photo out. She wanted to cry and she wanted to laugh.<br><br>ItÂ’s a nicely taken photo. A photo he took for her. She bends down, and kissed him on his cheek.<br><br>He smiled. He was just pretending to be asleep.<br><br>Â“You learn to love, not by finding a perfect person, but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.Â”<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>I like this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Korean drama sad love story - "I Love You" </strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Part 2</span><br><br>After a month, I got myself together and went to school. But what made the pain resurface was thatÂ… I saw him on a streetÂ… with another girlÂ… He had a smile on his face, one that he never showed meÂ…as he touched the dollÂ… I ran straight back home and looked at the dolls in my room, and tears fellÂ… Why did he gave these to meÂ… Those dolls are probably picked out by some other girlsÂ…In a fit of anger, I threw the dolls around. Then suddenly, the phone rang. It was him. He told me to come out to the bus stop outside my house. I tried to calm myself down and walked to the bus stop. I kept reminding myself that I am going to forget him, thatÂ… itÂ’s going to end. Then he came into my sight, holding a big doll.<br><br>Jin: Jo, I thought you were pissed, you really came?<br>I couldnÂ’t help hating him, acting like nothing had happen and joking around. Soon, he held out the doll as usualÂ…<br>Me: I donÂ’t need it. Jin: WhatÂ….whyÂ…<br>I grabbed the doll from his hands and threw it on the road.<br>Me: I donÂ’t need this doll, I donÂ’t need it anymore!! I donÂ’t want to see a person like you again!<br>I spitted out all the words that were inside me. But unlike other days, his eyes very shaking.<br>Â“IÂ’m sorryÂ” He apologized in a tiny voice. He then walked over to the road to pick up the dollÂ…<br>Me: You stupid! Why are you picking up the doll?! Just throw it away!!!<br><br>But he ignored me and just went to pick the doll. ThenÂ…<br><br>Honk~ Honk~<br>With a loud honk, a big truck was heading towards him.<br>Â“Jin! Move! Move away!Â” I shoutedÂ… But he didnÂ’t hear me, he squatted down and picked up the doll.<br>Â“Jin, move!Â” HONK~!! Â“Boom!Â” That sound, so terrifying.<br>ThatÂ’s how he went away from me. ThatÂ’s how he went away without even opening his eyes to say one word to me.<br>After that day, I had to go through everyday with guiltiness and the sadness of losing himÂ… And after spending two months like a crazy personÂ… I took out the dolls.<br><br>Those were the only gifts he left me since the day we started going out. I remembered the days I spent with him and started to count the daysÂ… when we were in loveÂ…<br><br>Â“OneÂ…twoÂ… threeÂ…Â” That was howÂ… I started to count the dollsÂ…<br>Â“Four hundred and eighty fourÂ… four hundred and eighty fiveÂ…Â” It all ended with 485 dolls.<br>I then started to cry again, with a doll in my arms. I hugged it tightly, then suddenlyÂ…<br><br>Â“I love you~, I love you~Â” I dropped the dolls,shocked.<br><br>Â“IÂ….lo..veÂ…you??Â” I picked up the dolls and pressed its stomach.<br><br>Â“I love you~ I love you~Â” It canÂ’t be! I pressed all the dollsÂ’ stomach as it piled on the side.<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Â“I love you~Â”<br>Those words came out non-stop. IÂ…love youÂ… Why didnÂ’t I realize thatÂ….That his heart was always by my side, protecting me. Why didnÂ’t I realize that he love me this muchÂ… I took out the doll under the bed and pressed itÂ’s stomach, that was the last doll, the one that fell on the road. It had his blood stain on it. The voice came out, the on that I was missing so muchÂ…<br><br>Â“JoÂ…Do you know what today is? WeÂ’ve been loving each other for 486 days. Do you know what 486 is? I couldnÂ’t say I love youÂ…. UmÂ… since I was too shyÂ… If you forgive me and take this doll, I will say that I love youÂ… everydayÂ… till I dieÂ… JoÂ… I love youÂ…Â”<br><br>The tears came flowing out of me. Why? Why? I asked god, why do I only know about all this now? He canÂ’t be by my side, but he loved me until his last minuteÂ…<br><br>For thatÂ… and for that reasonÂ… to meÂ… it became courageÂ… to live a beautiful life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Salty Coffee</strong><br><br>He met her at a party. She was so outstanding, many guys chasing after her, while he was so normal, nobody paid attention to him.<br><br>At the end of the party, he invited her to have coffee with him, she was surprised but due to being polite, she promised. They sat in a nice coffee shop, he was too nervous to say anything, she felt uncomfortable, and she thought to herself, "Please, let me go home..."<br><br>Suddenly he asked the waiter, "Would you please give me some salt? I'd like to put it in my coffee." Everybody stared at him, so strange! His face turned red but still, he put the salt in his coffee and drank it. She asked him curiously, "Why you have this hobby?" He replied, "When I was a little boy, I lived near the sea, I liked playing in the sea, I could feel the taste of the sea, just like the taste of the salty coffee. Now every time I have the salty coffee, I always think of my childhood, think of my hometown, I miss my hometown so much, I miss my parents who are still living there." While saying that tears filled his eyes. She was deeply touched. That's his true feeling, from the bottom of his heart. A man who can tell out his homesickness, he must be a man who loves home, cares about home, has responsibility of home... Then she also started to speak, spoke about her faraway hometown, her childhood, her family.<br><br>That was a really nice talk, also a beautiful beginning of their story. They continued to date. She found that actually he was a man who meets all her demands; he had tolerance, was kind hearted, warm, careful. He was such a good person but she almost missed him! Thanks to his salty coffee! Then the story was just like every beautiful love story, the princess married to the prince, and then they were living the happy life... And, every time she made coffee for him, she put some salt in the coffee, as she knew that's the way he liked it.<br><br>After 40 years, he passed away, left her a letter which said, "My dearest, please forgive me, forgive my whole life's lie. This was the only lie I said to you---the salty coffee. Remember the first time we dated? I was so nervous at that time, actually I wanted some sugar, but I said salt. It was hard for me to change so I just went ahead. I never thought that could be the start of our communication! I tried to tell you the truth many times in my life, but I was too afraid to do that, as I have promised not to lie to you for anything... Now I'm dying, I afraid of nothing so I tell you the truth, I don't like the salty coffee, what a strange bad taste... But I have had the salty coffee for my whole life! Since I knew you, I never feel sorry for anything I do for you. Having you with me is my biggest happiness for my whole life. If I can live for the second time, still want to know you and have you for my whole life, even though I have to drink the salty coffee again."<br><br>Her tears made the letter totally wet. Someday, someone asked her, "What's the taste of salty coffee?" She replied, "It's sweet."<br><br>Pass this to everyone because love is not to forget but to forgive, not to see but understand, not to hear but to listen, not to let go but HOLD ON!!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is a poem about a parent's love for a child and a child's love for their parent. Touching and real to me!</span><br><br>LOVE YOU FOREVER<br>by Robert Munsch<br>A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she held him, she sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever,<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br>The baby grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was two years old, and he ran all around the house. He pulled all the books off the shelves. He pulled all the food out of the refrigerator and he took his mother's watch and flushed it down the toilet. Sometimes his mother would say, "This kid is driving me CRAZY!" But at night time, when that two-year-old was quiet, she opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor, looked up over the side of his bed; and if he was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. While she rocked him she sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever,<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br>The little boy grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. he grew until he was nine years old. And he never wanted to come in for dinner, he never wanted to take a bath, and when grandma visited he always said bad words. Sometimes his mother wanted to sell him to the zoo! But at night time, when he was asleep, the mother quietly opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed. If he was really asleep, she picked up that nine-year-old boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rocked him she sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever,<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br>The boy grew. he grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was a teenager. He had strange friends and he wore strange clothes and he listened to strange music. Sometimes the mother felt like she was in a zoo! But at night time, when that teenager was asleep, the mother opened the door to his room, crawled across the floor and looked up over the side of the bed. If he was really asleep she picked up that great big boy and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. While she rocked him she sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever,<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br>That teenager grew. He grew and he grew and he grew. He grew until he was a grown-up man. He left home and got a house across town. But sometimes on dark nights the mother got into her car and drove across town. If all the lights in her son's house were out, she opened his bedroom window, crawled across the floor, and looked up over the side of his bed. If that great big man was really asleep she picked him up and rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while she rocked him she sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br>Well, that mother, she got older. She got older and older and older. One day she called up her son and said, "You better come see because I'm very old and sick." So her son came to see her. When he came in the door she tried to sing the song. She sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever<br>I'll like you for always....<br>But she couldn't finish because she was too old and sick. The son went to his mother. He picked her up and rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And he sang this song:<br><br>I'll love you forever,<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my Mommy you'll be.<br><br>When the son came home that night, he stood for a long time at the top of the stairs. Then he went into the room where his very new baby daughter was sleeping. He picked her up in his arms and very slowly rocked her back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And while he rocked her he sang:<br><br>I'll love you forever<br>I'll like you for always,<br>As long as I'm living<br>my baby you'll be.<br><br></div>
