But remember the lectures and tutorials and labs are there for a reason and if you're smart enough you can get your minimum of 75% or 80%(usually business schools) attendance.<br>The 1st year of poly is the best time to pull your GPA up above 3.5. Once you get into year 2 and 3 subsequently the modules are gonna get harder and if you're an average person like me(heeh) the A's are going to get hard to attain.<br><br>So my advice to you would be to enjoy and study smart at the same time. Those 3 years will go by in a flash. Trust me, i still couldn't believe i'm having my graduating ceremony next month.</div>
