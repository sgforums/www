            <div class='col-md body'>Hi pple...i need yor help in what to do..i'm totally out of ideas.<br>I have a friend who is in the marketing business. I've been to take a look at the product she is selling and can say that it is effective and useful. She has asked me to get my parents to go to her office to try out the product too, but my parents are not in the least interested or bothered to do so.<br>I've told her that but she says maybe i didn't try hard enough to persuade my parents. She insisted on coming to my house to talk to my parents herself and persuade them to try out the product. My parents do not want her coming and though I've told her that, she's very persistent and keeps insisting on coming to talk to them.<br>How do i talk her out of it? Anyone can give me ideas?<br>Thank you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, since ur fren called up everyday and ur parents picking up the phone, why not tell ur fren to talk to them on the phone first? and let ur parents decide whether they want to try her product or not.<br><br>Since u can't do any help, I think the best way to reject her offer is from ur parents decision. Anyway, just one of my suggestion here. Hope it helps!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Siaobell,<br>In my case one of my acquaintances in the army suddenly called me out of the blue, and said he wanted to go out and have a chat with me. But strangely he wanted to go to my area, and met me at a nearby coffeeshop, and he had a "friend" with him, and he finally revealed his true intention to sell that stupid bed thing. His friend was the one who intro him to the sales I think(both are trying to sell me). Out of courtesy I sat thru the whole "lecture" and after that they keep telling me to buy and tell my parents etc etc...I for one do not spend money on gimmicks(if it's so great why do they need salesmen to promote it, they should be world famous right?). Needless to say I was pissed off, but did not show it. But he kept paging me later and I finally erupted, saying that I'm disappointed he had to pull this kind of stunt on me. I always believed friends are friends, but you do not mix business with friendship and take advantage of it. He was unhappy at first, but later apologised to me. Just to let you know it's best to tell them straight in the face. Saves you time and er..money of course. But NEVER buy from your friend (unless he/she is going to get in jail or something like that or er..."ki-chia"(die) just because you never buy from him/her). Er...just my two thousand word essay's worth..<br><br>---------------<br>"I believe in you, you know you're the door to my barest soul"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Siaobell, if I face this case, I'll probably just say a flat NO to my fren. If she is really my fren, then she shd not get angry.<br><br>If she gets angry, just too bad, I lose a fren. I'm not saying that frens are not important, just that frens who pushes you too much are not caring about your feelings. So are they really worthy frens?
