                                comprehensive and profound. They recognise and revere the truth of the Buddha-dharma 
                                as soon as they encounter it. However, they face a common dilemma: they 
                                hesitate to take refuge in the Three Treasures because they do not wish 
                                to be vegetarians. For this reason, some ponder at the gate of Buddhism 
                                for a long time and are afraid to take that step forward. Others arrive 
                                at the crossroad of religion, some took the wrong turn and ended up with 
                                some cults or unorthodox ways. They do not realise that it is not easy to 
                                be born a human, and it is even harder to have the opportunity to encounter 
                                the Buddha-dharma. Having been born a human, it is indeed a waste of opportunity

                                  Buddha-dharma is infinite and there are in reality more than 84,000 Dharma 
                                  doors, or methods by which we can embark to learn and practise Buddhism. 
                                  Vegetarianism is just one of the many methods. To refrain from killing 
                                  is merely a means of assisting us to progress in our cultivation. As a 
                                  medicine, meat is permitted in the Buddhist precepts if it is required 
                                  to cure a particular sickness. Buddhism cherishes compassion. However, 
                                  killing and causing harm to life have their retributions. The world has 
                                  no peace as victims and villains engage in a vicious cycle of vengeance 
                                  and revenge, culminating in calamities and disasters, and inflicting suffering 
                                  and misery across the world. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">Buddha understands 
                                  the ignorance and habits of sentient beings that have accumulated from 
                                  aeons of their many past lives. In order to provide sentient beings with 
                                  an expedient means of embracing <em><strong><span style="color: #003399;">Buddhism, 
                                  those who are not able to convert to a vegetarian diet on a long term 
                                  basis are permitted to consume meat provided:</span></strong></em> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">(1) That he did not 
                                  slaughter the animal personally<br> (2) That he did not instruct others to slaughter<br> (3) That the slaughter was not committed for his sake<br> (4) That he did not witness the slaughter<br> (5) That he did not hear the cries associated with the slaughter <br> <strong><span style="color: #cc0000;"><em><br> </em></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">To 
                                  refrain from killing is fundamental to Buddhism. Regardless of life forms, 
                                  we must not kill, we must not instruct others to kill, and it must not 
                                  be killed for our sake, for example, to celebrate our birthday or because 
                                  we were coming to dinner. These are three sources of clean meat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">In Confucianism, benevolence 
                                  also means to refrain from killing. It is said that heaven has the virtue 
                                  of loving life. It cannot bear to witness the loss of life, let alone 
                                  eat the flesh of those whose cries in death we have heard. Buddhism advocates 
                                  compassion and loving-kindness to all sentient beings, regardless of their 
                                  relation to you. It is only appropriate that we do not kill for our livelihood 
                                  or for the purpose of celebrating occasions, such as births, birthdays, 
                                  funerals or weddings. Meats are no different from the other foodstuffs 
                                  purchased from the market if people do not witness the killing or hear 
                                  the cries of the animal that is being slaughtered. If a differentiation 
                                  between the two kinds of purchases and the taste of the meat do not exist 
                                  in the mind, then the guilt is lighter. Together with the three mentioned 
                                  earlier, these constitute the five sources of clean meat. </span></p>

                                  is a pre-condition to killing. If people refrain from eating meat, there 
                                  will be no killing of animals for meat. Sadly, the human race has committed 
                                  killings for aeons and is engaged in an endless cycle of vengeance and 
                                  revenge over their past lives. For one who is slaughtered for meat in 
                                  this life, it is probably because he had done the same to others in the 
                                  past. The score is even, no more and no less. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: normal;">People who eat meat 
                                  from the five clean sources are advised to learn to chant the Buddha's 
                                  name and the Buddhist mantras, so as to transfer the merits to those whose 
                                  meat they are eating. They should also wish them an early rebirth in the 
                                  human realm, to eliminate any thoughts of vengeance, to nurture their 
                                  virtuous roots to benefit all sentient beings and together build a peaceful, 
                                  caring and blissful pure land in this world. Only when this is promoted 
                                  across the entire world, will we be able to eliminate hatred and vengeance, 
                                  and enhance a mind of compassion and loving kindness. In this way we will 
                                  be able to transform this Saha world into a pure land.</span></p>

              <p>The people can get damn inconsiderate.</p>
              <p>KNN.....they want to burn one whole big lorry-load of joss paper, by all means, but wtf?! They go and drag this huge cage-like thing meant for mass burning, put in the field at my house and burn merrily.</p>
              <p>Firstly, KNN....that one public property you also want to pinch. Burn already they just left it in the middle of the field. The poor workers wasted much sweat transporting the freaking thing back.</p>
              <p>Secondly, they don't even consider how residents like me feel with all the ash flying around. A bit of burning, fine, but when you have a truck-load of things to burn and you burn it at a residential area, you just a fucking prick. Can't just go somewhere remote to do it??</p>
              <p>And other small-scale stuff include pinching 2 smaller burning-bins and putting them in the same field to burn. WTF?! Cannot burn at the designated area meh? And use already don't know how to put back??</p>
              <p>Really gets on my nerves when you have inconsiderate people like these.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I don't really believe much about 7th month. But on Friday night, I kena accident. Knocked over a cyclist. No one was majorly hurt but my car windscreen shattered. Cyclist managed to walk away after the accident. Came home, called mother then she reminded me that it's 7th month. Damn suay... cyclist turned without looking and I was going straight. So yah... damn pissed with him. By the time I saw him, he was directly in my path. Luckily, I wasn't speeding.

              <p>Some cyclists always assume that everyone else on the road has to give way to them. Just be more careful which I'm glad you'd done.</p>
