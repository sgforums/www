              <p>I was out for 7 months due to an operation... during the 7 months, I was bound to my bed, unable to exercise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm 184cm, previous weight is around 83~85kg. But now, I think my weight shot up to 100+ already...  - ,, -</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after recovering enough, these days, i've begun to run daily, but feel that it is not enough..</p>
              <p>can you recommend any slimming pills / methods to go along with my daily runs in order to allow for a faster return to my former fitness?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Watch your knees (the ones below the waist) when you run cos of your weight and height.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One good way is to do stationary cycling at gym. Always recommended for peeps who just started or recovered from something. Good conditioning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But more importantly, you need aerobics. I dun mean dressing up in skin tigh leotard and prancing around the foam mats antangonising and demolishing everyone in your path knowingly or not. You need to to keep burning for more than 20min at a certain heartrate so kick start your body into fat burning mode. I believe a GP or those membership sales exec can advise better in detials.</p>
              <p>If you are the sort that ran 15min feeling shiok and 'powerful' and tired out at the 20th min and stopped thinking that you have 'exercised', I'm sorry...you have not burn anything except some oxygen and most of your muscle. Yes, muscles, not fats.</p>
              <p>If you swmin, thinking that hydrotherapy is good; is it is but again, unless you swim more continuously (e.g. 20 laps), then you are burning something.</p>
              <p>I dunno what ops you recovered from, or your fitness level so can't advise much. But if you are basically fit with no significant health issues, do work out. Good for you even if you are not dieting!</p>
              <p>Try brisk walking for a start. Go to MacRitchie and walk HSBC Tree top walk briskly. Bring water along to hydrate and add weight for more challanges.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Happy training.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Do include HIIT into your regime</p>
              <p>And full-body workouts using the compound exercises.</p>

              <p>In addition, try to do some SMFR =&gt; not really for fat loss though, but helps reduce injury risks and improve recovery</p>
