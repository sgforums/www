            <div class='col-md body'>im feeling so crazy nowadays. i guess as a person matures, he will think more and probably become more paranoid like me. i have never felt anything like this in my entire life until my first breakup with a girl. this is total maddness. its the fear of being alone. its the dear that people will just hurt you again. its all about envying other people whom are receiving so much love and care from their partners. its about being unable to behave like the way i used to. the way i usually am - cherrful, positive and sporty. is this only happening to me or is this something in life that everybody has to experienced ? this is hurt, this is pain. or am i being too selfish to think of myself all the time ? my friends told me that i should not be so selfish and think about ME and myself all the time. i've tried but the feelings and emotions within me is so real. its something i can't deny. how i wish i have someone near me right now. i dont need a girl to kiss and hug. i would just like some love. someone to merely comment "hey do take care, good nite". but no. never. i really wish im dead now. i think that im a good guy, not some bad bastards who play with their girl and dump them. but im resticted to having a gf till my studies are over. im like a time bomb. i need someone to defuse me. would it be God ? or would it be a girl ? can someone tell me what to do ?</div>

No matter how good you look, if you are always in this pitiful stage, you will most likely not get your ideal gf - unless you want just a sympathetic gf - then again, she will ditch you not long after because she will be tired to maintain you - too much of a maintenance, just to stroke you ego and insecurity.</div>
