            <div class='col-md body'>well as i said in a letter to miss X.....<br><br>the most anyone should do out of respect for their realtionship and for the girl that you are trying to catch, is to become her friend...<br><br>I think don't make it a point to chase them...Let it happen natrually..if hse befriends you and falls for you in the course of your friendship, then that is "fair game".  To actually chase the girl then makes it unfair...it makes you a relationship breaker for your own selfish needs....<br><br>totally unethical and should be considered before you do it....if you come to the conclussion that this is the person for you after some hard deliberation, then you might consider chasing her if you think it is right....but if she is a perfectly good relationship and you just want her out of your own momentary needs and wants then dun do it....<br><br>that's what i beleive....some flexibilty here...while maintaing some form of respect and morales/principles...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DD1:<br>I guess it's also boils down to one thing. Firstly, ask yourself, do u have the intend or something u planned for, in the very begining. U ask her out for a movie &amp; she accepted, that's nothing wrong with that. It could still be meant as a platonic friendship. And u didn't know that u'll click so well with her. And she enjoy your company. It really depends on whether she come out with u is becoz she treat u as a frd too or with intend. 1 thing lead to another, u just couldn't help it now, right?<br><br>Don't worry, as long as your conscience is clear &amp; u have no intention to snatch her away from him, it's just that she wants to come to u, dun call yourself a bastard.<br><br></div>
