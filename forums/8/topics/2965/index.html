            <div class='col-md body'>Your post is very general...Different people react in different ways when faced with a possibility of having a new bf/gf....Some gals mean wat they say...some dun really mean it(ok...they mean 90% of it...the other 10%...they wish that U try harder)......so it all depends on the gal lor....<br><br>But if strictly talking about chemistry and action.....I think chemistry counts more...at least it gives U an advantage in watever U want to try to put into action....<br><br>------------------<br>Being broke is a temporary situation.

            <div class='col-md body'>ok, you made me do this ... I'll state some specifics.<br><br>For eg, you come to know this girl and you happen to like her (and you think she may like you that little-little bit).  So you ask her out and you've gone for a few dates, subsequently you pop the question (bf/gf qn) and she turns you down.<br><br>So, where do you go from here if you really like her?  Continue with sincerity hoping to win her heart or do you back off thinking maybe she doesn't like you in that way?<br><br>It's all very suspicious and I agree that it depends on who the girl is lah, but I just want to gather some feedback so I'll know how to go on from there.<br><br>------------------<br>the good life is one inspired by love and guided by knowledge</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is to use your sincerity and continue to date her for a longer period of time...not everyone can accept the idea of accepting a new bf just after a few dates...<br><br>------------------<br>Being broke is a temporary situation.

            <div class='col-md body'>it depends on whether she rejected you, or said she wasn't ready for a relationship just yet. if she rejected you, then it's you... pretty much helpless in such a situation. and it might just get her POed if you keep 'pestering' her after she's rejected you. but if she said she needed more time, then just give her a little space, but continue hoping.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lemme guess, is she the type who is "gian gian ti xian xian" (inwardly interested in you but outwardly playing aloof and hard to get)?<br><br>Shit! I hate it when that happens.<br><br>Seduction is a game to be practiced with skill. Although men and women are very different, but when it comes to seduction they feel the same(Rite girls?): Deep down inside, they often sense when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enoy the feeling of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other party to detour you into a strange land.  Everything in seduction, however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce your intentions or reveal them directly in words. Instead, you must throw the target(the girl you are interested) off the scent. To surrender to your guidance, she must be appropriately confused.<br><br>Here's how. Scramble your signals - appear interested in another girl(the decoy), then hint at being interested in your target, then feign indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite. Imagine this from her perspective: After a few of moves, she would sense that you are playing some sort of a game with her, but the game would prolly delight her. She would not know where you are leading her but so much the better. While your each move will intrigue her, it would keep here wait for the next one - Stir up feelings of jealousy and confusion, for any emotion is better than the boredom of security. Perhaps she would think that you had a ulterior motive; most men do!!! Likelihood is that she would be willing to wait and see, and prolly if she had been made to wait long enough, what you are up to would not have mattered much.<br><br>I guess what happened to you was that you expressed your intentions in a too overt manner. The moment you uttered the fatal word "love", however, all was changed. Your courtship was no longer a game with moves, it was an artless show of passion. Your intention was revealed: YOU are seducing her. This put everything your have done in a new light. All that before had been charming now seemed ugly. A door closed that would never open again.<br><br>Next time, study your target well and use a subtler approach when neccessary.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>chemistry is the catalyst building upon sincerity. without that catalyst, u will have to try harder, but sincerity may pay in the end<br>i kinda agree with ariana, if she rejected straight in your face, chances is that u better don't waste your time. if she say she does not want to go into a relationship yet, u may stillhave a chance (probably another way of rejecting u and not hurt u)</div>
