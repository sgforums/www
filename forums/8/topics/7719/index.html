            <div class='col-md body'>I must be one of the lucky few to have a great attachment then..<br><br>It lasted 6 full months... Can't say that I'm not "abused" by the company, in that they gave me a lot of work to do, but at least they were nice to me. : )<br><br>For the record, I got attached in this company as the webmaster, webdesigner, web programmer and graphics designer all rolled into one... (kinda "abused" eh?)<br><br>I developed and maintained 3 websites for them and had to set up discussion forums, counters, registrations, logins, online database administrations etc... Helluva work to do.<br><br>The nice thing is.. they never rushed me for my work, gave me encouragement, gave me a "pay" rise which I requested, heck, they even offered me the job when I graduate next year.. : )<br><br>Not all attachments are bad... just where you're attached to.. : )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My attachment was with my poly of which i was not paid a single cent for 6 months,you all may wonder why i kena such a suay thing,but i chose this attachment as this attachment project was very interesting as i had to create a 3D model of my then-future poly campus and i was mad about 3D modelling that time,so i was the only one who volunteered for the attachment while my mum screamed her head off when she heard i got an attachment with $0 pay,but i persisted and to date,i find that attachment to be quite fun and nice as i learned a lot and got to do what i enjoyed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)))))))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I give 15 million thumbs down for Attachments.<br><br>Still remember I was in ITE doing my holiday Attachments wif this certain school at Barker Road (It's quite famous actually). I was told beforehand that we all ought to be prepared for menial tasks and NOT complain abt it. I took it in my stride to complete the attachment wif as little possible fuss as possible.<br><br>Can't really imagine what happened during my attachment. The school administrator actually ORDERED me to DO CLEANING JOBS!!! Clean the pantry, cupboards, etc, etc. The only time I remember touching the office machines was when the principal came back from ICT and told me to type out a list of the teacher's tel nos and told me to photostat a few documents, shed a few pieces of paper and fax a document. THAT'S ALL!!!!!<br><br>There's one time, the junior clerk actually wanted to 'Takan' me (imagine being takaned by a female!!) by making me CLEAN THE TOILET!!! Boy was I so damn fustrated... Even the senior clerk pitied me (but didn't lift a finger to help)...<br><br>What's the most 'Jiat Lat' thing was that, the school administrator claimed in my report that I lacked initiative and performed poorly... I was so mad that I seized the opportunity to get back at her when I was told to write MY report! Here's what I wrote:<br><br>"I had a variety of 'interesting' experiences and learned a lot from this attachment... As it enabled me to pick up many new 'skills'" (YES! INCLUDING THE INVERTED COMMAS!!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>My attachment Training Officer didn't get wat I meant and asked me abt it. I juz simply answered: "Oh u mean the 'skills'?? U know... cupboard clearing, trash clearing, sweeping and mopping, etc...."<br><br>They never sent anymore students to that school from wat I heard....</div>
