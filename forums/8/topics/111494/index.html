            <div class='col-md body'>this is some of the weird news i found on the web: =)<br><br>Speed cop pulls twins<br><br>A Canadian policeman had to look twice after booking identical twins for speeding on the same day - in the same car.<br><br>Constable Chris Legere pulled over an 18-year-old woman, from Akwesasne, for driving at 96mph in the morning, reports Canadian Press.<br><br>Hours later, the same car was stopped by Legere for travelling at 92mph in the opposite direction.<br><br>He thought at first he'd caught the same person twice but an identification check showed that it was her twin sister.<br><br>"They don't only share the same birthday but they share the same offences," said Const. Joel Doiron. "They'll be splitting speeding fines, too."<br><br>Robber returns for directions<br><br>An armed robber held up a petrol station in the US and then went back to ask for directions.<br><br>The 22-year-old man, from Vancouver, Washington state, got away with cash after holding up staff at knifepoint.<br><br>The robber took off in a red Honda car and police from four towns gave chase, reports the Kitsap Sun.<br><br>After a 100 mph chase through winding roads, the man lost his pursuers but had no idea where he was.<br><br>He pulled into a petrol station to ask directions to Seattle, unaware it was the same one he'd just robbed.<br><br>Attendants alerted police who caught up with the man and arrested him soon afterwards.<br><br>Baby accused of theft<br><br>A Romanian mayor was shocked when he was asked to investigate a baby accused of theft.<br><br>Mayor Ionel Naftanaila, from Albestii de Muscel, Arges county, received the official request from police.<br><br>It asked him to help with inquiries into theft allegations involving someone born on February 27, 2004.<br><br>The mayor said: "I had a big surprise when I received the piece of paper and at first I didn't know what to believe.<br><br>"It was an official document with everything and by which I was being asked to make a social investigation and help police. It was really funny too."<br><br>Eventually it turned out the police had written the wrong year on the letter and the suspect was born in 1972, not 2004.<br><br>Thieves prefer coffee to cars<br><br>German detectives are hunting thieves who broke into a car showroom and stole only the coffee machine.<br><br>Dozens of brand new Citroen cars were parked in the showroom in Bonn and the keys were on the wall.<br><br>But the thieves ignored all the new motors, and instead unplugged and made off with the coffee machine.<br><br>Bonn police spokesman Robert Scholten said: "The coffee machine was a pretty good one but not worth as much as a new car.<br><br>"Staff only discovered the theft when they went to make a drink in the kitchen and realised the machine was missing."<br><br>The showroom which was owned by the Citroen main dealer in Bonn is on the main street. Police so far have no clues as to the identity of the culprits.<br></div>
