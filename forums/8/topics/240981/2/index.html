I'm all for shaming antisocial people... but if it starts becoming a case of catching otherwise normal people at their worst times just for the sake and sensation on it, that's another story entirely. </div></blockquote>but juz based on STOMP alone, how would u noe whether is dat person committing an anti-social behaviour or juz catching otherwise normal people at their worst time juz for the sake and sensation on it? in my opinion, it is difficult to judge, basically, if i were the editor of STOMP, it would be a terrible task for me, as it would not be possible for me to be at dat situation to judge whether the person has been framed or not.<br><br>proper checks and balance? i really dont noe how. maybe u could list some examples so dat i would have a better idea?</div>
