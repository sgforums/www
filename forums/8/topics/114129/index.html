            <div class='col-md body'>Read on CNA's website that there are some singaporeans out there that are concerned with magazines on our newsstands selling "risque magazines". Here's the website<br><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/128822/1/.html<br><br>Let me just say that the whole idea of magazine classification is downright silly. To classify magazines in their genre so that people have an easier time heading to the sections they want, thats fine. but to classify them based on they're content? thats downright silly...<br><br>I concede that some of the articles in the magazines are not suitable for the younger ones and parents are afraid that they're kids will get the wrong impression about them. I'm not just referring to the sex related ones. Articles in certain men's magazines glorify drinking or violence and other activities that the young and impressionable might get the wrong idea of.<br><br>But you know what's the real problem here? If parents are so afraid they're kids are gonna get the wrong idea, then sit down, be open with your kid and tell them what's actually going on.<br><br>Thats the whole point of me posting this, coming out of the dark after almost a year of silence.<br><br>Its absolutely nonsense that parents leave such things up to legislation. Why can't our singaporean parents teach their kids. I'm sure it doesn't take much time and provides an excellent opportunity to bond with their children. (and im only referring to those who shy away from they're responsibility to educate their kids about violence, sex and other adult stuff)<br><br>Some of you are definitely going to say "hey! even if the parents want to educate and the kid is only 7 and won't understand then how?"<br><br>Tell me that a kid at the age of 7 understands the implications of a bikini clad woman clutching a bottle of beer and i'll concede my argument. Obviously the more curious ones (those that are at the age of puberty) will be the ones who want to seek and understand such material. So if thats the case, then shouldn it be the time for parents to have "the Talk"???<br><br></div>

You are talking about a small percentage of singaporeans that have the luxury of maids. Let me address that point first,<br><br>If parents are overworked to the point that they neglect their family responsibilities, wrong impressions of sex, violence or alcohol BY "risque" magazines would be the least of that family's concern. If parents can even allow themselves to neglect their duties, I wholeheartedly condemn these parents. They're children do not deserve to grow up in a world where they have such irresponsible parents. This will definitely hit the heart of any parent who is reading this but if YOU are neglecting your duties as a parent, you better go home today and do something about it.<br><br></div>
