Two sore eyes actually.<br><br>It was my first time with sore eyes.<br><br>But I was not the only one with sore eyes in my company. There were almost 20 over friends who were down with sore eyes.<br><br>Our CSM ordered a standby and checked our eyes. I failed. Haha. I was one of them.<br><br>We didn't managed to get ATTEND C from the MO. Our CSM refused to let us off.<br><br>He was afraid that we would spread to the members of the public. Anyway, I know that's not the truth, for he let us booked out on Saturday.<br><br>It was a terrible week. I had eyes that were watering and could hardly open.<br><br>And guess what.<br><br>We were quarantined and separated from the rest of the company. We considered ourselves lucky, at least we are still in our own company with our friends. We could always talk when we are bored.<br><br>There were some that had to sleep over at the medical centre.<br><br>Our food was packed by our healthy friends as we were not allowed to go to the cook house. We had a toilet specially for ourselves too.<br><br>I was quite glad the quarantine worked. After the quarantine, there wasn't any new cases of infection.<br><br>I was able to book out on Saturday.<br><br>But I was down with sore eyes again the coming Monday. I guessed I wasn't vigilant enough with my health. But the second attack was a short one, I recovered quickly.<br><br>For people who are like me, I think they would appreciate the fact that the government is doing something they had to do.<br><br>There's a difference this time though, sore eyes don't kill.</span></div>
