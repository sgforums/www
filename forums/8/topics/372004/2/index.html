              <p>Hey  Ah Chia, unlike you I do not have the guts to directly critisise my government. i can't quite afford to get into any real trouble. Neither do I believe the powerful government would be daunted by any means. Quite frankly I just enjoy bringing out the ugliness of my home. Shame is a powerful tool. Maybe not. In my home, money redeems. </p>
              <p>I can work out the money part to get on ok in life. It's just the primary needs of life beyond reach that's frustrating. I've long given up hope in having a family. I find my sexual need satisfied by the abundance of unhappily married women in Singapore.</p>
              <p>My primary needs? A women that puts her family before herself. A child that carries my genetic signature and lesser assholes I have to bump into everyday. Those women do not exsist in this era. It's still not to late for me to plan to have a child but to risk my child of being a walking organ? Maybe not. I have no million dollar asset left behind to make sure he doesn't have to struggle like shit to have a decent lifestyle. Assholes? It's almost routine to have to deal with them everyday. Most of the time it's on the road and it's not a plesant topic to talk about.</p>

              <p>Do consider reassigning the topic of thread back to political views where it originally was. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Maybe you should follow a certain PAP MP's advice, throw your parents in Johor or Batam. Ooops.....I mean relocate your parents to Johor or Batam, then you can rent out the storeroom for extra cash. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think your storeroom can sqeeze at least 3-4 PRCs or Bangla in there. Serious!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>That advise came shortly after local hospital expanded it's business into Johor. Actually why not? Get rid of the useless old folks while paying the hospice whom operations belong in Singapore. Money comes back.</p>
              <p>Now my next issue is my sister is not giving birth. I need to appraoch Mr Tang again to see if his got relative to replace the tenancy. Otherwise  there would be no future for my home.</p>
              <p>I sell him the idea that my house got my dad to take out the trash. If they should fall ill my brother has got another kidney left whom he can have for half the price since he bought the first half. And I make my brother serve "family service"and activate him twice every year to perform guard duty so my home is a safe place. I still think my dad should stay here. Wait till he's 65 and down with dementia, I then relocate him there where he won't pose inconvenience to me.</p>
              <p>Quite frankly I'm starting to lose humour in this thread. It is disturbing that it is a fact SGP ppl are turning in their parents to elderly homes. It seems like the ideal lifestyle here in SG is to exclude their parents. Again it's an unplesant discussion. Lets stick to my beloved country and my home.</p>

              <p>When are you renting out your hall for gambling sessions? You see, your brother's already security, your sister can always serve tea and your father can throw away their rubbish and clean up the mess. You can love your home even more.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Quite frankly some of you know exactly how I feel. I have enough money to live. I don't have enough to have a share of Siingapore. I certainly don't have enough to date most Singapore girls. I have the same car in malaysia. Its cost me 10 times more for the car here. I pay less than $300rm every year for both tax and insurance and Malaysia roads are better suited for my driving needs.</p>
              <p>People can say what they want about Malaysia but from the border, instantly  I feel Malaysians have better respect for people. It's my own countrymen that keep trying to screw me. Of course Johor is the rougher side of Malaysia. When I get to KL. People are friendly, so are the girls! I enjoy making friends with them. In fact the best girls I've dated are from Malaysia and one from Fiji during my school days. I see a price tag on every Sg girl I date. So naturally I treat them like expensive whores. If I spend excessively and project that I'm "confid$nt"  I still get to screw them. But it's such a bad deal. As bad as driving the same car here for 10 X more the cost. Seriously I can make do with all the flaws in Malaysia if you actually read about my primary needs in my last couple of posts.</p>
              <p>But you know it's not easy to leave your country. rebuild business contacts or work contacts. My first option is to try to increase my income here and be unhappy for a while more. I will have to make my move eventually. I SHALL NOT WORK TO 65!!!!</p>
              <p>I spend my growing best years in military camp. I spent my living best years digging money with no quality life. It's just my fucking luck to be born humble here. I am not going to spend my final years here. And I know MY COUNTRY DOESN"T WELCOME ME HERE IN MY FINAL YEARS. </p>
