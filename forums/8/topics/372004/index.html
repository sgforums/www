              <p>Singapore is my home. I always picture my home having 10 rooms. I'll rent all of them out to people from all over the world. My brother can sleep in a corner on a mattress coz he dun contribute much. If he's able to find a blanket I think the corridor suits him better.</p>
              <p>My sister uses one room and she pays rental all the time. i love her to the bone because she never have problem finding any work. I let my dad sleep in the storeroom. But I tell him he have to ungrade his skills and knowledge and be useful and learn how to take the trash out everyday until he's 65. I'll make further plans if he actually lives till 65.</p>
              <p>I love the rest of my 9 tenants too except for a Malaysian IT lecturer who is also late to pay his rent. I impose on him a "administrative charge" for inconvenience caused to me so we are fine. I treat all these people like my family and love them to the bone. Yes I even love my brother too but I do hope he sleep in the corridor as soon as posible and I still love him.</p>
              <p>I love Singapore like I love my home!</p>

              <p>Hi "theme and guess". I guess I am the unhappy faggot you are talking about. You're telling people to ignore. Why don't you preach what you practice and don't freaking reply to my thread. This is a forum for god's sake.</p>
              <p>I am not as sick of Singapore as I am sick of people like you! By all means start a thread all you want rave about how you love your country. I'm not gonna call you a faggot. Picking fights in the cyber world is so uncalled for.</p>
              <p>I was born in songapore. I serve 2.5 years of my time in national service being paid $300/mth and am still serving indefinately. Something not even a Blangladeshi labourer would be willing to do! I think I am entitled to my opinion.</p>
              <p>I personally find humor in my topic. If the moderators find my topic inappropriate just delete my thread and send me a warning! On what grounds you come in and call me a faggot?  And do me a favour, don't pick fights with me on the road, don't pick fight's with me while I'm walking past you while you are queuing up for Hello Kitty.</p>

              <p>Well my apologies then. I just find life messed up. here. I have a decent job and enough money. Maybe not enough to start a new family or see me through major illness. It's just life's crazy here.  Yup my relationships failed over and over because I can't agree with the pro-women ways of Singapore. And I'm not getting anywhere screwing other people's unhappy wives.</p>
              <p>2 national rally ago pmlee claim the men here expect too much of a women and should lower our expectation. This nd rally mmlee admit to the current problem and his solution, to import new citizens. It is really hard to even think of Singapore as my home. My noisy neighbours from China studying in Singapore are driving me nuts. Their way of speech seems to be shouting.</p>
              <p>I too want a family. Someone beside me in my deathbed and send me off in a peaceful journey. I somehow think it's beyond reach. I am not sure if I can afford my child's education and expenses for the nxt 22 years. The bitches I date all make a lot of money but they spend all on themselves, so financial planning excludes them. I dated foreign women before but they soon become very Singaporean like the moment jobs and money gets thrown at them freely.</p>
              <p>Food (women  spends most, eat least) Fashion (one bra cost as much as my 5 year underwear supply) and Tourism industry is where women greatly have an impact on the GDP. Today's outcome was preplanned and objectives were met, purely on dollars and cents for Singapore.  Leading a series of social issues. "The Singaporeans refuse to breed"?!?!?!. I got a feeling this Nday Rally speech will be the biggest crap in history.  </p>

              <p><strong>When an Elite Degenerates into a Clique...</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Every society has to delegate to its
              elite such responsibilities as governance, the mobilization of the
              population for developmental projects, and the orchestration of
              diverging interests of individuals and various social groups in the
              name of progress. Such are the fundamental functions of elites
              throughout various epochs. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Generally, an elite is a
              relatively small privileged group within a society, and the privileges
              are sustained by the work of the commonality. </strong></span>As a price, the society
              expects the elite to competently realize its specific functions.
              Quality of public service in return for privileges is the underlying
              concept of the treaties between societies and their elites. More often
              than not, such treaties are informal rather than written, but their
              contours can be discerned practically in all societies. <strong>The
              provision of services by the elite at the level adequate to the
              society's needs is a prerequisite for stability and public accord,
              while the extent of the elite's privileges should not overgrow the
              confines prescribed by the cultural norms shared by the majority of the
              population. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Inevitably, an elite exists
              as a particular social stratum, but the particularity is never absolute
              and there always have to be channels of communication and interchange
              between the elite and the rest of the population. To maintain public
              accord, the intensity of the two-way traffic must be sufficient to keep
              the elite aware of the society's needs and to ensure that the elite's
              decision-making takes them into account. Furthermore, the society
              should preserve the potential for control over its elite, and the
              informal treaty between them must include mechanisms of elite rotation
              which becomes necessary whenever the elite neglects its obligations,
              unduly uses its status to exploit the society, or puts the society's
              existence in jeopardy by absorbing too great a share of its gross
              product. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Importantly, elites tend to
              be inhomogeneous. From the functional standpoint, they can be
              subdivided into political, business, intellectual, and other types,
              while in terms of the place they occupy in political systems of
              societies elites are either ruling or oppositional. Both the ruling and
              the oppositional elites are in many cases fluid coalitions of various
              elite groups. Naturally, the key roles are played by the ruling elites
              as they exert the greatest influence over various aspects of lives of
              their societies. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">If the population is
              discontent with the character of governance – that is, discontent with
              the way the elite is rendering its services – this does not necessarily
              mean that a revolution is the only solution on the horizon. Revolutions
              typically come with tremendous costs such as outbreaks of violence,
              economic disrepair, and plummeting living standards. After the change
              of the regime, it is natural to expect that upon strengthening its
              positions and gaining confidence in the future the new authority will
              make efforts aimed at reverting the life in the country to normality,
              but the risk persists that a new elite might be guided by evil
              intentions or lack competence. Therefore, whenever the society is
              dissatisfied with its rulers, it should – at least due to the sense of
              self-preservation – attempt to redirect the ruling elite by signaling
              its discontent and sending messages about the unacceptability of the
              current situation and the need to change course. Adequate authority
              must take such signals and messages seriously and – also in part for
              the sake of self-preservation – take measures to address the problems
              over which the society is concerned. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">If for any reason the
              signals fail to reach the elite or it chooses to ignore them, the
              society's natural next step is to turn to the oppositional elites and
              to seek regime change. Such dynamics, of course, also carries certain
              risks – for example, there is a chance that the new leadership will
              lack governance experience and make mistakes in the process of gaining
              it. Therefore, the society should opt for taking such risks only in
              case the problems generated by its current elite outweigh the potential
              costs related to the regime change and attempts to influence the rulers
              are unsuccessful. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">In some cases, however, the
              society's counter-elites are only nominally oppositional, make no real
              efforts to seize power, and readily embrace background roles, perhaps
              extracting material benefits from them while avoiding serious
              responsibility. Besides, sometimes the opposition is no more competent
              and no less selfish than the ruling elite, and, for example, replacing
              a president produces no satisfactory result. In other words, <strong>under
              certain circumstances the competition of elites does not translate into
              a mechanism of promoting public interest. Such are the cases when the
              elite irreversibly degenerates into a ruling clique simply trying to
              get an ever greater share of the pie without serving the people in any
              way. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Under such circumstances,
              what the society needs is to totally dislodge its elites, both ruling
              and oppositional, and to relaunch the elite-forming process. This is
              the type of situation known as revolutionary: the old elite is purged
              and the revolution propels a new one to power. The new elite does not
              crystallize literally out of nothing – by the time a revolutionary
              situation emerges the society always has groups and leaders
              representing the public demand for elite change and the requirements
              the new elite must satisfy. Such groups can be regarded as proto-elites
              as they do not have the elite status prior to the revolution but are
              the forerunners in the race over it after the regime change. Therefore,
              <strong>the replacement of elites is a fundamental phenomenon which encompasses much more than just regime change.</strong> And, of course, there is always a possibility that the new
              post-revolution elite would eventually evolve to the condition of its
              predecessors and that the development would thus breed a new
              pre-revolutionary situation. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">No elite would openly deny
              that its existence is legitimized by the interests of the “public
              service” in the interests of the society and the country, but,
              regardless of ideology and economic system, every society is confronted
              by the threat of a mutation of its elite. The elite's interest to
              maintain its status and all the accompanying perks always leads it into
              temptation to evade public control and to internalize the elite-forming
              process. <strong>The society that has lost its grip on the elite and the elite-forming process has no defense against the elite's arbitrariness</strong>,
              as the unchecked appetites of the elite would be satisfied at the
              expense of public interests while the society's legitimate interests
              will be neglected. In every sense, a high price has to be paid for
              retrieving control over the elite. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>Corrupting the elites of
              geopolitical opponents is an instrument routinely used in international
              politics. The US and the cosmopolitan forces currently taking over its
              global hegemony – the cast of informational and financial tycoons not
              rooted in any of the world's countries - are true masters of the craft.
              Corrupting and mind-controlling the Soviet elite contributed more than
              anything else to the triumph of the West over the USSR in the Cold War. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The Soviet elite was formed
              in the tense atmosphere of the epoch marked with ferocious class
              struggle, the demise of the Russian Empire, the intervention launched
              by 14 countries, the post-civil war economic recovery, the
              industrialization, World War II, and the reconstruction of the
              country's economy in its aftermath. External threats always – perhaps
              somewhat less after World War II - factored into the situations the
              Soviet elites had to deal with. The epic proportions of the
              civilizational transformation Russia endured in the XX century and the
              breakneck pace of the transitions created severe conditions for the
              elite-forming process in the country. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Every member of the elite
              under Stalin could easily end up paying with his life for failing to
              perform in the sphere he was in charge of. The rules of the epoch left
              no chance that irresponsibility would remain unpunished. <strong>At the
              same time, the process of picking for their competence and admitting
              them to the elite was organized on a broad scale in the USSR</strong>, and the social lift functioned throughout the Soviet era, though obviously with decreasing success after Stalin's death. <strong>Repressions
              were in fact the downside of the situation – they were justified as the
              instrument used to suppress the tendencies in the ranks of the elite
              that might lead to its defying the society's oversight</strong>. As noted
              above, such tendencies are inherent, and, condemning the repressions
              under Stalin one should keep in mind that quite possibly from the
              society's standpoint <strong>the harsh approach to eradicating the degradation of the elite is better than the gentle one. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Stalin is often praised for
              actively co-opting into the elite individuals from the commonality, but
              it should be realized that the inflow of new members to the elite has
              to be offset by the expulsion of others, as otherwise, in accord with
              the projections of structural demography, it can swell to socially
              unaffordable proportions. The expulsion from the elite awaited those
              whose individual or professional traits proved inadequate to the tasks
              it was intended to handle. In the context, the state had to decide what
              to do about those stripped of the elite status. Clearly, in most cases
              those were ambitious and well-connected people with strong awareness of
              belonging to a special group. Upset about the loss of their social
              status, they could hardly be expected to quietly integrate into the
              bulk of the society. Rather, they posed a potential threat with their
              presumed comeback plans. Sooner or later the regeneration of the
              country's elite was going to create a critical mass of former elite
              members which – especially under the circumstances of external
              intervention – could destabilize the USSR. Stalin's building a system
              of eliminating former members of the elite was a natural reaction to
              the threat. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Due to both the populist
              character of the Soviet regime and the Soviet Union's limited resources
              the material benefits available to the elite under Stalin used to be
              quite modest compared to what was within reach for elites in most other
              countries. Naturally, as anywhere else in the world, the living
              standards of the Soviet elite were superior to those of the rest of the
              population, but the gap did not leave a shocking impression. The
              standard set of a Soviet bureaucrat's privileges comprised a private
              apartment, a car, and a country house, plus access to better stores,
              medical care, etc, but this was nothing compared to what US or British
              officials – not to mention bankers or industrialists – had at their
              disposal. Stalin personally set the example of moderation in
              consumption, and, given that, a flashy lifestyle would have been
              inappropriate and even risky. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The US global project
              requires the formation of a global elite with members responsible not
              to their nations but exclusively to their club. <strong>The key objectives
              of the elite are the redistribution of the planet's resources in its
              own interests, the maximization of its own revenues, and the
              perpetuation of its own existence. In the framework of this model, the
              nations of the world are regarded as nothing more than a workforce
              which, on top of that, is available in clearly excessive and subject to
              future reduction numbers. </strong> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The integration of the
              immense and resource-rich territories of the former Soviet Union into
              the above project topped the West's list of priorities since the end of
              World War II. The key element of the plan was to induce a mutation of
              the Soviet elite, which was offered what any elite secretly dreams of
              and from what it was barred solely by the society's control. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">First of all, it was offered the right to <strong>irresponsibility</strong>.
              As mentioned above, any administrator under Stalin was strictly
              accountable for his work, and failure to perform could be punished
              ruthlessly. The arrangement required the elite's total commitment to
              work and made the elite status only marginally enjoyable.
              Psychologically the Soviet elite conditioned by this experience was
              prepared to embrace the scheme that would guarantee it immunity from
              public control and absolve it from responsibility for the results of
              its work. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Secondly, the elite was offered <strong>a much greater share of the gross domestic product</strong> than ever before. Tired of the Stalin-era asceticism, the elite craved
              much greater material additions to its status. These days they are no
              longer limited to apartments and country houses – Russia's elite owns
              villas and palaces both in the country and abroad, private planes and
              yachts, as well as other assets and status symbols formerly available
              only to the elites in the world's wealthiest countries. There was a
              time in Russia when the Soviet regime drew heavy criticism for
              maintaining better stores and service networks for its bureaucrats, but
              now literally everything among the possessions of the post-Soviet elite
              including food, clothes, and accessories stresses its upscale status. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">Thirdly, nowadays<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> the elite status can be inherited. </strong>I</span>n the USSR, the elite faced serious limitations in passing the status
              from parents to children. No doubt, children from elite families were
              guaranteed education geared to produce leaders and entry to the avenue
              to political power. Nevertheless, after the initial stage their careers
              used to be wholly performance-driven, and they were not insulated from
              the hardships the rest of the society had to endure. Even Stalin's son
              Yakov Dzugashvili fought as an officer in World War II and became a
              POW. Stalin turned down the offer to exchange him for German Field
              Marshal Friedrich Paulus who was captured by the Red Army. Moreover,
              Yakov's family lost the benefits the families of Red Army soldiers and
              officers were entitled to unless they were taken captive (the benefits
              were reinstated later when it was proved that he acted properly and
              died with dignity as the POW). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;">The solution of the inheritance problem offered to the elite in Russia was to give it <strong>a
              leading role in the privatization of formerly state property, thus
              giving its members a material base for the economic dominance in the
              society</strong>. Now a bureaucrat's discharge from the official post which
              entails the loss of rights to a state-owned country house, etc. does
              not ruin the individual's elite status as the posh lifestyle of the
              individual and his or her children can be sustained by privately owned
              assets. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><strong>As a result of the deal
              with the geopolitical opponents of the USSR, the post-Soviet elite
              exchanged Russia's geopolitics for the preservation and broadening of
              its own status. </strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A society unable to control its elites is doomed to decline.</strong></span> Nothing can be more disgusting than overfed complacency. At present
              Russia must face the truth that the entire range of peaceful means of
              influencing its elite in order to change its conduct has been used, but
              failed to deliver any improvements, and that the country is steadily
              drifting towards a revolutionary situation. The political force that
              will drive the revolution has not taken shape yet, and there is still
              time for peaceful change. But the time is running out. </span></p>

              <p>Local media is stupid becuase it has been stifled by PAP regime. This is a criticism of PAP regime.</p>

              <p>That is due to PAP regime's tactic of using dramas etc to sell and push their policies and agendas. This is a criticism of PAP regime.</p>

              <p>I learn from my nation what constitutes a home is rental and not blood. Whoever that pays rent IS family. Ya my dad complains about me making him sleep in the storeroom but I tell him. If I don't run the home this way your grandchildren are going to be maids in other people's home. No rent no home so count yourself blessed to have a storeroom to begin with. A home does NOT comprise of family!</p>
              <p>If my dad refuse to take the trash out I will not hesitate to replace him with my tenant's father because he is waiting to come to singapore and has rent to pay.</p>

              <p>Latest update. One of my tenant, the Malaysian lecturer Mr Tang is critically ill and needs a kidney. I ask him to leave but he says he's got a lot of money to pay!</p>
              <p>I now offered my brother a room to stay. I shall have his kidneys legally removed and all fees paid by Mr Tang shall be put in a trust for deductions in rentals.</p>
              <p>I tell my brother, "look. We cannot deny there are rich foreigners out there whom need organs. It's either you sell him yours or he'll buy some elsewhere. He'll leave and I get no rental from you nor him. Sell him yours and it's a win,win,win situation. You are my brother and I love you to the bone."</p>
