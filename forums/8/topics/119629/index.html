            <div class='col-md body'>i think its because many s'poreans do not posess the skills to do high level management (we're trained from young to listen without question, not think and make our own decisions), also, local varsities do not have the expertise to train locals to handle such tasks( NUS,NTU may be quite good at medicine and law but when it comes to business and corporate stuff, honestly, they suck). thats why most high level management staff are either foreigners or locals who have been trained abroad( even our gov does that, gov sends scholars to the US and UK rather than to our local universities).</div>
