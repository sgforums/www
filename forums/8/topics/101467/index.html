            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, some of them can be really persistent. sometimes, over persistent.<br><br>Maybe they're too engrossed and over dedicated in getting donations from the public that they sort of not notice how aggressive they have been? Thats a maybe only though.<br><br>Well, at the end of the day, it boils down to how you manage such situations. For me,  I will never be too bothered by such people. They may be persistent but I'll just walk away. Soon enough, they'll give up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
