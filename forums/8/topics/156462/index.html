And $70 fine for the researcher who miss-parked his car. Our judges and the legislators are amazing! They know well in advance that the researchers will be able to feed himself and thus only provide the law such that it impose a fine of only $70 on people driving Merz.</div>

It is based on important principle enshrined in our pledge that all judgements are based on "JUSTICE and EQUALITY". Indeed, we can see the success of the system in the low crime rates. Singaporeans are so lucky to have such a fine legal system. Under Yong Pung How, the legal system is even better now than ever!<br><br>Take the case of 53 yr old Mdm Yong who was given a jail sentence of 11 years for shoplifting, it goes to show how much advancement our judicial system has made since the 1990s. In the 1990s, a crook by the name of Nick Leeson, stole $1.3 billion and was only given 6.5 years jail term by our legal system. See how much we have advanced...<br><br>Now we are able to jail Singaporeans for shoplifting wallets and bangles for 11 years. The shoplifters makes a mockery of other Singaporean's favorite pasttime of shopping by taking and not paying... this is heinous indeed, it is such an evil crime and our enlightened courts knows it.<br><br>As for Nick Leeson, he was released after less than 5 years.
