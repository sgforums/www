            <div class='col-md body'>hi Beep,<br><br>if you are driving, coming in from loyang towards hendon rd..<br><br>turn left into hendon rd.  Then on your left is a slope downwards to hendon camp and on your right, there is a colonial building (currently restricted). Few metres down hendon rd, keep ya eyes on this building (and on the road too!), you will see a narrow road heading up slope.<br>GO up this road and go ALL THE WAY UP to the end, where you should see some huge cube-blouders blocking the road.<br><br>Voila! Welcome to OCH!<br><br>However, if possible, dim ya lights to avoid unnecessary attention. If I am not wrong, guards from nearby military facility (shall not name) patrol there too, to chase pple away.<br><br>Once there, you should be facing a single block. Entrance to this 'maze' can be from the left or right. On the right, there is a spiral staircase, where on the left, there is an entrance to along a long corridor. Some where in the building, you can also see a lift that has broken down, but with doors open. I wouldn't advice you to step inside tho..<br><br>If you are heading downstairs, be warned that the infamous old man is at the very bottom level, and armed with some ferocious dogs (and they mean business with their barking). If i remember correctly, some of the staircase are sealed with tapes. Personally ventured beyond, nothing much to speak of except some adranaline rush.<br><br>If you are heading upstairs, do go right up to the roof. A good night view of Old Changi and the hospita landscape awaits. But before you climb the narrow ladder up the roof, take a good look at around and you can find some old glass medicine bottles and remember to take a good deep breathe. That is the smell of OCH.<br><br>There are many wards along the corridor (pretty much same as today's hospitals), however there're some rooms that are pretty big and I suspect them to be the operating rooms.<br><br>It is a pity I couldn't locate the morturary myself. Rumour has it that it is closed or as mentioned, made to look just like any other rooms. But my tip-off was that it is where the old man guards. .. (sound like some games yah?)<br><br>have fun!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>but please, dun bring back any thing more than pics..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
