But the situation has worsened since last week.<br><br>"The worst part would be when they saw my car and dashed forward, taking photographs and asking for interviews. It scares me and I can't tell if there are cars behind or in front of me. So I will stop. I believe this is very dangerous," said Fann. - CNA/yy </blockquote>condominium....?
