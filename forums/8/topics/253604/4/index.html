Goes to show that juz becoz the Coy nurture them into wat they are today, they think it gives them the rite to be prima donnas and do wat they want so long as they're not caught in the act...sigh..., well wat goes ard comes ard.<br><br></div>

U mean to say marriage so soild becoz of the present case have to be delayed??<br><br>And his fellow colleagues and Coy said he did a lot of charity thru the years???? u mean he went to many organisations to do charity on his own accord own and not on Coy Orders?? We'd be interested in knowing which welfare organisation  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> we support ppl who have a heart of gold, but does knocking someone down, stopping meters away and speeding off count??<br><br>alas i forgot the papers are an extended arm of mediacorp....., juz wondering if they're hyping it all up to drum support for the dumb-as* who hit and run. I think they would have better luck running a spread in the Stratis Times and poll the common people in the streets and not those linked to the one involved. As we have learnt thru life experiences, sometimes there are no ifs and buts but u juz gotta take the bullet in the head and face the consequences for such a cowardly act.<br><br>And the worst part is to appeal for something u did so wrong rite from the start as the trial judge had said running away was a Choice he took thinking to shun his responsibilites for such a lowly act. Anyway the appeal i feel would be a test of our justice system as if it were to be under the hammer of our last CJ,  CJ Yong P H , u can expect no less than an increase in the jail sentence if u were found wanting for the offence and he's proven that he can extend a sentence if the case warrants it,  his track record of appeal hearings speaks for itself but for the present the outcome is still an unknown factor......, would justice prevail or otherwise we await with battered breath....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Celebrity or not, he should face the consequences.<br><br>We should not applaud him for being brave enough to go into jail. That's what all of us SHOULD do and people like Paris Hilton, who actually start a petition hoping that all her fans would help her so that they can convince Arnold to not let her go to the jail is just....disgusting, the behavior is disgusting...</div>
