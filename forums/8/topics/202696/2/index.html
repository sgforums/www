            <div class='col-md body'>It is hard to say whose land it is. In the distant past it may very well belong to midianites etc and jews take it down with force and killed all of them. Then it changes hand to christian and their crusades before the muslims and ottoman empire conquer it. After ww1 ottoman lost and ottoman empire was divided leaving Israel being controlled by british. Then most of the population is muslim. Then during british time, jews emigrate by the thousands back into israel and they buy a lot of land. arab expressed dissatisfaction but sadly nothing is done. So arab and jew start fighting. Then one fine day british decide to leave the mess giving a large part of land to jews. Muslims r not happy with the arranegment and expressed their dissatifaction but nothing is changed. So arabs invade Israel when the british left, only to be defeated by Israel. After tat Israel take over nearly all the land.<br><br>So to who does the land belong ? It is very difficult to say  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> All of them have a reason to say it is their land.

By making a firm stance, they open themselves up to scrutiny and question. So the best way to avoid all ugliness is to remain detached. Now that is a good tactics which sadly certain faiths have not fathomed it throughout centuries and they keep asking why are they being targeted and not others?

            <div class='col-md body'>jews and muslims have lived in peace in the middle east for centuries, actually jews enjoyed better treatment from their muslim overlords when the ottomans conquered most of the land in the med than what how they were treated under their supposed christian rulers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

He did not name Jerusalem. It was during the years when Hadith was codified when Baitul Mukadis was inferred as Jerusalem. For all we know, Mohamed's wisdom could have meant Baitul Mukadis as Constantinople which muslims had to conquer. Which they did.<br><br>Worthy of note also, Mohamed also prevented the Hadith (oral tradition) from being written down. But a couple of hundred of years later, the Caliphs and leaders (out of political expediency) leading to the current catastrophic split between shiites and sunnis mandated what Mohamed prohibited in his life time. Today, much of Islamic terrorism base their motivation from the Hadith. Worthy of note, there is not a single unified version of the Hadith. To qualify that the Islam is more violent than Christianity and Judaism would be like ignoring the violence in the books of Genesis, Exodus and Kings.<br><br>Therefore, world peace lie in<br>~ proving/persuading that Baitul Mukadis is Constantinople<br>~ respecting Jews that Jesus is not, have never been and never will be king of Jews.<br>~ Jews or anyone else need not be converted to another religion for universal salvation to occur.<br>~ Ethanol should replace petroleum as the fuel of choice.<br>~ George Bush should divert all resources in Iraq toward funding converting all car manufacturers facility to make hybrid/E85 cars.<br>~ democracy should be accepted in their various dialects not just the 'western' dialect. Blair's comments about superiority of 'western' values is foolish :http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/01/mideast.blair/index.html.<br>~ admitting that communism is just another form of capitalism (capitalism of power).<br><br></div>
