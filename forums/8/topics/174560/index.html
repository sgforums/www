Pre - martial sex refers to sexual activities before marriage and it does includes anal and oral sex, both which do not result in pregnancy but carries the risk of STDs.<br><br>2. As I said before pre - martial sex refers to sexual activities before marriage and teenage sex refers to sexual activities btw two teenagers or more. If the teenagers are married and they start hafin sexual relations. It cant be considered pre - martial sex since they r married but it can still be called teenage sex. The misconception of using this phase lies with most teenagers aren't married thus, sexual activities by them are also called pre - martial sex.<br><br>3. Assuming that U r sure that U haf sex with only one partner and U caught an STD, which means Ur partner spreads the disease to U. And btw since the word 'husband' is used, sexual activities cannt be referred to as pre - martial sex.<br><br>4. Abortion refers to the termination of the pregnancy. Under normal situations, if the couple does use contraceptives, the chances of getting pregnant is lowered. However, U can't dispute the fact that all contraceptive methods are not 100% fool proof. If the contraceptive worked, the pregnancy will not occur.<br>Sex is a general term used to classify the genders. It can also refer to sexual intercourse. The words used in front of the word sex refers to the area in which the couple used for their sexual activities.<br><br>P.S: Dude, next time please phase Ur qns properly coz its abit strange...<br><br>Cheers...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>1. lots of people have responded to this so i'm saving my typing space<br><br>2. So what if the people doing pre-marital sex are not teenagers? Age is not the most dependable standards to measure maturity. I've heard of engaged people getting married in a few months time having to go for adoption for they are not ready for kids.<br><br>3. STDs - The difference with couples that choose to get married is that by and large MOST attempt to be faithful (though not all succeed). Whereas, pre-marital sex means you can be having sex with someone who may want to have sex with you, but is not looking at a long term, committed relationship.<br><br>4. Abortion - if you look at many surveys, you will realise that many Singaporeans, especially young teenagers do not use protection when it comes to sex.<br><br>But most of all, I wonder what is the point of you pointing out all these "misconceptions"? What exactly is the point you are trying to make? To say that pre-marital sex is okay or what??<br><br>Thing is.. no one is assuming that pre-marital sex is wrong between<br>1.mature,<br>2. consenting<br>3. adults who are<br>4. committed to each other only and<br>5. using protection<br>6.if they do not wish to get pregnant.<br><br>It just becomes a problem if any of the above is not fulfilled.</div>
