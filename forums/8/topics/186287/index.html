The one that is pre-installed in a computer is lisensed to the manufacturer by Microsoft, thus, it is much cheaper than the retail version. While a retail version can be installed on many different computers (only 1 at a time), the Windows that come with your Compaq can only be install on that computer, thus it is cheaper.<br><br>Most brands of computers do this now, however, by paying around S$100 more, you can request Compaq to install a retail version instead of the lisensed version. This can only be done at the time of purchase. Only by doing this, will you get a complete Windows Xp disc, together with the box and etc...</div>
