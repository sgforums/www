So don't consume Sugar free product esp. 'fisherman sweet' ASPARTAME - THE SILENT KILLER (by Ron Harder)<br><br>To those who prefer to consume artificial flavouring........<br>There is an epidemic across North America today of Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus.<br>Most people do not understand why this epidemic is happening, and they do not know why these diseases are so rampant. I would like to share with you the main reason we are having this very serious problem.<br><br>Many people today use artificial sweeteners in their tea or coffee.   They do this because the ads they see on TV tell them that sugar is bad for their health. This is absolutely true. Sugar is toxic to us, but what most people use as a replacement for sugar is much more deadly.<br><br>I am talking about ASPARTAME. It is the cause of the epidemic that was mentioned above. ASPARTAME is an extremely toxic chemical that is produced by a chemical company called Monsanto. ASPARTAME<br>is being marketed around the world as a sugar substitute and is found in all diet soft drinks, such as Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi. It is also found in artificial sweeteners such as NutraSweet, Equal, and Spoonful; and it is used in many other products as a sugar replacement. ASPARTAME is marketed as a diet product, but it is not a diet product at all.<br>In fact, it will cause you to GAIN weight because it makes you crave carbohydrates. Causing you to gain weight is only a very small part of what ASPARTAME does. It is a toxic chemical that changes the brain's chemistry. It can and does cause severe seizures. This chemical changes the dopamine level in the brain, and it is particularly deadly for anyone suffering from Parkinson's disease.<br><br>ASPARTAME is extremely poisonous, and here is why one of the toxic ingredients of it is wood alcohol. When the temperature of ASPARTAME exceeds 86 degrees F, the wood alcohol in it is converted to Formaldehyde, and then to formic acid, which in turn causes folic acidosis. FORMALDEHYDE is grouped in the same class of poisons as Cyanide and Arsenic which are very deadly toxins.<br><br>The only difference is, Formaldehyde kills quietly, and it takes a little longer. And, in the process of killing people, it causes all kinds of neurological problems. There are 92 documented symptoms of Aspartame Poisoning leading to coma and death. The majority of these symptoms are neurological, because the ASPARTAME attacks and destroys the nervous system. One of these symptoms is Lupus, which has become almost as rampant as Multiple Sclerosis, especially with Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi drinkers.</div>
