            <div class='col-md body'>who really knows kiddo, and whaddaya mean for real? Love at first sight, is, as its stated, love at first SIGHT. its physical attraction, which may or may not lead to something further. don't know if reality has a hand in any of this. it all seems soo nebulous to me, and frankly, i think its crap. but then again that's just me, and as EcK will tell you i'm a cynic...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>of course love at first sight is real! you met a perfect stranger, someone you've never spoken to in your entire life, someone who could be an axe-murder, pimp, or all round arsehole, and fall profoundly in love with after about 1.5 seconds. of course its real! in just that instant, upon seeing his/her face for the first time you know you will have common interest, compatible personalities, a meeting of the minds and commitment from each other. then being in love, you marry, buy a house with a white picket fence, have 2.5 kids and live happily ever after. sure, it happens everyday!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Samantha...I am writing this because i have been through that.  Although I would like to say that it doens't happen or exist, I would liek to let you know what happeend to me and maybe you can have a better understanding of what love at first sight means...<br><br>I am not an extroverted romantic(which means I am but will deny it and will try not to dio anything associated with it, but I believe in romance)...I am the type of guy who'se gf will always say why i am not romantic...why am so pramatic all the time....<br><br>Well one day when i was in SanFrancisco University, I had a calss that i went to for the first time....On that day I saw from across the room this girl.  I didn't think that she was pretty or what? but I somehow felt this atrtraction to her...and I never even seen her before or even said anything when i walked intot at calss...In fact she never even saw me.  But as we were introducing ourselves, she must have noticed(although I didn't know she did)....I told me friend in the same calss that I was somehow very strangely attracted to her...for what reasons i dun know....I just felt her in my soul...stragne to say the least...<br><br>Then after that day I never saw her in the calss again and i never even got to make eye contact with her or even tok to her in the slightest.  The most i knew of her was her name was Paula Pineda.<br><br>Then after a couple weeks i totally forgot all about it...then one fine day she showed up in class  agian after about 2 months away since day 1.  I walked in and there she was standing there a few minutes before class started...I don't know why or how, but i just walked over there without my even klnowing it(and I am a very shy guy...esepcailly back then...)....<br><br>I just walked on over and she said hi to me...then I started to tok to her.  She started to tell me about whats been happeing to her these last 2 months within the first 10 seconds of the first word "hi"....<br><br>I discivered that she had to leave home and had no place to stay so she satyed with her giurl friend(yes she was a lesbian)...and got into a lot of trouble with a lot of butches..<br><br>And for some stupiod reason, I offered this tiotal stranger a place to saty at my place and I could sleep in my walk in closet while she slept on my bed....totally strange for a guy who never even had a girlfriend before...totally out of character...but that wa sthe effect that she had on me.<br><br>I didn't feel any sexula tension or sexual atrraction there.  It was just this feelingthat somewhere, somehow in time, I knew this person before...all her idiosyncrosies and what have you...I just knew!!!  And as she was trelling me all this she asked me wheter one day i would like to have coffe with her....I just nodded like an idiot and class started and i walked back to my tbale across the room.<br><br>From that day on I could never get her out of my head...I felt this thing in my soul that I knew her before...maybe from a previous life...but in fact I knew that i had never known her or even met her before....<br><br>I knew her as she was then..it was the strangest thing. and one day we finally had that coffee and she told me that for some relaly strange reason she felt that she had known me from someplace before...someplace that she knows doesn't exist because we had never met...and she went on to tell me in detail what she meant and the funny thing was that i was on the exact frequency that she was on...<br><br>i knew what she was saying because i was thinking excatly the same thing...and evrytime I called her or she called me, she would tell me that her heart would just beat like crazy...and mine would too...as if we were meant to be for some reason...<br><br>Anyway, she was my first real love...  We got on really well and we were so different from each other...even our differences was something good to us....and one fine day we told each other that I loved her and she said she loved me...and she felt it even that first day in calss when she never even met me...that somehoiw she loved me before from someplace else...<br><br>maybe it was a meeting of souls..of heart and mind...a totally sappy story but one which is all so real to me....<br><br>Eventually we broke up...mainly becasue i was too inexperienced...she did most of the wooing and shit because i didn't knowwhat to do... A couple months later sghe left me for another guy because she couldn't wait anymore for me to do things...She didn't knwo that I was inexperienced...in fact I was a virgin and she thought i was this really experienced hunk....so she had expectations of me that I couldn't achieve becasue i didn;'t know or have the experience to..<br><br>Inf I was the person I am now, I would have done things differently..and I am sure that it would have lasted a long long time....<br><br>.Anyway it was very real and wasn;t a figment of my imagination...it was just too real not to be.<br><br>Love at first site does exist...and it can work out if the situation is right(as in any relationship)....and It was such an intense experience for me...Even though I lost her and the feeling was one of the worst i have ever felt...I will always love her and will not forget her even on my death bed she will be the last thing on my mind besdies whoever i am with that is my wife or gf......<br><br>Don't give it up because it is an immaterial kind of love.  it may not exist for everyone, but it does exist...maybe a lot more rare so as to creat this idea that it is illusory...but if u feel it and it feels real and you can't explain it any other way...then explain it as Love at first site....<br><br>fuck....I feel like shit but can still come out with crap like this....haiz...maybe i need to sleep and rethink my aim in life.<br><br>Hope the best for you Samantha...U have a friend here.</div>
