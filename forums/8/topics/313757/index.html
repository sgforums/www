              <p>MONDAY, April 7 (HealthDay News) -- Call it a case of gator aid. New
              research suggests that alligator blood could serve as the basis for new
              antibiotics targeting infections caused by ulcers, burns and even
              drug-resistant "superbugs."</p>
              <p>The research is in its early stages -- extracts of alligator blood
              have only been tested in the laboratory -- and there's no guarantee
              that it will work in humans. Still, the findings are promising,
              researchers said.</p>
              <p>"We need new antibiotics. Anything like this is a step forward,"
              said Dr. Stuart Levy, a professor of medicine at Tufts University
              School of Medicine, who's an expert in antibiotic-resistant infections
              and is familiar with the new study. "But there are hurdles that this
              kind of antibiotic poses that others might not."</p>
              <p>The study authors, from McNeese State University and Louisiana State
              University, said their research is the first to take an in-depth look
              at alligator blood's prospects as an antibiotic source. According to
              the researchers, alligators can automatically fight germs such as
              bacteria and viruses without having been exposed to them before
              launching a defense.</p>
              <p>For the study, the researchers extracted proteins known as peptides
              from white cells in alligator blood. As in humans, white cells are part
              of the alligator's immune system. The researchers then exposed various
              types of bacteria to the protein extracts and watched to see what
              happened.</p>
              <p>In laboratory tests, tiny amounts of these protein extracts killed a
              so-called "superbug" called methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus, or MRSA. The bacteria has made headlines in recent years
              because of its killing power in hospitals and its spread among athletes
              and others outside of hospitals.</p>
              <p>The extracts also killed six of eight strains of a fungus known as
              Candida albicans, which causes a condition known as thrush, and other
              diseases that can kill people with weakened immune systems.</p>
              <p>The researchers, who presented their findings April6 at the national
              meeting of the American Chemical Society in New Orleans, said the blood
              extract could be used to develop an antibiotic in a topical cream form.
              They suggest that it could be called "alligacin."</p>
              <p>Levy said the human body might reject alligator proteins, thinking
              they're foreign invaders. "Our bodies love to make antibodies to
              proteins," he said. "After you get the first dose, the body sees it as
              foreign, and the next dose gets scooped up by the immune system, and
              it's done."</p>
              <p>But study lead author Lancia Darville, a doctoral student at
              Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, La., said scientists might
              be able to create drugs that copy the blood proteins once they figure
              out their structure. The idea would be to make a chemical that the body
              doesn't think is a protein. Even so, Darville said, "it is not easy to
              mimic any antimicrobial peptide for clinical use."</p>
              <p>Levy noted that many pharmaceutical companies have stopped
              investigating new antibiotics, because other areas of medicine are more
              profitable. The gap "has to be filled by more discovery," said Levy,
              who's also president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of
              Antibiotics.</p>
              <p>The study authors said alligator blood could become a drug source for humans within a decade.</p>
              <p>Still, Emily Ackiss, a clinical epidemiologist at Scripps Mercy
              Hospital in Chula Vista, Calif., who's familiar with the study
              findings, said, "The research discussed in this article is basic
              research. More extensive research and experimentation are needed before
              drug development could be expected."</p>
