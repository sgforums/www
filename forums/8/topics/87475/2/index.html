They have put up poster informing us that they have enhance their safety in the train safety by introducing security and MRt staff patrolling at the platform and yet this things happen!<br><br>But after a while, they have stopped doing so. Alll I see is the MRT staff just sit in their office talking and chatting. They didn't even bother to come out and check the surroundings for suspicious character or ppl like this guy who died!

If he think he can stop the train, then he's a numb skull! But it cost him his life.<br><br>I know that the staff alone can't do the job by patrolling everyday. but how about the public? They should have seen this guy and yet they chose to do nothing and pretend nothing has happen. All these time, government has been telling us to be vigilant but what those ppl do?

If he was, then yeah certainly Singaporeans are not exactly very helpful, but if he wasn't, well..... its really hard unless u're a Jedi who can read minds. Anyhow, condolences to this guy's family. Its a really horrible way to die.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree that if there are other passengers who ignored obvious signs of someone who is contemplaing suicide, these passengers should bear the guilt of not responding to the calls for attention by the person. if someone had in fact approached him and asked if he was alright, it would probably have made alot of difference - he may turn back on knowing that at least someone cared.<br><br>however, at the same time, before we start pointing fingers and criticising others, i would also like to urge everyone here to do some soul-searching: will you do something if you were there and you saw what the above other passengers saw - a stranger, sitting at the edge of the platform? or would you have become like all the other passengers, blending into the crowd, losing your own identity and individualism, filtering off warning signs with the thoughts that "someone else would respond" - just like what the above other passengers at bishan did today?</div>
