It is such a "tearjerker". I was telling Naivegal the other day that most books which won prizes like Booker Prize, are always made into movies, because they exists at least one sex scene with the male lead and female lead in the story, making it soft porn for a few pages. Hmmm, it seems that we have not got a plot where there exist a line "Guy and Gal have a one night stand, or sex"....<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is the last part to the romantic tale I concocted before I will go to the ball and present the realistic version to you. I have to say that the 3 parts of this short story was rushed by the lack of time. Given more time, I could write something much better. Here goes :<br><br>The Romantic Ball<br>-----------------<br>Part III<br><br>I really wondered why I said yes to her. For the first thing which made me resisted all the time, was that I felt that I am like a paedophile, since I am five years older than Cher, since she had just turned 20, and I have yet to turn to 26.. Well, she looks so childlike that it would be a joke. Anyway, that was mentioned in the top ten reasons why I would not go after Cher, as over the ICQ with Hugh. I would most appeal to reasons like the gal is still young and immature what she wanted to do.<br><br>That is the thing about being old, you become more sensible, and you don't jump into a relationship so easily, or even a romance. One night stand seemed attractive all the time but it is hurtful if you are the kind who seeks permanence. Such was my thoughts on rejecting Cher. Yet, my feelings gave way, trust me, not because I was seduced, rather I would want to experience that loving feeling again. You know, if this was the night which allow me to fall in love with her and vice versa, and a romance fluttered. That is what I would hope for then...<br><br>Where should I start first for this romantic night? Let me start from the dancing as usual, since I love ballroom dancing, and she learned it before with me. This is the second time and I knew that I would be able to waltz her thru, since Delirium has been a kind friend who have helped me over by being my partner, but ended up being gossiped by our country folks that we are going together. With our posture ready for the dance, my left hand clasped with hers, straightened and moving in one direction, and the other hand which rests tightly on the back of left shoulder. The posture was important because it was meant to give your partner the confidence that you can bring her across the floor without any problems. Her big eyes were sparkled with light and for the first time, I can see beauty, and that electrifying feeling would seduce me forever to her. I was always tempted to say the famous line by Chow Yun Fatt in "Anna and the King" in a modified version,"I am guy, I shall lead."<br><br>The beat of the slow melodious tune took over my mind. Slowly, I raised my right feet, and she got my signal, and we moved across the dance floor in the tent. The whole thing about life, is that the most meaningful and most brilliant moments are only so short, but they cast a light to my future. If you remember the last scene from the movie "Anna and the King", you would be able to imagine how this dance would be like. We crossed the floor at ease, though I was worried that I would make a blunder, with her dress fluttering by the side, and her head looked to the other side. My feelings were invoked with that sensation that I could dance forever, as I took her to the corner, and made a beautiful spin turn, and changed direction to move to the next one. The most beautiful feeling for me, would be able to dance with someone without crashing into someone. I would say that she is a good dancer, and I would still believe that way. The world passed with me in a smile.<br><br>Then if I continue this flash of the moment that she fell in love with me, and then we have a time alone from everyone in the ball, by some nice green pasture, drinking red wine and talking about everything under the pale moonlight, before daybreak at 4 am... This is how a romance fluttered right. The most beautiful romance in the context of a new age guy like me and which I felt that I can ever obtain, is something of my favourite movie, "Before Sunrise",where you can find that special someone to share less than 9 hours of romance, talking about friends, lovelife and many other things. If you would like to stretch your imagination, you can always have the scene, where I glanced with a smile into her eyes, and the next thing we know was that we made the first kiss in life and I found not the two, three, four or five, but the One and only.<br><br>If you want to conclude such a simple story, it would go in the sequence, that she became my partner for the 2nd ball, and subsequently, we became attached and then married and finally lived happily ever after.<br><br>Now, the next moment when you read this story, you realize that I am having a dream, and when I wake this morning, I find it really beautiful. We all need dreams in us, they keep us alive. And I tell myself,"Rick, even if this is not what is going to happen in the ball, you are consoled that you are going to win 3 pints of beer from Hugh, Sparkle and Darling."<br><br>Good day and good luck and dedicated to those hollywood dreamers...<br><br>----The End ----<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 20 June 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 20 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear all,<br><br>In retrospect, I felt happy and liberated after the ball was over. Although I thought that overall was a disaster, there are good times in the ball somehow like meeting up an ex-classmate who have left to do his PhD in London, and sitting down at the fellows common room, reading "Romeo and Juliet" and other Shakespearean plays.<br><br>In fact, I felt happy for some unknown reason, even though the next two balls might end up 3-0 on me. I was cycling back to my lab after recovering from the overnite ball and taking lunch with my friends. Then as I passed into the cycling path that led directly into the laboratory, despite the gloomy and windy weather, the tall grasses and fern fluttered gracefully across in a harmonious way, and just before the entrance of the lab, I look out at the vast landscape out there, and I stopped there to admire the beauty where I have been so busy with my desires that I did not realize that there are beautiful things around me. That sudden thoughts of contentment made me feel something that I have stopped feeling for : my happiness.<br><br>Have a good day, guys and gals.<br><br>yours sincerely<br>A Happy and Contented Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal</div>

Such scenarios are extremely sad, but are usually the most beautiful.<br><br>I think the reason is that when 2 person are together for a longer period of time, they may still love each other, but there will be many things that each of them need to tolerate about their other half.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, bochup,<br><br>I share your sentiments. However, r/s nowadays are getting very superficial. One of the reasons why I think about writing this hollywood fantasy, other than the story which I wrote and the realistic version (which I did not write), makes me think how different things can be. Sometimes, things just work against you and the best thing to do is to do nothing, was to ask the question,"Is love only a spark of moment, when you know you meet this person, it would be forever, or is it something which can be developed thru time?"<br><br>I do not know the answer. Most gals I met here or even thru cyberspace tells me that it is a spark of the moment. Seems to me that this age has left no room for r/s to develop in the manner as you grow to love someone. I adopt the view perhaps a cynical one, that nothing matters anymore in a r/s except x-factor. It is saying that can means can, cannot means cannot. There is no in-between. Much that things have changed so much for me in the past few months, that I realized that I have totally given up searching....<br><br>So is there still true love when I can still find faith in or is it just superficiality that makes people go around?<br><br>Have a good day. Nice to hear from you again.<br><br>yours<br>Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights.
