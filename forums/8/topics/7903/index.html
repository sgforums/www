            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>This thread is a product after a chat with few friends after some vodka. And my few friends include Revelations and Qwerty who have both finished their exams.<br><br>So we discuss about the recent romantic movies which we have seen recently, and I was commenting that I have recently seen a simple and touching low budget romantic movie entitled "Return to Me", starring David Duchonvy and Minnie Driver. There is for once no sex, but simple romance not like the recent ones which I see, including my favourite romance movie "Before Sunrise".<br><br>I am sure most people would agree with me that the following receipe would be how hollywood would be started :<br><br>1)Boy lose ex-gal<br>2)Gal lose ex-boy<br>3)Boy meets Gal<br>4)Boy fall in love with Gal and vice versa<br>5)Boy and Gal go together<br>6)Boy and Gal go thru problems<br>and finally<br>7)Boy and Gal live happily ever after.<br><br>Being a die-hard romantic, you would expect me to give the answer that I wish that a Hollywood kind of romance would fall into my life. However, after going thru a lot in life, I become more real to what things are in life, and I learn to say that the Hollywood fantasy story would not happen to me.<br><br>So, I would ask you, do you believe in Hollywood kind of romance, that your romance would follow the kind of receipe above? You can describe the kind of romantic encounter which you would like to have. Tell me your romantic love story or make one if you like.<br><br>Since Revey has challenged me to write a story, as I am expecting a very boring and quiet ball since I am going with the couples and expect them to disappear, I will followup in the thread later with the story which I am going to make it hollywood. Revey argues that hollywood romances do happen and I reply with the most skeptical tone,"Yeah, you would expect the greatest love story which would happen in the Mayball next Tuesday."<br><br>Have a good day and enjoy yourself.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>The Prodigal<br><br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 17 June 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I will write it later, but then, this will be the ball which I would hope to go to except for the fact that I know that it would not happen.... This is in response to Revey's challenge to the Hollywood dream...<br><br>Disclaimer : Characters and Places are fictional and any similarities are coincidental.<br><br>The Romantic Ball<br>-----------------<br>(Part I)<br>--------<br>Of course, I don't know how to write this little fairy tale, but let me narrate you to exactly what happened. You can call me Rick, the name which I always wanted people call me. Think of me, as a tall and thin young Singaporean man with average looks, not much of a hunk, otherwise, I would have found myself tonnes of girlfriends on my fingertips. Then add a background to my story, I am the only child of my family, and then, I broke up with my ex-girlfriend last year, and it was the worst thing which happened to me, being the faithful guy. I was the typical nice guy, who, of course, most of the time, being taken advantage of and always have to be the counsellor and family friend to many couples whom I know in my university. I am just a simple guy, who is now taking his doctorate in one of the two universities in UK, which have a college system. I leave you to guess which one, as I will fill in details in the story. I liked to do ballroom and latin dancing, worked in the bar and college bops security and so forth. Think of me as someone with a jack of all trades but master of none.<br><br>Let me tell you about my university, it has a small town named Grantchester nearby, and for the first time, over how many years, there was going to be a ball held there. Of course, for the fans of Jeffrey Archer's books, you would know that he resides presently in Grantchester. It is a small town, endowed with beautiful greenery, and the flowers in the old Vicarage would blossom in the dawn of summer. The ball that I am going to tell you, was a romantic story which happened to me, and it would happen to you, if you believe in dreaming. I always believe in dreaming, not until I split and my whole world collapse on me. Over the year, I spent my time recovering and tried to date several gals, but ended up with futile attempts.<br><br>Of course, now let me cast the characters who are going to the ball. There is of course, the female lead called Cher, who is a young first year medic, with her big eyes and childlike look. She was popular among her peers, being one of the few pretty Singaporeans in the University (but of course, not everyone think so, and that includes my good looking friend Hugh). Of course, she have both beauty and brains, not to mention that she is a nice gal too. Such combination would naturally attract bees, or I use a more horrible label on them, and I call them Bodyguards. The problem between Cher and I, goes like this : whenever I see her on the streets of the University town I stay, I ran in several stints of bad luck, so unfortunate that I have to spend money repairing my bike, washing my creamy white jacket filled with dirty coffee stains from the coffee of Starbucks and etc. It became till a point that I decided to avert her at all cost. However, this was half of the story, the other half of the story, is that I owe her a favour, because there was the last term, where I desperately seek a girl dancing partner, and I asked her, because a junior of mine happened to be her ex-classmate. But believe me, I am not interested in her at all, as Hugh would beg to differ because I once listed the ten reasons why I should not go after her (that includes being poor on bed, since I was told that she was an sweet and innocent child, brought up by stauch Catholic tradition in the shelter of a rich family).<br><br>Then there are the two couple friends who are in the story, but I only stress on one, knowing the other would disappear in the story which I do not bother to introduce. My friends Darling (he happens to be the neighbour of Cher) and Honey are the first couple. Well, they got hitched recently, and there is always this joke which I loved to crack on them, which is Cher being their family doctor, and me being the family friend, and you know what, they would make fun of me from London to my town, that the family friend and the family doctor should go together.<br><br>So, with enough background, I can start my romantic story easily, so that things would be set in motion. It may not be the most beautiful story but a fairy tale, which happened on Midsummer's day, and the most coincidental thing about the name of this ball, happens to coincide with my favourite Shakespearean play, "A Midsummer's Night Dream".<br><br>[to be continued in this thread later]<br>------------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 18 June 2000).]</div>

Guys will be on their smart-looking tuxedoes, and the ladies will go around with their gowns. You can imagine how beautiful an event like this can be, and how very possible a fairy tale ending might be given this perfect ambience. The reason why I think he would find the ball boring is because of the following reasons:<br><br>1) He is too skeptical of anything remotely fairytale might happen.<br>2) He lacks the imagination to make things happen.<br>3) He lacks the drive to push for things to happen.<br>4) He lacks the courage to approach people to make things happen (not that way).<br><br>So go on Proddy, prove me wrong. Prove to me that you are well-deserved of your long-preserved reputation in this forum. A pint would be at stake, but I know that you know much more things are effectively at stake too. Come on, a challenge is a challenge, if you are man enough to match your nick as Prodigal the Bard, write something spectacular for all of us to see. We shall see a before and after. We shall see if fairy tales do exist in real life, no matter how "coincidental" you might put it. Write something to warm all our hearts, and we shall see how far your actual experiences differ from it. The stress would be on your side, since I have already made situations very advantageous to myself, meaning, I foresee myself winning, unless you make sure you do something about it. You know down inside I hope you win, and I won't mind losing a pint to you, but if you do lose, I do get a pint as a consolation.

            <div class='col-md body'>While Revey is on the plane, flirting with the air stewardess in British Airways, let me continue the story, before Tuesday in UK time, so that I can write this fairy tale.<br><br>The Romantic Ball II<br>--------------------<br>So, I have to continue part II of the story. How do you want me to tell it to you? I would like to continue to tell you that I set off to the party without any expectation, and even if I have, I have expected the worst. I did not want to give myself any hope, because I always have the experience that I don't have my partner with me in any balls, i.e. I am unable to have the charisma to maintain my partner.<br><br>I was waiting by the college gate, before proceeding to the ball in Grantchester by punt thru the beautiful river. I was waiting for the couples as usual, with their typical habit of being late, since I am usually punctual. Of course, you want me to describe to you what I have wore for this ball, and I will tell you that I am dressed in full black with a black tie. The thing about guys was that, they don't have much to wear compared to gals. Of course, there will be the meeting of the group of us eventually, since they are always late.<br><br>This is the n-th time where I have met Cher, in her normal black dress and make up. To be really honest, it is her usual. As Jerome, one of my students in the department, has met Cher in a ball, commented to me that she had worn very heavy makeup, and suggested to me that she should learn from Brittney Spears. I don't know what he has in mind, but hopefully, he is not suggesting a boob job.  Personally, I agree with him, since I think she looks like a kid, when she tries to dress old, but then, that is the beauty of it all. I recall once, when we were walking towards that only dancing class, she told me of her interest in learning latin dancing and wondered whether it is essential to dress scantily. Of course, I gave no comments. Such was my impression of her, and I admit that I am biased here. She was just the kind who would be conservative, if not more, very repressed, as Darling, my friend has told me that he is trying to corrupt her to the Dark side.<br><br>Somehow, I decided to be silent for a nite, despite being a good talker. The couples are as usual, in their groovy mode. Both of us are sitting on the punt with no words. Actually, it was not her but another of my lady friend Delirium, whose mind is more random than the weather of England who was supposed to go. Delirium has made my life really miserable by selling the ticket to her. When she told me over the phone that she sold the ticket to Cher, I was going to faint like Rupert Everett in "The Next Best Thing".<br><br>So, if you ask me, the punt just continued till we reached the small town out there. If you will allow me to tap my imagination, you will see beautiful marquis tents set up in the midst of the fields. There were just many interesting things to do in a Mayball. You might ask why the Mayball is in June, and the week where most Mayballs happen is called the Mayweek. I suppose it is by tradition, despite I tried to ask around in the college bar. Typically, if it is going to be my worst case scenairo, Cher will technically split with me, after one hour, and then I will be drinking, or maybe try one of my lousy attempts to chat up a gal. Think of guy who have all the chat lines taught by his beautiful sworn sisters who are all man-killers, and by principle, he refused to use. That is me, the pathetic me, or should I say the stupid me.<br><br>I take the white wine, and beautiful music ranging from the soothing classical music to the heavy house music, just as Cher who was being chat up by her college mates as well as talking to her friends there. Let me tell you what one can do in a Mayball. One can do a few things in the Mayball, go to the Casino and be the gambler like Chow Yun Fatt in the "God of Gamblers", go to get a massage where you encounter Lisa Kudrow lookalikes (her character Phoebe in Friends) to knock your bones out of you, or you can enjoy eating food. There are also punt trips. If you want me to tell you what the ball is really like, it is a ball where you need a partner to go. It is ridiculous to go alone or with a group of friends where everyone is attached and you are not. This is the way of the English kind of balls, not the kind of Singaporean graduation balls where there is nothing like a jam and hop followed by people renting hotel rooms and play drinking games there.<br><br>I must be talking really a lot about how different balls are. Come back to the story, I was decided to split and somehow, I fished my way out of the marquis tents area and proceeded to the nearby river. I sat there silently and listen to the river flow. That is the beauty where everyday I could not find the time to appreciate what it was.  I sat down by the grass, as it is dark under the pale moonlight. Darkness only engulf less than 5 hours in summer, beginning from 11.00 pm to 4 am. My mood was fluctuating like the many ripples in the river. I was swinging the wine glass, and see the white wine inside swirling gracefully across the surface of the glass inside. I don't feel depressed because of the ball. Perhaps, it's my life, it is the way which I want to enjoy it. Honestly, I would rather go with a partner, even if you would have call it a one night stand or anything else, since it bear no connotations of sex.<br><br>"So, you are here," a feminine voice came behind me.<br><br>"Hi there," I smiled and turned around to look at her. It was Cher, and I was surprised to find her here. Somehow, I felt that there was a conspiracy involved. It was all because Darling and Honey had a bet with me, that she would stay with me for the whole night over the pint of beer. I felt unnatural, standing in the face of her. Sometimes, I am wondering what the next disaster would be installed for me. Yet, there is something in me that perhaps, once I had returned the favour to her, I would be done, and able to move on with my life. There are somethings in life, which I cannot find a rational reason, but I know that I would be able to move on, after this, because it was just some exotic karma experiences which I have to bear with. The interaction between a man and woman is always like a chemical reaction. I wanted to be real and see someone right in front of me. I suddenly found myself at a loss of words in front of her. This would be perhaps my last chance of meeting her, because she is always so busy that I could get her out for the dinner to repay the favour.<br><br>"Are you with your friends?" I said in a smile, encrypted with a sigh. "Well, no point accompanying me, an old postgraduate."<br><br>She said nothing, and looked into my eyes, found a weary and tired man, seeking for solace and peace in his life. She smiled and said,"Why not we just enjoy ourselves for the night?"<br><br>And I will tell you the decision in the next part. For the sake that it is a romantic ball, it must be yes that I answered.<br><br>[to be concluded]<br><br>----------------<br>"I wish that I could have the love of a woman who could come to my life, lift me from sorrow, depression and loneliness, and push me to higher heights. However, love is not about finding someone to relieve you, but love is about you devoting your heart and soul to love that someone, even if you know that someone do not love you the way you do."<br>- Prodigal<br><br>[This message has been edited by prodigal (edited 19 June 2000).]</div>
