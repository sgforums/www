            <div class='col-md body'>hi there... guessed that we are in tha same boat here. well..from my view.. hopefully.. she will.. provided that guy show his care and concern for her. and show that tha reason for rejecting you is NOT true.<br>this depends though.. if she rejeted tha guy cos she had found another guy.. well.. tha rejected guy more likely got less hope of her liking him. thats from moi experience. got to start to find other girl that is worth loving.<br>if not... well..tha guy have to trace back  what have gone wrong. if he is in tha wrong, pls do tha honour of askin for forgivness with sincere and honesty. as a guy he have to think some other thing.. like askin her out or sort of for dinner, movies, etc. anything that he feel she will be comfortable. But tha most important is Patience and dun try to force her. He lead tha way and let tha girl decide. hopefully.. she'll get tha message and fulfil his wish.<br>if he is not in tha wrong.. well.. still do ask for forgivness, (well.. girls nowadays neber say she is wrong) cos maybe he dun realised what he did before might had offended her. try to convinced her that he didnt mean of hurting her (if he truly likes her). well.. Patience again! and dun try to push her too far until she began to insult him instead.<br><br>well.. give her time.. but not too much time that she started to find some other guys. by that time..its already too late. keep in touch with her but not too often until u started to irritate her. if she asked for frendship for tha time being.. well.. accepting is tha wiser step. try to get closer to her by utilising tha power of your brain. think creatively not stupidly. add some humour (try to avoid insult). and tha most important, show her that he like her and never gonna dissapoint her  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> im sure she'll get tha message.<br>well, this is from moi experience but result..hehe i have yet to know. i feel this step is tha wiser one?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> well.. got to risk for it cos if he really like her.. its worth risking. Dun Give UP and Be Patience! (i dun think this is valid for guys who are playboys)<br><br>------------------<br>Professional Critics</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me, I just move on if a girl rejects me. In fact, I have been rejected many times the first time around in the past, and I just "walked away" and forget about the girl.  This could be part of  my lack of self-esteem, confidence and patience.  This was a many years ago.  But now as I grow older, my confidence and self-esteem are much better.  So, if a girl rejects me now, I would definitely try again. I am not too sure about the patience part of me though.  In fact, I am an extremely impatient and aggressive person.  This could also be one iof the factors that explained for my past failures in going after girls.<br><br>So, my suggestion is don't give up so quick yet.  Try again!  In fact, try asking her why she rejects you.  Hopefully she will answer ur qusetion and give u an honest answer.  Then u decide your next move.<br><br>The decision is ultimately yours!  Don't let others to decide for u!<br><br>Good Luck!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hiya.....thanks for the replies.....what if the reason is that we are different in character?? This is quite true due to the fact that she is more introvert while i'm more extrovert, but then what i feel is that it takes two hands to clap in a relationship. So can someone please enlighten me wether the reason is really what it means or is there some other 'hidden' reasons that i do not know. Maybe girls will know it better. RIght??<br><br>Comments please....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>unicorn:<br><br>It depends on how much the girl is worth to the guy. If the guy finds that the girl is really very special to him, that she isn't someone he will find anywhere then I think he should be patient and see if she changes her mind. but if after careful deliberation the guy realises that the girl isn't all the great, maybe it's just that she's quite chio or something, then I say forget her, you can easily find another equally chio girl but one who likes you. From personal experience, sometimes after thinking long and hard, you decide to move on, and say later on the girl decides she likes you and wants to have something going with you, you might actually realise then that she doesn't mean very much to you anymore, ie. it was more of a passing infatuation you had for her, so lucky for you, and her, you didn't have a relationship with her.</div>
