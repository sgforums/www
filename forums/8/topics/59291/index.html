            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT'S happening to the kids these days?<br><br>They hog seats at cafes and fast-food outlets.<br><br>Take up two seats on the bus and MRT- one for themselves and the other for their bags.<br><br>Are Singaporean kids these days getting a bit too big for their shoes?<br><br>Maybe they are, but can you fault them for it?<br><br>Recently, a student who was studying at a cafe had her particulars taken down by the police for refusing to leave after being asked to go when it got crowded. When her mother got to know about it, she got upset, not with her daughter but with the cafe and the police.<br><br>In my days, I would have been given a walloping for causing trouble in the first place. My parents would take it that I was the guilty party even before all the facts were known. It was punish first, ask questions later.<br><br>In school, if I got a complaint from the teachers, I knew I would be in trouble when I got home. If I got punished in class, I would be assured of another painful session at home.<br><br>Nowadays, when a teacher complains about a child to his or her parent, some parents will jump to the defence of their offspring. Giving excuses from they are not feeling well, or that their child was unhappy with something, right up to accusing the teacher of not paying enough attention to the child or criticising their methods of instructions.<br><br>It has certainly changed from a case of guilty till proven innocent to one where itÂ’s innocent till proven guilty.<br><br>In the cafe incident, I would say that cafes and fast-food outlets have been very patient and accommodating in allowing students to study there. I used to study at McDonald's during my time, the Beach Road branch to be precise. There were two levels to that outlet, and we would go to the second level to avoid the glares of staff.<br><br>If we were chased away, we would have left quietly without a fuss.<br><br>Today's kids have taken a different tack to assure their place at these outlets. They have come up with strategies such as buying a drink to get a seat and then buying a burger when it gets crowded to justify their stay.<br><br>Not caring that these outlets are trying to run a business or that they are depriving genuine customers of tables.<br><br>Has a change in parenting techniques resulted in such behaviour from kids today?<br><br>In the past, parents wouldn't think twice about giving their bawling kid a tight slap in public.<br><br>Today, with a greater awareness of laws protecting the rights of children, as well as the change in paradigm from the punishment and reward system to one that focuses on nurturing and educating, the younger generation of parents are certainly different from my parents' batch.<br><br>More time is spent explaining the logic behind rights and wrongs in the hope that this will lead to the child growing up into a well-adjusted adult.<br><br>So does it mean that my generation is not as well adjusted as the next generation will be?<br><br>What about the older generations like that of our parents or those of our business and country leaders?<br><br>I don't think they would consider themselves any less well adjusted. And neither do I.<br><br>During my last in-camp training, my Commanding Officer (CO) was lamenting about the latest batch of recruits that were assigned to him. According to him, they didn't know how good they had it. Even though National Service life has drastically improved since our time, they were still complaining.<br><br>Compared to before, he was spending a great deal more time counselling these 'men'.<br><br>There were even a couple of would-be undergrads that he had to regularly counsel each week to help them get through the week.<br><br>My CO also begged us that if we had male offspring in future, we should try our very best to bring them up to be real men, not a bunch of wimps who can hardly defend themselves, let alone a country.<br><br>Now whose less well adjusted?<br><br>But can these youngsters be faulted for their attitude?<br><br>With smaller family units these days, kids are being considered more precious than before. Some parents can hardly bare to dispense any discipline on their little princes and princesses.<br><br>It seems like the old saying of sparing the rod and spoiling the child does still hold water.<br><br>What do you think? Maybe it is time for that old rotan to be reinstated as a symbol of fear.<br><br><a href="http://www.asia1.com.sg/a1news/20031013_story1_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asia1.com.sg/a1news/20031013_story1_1.html</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
