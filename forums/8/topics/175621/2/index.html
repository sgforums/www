It's a standard procedure for these criminals to employ a lawyer to defend them.

As for the criminals, it's usually a case of being the almighty and not being afraid of death when committing the crime, but turning into worthless cowards when they're caught. Anyway, most of the times these criminals will be found guilty, as the evidences will usually be too overwhelming.
