            <div class='col-md body'>I just looked at the tax letter my father got. Wow. I believe that continuing with capital punishment will definitely prevent the tax from rising since there will be no need to pay for their lodging. Looking at monetary value i think that its ethical. However when i look at the 10 commandments of "though shall not kill" and what buddism say "bu nen sha shen" obviously in terms of religion its not ethical. Ai such a hard decision to make. I believe that just kill the guy after his parent die at the least his parents will not have to bear the pain of seeing the death of their son.

But I always wonder, if it is meant to deter, why do lawyers always plead for leniency for their clients? If he's not afraid when he commits the crime, why should he be afraid now?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

But the pain of losing one's child is greater than a murderer's parents losing their murderer child. In the 1st place, these murderers' parents are mostly pathetic parents who don't give a sh.it about their childrens' life. Only when their children have committed a crime do they start appearing in court crying and complaining as if their child is innocent. Losers. So I'd suggest the death penalty for the murderer, and also a death penalty for the parents. Just kidding... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
