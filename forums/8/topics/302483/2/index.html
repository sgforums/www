            <div class='col-md body'>I believed one of the write-ups is this article:<br><br>----------------------------------------<br>Straits Times Interactive.<br>MARCH 19, 2004<br>Hope for childless as 15 offer eggs or sperm<br>'Surge' in potential donors after ST report on infertility<br><br>By Wong Sher Maine<br><br>EGG donor Karen (not her real name) winces when she recalls how she had to<br>fight her fear of needles to give herself daily hormone injections, but<br>smiles when she imagines the joy she has brought to childless couples.<br><br>The 30-year-old management assistant is one of a handful of women in<br>Singapore who has donated her eggs, and done it more than once.<br><br>In 2002, the divorcee went under general anaesthetic in January and June at<br>a private hospital's fertility clinic to have 31 eggs extracted.<br><br>She was told they were divided among three couples - two Singaporean and<br>one Indonesian Chinese.<br><br>She was not paid a single cent.<br><br>Karen wants to do it a third time at the Singapore General Hospital (SGH)<br>to help childless couples recently featured in a Straits Times report on<br>infertility.<br><br>In the past five years, SGH has come across only two walk-in egg donors.<br><br>When asked why she was willing to go through what many women would not even<br>consider, Karen said: 'What else am I going to do with my eggs? They are<br>just flushed away every month.'<br><br>Since the Straits Times report was published a fortnight ago, 13 men and<br>two women have walked into SGH and KK Women's and Children's Hospital to<br>offer their sperm or eggs. An SGH doctor described it as a 'surge' because<br>the hospital had just three sperm donors and two egg donors last year.<br><br>Both hospitals have patients queueing up for eggs and sperm, and they have<br>to wait up to two years. Figures were not available from the National<br>University Hospital, the remaining public hospital which accepts such<br>donations.<br><br>All the potential donors are now undergoing physical and psychological<br>tests to assess their eligibility to donate. According to Dr Julianah Abu,<br>an SGH obstetrician and gynaecologist who runs the sperm bank there, about<br>two-thirds are usually found to be suitable.<br><br>She added that the number of sperm donors, however, still outnumber egg<br>donors because egg donation involves hormonal stimulation and an operation.<br><br>Three potential donors, who had e-mailed The Straits Times asking how they<br>could donate their eggs, explained that their desire to help childless<br>couples outweighed whatever physical or emotional pain they would have to<br>undergo.<br><br>A 33-year-old single, who works as a journalist in Malaysia, said: 'More<br>than organ donation, which is about extending life, egg donation is<br>life-giving. I feel assured that the child will be specially cared for,<br>since the couple had to go through so much to be parents.'<br><br>A 26-year-old part-time student, who loves children, said: 'My heart goes<br>out to those who want kids badly but cannot have them.'<br><br>Karen said she equated egg donation with blood donation - she was simply<br>helping others.<br><br>She dismissed the possibility that her children could end up marrying one<br>another. 'The chances are so remote and anyway it is okay for cousins to<br>marry.'<br><br>She decided to donate her eggs shortly after she began divorce proceedings<br>against her husband, an aircraft engineer, at the end of 2000 when she<br>discovered he had a mistress pregnant with his child. They did not have any<br>children.<br><br>'I may never have the chance to marry again or have children but if I can<br>help other couples, why not?,' she said. She reckoned that since she had<br>good genes, with no family history of cancers or genetic illnesses, she was<br>a good candidate.<br><br>She was also determined to 'experience and live life to the full' after her<br>divorce, engaging in what she called 'dangerous activities' like riding<br>motorcycles, operating cranes, sailing boats and flying planes.<br><br>'Anything can happen to me. If so, I know I have done my part as a human<br>being in reproducing, though I may not have been the one to bear and look<br>after my child.'<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Copyright @ 2004 Singapore Press Holdings.
