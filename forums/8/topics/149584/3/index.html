In fact, the search for truth has frequently been compromised in their quest to mete out a swift sentence. If you wanna debate about our legal system, look for my topic in SC on this poor guy.<br><br>In fact, if we were to dig further, we might find that VS Aiyar was not as guilty as he was made out to be. I suspect he could well have been framed. Similar high-profile cases in UK were dismissed by the courts because they didn't think they could get a guilty verdict.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets ask ourselves, what is the point of killing another person (death sentence) while the "victim" is already dead? For justice?

If not, then death sentence is for what? It will only deter people at the right mind but not at the critical time.<br><br>Lastly, we all know (including Malaysians) that murder is death sentence, why would he come back to ask for death?<br><br>Anyway, personnally I felt that humans are full or craps.

Maybe one day when we kill someone out of peak of anger or when you know that person cause your future to collapse, then we can truely understand a murderer's feeling.<br><br>Can you imagine the moments before hanging and during hanging? Thats the cruelity of humans. Do you think Ah Hao likes killing meh? Must be something which he cannot control at that point of time.<br><br>I don't mean to encourage murdering but I kind of pity Ah Hao, he is just 22 or 23, have family etc. Maybe it is his unfortunate to know Huang Na and her China mother.
