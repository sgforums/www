I was told that, the suicidal tendency is very high among the new inmates and the officers have to keep an eye on you with extra care during the 1st three months.<br><br>My friend who has some old neighbours or friends who came out from the prison.  He told me that they all looked very stoned, like very slow in response.  He said that he cannot imagine how these ppl going to start a new normal life.</div>
