In the acticle published in page 6 of LianHe Wanbao 11/11/2004, he cited that something was amiss in the psychological behaviour of Huang Na's mother, Mdm Huang Shuying, and her step-father, a certain Mr Zheng.<br><br>The expert's view was that Mdm Huang appeared aloof and was unusually quiet for a mother who claimed to have lost her beloved daughter in a murder case. He noted that it was baffling, not only to himself but to members of the community-at-large ( possibly including psychological experts at Woodbridge Hospital and NUS ), that Mr Zheng, being a stepfather to a daughter he had hardly any contact with, could behave in such a manner - wailing loudly and crying uncontrollably during the funeral procession.<br><br>The article carrying Prof. Lee's view is suggestive and appears to point towards a plausible scenario that Huang Na was silenced by her mother and stepfather, thereby making Malaysian Mr Took Leng How as a scapegoat. Prof Lee himself had the opinion that the case left numerous questions that have not been answered............<br><br>Part 2 to be continue.</div></blockquote>We had a long debate on this...hahhaa</div>
