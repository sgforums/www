            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, Jasonnex, Rinoa or other christians, I am just wondering what is your opinion on faith healings ?  It seems a major belief in Charismatic churches is that God in all his love &amp;  mercy would demonstrate his power by healing people of ailments immediately during healing sessions. Contrasts this with evangelical churches who don't emphasis such radical faith.  thus memebers take longer to heal.  U know tumors don't just shrink immediately &amp; people on wheelchair don't just  get up and walk and maybe never walk again at all.  Does this mean God has found more favour among charismatics than evangelicals ? Its like God saying well since they believe I can only do this much therefore I will bless them little but those that don't limit me I will bless abundantely ?<br><br>Why does it seem selective ?  I mean if you can heal cancer why don't they make the blind see ?  the deaf hear ?  raise the dead ?<br><br>Does God want to heal everyone who believes in him immediately ?  Could he chosen not to heal someone in a Charismantic rally if he choses not to.  Like Job suffering terribly for a long time perhaps sometimes he doesn't heal for a reason only in heaven would we know.  Only we know his love is real.<br><br>could sometimes during faith healing a person believes so his illness goes into remission but doesn't really go away.  like the experiment where they give dummy tablets to patients saying this will heal them &amp; the power of belief made them feel better ?<br><br>I hope this posts makes sense. I m half awake.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. I do not discount the fact that God still heals today, but you have to understand that sometimes it is a natural thing to grow old and fall sick. As much as I believe in faith healings, I believe in medical science.<br><br>As for faith healings, I believe that it is the sovereign authority of God whether he wants to heal or not. God does not play favouritism and you're right, there is a purpose for everything, much of which we will never understand. Sometimes, it is the heart/spiritual/soul condition that God is trying to heal, not the physical.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is there really such a thing as faith healing? i mean, i noe it exists, but issit really true??? i've seen pple who go up to a pastor, who claims tt he has been granted the gift of healing pple. then, the pastor, i tink prays for the person, touches his/her head, n this person falls to the ground. so, is this real, or issit just b/s? y does the person fall to the ground???<br>by the way, (can i sidetrack?) does neone know bout tongues? the gift of God.....do people now a days still have the powers to speak in tongues??? when people speak in the so-called tongues, how n y do they speak in it? the bible says tt it's a gift frm god, but how do pple acquire it??? seems to me s if those pple who speak in tongues, in present day churches r either faking it, or they created it themselves, n learnt it......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>y do people fall on to the ground coz the holy spirit fill the person when the pastor pray or christians pray.the power of the holy spirit is too strong for the person to handle that y the person fall.people do speak in tougnes in these days.indeed it is a gift from Him.how u get this gift is that u need to read the bible ,spent time with Him then He will give u the gift. actually speaking in tougnes is not fake or u can learn fron any where coz when God give u the gift of speaking in tougnes ,the holy spirit feel u up. actually speaking in tounges is other languages .God also give the gift such as healing, etc</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>God has a purpose for everyone, if he thinks that it is time for u as children of God to return to thy kingdom, U will have to go. Faith healings..it does exist...my grandpa was converted cos he is healed by God...when my uncle who is the only christian then prayed so hard for him , I think even asking the whole congregation and the church to pray for him as well...Like I said, God has its way of doing things...after that my whole family was convinced that there is a true God and got converted too...and my grandpa is still living till now as a totally devoted christian...<br>As to why God heals some and some not, I only believe one thing, when the time for u has come...it is time to go...Miracles dun happen all the time...God choooses ppl to be freat prophets and also evangelists...just like he chose Moses and also Paul...<br><br>Becos Christianity is not Science...soit can't be interpreted into Scientif forms of genres...but one thing for sure, if u have the faith, ur faith might save u....perserverance and undauntedness reigns...As we Christians believe that we are only passing clouds on this earth and once we have completed our mission and tasks...we will go back to heaven to enjoy thy goodness with him...</div>

But I am pointing my fingers at the bunch of christians who practice faith healing meant as a lure to attract non-believer. You sensationalized your version of faith healing by doing it in full view of the crowd, and have your patients touched and fall.<br><br>Your idea of 'manifestation' is sheer murder.</div>
