            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, I would like to report on cabby driving dangerously, nearly causing me to have an accident on the expressway. The cab involved was SHA 3380 H.<br><br>It happened at around 2320hrs along TPE. I was going at 90km/h when a Comfort Cab sped past me at most than 100km/h. Along the way, the cab got stuck between 2 other cabs. As I overtook the speeding cabby on the left, he signalled left and without checking his blind spot, he squeezed into my lane.<br><br>I sounded my horn, and he persisted in getting in. I picked up my speed to avoid collision. Along the way he tailed me very closely, less than half a car's length. After which I slowed down because I was going too fast with him following me, he still tailed me closer and when he went too close, he braked and I heard his tire skid.<br><br>He picked up speed, and used half a lane to overtake me. Nearly knocking me, and overtook me. We exited at the Tampines/Pasir Ris exit. He slowed down to block me, and jammed his brakes in attempt to cause me to have an accident. His tires skidded again and smoke was seen coming out.<br><br>I moved to the left only to see him shift his taxi to block me and jam his brakes again. After which he went left to Pasir Ris and I went right to Tampines.<br><br>As a rider on the road, it appalls me to think that there are such drivers in your company. They are a risk to our safety and as a rider, he tried to get me into an accident which will go his way because he has gone in front of me and should I hit him, it would be my fault.<br><br>Should there be no action taken against the driver, I will bring this up to higher authorities.<br><br>Thank you for reading my email.<br><br>Regards, XXX<br><br>I sent this to comfort feedback on taxi services... anyone else i should forward it to???</div>
