He claims that the doctors can turn away patients at the clinic's closing hours. He is totally wrong.<br><br>The medical profession is not like any other business. A convenience store owner can decline to sell to customers who knock at the shop's closing time but not a doctor.<br><br>Every doctor takes a pledge that he will put the interests of the patients first. A doctor has a social, moral and legal duty to attend to a sick person at any time.<br><br>Suppose a doctor refuses to treat a sick person because he has to go home and the patient dies. The doctor can be held responsible for it.<br><br>Natarajan Nageswaran </span><br><br>I am appalled by Lim Boon Hee remarks who seems to have been a responsible indiviual who often contributed to the ST Forum. Where have all the moral ethics gone to?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ST Forum<br>Feb 25, 2006<br>Doctor's duty to save lives, not watch the clock<br><br>I AM shocked and read with disbelief Mr Lim Boon Hee's views in 'Doctors at fault? That's not always the case' (ST, Feb 24).<br><br>I am not a medical doctor but I know what is professional ethics. To the man-in-the-street, a doctor's job is to save lives.<br><br>When a clinic operates till midnight, it means that as long as the patients are at the clinic before midnight, the doctor has a duty and obligation to attend to them.<br><br>If there are worries that the doctor and his staff will go home late, then don't operate until midnight. It's as simple as that.<br><br>I was very shocked at Mr Lim's view in supporting the clinic operating during holidays and attending only to its regular customers. This is placing commercial considerations over everything else.<br><br>My four children had taken Klacid MR when they were sick. But it was always the last resort before my family doctors prescribed it for my children, and only after other antibiotics fail to have any effect on their condition.<br><br>Klacid MR is usually not prescribed on the first visit. I was told that where possible, we should let our body build up resistance rather than rely on antibiotics to fight the germs.<br><br>Tay Sok Khoon<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ethics? This is not Stone Age. Who cares about ethics now? Money makes the world goes round. That applies to everybody. Talking about ethics, some clinics have even resorted to marketing approaches to boost sales. It has been reported in the Sunday Times and the reporters query about their ethics. Some of those vitamins basically have no use for health, but doctors are selling it.</div>

I wonder if they have missed the point completely in the rebuttal by Mr Lim Boon Hee. The fact is most patients go to a clinic for non-emergency conditions such as flu or common cold.<br><br>Correct me if I am wrong. There is currently no strain of pathogen causing the influenza or common cold that's acutely present just a few minutes before midnight. Most of the patients would have been experiencing symptoms in the preceding hours and there is no reason for them to be attended to when they decide to turn up at the clinic at closing time.<br><br>These patients should not blame others for their own procrastination. Closing time does not equate end of registration time. It is meant for the doctor to finish seeing cases that had the courtesy to present themselves in the ten to twenty minutes before closing time.<br><br>Granted the rare situation where a patient presents himself at the clinic in an emergency, it is the doctor's right to refuse any other patient, subject to his judgment.<br><br>In the same vein, if he refuses to see a patient who then collapses, it's his responsibility to bear.<br><br>There's no need for the 'man in the street' to take the high ground and preach to a doctor his professional obligations. It is typical that patients here use rhetoric to justify their lack of consideration.<br><br>In essence, it just seems wrong for the doctor to do anything that displeases the patient.<br><br>Perhaps Singaporeans have their perception of reality tainted by medical dramas from Hollywood or Caldecott Hill which depict photogenic doctors going out on a limb to uphold the patients' interests.<br><br>Let's keep it real and bear in mind that doctors are not individuals with super-human capabilities but are human beings who need a well-deserved rest at the end of a long day in the clinic.<br><br>Tan Shian Ming<br></div>
