When the time comes many will stand up and be counted. It's not the size of the country that matters but rather the number of Singaporeans that feel that they matters. I m born and bred here and I will never desert it in times of need.<br><br>Like my mum who reacted strongly whenever neighbouring countries like Indonesia &amp; Malaysia makes insensitive comments/threats on our country, I too feel a deep sense of pride and patriotism to stand up for my country and speak up for it when I see unjust remarks. Whenever I go to other countries(tour,backpacking,climbing expeditions) and was asked where I came from, I will tell people that I m from Singapore with pride and my head held high. Seems that a number of foreigners that I met had a narrow perception of Singapore(being a "fine" city and people get cane for everything!) so being the person I m, will confidently tell them otherwise and to go Singapore to take a look for themselves  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!</div>

I agree totally. One shouldn't critisize the host country they are in. My views are that I do as the roman do when I m in other countries. Be open and receptive to their way of living and try to assimilate urself into the surrounding. Part of the aspect of visiting other places are to experience their way of life mah   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Visiting other countries widen ur horizon and broaden ur world n views of things. U will be more appreciative of what u have in Singapore but do be sensitive to others and keep ur criticism to urself. Juz appreciate it blissfully, no need to look down or show pity. I m sure you would not like to hear criticism on Singapore too. Let's make our world a better place to live in.
