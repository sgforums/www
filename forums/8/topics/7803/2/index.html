The will to maintain the mindset of eating vegetarian and the effort of getting vegetarian food. It also takes a lot of planning to know where to find vegetarian stalls.

I can be sure vegetarian stalls is diffcult to find in Singapore unless you know where got vegetarian stores.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I do not quite agreed with you.

My friends also brought me to a few vegetarian stalls and restaurants before, but I realise that all the stalls and restaurants he brought me to need to walk some far distance before reaching.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Can you tell me which large estate has only 3 or few vegetarian stalls?

I totally agree with you they have their meal at home, the main reason is because they know that vegetarian food is diffcult to find.<br>They have their ways to find vegetarian food, thats of course, the main problem is easy or diffcult to find.<br><br><blockquote><strong>To become a vegetarian takes a lot of will and effort.

My place is 1 example, I need to go to town central to have vegetarian food if I am a vegetarian. I got no doubt about their will and effort, we are now discussing about availablity of vegetarian stalls and not on will and effort.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Check with your friends or try asking the people when you reach there for the nearest available vegetarian stall.</strong></blockquote>HAHAHAHAHA, I know you will said that. I tried before already. I can be sure to tell you most people don't know. Even those who live in the estate don't know. You will be surprise people know where is TOTO shop but don't know where is vegetarian stalls. This prove that vegetarian stalls is not common even in housing estate.<br><br><blockquote><strong>This is just something extra, you can ignore it if you think it is unnecessary.
