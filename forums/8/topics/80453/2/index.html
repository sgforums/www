            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I hate to say it because I enjoyed the tension and the emotion of the flick, but the more I think about it, the more it falls apart for me.<br><br>Leaving questions unanswered is fine by me in some instances. And I certainly can make certain logical conclusions when given evidence. But we shouldn't let directors/writers off the hook so easy by allowing them the cop-out of "use your imagination." It's lazy story-telling.<br><br>If you watch the DVD and watch the alternate ending where Jim dies and the women grab the guns, that's a good example of where you don't have all your questions answered, and have to draw your own conclusions. But the soldiers just assuming that the zombies will eventually starve, without ever explaining why they would make this assumption, or why that's exactly what ultimately happened makes little sense to me. </blockquote><blockquote>Ok, I went and saw 28 Days Later for the first time tonight, and it had the alternate ending after the credits. So for those who are curious about the alternate ending, but don't feel like going to the theatre again, I will attempt to explain it to you now. Ok, in the orginal ending, Jim gets shot and Selena (is that the right name?) and Hannah drive off, and then you see flashbacks to some hospital, then Jim wakes up and he is in a bed in the countryside. Well, the alternate ending starts up right after Jim gets shot, then you have the dramatic driving away scene, then we actually see the hospital scene, Hannah frantically pushes Jim down the hall in a stretcher, while Selena tries to find some medical supplies to help him. The girls try to resescatate Jim, as Selena screas something very close to "Live damn you! Live!" But alas, Jim does not come to and dies on the hospital table. Hannah asks Selena "What are we going to do now?" and Selena answers "Keep moving" And the two walk out of the hospital together....fade to black. So, basically they worked in a happy ending and a sad ending. Take your pick.</blockquote>Yo Heng@ : Two - Three Alternative endingS!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

She is trying to get out of the hospital (she works the day shift), but one of the doctors tells her to look for the location of this one patient who had gotten bit in a fight. He ignores her protests, and she trudges over to the Nurses' Station and has a friend of hers look it up. The friend finds out that the names were mixed up, and the guy is in ICU. Ana is confused over this, but passes it off and leaves for her house on Normal Street, Suburbia. On the way home, she hears some brief news bits about how "...is unknown what is going on, but..." and "...us this is not an isolated incident." As she's pulling in, the neighbor's daughter, Vivian (Hannah Lochner) comes up, and we see that they like each other. Ana pulls in and goes inside, where her husband Luis (Justin Louis) is lying on the bed watching TV. Next shot, the two are hot and heavy in the shower while on the TV, the show is interrupted by a special news service bulletin.<br><br>6:37 AM, the next morning...   Blah blah blah<br><br>Everyone else -- Kenneth, Ana, Michael, Terry, Chips, Nicole -- heads for the boat, but at the last second, Michael says he won't come, and shows them a bite he got in the street. Ana pleads with him to come, saying that she can help him, but he says, "Help them." The boat pulls out and we see Michael take out a gun and watch them leave as the screen fades to black.<br><br>We hear a gunshot.<br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">CREDITS<br><br>During the credits we see many 2-3 second clips...<br><br>We hear that Terry is fooling around with some video camera of Steve's he found below deck<br><br>We see a short bit of Steve saying he runs a tight ship while hugging a bikini-clad girl.<br><br>We see Nicole and Terry fooling around.<br><br>We see Ana shaking her head at them.<br><br>We see Kenneth telling Terry to "Get that damn camera out of my face."<br><br>We see a boat floating in the water.<br><br>We see a still living zombie head in a cooler.<br><br>We see giant worms crawling over something.<br><br>We see the island at last coming up to meet them.<br><br>We see the fuel gauge -- it's on empty.<br><br>We see Chips running off into the forest barking.<br><br>We hear Nicole call after him.<br><br>We see our heroes walking with their guns drawn.<br><br>And then...
