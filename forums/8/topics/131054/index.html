            <div class='col-md body'>Today, being a mother's day, I wished every single mother out there a very happy mother's day to you.. This thread is dedicated  for all your hard work.. You worked lots of tough places and many long hours to ensure that your kids could enjoy opportunities you never imagined.. And when you were done working at work, you worked at home..<br><br>For the love, care and concern that you display through the years.. for the time and patience that you nuture the kids and make them what they are today.. for being the pillar of the family, the credit is defintely undoubtly yours..<br><br>To my mum:<br><br>Being a working parent is already hard enough.. nonetheless, you make it a point to be the homemaker too.. you cook for us before you left for work, never a single time did you flinch when the going gets tough.. You were great at making what we liked, and also making us like what you made..  When times were tight, I never knew a dollar stretched so many ways could still taste so good..<br><br>It doesn't matter the food turns cold at night.. It may appear inedible to some, but for sure I know it is cooked out of love.. I can feel it, though at times I really hate the coldness of the food..<br><br>Its for the time when there were ample reasons to count me as a loser, a disappointment.. but NO.. you held onto the notion that I could still do something good.. You just kept hoping and hoping like all great mums do..<br><br>This is also for the time when I took you for granted when I was growing up..<br>I always assumed you'd be there when I needed you... and you always were..<br>But I never really thought about what that meant till I got older and began to realize how often your time and energy were devoted to me..<br><br>As I look back on my life I find myself wondering... Did I remember to thank you<br>for all that you have done for me? For all of the times you were by my side<br>to help me celebrate my successes and accept my defeats?<br><br>Or for teaching me the value of hard work, good judgement, courage, and honesty? I wonder if I've ever thanked you for the simplest things... I hope its not too late as I would like you to know with this special occasion.. Mum thank you.. I hope that you've known all along, how very much you are loved and appreciated.. For the motherly love that you displayed, I wouldn't exchange it for billions and billions of dollar, for you are the greatest mum on earth..<br><br></div>
