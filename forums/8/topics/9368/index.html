            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the recent SMRT reply regarding their reason for taking so long to build an escalator in Novena MRT to help the old folks and their reason for not providing announcements for MRT stops in the four official languages for old folks who may not be fluent in english and being unable to provide free rides for the visually handicapped due to profitablity,i wonder is this what a service provider capable of?To let profits overule common sense when they earn so much,but are unable to even provide a service that will make people think well of the SMRT corporation.It shudders me to think that a major coporation that gives us the MRT is so intend on profits as to overlook the lesser privileged,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Drooling is not to be drooled to the extreme.<br>Burping is not to be done to the extreme.<br>If eating is done to the extreme.<br>Your tummy will bring you to the toilet.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
