            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singapore has to wake up....... especially among youths and those moulding the lives of our youths. Lets face it; no such thing as iron rice bowl or a safe and secure job. not even in MNCs. Nowadays if u happen to be working for someone, chances are you are working with lesser pay and MORE work...  Now despite this I <strong>still hear</strong> people saying, "go to school, study hard, get a degree, get a good job, get good pay and so on... " its time to wake up guys.....  the economy is NEVER going to pick up and be good!!<br><br>a very good living example are my parents. They tell me to "go to school, study hard, get a degree, get a good job, get good pay and so on... " However they themselfs tell me; "times are hard, I have no money and I cant afford this and that"..... my question is, didnt they studied hard when they were my age? ooOOOoooOOoooo... my dad is a multiple degree holder in Law, Science, Business. But he has to fly all over to Taiwan to find a job, earning a meagre 4k <strong>before</strong> taxes, and other deductions.... he could not even find a job in SIngapore!! We live in a condominium for 10 years but are still paying the interests!!<br><br>By following his 'theory' shouldnt he be earning big bucks, fully owning a bungalow, drive a nice car??? and.... perhaps have some prestige in the family?? well my dad sold his car.<br><br>My message goes to all those who are in college, polytechnics, JCs and universities,  how much is your school fees? are you going to waste your time bumming around in school acting like some miss-goody-2-shoes? oh, and by the way its not education you are getting.... Yes. I just said it is not education you are getting but some memory excersice cuz u have to take exams and tests... after which you would have probably forgotten.<br><br>Singaporeans have to think and dream big.......... our school system teaches us exactly the opposite. Want example? "Augustin, wake up your stupid business idea and start attending classes!! diploma is your future!!" wow...... in other words my lecturer was trying to say that i should study harder and later on find a job and work for someone else and shut up........ he just forgottened that times are hard and you might get retrenched....  so what do I do? study even more harder?? Goodness!! when will this stop??<br><br>To cut my story from here, I say that the only way to make it in life is to own your own life.... be your own boss.... people WILL say you are crazy but thats life..... you want success, then take the road less travelled....<br><br>Successfull people dont do different things, they just do things differently.<br><br>Signing off,<br><br>Augustin</div>

My points are...<br><br>1. DO you know how many jobs are out there for soccer players as compared to graduates? No doubt time would change and there'll be fewer jobs... Still... Compared to the jobs for soccer players?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2. Educational system works on a heirchery system.... If you fail to be a MBA, you might end up JC or poly student with diploma and such? In soccer if you can't make it the TOP CREAM... Nobody is likely to want you... Where would you wanna go then?<br><br>3. Education not only provide you with your rice bowl. It also shape you into the person you are. Imagine if you're a BIG SOCCER STAR and you have a totally f*ck up attitude or you're like a PLAIN IDIOT's twin brother.... Ain't gonna get you very far...<br><br>There should be more points I can bring up but pardon me for not in my right frame of mind today....</div>
