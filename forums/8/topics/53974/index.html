Sometimes a degree or a profession qualification is a neccesary, rather than options, dependant on the vocation or industrial norm that u have decided to throw urself into.<br><br>And I agree with u too. It is quite hard, if not impossible to recover back the amount of school fees back within 3 years, given the current job market outlook.<br><br>On the long-term trend however, one may get to enjoy some return from the investment though.<br><br>That is assuming that the individual is a really very lucky person and heaven has been protecting him/her from all the various retrenchments and stuff.</div>
