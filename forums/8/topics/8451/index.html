I get what you mean   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> but since it is a disorder, we cannot really 'blame' them right? It has been a thought that if the person has no control over whatsoever he is doing, the best is to keep the public away from him. He might suffer whatever social stigma, but it is for the own good for the public if u know what I mean.<br><br>Revolution<br>Aversion Therapy which its name implies has to be ongoing to make sure that the patient will be 'under control' through classical conditioning.(This is one method to keep the patient suffering from the disorder from recurrence of the sexual urge.)  However, it all depends on the patient if he wished to carry on with the therapy or not. We cannot coerce any one to go for 'rehabilation' if he has served his sentence in jail. It is all up to the patient to go for any necessary therapy to curb the sexual arousal in him.<br><br>*just imagine u keep having your shoes/briefs or other belongings stolen from a guy suffering from heavy fetish*..shhesshh!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Trinity (edited 25 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read in the ST about a british tabloid who published the name of the registered paedophiles with a claim that every few miles, there lived a paedophile who's a threat to your child.  The tabloid insists that many of the sex crimes solved are done by repeat offenders and that the police haven't done enough to monitor them.<br><br>The police didn't like the move because it has been tested: if these people are alianated they will be driven underground and it's much harder for the police to track them.  They can, for example, move somewhere else and change their names and this is much more dangerous.  Various welfare organizations don't approve of the move as well and beside citing the same reason as given by the police, they state a possibility for innocent persons being listed there.<br><br>------------------<br>All suffering comes from a person's inability to sit still and be alone.</div>

Like I said, for them to do the deed again is more than 70%.

            <div class='col-md body'>From your postings, I gather that you must have done some notable research into this topic. I canÂ’t match your information nor do I wish to do so. My time is only so limited and frankly, psychology and the working of the human mind can only achieve so much. A bit of Freud and Carl perhaps, but nothing more.<br><br>Perhaps you can enlighten me further on this research on paraphilics. Is it proven that there is no cure for it and that appropriate medicine and therapy is not enough to set Â“rightÂ” the patient? I am sure most law agency will take special notice of this fact and most legislators to capitalise on this issue. After all, it is a potential election issue and the fact that the prevailing government in U.K. is not too happy with this recent fiasco on the publishing of the known paedophile shows something, isnÂ’t it?<br><br>As far as I am concerned, this is an infringement into the privacy of the individuals and not to mention, smacks of vigilante too! I will not go into details of what horrendous mistaken identity can wrought. As far as I am concerned, the law is there to take care of offenders like them. If it can be expressively shown that those offenders WILL repeat their deeds and that there is no cure for it, perhaps it will be a good idea to lock them up for good. The thing is, it canÂ’t be proven 100% right? If it is not conclusive, why are we depriving these known paraphilics their chance at reform and cure? By naming them in public, we are effectively condemning them to the unruly crowds and ruining their one chance at rehabilitation.<br><br>Furthermore, this is only a popular measure at curing the problem of child molesters running lose in the neighbourhood and for your information, this will not lessen the danger of the streets. For every known paedophile, there are at least 4 unknown. As Maya has mentioned, there is the problem of them going underground, making it harder for the police to keep track of them.<br><br>Nope, I do not agree in the least bit with those publishers. And if I am one of those convicted, I will sue the paper. And for your information, I detest paedophile. However, it would do well for us not to sway to popular emotions and examine this issue more in depth. This is definitely not the way to solve the problem.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm .. first of all, some psychological disorder can never be cured. i should know because my sister is a schizophrenic. the best we can hope for is for her to continue medication. sexual disorder, i suspect, and shld be quite impossible to cure. most psychologists and psychatriats do not give definite answers to how a patient will behave in the future. who can predict ? i for one will not vouch for their future behaviour. this is one of those very grey areas in society that nobody can step into and whiten or blacken it<br><br>but this is what makes the world such a mysterious and interesting place to live in right? not withstanding the dangers involved of cos<br><br>------------------<br>- i rest my case -</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Hata-San<br>Prevention is better than cure. It is easier to say right now that the righteous being might say, " Be fair to the them, for they might have been cured!"...BUT the dangers of having a relapse is simply so great...that no kids are safe at all. Let me give u a scenerio.<br>"If u know u are a pedophile, and knowing you cannot control sexual urges when u see a kid. Your conscious tells u that u will have to repress your thoughts. However, the libido simply overwealms u, and u decides to do the deed anyway."----So will you still sue the court for actually wanting to identify you in public?Since it is due to an impulse and urge, you cannot blame the authorities for trying to make sure the safety of the kids. Wrong identification of the pedophile? That is a catchy problem. Yes, it might bring distress as well to the mistaken person. But may I know how many ppl in this small island you are living might look like you? Not to say in the same neighbourhood?<br><br>Moose<br>Drugs and therapy..yes it can be supressed...but nevertheless it all depends on the patient himself...how is he going to maintain his so called condition from an outburst? You mentioned that u will keep your kids from strangers but may I know if u are intending to be a house husband, or a baby-sitter? Unless, you want to make it as your full-time job. I really believe that u cannot afford the time to even spend more than 5 hrs with your kid a day.<br><br>Jiliu<br>I dunno what u are trying to drive at. Can you be more explict?</div>

Forgive me for thinking that you sound like Chinese, for they loved to practices this form of indiscriminate justice. To me, that sounds more like frontier justice, which is way back in the 19th century.

They rather the 30% are not harassed rather than pin down the 70%.<br>Beside, I hate to be in those 30% if I am living under your regime, dear Maya<br><br>"We do not have to visit a madhouse to find disordered minds; our planet is the mental institution of the universe." --Johann von Goethe<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Trinity,<br><br>I hate to generalise down here but I wish the government here would publish the names and pictures of all those known drug addicts and kleptomaniacs. After all, they are known to relapse into their vices and mental vertigo, thus posing such huge danger to my kids and silver wares. Nope, we, in clean Singapore, would have none to do with it. Come to think of it, wouldnÂ’t it be simply smashing to lock them for good or banish them to some Riau islands? After all, nothing matters as much as the safety of our children. Yes sir, these kids of mine are entitled to their peaceful sanctuary in the neighbourhood and woe betide any ex-deviants with the potential for relapse!<br><br>Sorry for deviating (puns fully intended) from the main thrust of argument. What I want to point out is that the law is sufficient to deal with these offenders. Should the public feels that it is insufficient, they should raise this matter up with their legislators and let the law be amended. It would seriously show the decay in society when civilians feel that it is perfectly fine to lynch a person in public, his crime not withstanding. And those publishers are infringing on those simple principles of privacy by encouraging these forms of behaviour.<br><br>Simply put, paedophile is a heinous in the society. It not surprising that people is resorting to such draconian methods in dealing with them. However, this is a very fine line to thread. Trinity, you mentioned that there is treatment for this form of behaviour, depending on the willingness of the patient. Should he choose to accept the medical treatment and reside in a peaceful neighbourhood to recuperate, do you think this is reflected in the policeÂ’s record? Which, ironically, is the place where those publishers got their pictures?<br><br>There are too many wrongs, which can arise from this Â“rightÂ” tactic of dealing with known paedophile. Being a Liberal myself, I would rather err on the side of the individual. And to think this is happening in the country that gives the world Mills.<br><br>"We do not have to visit a madhouse to find disordered minds; our planet is the mental institution of the universe." --Johann von Goethe<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
