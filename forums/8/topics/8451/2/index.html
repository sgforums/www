            <div class='col-md body'>Mr. Hata San, I never said that Chinese is all bad!  :p<br>I don't believe that libertÃ© is practiced anywhere, as a government PR official properly put it in the ST, "things will never get done if we have to listen all the time to some vocal minorities" (I swear i've seen this quote in the ST forums page).<br><br>We are not babies, even though some things may seem deceptively trivial (like not reporting your change of address) I believe people know that paedophilia is a serious crime, especially in places like USA, many of European countries and Singapore.  If they have decided to break it the first time around, it has to be either their urge is too big for them to handle or that they are not that afraid of the punishment.  Whatever it is they have done it and they have to, well, pay for it.  Say if instead of saying that they have done their time, goodbye, why don't we extend the penalty as you do your time, you go for theraphy until you are cleared by 5 doctors or we have to place an electronic tag on you so we at least won't suspect that you are somewhere doing something while in fact you are someplace else doing something else.<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Maya,<br><br>Actually, I was the one insinuating that the Chinese is a materialistic race and more. Got to know some Â“brilliantÂ” insight into the behaviour and characteristic of Chinese on the whole from a essay written by a man who obviously got too much time on his hand. Anyway, back to the topic at hand.<br><br>True, to keep to the original spirit of Â“liberteÂ” as proclaimed by the French Revolution is perhaps no mean feat but we do aspire to it donÂ’t we? Beside, I wasnÂ’t thinking about Singapore when I make that remark, rather, it was the place that house Terence and Prodigal. I rather liked your suggestion of a more comprehensive rehabilitation program catered to this class of offenders. The idea of electronic tagging is more widely practised nowadays by prison service and it is worth trying out this. As for publishing their pictures and names, this just smacks of sensationalism to me.<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>
