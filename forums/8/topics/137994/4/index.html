            <div class='col-md body'>There is a saying: The best way to save is to spend wisely.<br><br>In fact, spending money is a skill in itself, which unfortunately, many people have not mastered (Me included). I have read articles about millionaires in the US, and found out that many of them bought a used car instead of a brand new car; and lived in terrace houses instead of bungalows (Note: Terrace houses in USA is almost similar to HDB flats in Singapore).<br><br>The most important thing is to live below your means. Of coz, some may think that people might look down on you should you not pursue the "high" life, but think deeper, when you are in debt, down and out, who will care about you? Therefore, I believe that, as mature adults, most of us are able to guage how much savings we need, it all depends on willpower.<br><br>This reminds of another saying: We often spend the money we have not earned, only to impress those people we do not care about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've got an advice on how to live a simple life......<br><br>You just have to appreciate the finer things in life.....Basically, ur emotional and spiritual well-being....if u've taken care of these, u definitely won't feel any 'poverty stress' kinda feeling, no matter how little u spend and how simple ur lifestyle is.<br><br>Like, if u go out to fancy restaurants to 'feel something' and 'get something' out of it, actually when u are content emotionally and spiritually, even when u eat at home with simple food, u will 'feel' and 'get' something much better, and ur whole consciousness seem to be filled with calm joy and satiety. In this case, it doesn't matter at all that u didn't go to the fancy restaurant. Instead, u probably wouldn't feel like going.<br><br>Sometimes when u see around u......in life.......New parents, they become so happy, stay at home alot, play with the baby, caring the baby......Do u see them change a lot? Coz now they 'see' and 'experience more' of their emotional/ spiritual side.<br><br>And me too....personally I've got the same experiece.....just not exactly with a baby, but something similar, which made me change my view of life.<br><br>U just take care and invest/ build up on ur emotional n spiritual well-being, instead of 'focusing' so much on the material well-being. And when u reach a point, u will feel so contended, a simple lifestyle or a flashy lifestyle is not that important to u anymore.</div>

Also,dont grab up credit cards immediately when u start working,and spend more than u earn otherwise u see that u end up owning the banks money,18% p.a is not a joking matter.<br><br>Have dinner at home is the best,having home cooked by parents are still the best.
