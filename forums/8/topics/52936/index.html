            <div class='col-md body'>Think of getting darker but confused with so many products on the mkt.Anyone can enlighten me on this. See so many products, some sun screen, some sun block. Noticed that most of those products that have low SPF ( 4 - 8 ) promotes tanning. Does it means that if u use those much higher kind of around SPF 30, then u will not get any tan ?<br><br>Just a additonal note that i dun tan easily and most of the time, i just turn red or maybe a bit tanner but after awhile,i will return to my previous skin tone.Previously when i was in Secondary school, use to play under the hot sun in the afternoon for around 4-5 hrs almost everyday but after 4 yrs of such conditions, my skin has hardly got any change in skin tone.This is the same after going thru Army as a combat fit personal for the full 2 1/2 years.Does it means that i will nvr be able to get tanned?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well problem is that i m too freaking fair, even fairer than most girls around in singapore.Look too strange for a guy. And the thing is i know i can get some tan cos of the tan lines i used to get when participating actively in sports previously, just that it take a much much longer time.<br><br>So would like to get comments here on is there any way to tan faster and let it be a more permanent one from appropriate use of good tanning lotions apart from spending tons of hrs under the sun.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe i have the same type of skin as u<br>if u will get sun burnt easily, buy bananaboat yellow spf 4 or light greenish blue spf 8. the latter 1 not so effective in tanning but better in protecting. if u wanna get a damn good tan, use the red spf 0. it's good but possible of sun burn if sun damn strong. so far my preferred choice is spf 4, no sun burn with it b4.<br><br>FYI, my tan lasts on me minimum 2 weeks and max 1 month, slowly fading in the process. each tanning session i go 4 is 2hrs of strong sun +- 10-30mins of passing clouds(i.e. not much sun).<br><br>if u wanna change your skin as in make it more sun lasting, it is possible if u tan regularly.</div>

Well as u have mention spf 0 - 8 is good for tanning, so does it means that if i go for prolong activities under the sun and i need more protection, then if i use those like spf above 20 kind, it will almost be useless in term of getting a tan ? Lastly if r are able to give any comment, is there any difference between those spf 4 oil like tanning liquid and those spf 4 cream lotion kind ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm thinking back, used to spend almost the whole afternoon after school in the hot sun. Nvr really remember getting any sun burn during those times or when in NS, guess i should get a spf 4 to try on first. Well thx for your info.</div>
