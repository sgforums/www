            <div class='col-md body'>"Girl from Ipanema" is by Antonio Carlos Jobim. Most of his songs have the sound and feel of "Girl from Ipanema". Perhaps you might want to check out his album.<br><br>"Take Five" is by Dave Brubeck and it's not a typical 4/4 type of jazz music cos it's counted in 5/4 so that's why it feels different and sounds good.<br><br>If you would like to explore jazz music further, you can check out John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker and Stan Getz (He is the saxophonist on "Girl from Ipanema"). Most jazz musicians and even beginners listen to them for inspiration.<br><br>Hope this helps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nice to see someone who knows jazz, happyface! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I'd say that the style of "Girl from Ipanema" is carried through more in Astrud Gilberto's style than in Jobim's, though.  For Gilberto (Astrud and her husband Joao), try "Aguas De Marco" and "Agua De Bebe".  Baden Powell is also good, especially in the case of "Deve Ser Amour" (although Slavia Grigorian's jazzed-up version is also fantastic).  For later stuff with Latin influences, you might want to try Matt Bianco and even some of Sadao Watanabe's stuff - he played with Stan Getz and the influence shows in some tracks.<br><br>|_|_|, Dave Brubeck's style falls under the general category of Cool Jazz - it was a US West Coast response to the Bebop style in New York in the 60s.  I'd go with happyface's recommendation of Miles and Coltrane (check out the Miles Davis quartet).  Along those lines, also try Gerry Mulligan, Bill Evans, Wes Montgomery, Oscar Peterson, early Wynton Marsalis, and definitely check Chet Baker out - IMHO, he blows Miles out of the water (pardon the pun! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).  However, the nature of Cool Jazz is such that you might have a few good musicians who were one-hit wonders like Mark Murphy ("This Could Be the Start of Something Big" ), so keep an eye out for what fans say.<br><br>From that point, you might want to try something more on the bluesy side - try Ray Brown (double bass) and you can't go past Sonny Criss' horn.<br><br>For later stuff, you could try jazz guitarists like Lee Ritenour, Stanley Clarke, Earl Klugh, George Benson or even Jonathan Butler (although strictly speaking he's more R&amp;B), vocalists like Al Jarreau and Chuck Mangione on trumpet.  Fusion's not bad either - there you've got bands like Spyro Gyra, Casiopea, Yellowjackets, but I'd recommend Mezzoforte for starters.  You could also try acid jazz and funk, even though it departs from what you're talking about quite a bit - Brand New Heavies and Incognito are good starters.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, happyface - I first got into jazz in 1984 and I haven't stopped since.<br><br>For me, it's a matter of mood.  Most of the time, it's either fusion or latin, and cool jazz is for chilling out in the evenings.  I really do have to be in the mood for acid jazz.  The first jazz stuff I heard was by Matt Bianco and Basia, and every once in a while I dig it out.<br><br>Live stuff is good too.  I used to hang out at a jazz club in Melbourne called Dizzy's.  The owners play jazz themselves and they get some good bands and artists there - watching a 17-piece band play was amazing.  I caught Mezzoforte when they came to Singapore in 1994 (I think).  Their bass player Johann Asmundsson was this huge bugger, and the bass guitar looked like a ukelele in his hands, but that guy could play.  So could Eythor Gunnarsson, their keyboardist - for the whole gig he was playing with a cigarette in his mouth, and he couldn't see anything.  It's a pity that Jeremy Monterio isn't performing anymore - he was brilliant to watch on the keyboard.<br><br>I haven't checked out Michael Brecker's stuff yet - I'll have to do that one of these days. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do you like something like Louis Armstrong or do you wanna jump right into the new stuff -- how about the '50's and '60's? Everyone is different, so the type of songs will depend a lot on your musical taste. There's a lot of great jazz music out there so its too many to recommend. Take your time and have fun exploring the world of Jazz, its definitely worth it... For me i'll recommend sax player scott hamilton for a romantic moment with your love one. Smooth jazz artiste such as kirk whalum, kim water, rick braun, walter beasley, boney james, dave koz, Pat metheny, four play are best while listening during driving or on the road... *<strong>Highly recommended songs---&gt; Peaceful Hideaway by Kirk Whalum, Answer Me (My Love)Â” by scott hamilton  After listening to "Answer Me (My Love)Â”, it prove once again that Scott Hamilton is one of the most melodic saxophone balladeers in jazz!! . *Highly recommended album----&gt; All albums by scott hamilton and stan getz....</strong>* <strong>All are my personal views, doesn't mean it appeal to u. Choosing jazz music is like choosing wife.

            <div class='col-md body'>Read from CNN today that Norah Jones' new album sold 1 million copies in a week! Wow!<br><br>Actually listening to Norah Jones is also a great way to start off with jazz for beginners although some of her tunes are a bit country /folksy sound like.<br><br>Pat Metheny is really cool. Let's not forgot the piano guys like Monk (no...not the detective on TV <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> )!<br><br>Oh yes...I just found out that Jeremy is still playing. He just finished a gig with Bobby McFerrin in Esplanade.<br><br>Btw, anyone know of any big jazz acts coming to Spore in 2004? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're right Gedanken, Thelonious is a bit too heavy for beginners. Hope they will graduate to listening to him soon! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Say, did you know that Thelonious monk has a son, Thelonious Monk Jr,  who plays the drum? But I guess he didn't really made it big like his dad...<br><br>Speaking of drummers, I was so shocked to hear the passing of our local drummer Edmond Branson. It really is a great loss to an already small jazz community here. Sigh. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm what abt some vocal jazz like chet baker, ella, bennet, hartman etc would be nice. Personally feel tat michael bubles n norah jones not tat jazzy n appealing. Today while browsing thru the Straits Time, notice JAZZ AT THE BEACH in Sentosa, wonder if its performance is free... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
