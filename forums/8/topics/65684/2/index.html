But I guess he didn't really made it big like his dad...<br><br>Speaking of drummers, I was so shocked to hear the passing of our local drummer Edmond Branson. It really is a great loss to an already small jazz community here.

Funny thing about Bennett - he always claimed that he was not a jazz singer and Sinatra called him "the world's greatest non-jazz jazz singer".<br><br>Ogbunwezeh, you keep reminding me of how bad my memory is - i forgot about Tuck &amp; Patti! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes! I remembered the Jazz festival in Suntec! It was fantastic! I guess SIA hasn't been doing too well lately so maybe the festival was axed until further notice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>I saw Tuck and Patti last year when they performed at the University Cultural Centre (UCC). Great singing and guitar virtuosity! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>When it comes to jazz singer, Ella is my all time favourite! Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughn are cool too! Johnny Hartman can melt any girls heart when he sings! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But I guess I'm still more of a horn man...Miles and Coltrane anytime!

            <div class='col-md body'>Romantic stuff?  First name that comes to mind is Nat King Cole.  Oscar Peterson does good stuff too.<br><br>I think it's more of a question of the song than the artist.  For example, I haven't yet heard a version of "My Foolish Heart" that doesn't clearly fit the romantic bill.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow i'm pleasantly surprised to see that my topic so long ago has so many replies now. Thank u all for ur valuable suggestions and recommendations! There are so many that i barely have enough time to go look for them all. Haha! Anyway recently watch American Idol 3 and a song called 'what you won't do for love' sung by one of the contestants caught my attention. Do the experts here know of any similar-styled songs which u can recommend? recently i also heard some live jazz performances of a jazz singer called 'maya nova' (dunno the spelling) on 96.3FM. They sounded really good too! Hmmm which local radio station still play jazz anyway? i only know of passion99.5 which had closed dwn since. Quite a pity.... Looking forward to all your replies! Thanks very much again!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't watch American Idol, but if I've got the right song in mind, it's originally by Bobby Caldwell (1979), although Go West made an excellent cover of it in 1992.<br><br>It's much more in the 1970's pop category than jazz.  However, along these lines, try:<br><br>- Player: "Baby Come Back"<br>- Young Rascals: "Groovin' (On a Sunday Afternoon)"<br>- Gino Vanelli: "I Just Wanna stop"<br>- England Dan and John Ford Coley: "I'd Really Love to See You Tonight"<br>- Stephen Bishop: "On and On"<br>- Neil Sedaka: "Laughter in the Rain"<br>- anything by Hall and Oates in the 1970's</div>
