Things get cheaper when they're higher which means shops selling at the upper floors are usually cheaper. If you want something cheap, avoid the shops which if full of ang mohs or shops the the 1st lvl because the price is higher but very cheap for tourist. I noe some shops who like to put high prices; they got also say they sell even cheaper than others and say that they're bing discriminated my other shops WTF. Avoind backlane shops, but if you're lucky you can get something cheap from there but its not common(i came across a few before while looking for a graphics card). If ou noe someone from the shop even better, get discount, lyk me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Basically i know that many shops way of doing business is they tell their salesman the " selling price " of the particular product , then how much their salesman quote to their customer , they don't care as it may be deemed as their " commission " for selling the product . So the higher the salesman quote to the customer and made a successfull sale , the more their " commission " in their pockets . Even when you buy cdr from certains shops you will also encounter such tactics and usually are those product without price tags , so that they can flunctuate their prices base on their judgement on their customers . Once they see you and consider you as a " carrot " they will chop mercilessly to fill their own pockets .</div>

So the higher the salesman quote to the customer and made a successfull sale , the more their " commission " in their pockets . Even when you buy cdr from certains shops you will also encounter such tactics and usually are those product without price tags , so that they can flunctuate their prices base on their judgement on their customers . Once they see you and consider you as a " carrot " they will chop mercilessly to fill their own pockets .</div></blockquote>no the pay is by hourly rate or count by whole day one...extra charges go straight into the cash register and to the boss<br>unless the staff is family member of the boss..</div>
