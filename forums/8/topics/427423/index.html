              <p>Go before the lunch hours and before dinner time. Your chances of getting a successful price cut is higher.</p>
              <p>Play with their feelings. Ask tons of questions about the product that you wanna buy. Then leave. Come back to them 10 minutes later.. :-D and then leave.. come back to them 15 minutes later. and..... tada! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>Best thing is know what kind of price you wanna pay and stick to it. Do some research first if you have to. Shopkeepers giving condescending looks when you bargain is an ancient trick....evergreen perhaps lol.</p>
              <p>Or best thing, stay away. I have seen those semi formal shirts at queensway being sold for $40-50. I inspected the quality of the the threadwork and found it's substandard. No point bargaining so I never went back again.</p>

              <p>This works...</p>
              <p>from : <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/76760">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/76760</a></p>
              <div class="KonaBody">
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you learn only one negotiating technique, learn to flinch. The rule is: Never accept the first offer. Any decent opponent will ask for more than they expect to receive, and you have to disabuse them of this notion. After all, the more eager you are, the more the other side will push; the more indifferent you seem, the more your opponent will concede.</p>
              <p>You can flinch big or flinch small. Whether it's laughter or a subtle smirk, the important thing is that you react quickly and negatively to your opponent's first offer. Even if it's unbelievably generous, haggle--or at least grumble. And keep your glee to yourself. To professional deal-makers, the flinch must become second nature.</p>
              <p>For example, there once was an attorney representing two entrepreneurs who made their hobby into a multimillion-dollar <a id="KonaLink0" class="kLink" style="position: static; text-decoration: underline !important;" href="#"><span style="color: green;"><span class="kLink" style="border-bottom: green 1px solid; position: relative; background-color: transparent; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: green !important; font-size: 14px; font-weight: 400;">business</span></span></a>. When it came time to harvest their company, they met their lawyer and fixed a selling price. An offer came--twice what they had hoped for! But their lawyer, in his excitement, accepted immediately. Had he flinched, he would have made a better deal. After all, his clients had a different number in mind!</p>

              <p>There is not really a point for bargaining....</p>
              <p>Places where bargaining are allowed, storekeepers just increase the prices up higher to compensate, so make it seem as tho as discount is given when they reduce the price from your "bargain".....</p>
              <p>Maybe i am wrong, but this is a forum, just throwing my thoughts out here haha</p>

              <p>Bargaining goods are alway at the losing end, going to shop with a fix price is the best, it is more or less standardised, even if you will to lose, you dun lose much.</p>
              <p>As for T/jersey, becareful, my ex bf once wanted a chelsea T, addidas, $120, no bargain, later walk away, the shop indian seller said $110, my ex said $90, later they settle at $85, the indian went in and take a new one, my ex was happy with it, I look at it, addidas made in Thailand, but the one on show is made in Germany, so we insist for the made in Germany one, he said that one no discount. That is one of the problem with bargain goods. Becareful</p>
