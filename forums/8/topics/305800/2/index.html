              <p>And why should you be confused? Just because some radicals believe in some supposedly new law in their religion, it does not mean all religions must believe in that law. There are indeed many religions and beliefs out there, just because one of them believed that God is actually an alien from another universe, it does not mean you have to believe in it. The Talibans believe that it is against God to depict life forms in art, that does not mean it is true.</p>

              <p><br>Not what the Talibans believe, they are based on the religious book. So if they are based on the book, is it really true ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes there are many many religions out there. but is it logical if the religion law saying this and that without a good reason?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I never say i believe in God neither i dont believe in God. Cuz this question i dont have the answer and by that i wont be able to answer that question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its not new law in religion law.. its that the government implemented the religion law based on what is written in the book.</p>

              <p>If you are mentioning Islam, please understand, like other religions, there are different sects, be it deviant or purging from Mainstream. All religions have different sects/branches/doctrines. Wanna imply Islam as being a single dogma would be wrong because Taliban being situated in Pakistan mostly belong to Shi'ite / Smaili Muslims or Ahmaddiya sects.. Both being frowned by Muftis (religious head) of mainstream Islam all over the world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cutting of hands, hanging for adultery, cutting of tongues for lying.. Have u seen it happen here? Perhaps the only few countries practising it have to Iran and Iraq where they are the only few countries having a stronghold of Shi'ite Muslims. And like i said, Shi'ite is a deviant branch of Mainstream Islam. They doctrines and dogma are as different as apple and oranges with the mainstream though they worship the same One and follow the five pillars as per normal. The ways they perform differ tremendously. This is called Tarekat. An extreme display will be self flagging themselves with machetes to signify how one of Prophet Muhammad's (pbuh) acquaintances died in battle in the day of the Ashura.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You do not see this day in Singapore because like most of the world, mainstream Islam is preached and practiced. And by not reading up facts about Islam, you are simply stirring up religious collision and perhaps, tarnish and smear the good name of mainstream Islam (Sunni Islam).</p>

              <p>yeap i agree Iran or other country are a bit extreme on following the religion rules. Nothing bout insulting the religion or the God. Iraqi are just too extreme.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It doesnt happened in Malaysia too bout cutting hands. Different country different view. While destroying any drawing in Iran, it doesnt happened in Malaysia or any other Muslim countries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least i understand how ppl can perform a tremendous different way of following the religious law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All religions are good, it always depend on how ppl wan to follow the religion way.</p>

              There are many holy books out there, the Quran, Bible, Sutras, etc.  Just because they are written, it does not mean they are the truth.  The Muslims will say Quran is the truth, the Christians will say, the Bible.  And the Scientologists believed in the writing of the science fiction writer, Ron Hubbard, but that does not mean their beliefs have to be true. It is up to each individual to decide which religion he or she think is the truth.  Of course, you can decide too that all religions are wrong and chose to be an atheist or create your own religion.
              
              The Talibans chose to believe in the "new Law" written in the whatever book which was discovered (I did not watch the documentary), so it became one of their beliefs, but it does not mean it has to be true.
              
              From what you have written, you are probably an Agnostic...someone who is undecided whether there is a God or not because to you, the existence of God cannot be proven or disproven.

              <p>If i want to believe in God..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i will say there is only one God and only God, no names. IMO, theres not as many Gods as we have today.. Everyone seems to insist that there are no God than their God. Somehow im amazed by how ppl assumed it that way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somehow i doubt if anyone from the past misunderstood some of the teaching and implement the new one themself which makes todays religion laws.. stil no answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Aiyah, for me, anyone can follow the religion law except if its too extreme. It is only my opinion nia. Not meant to insult any extreme religious followers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are rooms for God in my heart and there are also room for not believing in God.. It always changed.</p>
