            <div class='col-md body'>Don't just boycott them. Write in and complain about genuine cases of bad service.<br><br>So let them know, you might find that it is worth your while. I was once given a voucher for inflight sales because the entertainment system wasn't working on my seat. Another time, they have to upgrade me to first class because the food I ordered wasn't given to me!<br><br>I don't have a problem with most airlines but there are always isolated cases of bad service. SQ isn't so bad in overall comparsion.<br><br>But I discourage boarding the flight with a chip on your shoulder, looking for some imaginary fault. I have seen a local chap trying to peep into the top of the SQ gal every time she serves him, no wonder she was reluctant to do so!<br><br>There are much worst airlines, imagine yourself in a UA or NW flight, being served by grandma! Or Varig (Brazilian National Airlines) that serves soup before take off and didn't bother to collect it during take off! Imagine the poor bast**ds that didn't finish the hot soup on time (I was one of them)<br><br>Anyway, flying about 120 thousand miles a year, I still find SQ and Emirates the best overall airlines in business &amp; coach class.</div>

Where ever you go and whatever you will do you will find inequalities.  Most people learn to get over it.  HAve you ever flown BA or Quantas or Lufthansa (sp?)  I guess not by your above mail, they are 20 times worse than anything you may have or ever will experience with SIA.  Just becuase you have received one bad experience doesnt mean that you should boycot the Airline.<br>If you go by the methology in every day life you will end up boycoting everything, as you will receive poor customer service just about anywhere, so good luck in life</div>

I've flown all 3 and can tell you Quantas regarless of your nationality or class do thier best to make you happy and they are ang mohs for crying out loud. Its only in sg that you get dicriminated by your own national airline.<br><br>SIA standards are further more dropping and this was said by air stewards who served 30 years ago.<br><br>SIA for all it money spent on technology and other rubbish should take a look at Thai airways. Thai airways may not boast of all the features SIA has but regardless whether you'r in economy or business they treat you like king the moment you board till you get off.<br></div>
