            <div class='col-md body'>Come back from oversea last week, taking SIA the first time in my life. To my surprise, i'm treated differently from the foreigners in the cabin. Request for fish n the air stewardess told me tat no fish but a japanese behind me ask the stewardess for fish instantly the reply is "YES WE HAVE IT", wat the f uck is this?? Some more i ask for blanket first, in stead the stewardess give it to the caucasian first in stead of me, some more cover for him, wat the f uck is this?? Why singapore customer service ppl always wanna be a dog to foreigners n treat local singaporean unfairly. Aren't we all the same, we all fork out the same amount of money for the service.<br><br>SIA is famous for their service but i think its only famous to foreigners only. As a local, I am treated as a second class or rather lower class customer. We fork out the same amount of money compare to the foreigner but we r treated differently from them, is this call customer service?? Tats mean my hard earn money is nothing compare to those Japanese n Caucasian??<br><br>Rather take budget airline next time, save money n most importantly everyone is equal inside regardless of race n colours of skin.</div>

They are warmer and much more attentive. They tend to be much more flexible as well. </div></blockquote>Sorry, but for very good reasons, don't mind if I avoid referring anymore to SIA.<br><br>This leaves me only able to make comments on TG.  The below is NOT a comparison between TG and any other airlines.<br><br>Pros of flying TG:<br>- Service is genuinely friendly, humble and not robotic.<br>- On a bad service flight, everyone gets bad service (not just a selected few).<br>- Cheaper.<br>- Not too bad safety record on international flights.<br>- Should a plane crash, its not easy to cover up due to Thailand's free media.<br>- They're not strongly politically backed and don't sue if you say anything bad.<br>- Have to transit in Bangkok first to get anywhere (which give me time for some Thai massage). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cons of flying TG:<br>- Service is not as efficient.<br>- If your plane crashes, compensation may be lower than from richer airlines.<br>- Planes are not as modern, no entertainment systems in J class.<br>- Have to transit in Bangkok first to get anywhere else (waste time).<br><br></div>
