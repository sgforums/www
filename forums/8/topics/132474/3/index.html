In general Asian airlines are better, they pamper their passengers more.  I've flown Scandinavian Airlines on few occassions - they have your grandmother as stewardess and they are really curt and just do their jobs, period.<br><br>Within Asia I fly very frequently, always with SIA, just once/twice with TG.  I must say that TG is just symbolic of the Thai people - genuinely good service and manners.  SIA is a little too polished perhaps, but hey that's professionalism for you.  But I never ever had a bad experience with SIA, cretainly not discriminatory ones - maybe they know I'm a PPS member.<br><br>Once an SIA stewardess spilled orange juice over my shoulders.  Maybe that something  out of routine that wasn't taught properly at SIA school, but she was so "kalang kabo" and just kept uttering "sorry, sorry, sorry".  It took a steward to come in and coolly took over the situation - apologising, getting tissues to clean my shirt, checking back to see whether there are any stains, and finally giving me a USD 25 voucher for in-flight duty-free purchases.  Now that's what I call good service.<br><br>Whatever it is, I still think SIA is fantastic, with maybe the occassional black sheep that you will find anywhere.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have heard similar incidents from my friends as well regarding the different treatment in SIA.. Sad to say, it makes us feel that SIA is an airline for foreigners even though it states SINGAPORE International Airlines..<br><br>So far I have taken Thai, MAS and China Eastern.. Agree with you guys that the service from Thai Airways is great.. MAS is great too, even towards their own people.. China Eastern, eh... Not too good in my opinion.. They seem a little lazy to serve..<br><br>But coming back again, regarding the comments, I feel that its up to the individual.. I believe that there are still air stewardess who are good and professional.. Just that it is fewer than some of other airlines I guess.</div>
