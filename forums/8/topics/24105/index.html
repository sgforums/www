            <div class='col-md body'>There has been a recent spat of incidents involving the US army in numerous international cases.<br><br>The latest accident occured here in our own backyard when a 41-yr-old aircraft engineer was killed due to flying debris  from 2 colliding helicopters at the paya lebar air base.<br><br>It would seem, based on the circumstances, that once again those responsible are gonna be let off with merely a slap on the wrist and the whole incident written off as a freak accident. Our armed forces will subsequently review the air base safety standards etc etc. Typical Sinagporean style - just to show everyone that action is being taken. Once again, because of their "international police" status, they are exempted from punitive action and let off faster then the parents of the victim can stop greiving.<br><br>It wasn't too long ago that US army servicemen were killed in a training accident in the former Teleban state, again involving Chinhooks. Similarly, there was a recent mix-up in intelligence that prompted US officials to mistake a wedding procession for armed terrorists and resulted in the innocent deaths of numerous well-wishers at the ceremony. Who's gonna take responsibility for that?<br><br>Is it any wonder why ppl in their own countries curse and swear at americans in uniforms. Is it any wonder why George W Bush is playing punk and refusing to accede to UN international ruiling unless the US forces are given immunity from local law enforcement agencies in the various countries they "visit"?<br><br>An exemption from a country's justice system makes them above the law. The question is have they earned that right?<br><br>We all know the ans to that.<br></div>

We did not implore them to be our guardians. They volunteered because it's in their interest. They have their own investments and US-based companies in various parts of the world and these need some form of protection, especially since 911.<br><br>We dun condone errant law enforcement agencies who clean up the streets during office hours and have dirty dealings thereafter. Same here. If the US wants to keep their presence in the region or anywhere for that matter, they shd not be conferred preferential treatment. They shd not hold the UN to ransom for demands of exemption from international law. Okinawa was a clear example of how they tried to strongarm japanese law enforcement against extradition. Thankfully justice prevailed.<br><br>Unless u dun mind peacekeepers who police the streets in the day and then loot the place at nite and get away scot free.</div>

Why? Because JapanÂ’s weapons are mostly brought from America.<br>The worldÂ’s largest suppliers of arms is America.<br>They control who gets what in their so-called arms balance.<br>Thailand gets the F-16 without the LRM such as AIM-9.<br>ItÂ’s like having a water-gun without water to shoot people at and the only way to is to use the gun to hit the person you want to hitÂ…<br>It is a matter of time China becomes a superpower also.<br>Till them, we will have to make do with BIG brother USA out of lack of choices.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No doubt US do act as a bully and in it's own interest, the bottom line is that many weaker countries still need to depend on it to deter any agressor. When those rogue nations starts invading other countries, they do'nt give a damn whether its a holy day or not, whether how many people are killed, or whether any human rights are infringed. What happen in Iraqi and the Kurdish are a good example that not all muslims are brothers. It is good to note that at least the action of the US troops can been scrutinized by the world. Try telling Saddam that his Iraqi jet fighter has dropped a bomb in a residential area. He'll probably laugh.</div>

Where i come from there are no bad opinions, only objective ones.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Have you ever lived amongst them? Did you know that there is no such race as the American race?

When they did, they were called busybodies once the war ended..</strong></blockquote>Were they? This is news to me. I happen to be a big fan of WW2. If anyone did condemn US for being busybodies, i can assure u it wasn't the majority of the allies. If anything, they were hailed as saviours especially after the island-hopping campaign in which they almost single-handedly beat the japs at their own game.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If you dislike the Americans so much you have to dislike the Chinese (as you are probably one) and pretty much every race in the world.

Why shd one party be linked to another? Pure hatred? I have none of that. And by the way, henry ford may have invented the car but ford isn't the only car producing firm in the world...neither is boeing. U seem to love digging up every niche where the US have excelled and toss them at me. Where are all these related to the discussion at hand?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Did you ever praise them for their efforts and contributions? Do you think you'd like to be talked about in this way?.</strong></blockquote>Did i ever condemn them for everything they did wrong? The one does not mean the other. Get that straight.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I also seem to remember that a lot of Singaporeans expressed indignance when the SIA pilots involved in the Taiwan crash were detained and almost prosecuted. Would you complain if the pilots were US marines instead? Were you at the scene of the incident or possess enough technical knowledge to accurately reconstruct the entire event?.</strong></blockquote>Before u get too indignant, let me remind u that as a pilot, u are handed the lives of passengers. But when an accident at an airport is the result of a combination of errors, surely prosecution becomes questionable?<br><br>That is in stark contrast to marines based on foreign soil and raping a local....think abt whether that is excusable.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If you can't achieve as much as them, try to do better. Don't attempt to increase your self esteem by talking them down to your own level..</strong></blockquote>I've heard this time and again, and i will respond as b4: U speak like u have achieved a big deal to talk down on me. In this forum, ppl raise issues under cover of anonymity for discussion purposes. If u can't stomach criticism even when it's not directed at u, please feel free to flame. But dun expect to be taken seriously when all u've got is accusing ppl of raising "self-esteem" over constructive remarks.<br><br>ppl are always remembered for their faults, seldom for their achievements. That is something u shd know by now. When was the last time u praised SMRT for the smooth running of their trains instead of cursing them over the occasional technical delays?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Remember, they are made up of the world's people. If you insult them you are inevitably insulting yourself in the end.</strong></blockquote>It is criticism or insults? Think carefully b4 u choose ur words. Personally i welcome constructive criticism and have nothing against u. However i feel ur flaming is rather misguided.</div>

Conflicts and hot spots can be found in almost every part of the world like the korean peninsular, the middle east, eastern europe. For your info, singapore may not be a weaker country, but it is "strong" partly because of the teachnological hardware made available to it by the US. Even with these arsenal, it still depends on her for military support. That is why singapore is so keen in getting her "good books" by offering harbour and airstrip for uncle sam. Our leaders are'nt doing these for fun.<br><br>It's naive to imagine that only malaysia is an agressor. In the worst scenario, it could be our surrounding neighbours.<br><br>It is finally clear to me why our minister said our generation is a generation of consumers. We live on the fruits grown by our forefathers. We take peace and riches for granted and am ignorant of the complexities of the outside world.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rudyiskandar:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm afraid your knowledge of the world politics is very limited. Conflicts and hot spots can be found in almost every part of the world like the korean peninsular, the middle east, eastern europe. For your info, singapore may not be a weaker country, but it is "strong" partly because of the teachnological hardware made available to it by the US. Even with these arsenal, it still depends on her for military support. That is why singapore is so keen in getting her "good books" by offering harbour and airstrip for uncle sam. Our leaders are'nt doing these for fun.<br></div></blockquote>that explains why the korean graduates are reducing american flag to ashes and also the explicitly displayed of hatred towards the ameris."We want them outta our country". over here, thats the reason why i said singapore government is weak, they cant stand on it own, gotta need a standing pole and also in which it compels the next generation youth to lick the boot of the ameris.<br><blockquote><strong><br>It's naive to imagine that only malaysia is an agressor. In the worst scenario, it could be our surrounding neighbours.<br></strong></blockquote>can say which neighbouring countries that u had mentioned that have a concrete economic to substain a war and a full-scale incusion of singapore? indonesia, vietnam or maybe thailand or even the philippines? do you know something? waging war dont just depends on military strength alone, how about the expenses of the army and intrinsic need to subtain the larger population after the conquest. you dont just win the war, remove the goverment and install your in the authorities. one reason for the collapse of the japanese during WW2 is because they cant cope with the steep ascend in the population of the newly-gain empires.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It is finally clear to me why our minister said our generation is a generation of consumers. We live on the fruits grown by our forefathers. We take peace and riches for granted and am ignorant of the complexities of the outside world .</strong></blockquote>so that includes you in your own critics, doesnt it?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>PS: It is easy to give criticism and debate on this issue, but do you have a solution for it?</strong></blockquote><br>get rid of the americans.<br><blockquote><strong><br>Can you list the mistakes they have made, just one will do.

On the contrary, it seems that my reply have irked and piss you off so much as to call me a psychological mutant. Well, you can carry on these riduculous name calling for as long as you want.<br><br>But I just need to remind you of one thing, the next time while you are sitting at McDonalds, with one hand holding a burger and the other cuddling your girlfriend, just remember how fortunate you are to live in a peaceful country. Thousands of US and NATO troops are deployed around the world to prevent any military flare-up that could potentially spread around the globe. It is due to the presence of these troops that these rogue nation think twice before attacking.<br><br>The reasons why those korean students goes on an anti-US demonstration is because they think that their armed forces are capable to deter the North koreans. But do you understand that their military arsenal are supplied by the US? If the koreans have primitive WWII weapons, do you think those students would still want to kick the US butt?<br><br>The korean government as well as the singapore government ARE ELECTED by the people. If the majority of the people disagree with their american policies, they would be booted out. Those flag burning, riots are carried out by just a fraction of the population. I hope you will live to see these very same leaders getting re-elected again.<br><br>Get rid of the americans.<br>Could you be more specific? Does this also includes their businesses here?<br>You could save yourself from embarresment by thinking twice before saying anything. More than half the population would be out of jobs if the americans were to relocate elsewhere. Remember, even China is welcoming american business into their economy. You do'nt need to show them to the door, they will take their leave.<br>Thankfully, our leaders have more brains.<br><br>So why do'nt you start the ball rolling and do whatever you think can kick the american ass outta this island? I'm afraid all you could do is flood this forum with anti-american articles and make a fool out of urself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>PS: Your reply reminds me of the disgraced ex chief of fateha.com. You simply digs up all the american dirt and display them out without giving a fair and two-sided comparison of their merits. What a shame.... The situation is'nt as clear cut as you think, it's not the usual good guy vs bad guy games you play when you are a toddler.<br><br>With these words, I end my reply to this topic. I believe our dear forumers here are a generation of young adults who can judge not just based on one side of the coin, but on both sides.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh...controversay I think you should really try living amongst them for a while.<br><br>About your pilots theory. Yes it is true pilots are accountable to a certain degree for their flights. However I would like to raise that passengers are always allowed the privilege of not flying on a particular airline, with a particular pilot if they bother to find out.<br><br>As for STqwerty...<br><br>I think your quote "it is because most of the us population were made up of europeans and they felt that US ppl should be responsible for their descendants countries instead of onlooking the woes and staying innert. as for the so-called busybody, it is just a figure of speech probably due to human emotional reactions which i think everybody possesses it." is very right. I can agree with you on this.<br><br>"I also seem to remember that a lot of Singaporeans expressed indignance when the SIA pilots involved in the Taiwan crash were detained and almost prosecuted. Would you complain if the pilots were US marines instead?" US Marines are navy affiliated infantry. US marines have their own pilots too (vietnam?). That's all I can say.<br><br>I agree that 'insult' was a word wrongly used by me STQwerty...but I personally feel that critisism should not come from us.<br><br>The truth is I used to dislike Americans too because they have not been kind to my country. However I think every country has its own faults and these should be looked at first. Singapore is a good country but it has its fair share of problems. If the US is being accused of nosing around...wouldn't it be fair to say that whenever we comment on their politics, mishaps and happenings we are to a certain extent, being busybodies too?<br><br>I guess in a sense you can start treating nations as individuals. Treat them as you would wanted to be treated. Sometimes there are just bigger sized bullies in the playground, sometimes there are nice people to talk to and some just plainly stab you in the back.<br><br>iskandar...for your iraqi invading kuwait war comment, I can identify with your standpoint.<br><br>None of us here are qualified enough judges to say, "Okay America's faults weigh more than the merits."<br><br>STQwerty I don't know if the Iraqis waged war to bring the Americans into their soil...but personally I believe it was because Kuwait was a rich neighbour, and even though Saddam has the cheapest oil in the world, more wouldn't hurt.

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is that nobody dare to comment on the bombing of chinese embassy issue? is it because it will unravel the mistakes committed by the US, in which u guys are trying desperately to evade? i can continue to dig up the dirt left behind by the US in the past but i wont.. for the moment.<br><br>'china allowed the US into its country' is because the chinese still benefits from the dealing with the US, same as the chinese spy sent into NASA to surp classified. but i can assure u once the US is sucked dry, they will be expelled to their own country. china is trying to achieve world standard in every aspects of the country, be it olympic or its economic strength or even space ventures and so on... as you know they had a period of decadence in the past, civil wars and heavy corruption among the feudal lords or even the opium brought in by the europeans which led them astray. this is probably why we r speaking english now instead of chinese worldwide. the englishs are cunning, the chineses are disarrayed and easily deterred. china are trying to 'escape' their past and once they have attained what they always wanted, there will be no US interferring and no obeying of international sanctions and treaties if they overstepped the boundaries.<br><br>as for isk, you probably are a hybrid between an ameris and a muslim and its also the reason why your comments is foolishly biased. both of you just considered the merits of US and totally expunged the rancid mistakes they have made.<br>as for perseus, u r probably just any typical american expatriate or such whom will defend the US like hell is about to break loose. white ameris especially are known to be blinded by their patriotism.<br>my allegations are you must be sent by the US goverment to spread ameris propaganda so as to bring the whole asia continent into 'the US ways' or maybe to gain reconnaissance of the communist activities in asia. ameris fear the spread of communism more than the vietnam war. please dont make the mistake of associating me with a communist. the americans had made enough misstakes already, lol.<br><br>despite all the graffitis conveyed by both of you, i will still stick to my point and continue in my ranting against the US. oh, if this debate is carried out in chinese, i will probably beat you 10 to 1, believe me.</div>
