            <div class='col-md body'>Dear MayaJade.<br><br>I am sure that you would be really happy with the values of the western society if you migrate there, besides multi-partner sharing among ang-mohs are very common...<br><br>Well, I have promised dear Naivette that I will be honest with her if she wants to know anything from me.. So, no choice, bound by promise. Anyway, I am not mad at you at all. One could always ask Revey and Qwerty that I don't get angry very easily unless 1)they insult my family or friends or 2)they did something really horrible to me, i.e betray my trust (I would not forgive a gal in doing that to me) .....<br><br>In case, you are worried that I am mad, rest assured that I am not. There are better things to be angry than such a trivial matter. But both of you really made me "blushed". Of course, I can continue to be your therapist, that is if you need one.<br><br>As for your long letter, I would reply you later...... Hope you get your new pewter soon.<br><br>Good day...<br><br>yours sincerely<br>Prodigal<br><br></div>

So, we were passing this small nice biscuits around us, where one of the guys commented that it looked like dog biscuits. So, I got the bowl of biscuits, and started munching some. The gal then asked me,"Can u please pass the bowl of dog biscuits?". My instantaneous response to her, was to hand the bowl to her and said,"Nah, bitch.". The other two guys burst into laughter and said that she deserved it.... Besides she was laughing as well...<br><br>yours,<br>Prodigal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>darling Terence dearest,<br><br>do you mind signing off with more affection rather than as your stiff-fingered one? that phrase brings to mind of either you or me flashing the middle finger, not a very enticing scene, darling luv. and iÂ’m trying dead hard to correct this filthy habit of flashing that finger whenever pissed, so kindly please donÂ’t give me any more ideas. thanks luv.<br><br>i donÂ’t even know if i should say this but darling Terence baby, i simply cannot resist: you still a virgin? *hysterical laughter resounding in my room over here in sunny SÂ’pore although it has been raining for the past 2 days* hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, thatÂ’s one of the reasons i'm falling in luv with you, youÂ’re so funny sometimes.<br><br>me very innocent one   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">, what lure little boys and ravishing them? i donÂ’t do such things, itÂ’s most likely the other way round. and can i help it if youÂ’re years younger than me? i can only lament that i was born too early or you were born too late. Terry baby, youÂ’ve no idea how often iÂ’ve wished that i was years younger than i actually am since i met you this February, but then, i remembered reading that you donÂ’t mind dating an older woman even if sheÂ’s 45 (and iÂ’m younger than that   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">) as long as she doesnÂ’t look like a prune. well, i may be on the way there, but thereÂ’re some years yet before i would look like one, so ... ... *hopeful looks*<br><br>and darling Terence, please seriously believe me that iÂ’m very sincere when i use all these terms of endearments for you, itÂ’s just such a pity that they donÂ’t seem to move your cold cold heart or mean anything to you. so tell me baby luv, should i persist in getting your attention or should i still my flighty heart now and stick to pacman and pacman alone? even if it pains me dearly to let you go? for youÂ’ve have done nothing but capture a part of my heart since i know you, darling Terence.<br><br>*colette waits with bated breath for her luvÂ’s answer* so darling Terence, please donÂ’t ignore me and tell me your answer even if itÂ’s for me to ignore you in future, a part of me will surely die if thatÂ’s so, but i promise iÂ’ll be strong and learn to fill that void ... *sniffs*<br><br>yours with much luv,<br>hopeful colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 03 August 2000).]</div>
