But I need the right man for that, would you?<br><br>Looking at the frequency of your posts, I am convinced that you are indeed taking vacation from reality.  Hold on just a little while, those brain of yours are the sexiest around, you will get through sliding on a rainbow.  Even if you don't come out smelling like roses, home to me, demented angel, I'll kiss all your frown away.<br><br>By the way, <strong>they</strong> turn to pumpkins because of my curse.

            <div class='col-md body'>SETTING: A deserted bar in Bali.  A single, huge, hairy bartender is wiping the bar with a rag but otherwise everything is quiet.  A striking young woman in her early twenties sits motionless on a piano stool.  She is dressed in a black sarong and a drooping pink hibiscus hangs listlessly behind her ear.  She is staring into space.<br><br>(The woman slowly places her hands on the keys of the battered piano.  After a sigh, she starts to play)<br><br>MAYA EBONY: (sings) Ebony and Ivory...live together in a perfect harmony...side by side on my piano, keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?<br><br>(the bartender turns towards the audience and starts his soliloquy)<br><br>BARTENDER:  Ah, poor girl.  What a shameful thing, what a shameful thing that happens here everyday!  Those tourists, they don't only bring cheap, useless fabric home, they have to wrap our sweet girls in them and take their soul away.  Look at Ebony, if the boss doesn't stop her, she would have been singing Ebony and Ivory all night.<br><br>It all started when a rich banker came to this bar.  He heard Ebony singing that song and he managed to find her dressing room.  I don't know for sure what that bankir, Barclays Ivory, said to her but she went away with him without heeding my warning.  I guess...ah....  She disappeared for three nights and I don't know where had she been and whether she had gone with Ivory, but the small earthquake lasting for the same three days in Singaraja might be an indication of their whereabouts, it doesn't matter...<br><br>She came back on the fourth night and she had been like this ever since, playing Ebony and Ivory like a broken record!  I've never seen that Ivory guy coming around again and she won't even change the hibiscus she places behind her ear.  I think the boss should...<br><br>(An urgent, loud knockings are heard.  Everyone stops what he is doing and looks at the door.  The bartender reaches below his bar to fetch a nasty looking sabre.)<br><br>BARTENDER: (hoarsely)  Who is it?<br><br>------------------<br>My notion of a husband at forty is that a woman should be able to change him, like a bank note, for two twenties.</div>
