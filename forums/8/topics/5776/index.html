Say, someone chat you up and you find his opening move interesting or you have said one yourself (stolen from a book, a divine inspiration, whatever) and it gets incredible response  :p<br><br>Or you can tell about those that don't work, the whys etc.<br><br>I know what doesn't work for me, coming up to a girl and say "Hi, can we be friends?"  It is safe sounding but utterly uninviting, too.  It's unfair, but I think that a girl can get by with "Hi Handsome" while the guys might have to find something more , i dunno, original?</div>
