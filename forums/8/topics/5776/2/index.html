I could tell you how intelligent, delightful and charming you are from your posts but you're probably bored with guys telling you this over and over again.

The offer is still open, drop me a line and whatever the outcome, you can be sure you'll not be bored. *wink*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, there was once.... this guy came up to me at the bus interchange and asked me for the time. AND, there is a clock at the bus interchange!!! So, I told him the time and wanted to walk off... (I was in a hurry), but then he followed me. He started introducing himself... ask for my name... say that he want to be friends with me. Would you think this is at all original? I wouldn't.<br><br>Gave him this excuse that I was rushing to somewhere... then he backed off. Besides, this guy is not like drop-dead gorgeous!! If he were, he wouldn't have much need to use a pick-up line. But do think a guy is good-looking... that he still need to approach girls? I don't know...<br><br></div>
