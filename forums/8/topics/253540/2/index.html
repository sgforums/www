It's not that much of a 'trick question'... Though it's unlikely that anyone would belong purely to 'type 1' or 'type 2'... One's state of mind, belief and condition might likely to allow themselves to place own in either of the 2 categories.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It's true because that provides the basis of consciousness. because if everything is not real. The only thing that you can confirm an existence in your conscious (aka your thoughts). However, it's proven wrong because your thoughts require a sensory from the environment. The saying only goes, I think therefore I am. I can't tell you I'm hot, or cold. I'm nothing or someone or something without knowing something in the environment. You can't be nothing, unless you know there's something. it will be like a blank slate. That's where it breaks down, which then someone proposed that besides a conscious, there needs to be a body. then this debate went on to asking people, so it's the body the drives the conscious or vice-versa, or they interact with each other. Pretty ugly...</div>
