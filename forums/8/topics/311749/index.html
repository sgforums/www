              <p>Last week my mum asked me to buy a few boxes of incense for her. So when I happened to passby this neighborhood shop selling religious offerings products, i went in &amp; take a look. It's the 1st time i bought from this shop... since I'm in a hurry &amp; price seem slightly cheaper, without much thought I bought a box. When I reached home, I realised the cover is a little loose, i opened &amp; checked...</p>
              <p><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/egvc6u.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="310"></p>
              <p>I noticed the package inside seem smaller, so to compare, I took another box of incense, SAME brand &amp; size which my mum bought previously from another shop. After that, i decided to confront the uncle, at the same time to check whether if the uncle is to blame or some one might have changed the package without his knowledge. When I asked him, why the package i bought is smaller? He<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/devil.png" alt="devil.png"> claimed that ALL the others are the same size as the one I bought &amp; denied that it's smaller. He then took another 'new' box of incense from his display shelf, opened up &amp; showed it to me.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/1z1tzec.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="340"></p>
              <p>I said to him this is not the 1st time I have use this brand &amp; I have another box at home. The uncle keep silence for a while, staring at his shelf... then he replied, "when the products came in it's like that one", he then showed me his box of incense at my face AGAIN... wtf. At the point, I also noticed MOST of the seals on the boxes have been removed or damaged. so i questioned him on that... NOW his reply was most of the customers open up to check before buying, so there's no big deal about it.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"> (Now obviously he trying to cheat his way out)</p>
              <p><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/ztzpko.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="332"></p>
              <p>To shorten the story, he later gave all sort of lame excuses during the argument, and INSISTED he had done nothing wrong, but what really pissed me off was at the end, he said that he is selling religious products to help people and will never cheat their customers. I told him that he's just operating a dishonest business using the name of religion, nothing more... &amp; I walked off while he was still mumbling.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <h1 class="clr">House buyer cheated of S$5,000 deposit</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE: A house buyer was cheated of S$5,000 when she was buying a five—room resale flat in Woodlands.</p>
              <p>Wong Git Siow said: "Since I was already buying the house, and...
              she (the flat owner) said she did not have enough money for the New
              Year, I did not mind giving her the $5,000 deposit."</p>
              <p>Ms Wong claimed that the flat owner changed her mind after receiving the S$5,000 deposit, and never returned the money.</p>
              <p>She
              also said that the owner failed to bring the relevant documents on two
              separate occasions when she tried to seal the deal last November.</p>
              <p>The owner has been missing in action since then.</p>
              <p>Ms Wong had applied for a house loan and if it is cancelled, she will have to pay a penalty of S$2,000.</p>
              <p>She added that the seller had taken a S$2,500 loan from the property agent and did not pay back.</p>
              <p>Both
              Ms Wong and the property agent have filed a police report and reported
              the matter to the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE).</p>
              <p>But
              CASE pointed out that this case is not within its jurisdiction as it
              only deals with companies and agencies. It advised Ms Wong and the
              property agent to approach a lawyer instead.</p>
              <p>The transaction period for the flat expired earlier this month. — CNA/ac</p>

              <p>Last week my mum asked me to buy a few boxes of incense for her. So when I happened to passby this neighborhood shop selling religious offerings products, i went in &amp; take a look. It's the 1st time i bought from this shop... since I'm in a hurry &amp; price seem slightly cheaper, without much thought I bought a box. When I reached home, I realised the cover is a little loose, i opened &amp; checked...</p>
              <p><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/egvc6u.jpg" alt="" width="394" height="310"></p>
              <p>I noticed the package inside seem smaller, so to compare, I took another box of incense, SAME brand &amp; size which my mum bought previously from another shop. After that, i decided to confront the uncle, at the same time to check whether if the uncle is to blame or some one might have changed the package without his knowledge. When I asked him, why the package i bought is smaller? He<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/devil.png" alt="devil.png"> claimed that ALL the others are the same size as the one I bought &amp; denied that it's smaller. He then took another 'new' box of incense from his display shelf, opened up &amp; showed it to me.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"></p>
              <p><img src="http://i29.tinypic.com/1z1tzec.jpg" alt="" width="390" height="340"></p>
              <p>I said to him this is not the 1st time I have use this brand &amp; I have another box at home. The uncle keep silence for a while, staring at his shelf... then he replied, "when the products came in it's like that one", he then showed me his box of incense at my face AGAIN... wtf. At the point, I also noticed MOST of the seals on the boxes have been removed or damaged. so i questioned him on that... NOW his reply was most of the customers open up to check before buying, so there's no big deal about it.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"> (Now obviously he trying to cheat his way out)</p>
              <p><img src="http://i27.tinypic.com/ztzpko.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="332"></p>
              <p>To shorten the story, he later gave all sort of lame excuses during the argument, and INSISTED he had done nothing wrong, but what really pissed me off was at the end, he said that he is selling religious products to help people and will never cheat their customers. I told him that he's just operating a dishonest business using the name of religion, nothing more... &amp; I walked off while he was still mumbling.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <p>I forget to mention, this brand have few different types of grades, sizes and the package look very similar, that's<br>why some retailer take advantage of this. Let's say if I swap the <strong>same size but of different grade,</strong> it's not easy to tell the difference.  Look closely I have swapped the package...</p>
              <p><img src="http://i26.tinypic.com/sc8ev8.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="304"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I had bought 3 boxes, I could have easily lose about $6.00. If smaller size, even more. So it's very important<br>to check the seal on the box... &amp; did u notice the colour of the two packages of incense are slightly different too?</p>

              <p>Some may comment that it's nothing new, just a petty cheat and no use complaining. If this is the case, there are<br>crimes happening everyday, so it's nothing new too. Then the victims need not complain or speak up, no need<br>for news report, no need share &amp; remind others...</p>
              <p>To me, it doesn't matter how much the amount involve, cheating is still cheating and my purpose of posting is CLEAR, to share and warn more people, so people can be more alert when they are spending, and I encourage other to share if they are being cheated. NO DOUBT there are cases which cannot be resolve, there's nothing we can do to get back our loses. At least we can share and alert the others... the more the better!!!.</p>
