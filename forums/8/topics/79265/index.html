            <div class='col-md body'>Ryan Seacrest: A BIG hello to everyone! Welcome to another instalment of AMI and today we have the honour of having another 'has beens' of the music industry to grace the show. Her last appearance in the public eye was an advertisement on the importance of calcium in your bone. Let us put our hands for the one and only Donna Summer!<br><br>Donna Summer: Hello.<br><br>Ryan Seacrest: Right! And together with us on the show are our venerable judges. He is the current Olympic record holder for number of ways to say "You Suck!" Simon Cowell!<br><br>Simon Cowell:  Ryan, your hair sucks.<br><br>RS: Ok, America, you've heard your idols perform yesterday and cast your votes, and tonight one of them is saying goodbye to their lofty hollywood dreams and going back home to tend to the cattles! We're getting to the results in just one second, but first lets look at some footages of your idols pretending they are already stars!<br><br>(Big screen shows footage)<br><br>RS: Wow! Apparently they'll wear anything we ask them to, eh! We'll go for a break right now, and we'll come back with the results in just ONE second!<br><br>(Commercial break)<br><br>RS: Lets get to the results. Fantasia, Simon said you suck. Donna Summer said you were good, but I don't think she meant it. Paula said you put on a nice performance but then again she won't hurt an ant. We still can't make out what Randy is grunting about. And Fantasia, America has voted you to the BOTTOM TWO!! Congrats!!<br><br>Fanstasia: (Fight back tears, struggles to put on a smile)<br><br>RS: We'll get to the other 3 idols, but first lets see a performance by your idols. It ought to be fun to see if Fantasia, ONE of the BOTTOM TWO still be able to prance around gaily.<br><br>(Idols take the stage, Fantasia prances around bravely, as if nothing has happened)<br><br>RS: Looks like Fantasia has forgotten she's the BOTTOM TWO. I better remind her again during the commercial break.<br><br>(Commercial break)<br><br>RS: Welcome back, who's joining Fantasia as the BOTTOM TWO? We'll find out in a second. Haha, I just love putting the whole America in suspense. Now, lets talk to Fantasia. How do you feel, having known that you have received the one of the two lowest number of votes?<br><br>(Fantasia sliently slits her wrists)<br><br>[Click]</div>
