The latter portion, I shall leave out, for that was not what u requested.<br><br>Atti and Pixie, well, you have experienced what a lot other people might not even have the chance of experiencing, so remember to cherish those memories, they will make nice "once-upon-a-time stories" for your grand children in the future, hehehe......<br><br>And used to watch this cantonese series about the ten brothers, used to imagine myself having those exact capabilities too. And cartoons, yeah, Visionaries is still the best. I think I mentioned somewhere else that I liked that too.<br><br>Too all those who are on their way of achieving their childhood ambitions, like Crysania, congratulations. You have done somethnig not many are capable of boasting of. Keep it that way. Not many people have the luxury of fulfilling what they claim to be their destinies when they were kids. So in that aspect, I am really envious of you Crysania.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Atti:</strong><br>Ello! *GRINZ* Hmm, about the piglets, I think Grandma felt that there was no need for so many domestic animals since we already have chickens and ducks already. Oh well, there are people who will buy piglets to rear NOT to sell. Some of them buy piglets as pets (yups, you heard me right, as pets). I am NOT kidding! Actually those piglets are quite cute loh, I don't mind cuddling them myself and of course, that is when they are NOT sun-bathing in the mud!  :p As for how many piglets, I don't really remember or should I say I never bother to find out. I always pick one up to play with, that's all. They are more or less the same anyway.<br><br>You are right when you say that kampong people always look after one another but that is only when in time of need. A friend in need is a friend indeed. But on normal days, you will be surprised how they can argue over how much 1kg of meat cost and how they can pick at each other over how much money their chickens and ducks can fetch when sold in the market! However, that was just verbally. Deep down they care a lot for each other and if one household cooked curry, the whole kampong will have curry for that night. They just refuse to admit that they care. It always amused us kids how they can go on hurling abuse at one another when they actually care so much for one another!<br><br>And hey, I FRACTURED my leg NOT broke it lah! HUMPH! But well, it was nearly broken.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Once while climbing trees, thrice while skateboarding. XI GUAN JIU HAO!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Well, actually my family had a house ourselves but I only went home on weekend and sometimes never, so I kinda spend my days at Grandma's loh. Still love that OLD zinc-roofed house than my own house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I don't know but I always feel that few 19 yr-old (none that I know so far) had a childhood like mine so I think I am really LUCKY.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Interesting incidents? Hmm... let me think.... oh yeah there was an indoor well at Grandma's house. The well is located in the kitchen and I think there is a SQUARISH hole on the roof so that when it rains, the water will fall into the well loh. Anyway, there was once when my cousins were super bored and they actually suggested that one of us get down the well and try to fidn out how my uncle managed to get down and dig that well years ago. Because I was the youngest among them, they chose me of course. And you know what they did? Well, they got a big bucket and asked me to get in the bucket while they moved me down slowly with the rope so that I don't so "SPLASH" into the water. Because my cousins were NOT strong enough, halfway down, they could NOT hold on to the rope and I fell into the water together wif the bucket! By the time I landed onto the water, I am OUT of the bucket already! My cousins all start SCREAMING and I panicked and gluped down lotsa water accidentally. Yeah, I can swim but it's just a small circular area so where can I swim to? All my auntis and uncles all rushed to the kitchen only to find me in the well struggling and the other kids screaming. Uncle immediately got a pale and threw inside the well and asked me to climb inside it. I did just that, with diffculty of course, and Uncle hauled me out of the well! PHEW! What a CLOSE shave! However, after Uncle attended to my wounds, all of us kids were caned by Grandma for being so notti and we could NOT have ice-cream that night for our dessert!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>WohooO!~ I actually typed so much already.... sorries for being so long-winded and boring you all to tears! That's all!

So now u must be a really good skateboarder huh? My mum is good to me, enjoy lotsa freedom, but skateboard is one thing she doesn't allow me to play when young, haha......and now old liao..... dun have the urge to try out liao......<br><br>Well ya same here, kinda miss the zinc-roofed house.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>lexelle:<br></strong> Well, you still can be an all-rounded woman. It's NOT that far-fetched if one is equipped with the knowledge. *HUGZ* Knowledge is power so let's keep learning!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>Atti:</strong><br>*LUFFZ* I never say that your English is not good and neither did I say that mine is good. If you read properly, you will realise that I make lotsa grammar error but I cannot be bothered.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Regarding your question on bathing the piglet, I am not to sure either. I guess we bathed them..... because they always get really dirty and smell after sun-bathing in the mud and I would stay far far away from them. And when I see them again, they are all clean again! I supposed Grandma bathed those piglets and hopefully, their new owners cleaned them too.<br><br>Also, I think your mum does not allow you guys to climb the coconut tree because it's too dangerous and she has your interest at heart. Anyway, my parents work in the day so usually, what we kids did in the day time, she would not know unless Grandma told her. Grandma doted on all of us too much to tell tales to my mum or my aunties and uncles! Grandma always believed that kids should learn to be independent and even if they have to fall down while at play, that's their problem and she will definitely NOT sympathise with us and come console us, despite the tears! *SHRUGS* When we fall down, we will refrain from crying most of the times unless the pain is really unbearable! This is because Grandma will STOP us from carrying on with whatever fun we are having should one of us start shedding tears.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Oh well, what can I say man, my brother, together with my cousins and me learn it the hard way but those bruises, scar and blood are worth it. That's GROWING UP anyway! *GRINZ*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Btw, who else do you live with in your old kampong? One big family of cousins, aunties, uncles and gramdparents like mine?<br><br>Hmm, I did go with my grandma to the market sometimes. Grandpa would cycle and fetch one of us there in his old bicycle too if he decided to accompany Grandma. And you better believe it when I tell you how neighbours can fight and argue over a piece of pork at the butcher's! *SIGHZ* I think my ear drums could have burst during those moments!<br><br>Eeerrrr, I also don't want to fracture my limbs and bones either but sometimes it's really accidentally or just plain careless mah! *SIGHZ* Hey! You sound just like Grandma.... "See lah! Keep fracturing your bones.... old liao got rheumatism then how? Must take care ahz....." *LUFFZ*  AHEM.... words of WISE OLD people eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Btw, Mum did NOT know that I pick up skateboarding till I was 16 and by then I had already been skating for nearly 4 years and owned 2 decks. She saw one of my decks in my bedroom and asked me about it so I just admitted it loh. I see no point in keeping things from her. Of course, she disapproved but like I say, she does not restrict me so she keep telling me to be careful! The last BAD fall was 2 years ago when I fractured my knee during the june holidays and Mum was fuming mad. She advised me to stop but I did not though I stopped skateboarding totally from last December till this May! A 6-mth miracle but I am back at it again. *SIGHZ* I sold my decks in January and though I went back to it agian in May, I really want to stop COMPLETELY! Mum is getting really worried! *SHRUGS* Maybe will turn to roller-blading instead, SUPPOSEDLY less dangerous if I don't go and try out funny stunts! Shall wait and see!<br><br>*BLINKS* I'm older than you? Really wish so  myself but too bad! *LUFFZ* Being 19 means that people don't really treat you as a thinking adult but as a problem teen instead! *SIGHZ* Oh yeah, I don't sleep with mosquito net but lit up mosquito coil instead. However, I have always been a treat to those blood-thirsty mosquitoes and used to have lotsa sores and marks on my legs due to those insects' bites! Ahz? At 19 then got fresh memory? You are very OLD eh? *LUFFZ* Well, nevermind lah, take it as more MATURE loh!  :p<br><br>As for the well, I am not sure how deep, maybe 10m like you say? *SHRUGS* But I DID hurt myself during that fall. The wall of the well bruised me and left lotsa cuts on my arms and legs which was why Uncle got to tend to my wounds after he "rescued" me from the well! Well, I thought it's pretty normal for a kampong kid to be able to swim at 5 or 6 yr old? I started swimming as a toddler.... and yeah I swam in ponds and rivers... it's soooooooo COOLING and refreshening! Can't you swim?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> Don't you swim in rivers and ponds? Any interesting encounters during those swims? Anyway, we deserved to be caned for being so naughty then but it's okies, make us BETTER kids (hopefully) wat! *LUFFZ*<br><br>Hmm, we don't have ice-cream for dessert every night, just on Saturday and it was a Saturday night then! That was why we were all so unhappy and grouchy because we only got to eat ice-cream on Saturday and we were deprived of it that night because of our mischief! You love ice-cream? Last time and NOW? I do.... and chocolates too! *SLURP*<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pixie_Gal,<br><br>Hiya, been a long long time since I last heard from u (Due to the problem in this forum)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  , so how have life been....... well finally everything is back to normal.<br><br>Frankly speaking, think yr childhood really diff from other pple ya, i mean, other gers carry dolls ard when young but you carry piglets ard, heh..... guess that's your own form of 'doll' rite   :p ....... well i am sure yr grandma did bathed them lar, if not she would not let you kids played with them.<br><br>And yup, do agreed that for our own good, that's why mum did not allowed us to climb the coconut tree, but then now that i missed the chance to, haha......dun think i will ever get the chance to liao......and, yr grandma do sound like a very firm person hor. Although my mum also believe that kids should learn to be independent, and learn to stand on their own after they FALL, heh.....but i am sure she wouldn't wand the fall to be from a coconut tree (a bit far too high rite, heh.....). Hmmm....and who else lived wif me in the kampong eh, well alomost like yrs lor, grandparent, uncle and auntie (singles one lar, cos married one will moved out to live with thier hubby)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> .<br><br>Oh u did go to the market eh, not me lor, heh......maybe their thinking is, ai yah, guys no need to go lar, heh....i meant who knows rite. Think yr grandma wanna u to picked up the skill of bargaining, that's why needed yr presence there lar......so, how many percent of her skill did u managed to picked up?<br><br>Errrrr dun think any1 ever wanna fractured their own limbs and bones lar, but then as a general conclusion, heh........ you are one very careless person. And Oei, u sure i sound like yr grandma or not, heh...... maybe yr grandpa lar (errmm never heard u mentioned b4 that he nags leh, guess most guys not so naggy eh,   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> .<br><br>Wonder how u did managed to keep it from yr mum for so long, heh, not bad huh...... well a deck cost abt 100-200 dollars rite? wow where u get all the money to buy at such age eh...... also, hmmm......a bad fall in june holiday 2 yrs ago eh.......heh, see lar, wasted yr holiday liao....... anyway, how badly does it hurt, hopefully it doesn't happened again. Wanna give up skateboarding completely, errrmmmmm u sure u can  do it or not, heh......as i see yr passion in it leh. Anyway, how abt swicthing to skate blading instead of roller blading, this one the risk confirm lesser   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> .<br><br>well not every1 treadted a 19 as problem kids but this are the age that 1 will turn problematic again (think 15-16 also very easy to turn bad eh). Hey hey hey, 19 is a nice age to be man, i meant u will know lar, after a few yrs that u can't get back this age again once u lost it *sob sob*. How i wish i am 18 every yr, or maybe 21 forever. treasure yr time now, like u did when young okie. Frankly speaking, i can only remembered that i was in poly at 19, the rest doesn't really remember. Oh yes, by the way, i am 22.<br><br>Wondering how many mosquito coil do u have to burn in the nite in order to keep those pests away, as i found out that some mosquitos aren't really afraid of the coil leh. Or should i say the smoke the coils gave out can't cover enuff area, e.g can cover upper body, can't cover yr legs etc.<br><br>Well is the wall of the well that rough? its suppose to be made of concrete rite. Anyway, i am sure its one experience not to be missed. But now thinking of it, its kinda dangerous for you to go 'scuba diving' in the well, dun u think so. And this may sound surprise to you but there's no pong or pool in my kampong, as far as i can remember today. Geeeez, no chance to swim then also, that's why start swimming only when in primary sch...... ai seh, started swimming as a toddler, guess u must be a pretty good swimmer today. So how's the feeling like to swim in the pond? the same as swimming in the sea? Well so what are the encounters u have during those swim, like seeing some crocodiles etc etc, heh.....oOoOOOooopppps<br><br>Wow ice cream every weekend eh, that's a lot liao leh, i remembered only having ice-cream once in a while back then......... Well and YES, I LOVE ICE CREAM and CHOCOLATE, haha......some friends even labelled me as an ice-cream goner .........i really dun mind having lotsa ice-cream but i have cut down on chocolate liao, haha......cost it might cost me my figure (haha....sounds vain eh)...... but then, i normally gave in after some temptation   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Angeldark:<br><br>Nice going here....brought alot of memories back to me. *smiles* Thanks...<br><br>colette:<br><br>*smiles* now I know why I am so attracted to you, you wrote beautifully, and I am charmed, each letter and pharse you have there sitmulate my mind as if a live scene is playing in front of me, I can imagine you stomping on the berrys, walking by the sea. And yes the innocent look on you when you gave your first kiss, all and all are so beautiful, I applaud you for such a great life you had, and definitely wish I had one like you did. Yes, colette, I think you are special, and you are unique, for no one charm me like you did.<br><br>Atti:<br><br>Been missing me? So how's life back there? You can ask me out for coffee sometimes you know? Anyway, you should be leaving the place in a few months time right? Call me up and maybe we can go for a drink or something. And yes, I think you are getting there. See what I mean when I told you that if you are able to enjoy the joys of a nice long exchange of people, it can be addictive? *smiles* enjoy and I am sure pixie_gal is enjoy this spiritual exchange with you too.<br><br>To all:<br><br>This is my childhood, a time which forms part of my life.<br><br>I can't recall much beyond 4 yrs old. But I do remeber that I lived in the Chin Swee area then, I do recall that I am an energetic little devil who would wake up at 6 a.m. to go pester my mum for 20 cents so that I can go next door to buy soya bean milk for breakfast from dao hua pek. I can recall the daily morning rountine of following my mum to the market. I can recall spending the rest of the day in the house of my god-mother, often sneaking out to play along the corridor with the neighbour's kids causing her great worry.(Sorry mum)<br><br>Toys, yes, I have toys. They were my everything then. I have the piece of rope which I use for my zero point, that I took 2 days to piece up with rubber band. I have my marbles, I have my bag of toy soldiers given to me by the gor gor who grew too old to play with them, I remeber I spent hours with those comarades of mine. "Ta Ta Ta Ta Boom" I would go on and on. I remembered my gloom when I was grounded. All I could do was to speak to my friends who were playing outside through the little slit under the door. It was still fun though, we were planning what to do tommorow. I remembered playing wrestling with brother chui, I would go over to his house, and we playing wrestling on his bed, if I got too tired, I would just sleep there, if he got tired he would sleep too, and when he is asleep I would explore his room, My exploration are normally quite fruitful, I found a smoking pipe which I posed later with in a photograph, a pair of sunglasses, a big T-shirt which goes to my ankles with the smiley face in front. Brother chui move out after he got married, did not hear from him much oredi.<br><br>I remebered my excitment when I first discovered plastersine. I made quite a few piece of art out of them, my first piece of dog poo, my first snowman lookalike, my first Tv, which is just a square block of plastersine. *laffs* Yes, the TV, it cause great excitement in the block I was living in. My family bought this old TV from a friend which comes with it's own box and shutters, there were dials on it which goes "Tak Tak Tak" each time you turn it. I often got a caning for my constant channel surfing with the dials. My neighbours will always come to the house to watch TV. It is a magical moment, everyone's eyes will be transfixed to it, no sound, no noise, just wide eyes on the TV. I thin kthe neighbourhood noise pollution at night went down after the TV appeared.<br><br>I remembered my ah mah, I missed her, it is a pity I did not learnt how to endear her early enough. but I remember her coming out to the corridor asking me to come back for dinner, I remember it well, for I caused her to fell once, she was weak, and all this walking in and out is not doing her good. All I could do then was to cry out loud on seeing her fall, I remebered trying to help her stand but I was too weak and she was too weak. So I just sat down by her side, while my firends went to call out the nieghbours to help her into the house. I am sorry grandma, I miss you.<br><br>Then I remeber school, my first day at the kindergarden is a funny sight I remembered. Everyone was crying. Well I was not *proud face* in fact I was telling those sitting around me not to cry and then our pa pa and ma ma would come back to fetch us in a while just like my mum told me. Even the teacher was at a lost. I remembered the classroom, dark, with little chairs and low tables all around, it has a musky dusty smell, and yes the toilet was very dark, I slipped and fell once there.<br><br>I remembered the old trees with roots in the air whenever I walked with my mum to the bus stop, I remembered the squariels on them. I remeber the old bus tickets I used to keep endearingly each time I had a bus journey. I always look with interest when the bus conductor punch a hole in the puch ticket.<br><br>I remember my father's joy when my sister is born, I rememer me playing with her little fingers and pushing her around in the cart showing her off to all the neighbours. I will always claim out loud, "This is my sister!" And all the neighbours will smile at my innocent. My sister loves to cry when she is young, and cry and cry she did.<br><br>I remembered most of all, the time when my head got stuck in the staircase railings and my dad had to use a prybar to bent the wrought iron railings to get my head out. I think the bars are still bend till now. It is a mark of my childhood I guess, and yes, the railings is a place I dread actually, for when I am really notti(like when my grandma fell), I would be chained there and my dad will cane me, the reason I was chained was because I am really fast and would run, dodge, evade with every possible manuver, to escape the cane. Well, I guess that tamed me, for I dun recall being chained there for more then twice. I learn to be obedient when I should be.<br><br>My childhood, a time of joy to recall, and some tears to live with. I will not forget them, for it is so unique to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Callan,<br><br>Hiya how have u been? So working now or studying? Well yes, i would be leaving in a few mnths time, 4 to be exact....... and my 'US' just came today. Well also, would like to add that well, at least in this tread pple are more willing to share then to frame each other ya?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> so guess that's why my post seems to be extra long in here.<br><br>Anyway, like the way u describe yr childhood, really ....... guess the main diff is our command of english. No matter how i write, won't be able to write the way u did.......<br><br>Oh yah, one of yr story abt the kindergarden remind me of a story as well, maybe would just like to post it here and share...... nothing much just a short story......<br><br>-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-<br><br>Remember during one of these day in kindergarden, when i had a small tiff with a fellow male classmate. I was so angry that i gave him a punch straight in the nose. Anyway, as far as i can recall, its definitely not a hard punch. After punching him, he did not cried but just complained to me that it hurts, and well as an 'innocent' boy i was then, i was told him that if its not pain, what for i hit you.<br><br>And guess what after a few min? Yes, his nose started to bleed badly, like a waterfall, no joke, and i got a shock of my life. In fact, i was so stunted that i did not know what to say then. Of cos, our teacher came and comforted him, and at the mean time help him stopped the bleeding.<br><br>Needless to say, was scolded jia lat jia lat by our teacher, and later on when my mum came and fetched me, she complainted to her. And again neeless to say, after going home, got my second round of bombartment.<br><br>Okie, got to admit i dun recall that boy's name already, since its been so many yrs. Anyway, if any forumnities happen to got a punch in the face yrs ago during yr kindergarden, and yes, i am probably the boy who hit u, heh......... joking   :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Atti:</strong><br>Eh ello! Been a while since I last post here! So how's life? Guess I kinda MIA for a few days.... *LUFFZ* Busy with my stupid Multimedia project.... *SHRUGS* Still burning midnight oil now!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hmm, talking about dolls, I never like dolls even as a child, especially Barbie dolls! *SHRUGS* I remember Mum buying me Barbie Dolls on my 6th birthday and I kinda "destroyed" the doll by painting the gown and cutting Barbie's hair! Guess I was pretty furious then...... Mum did promise me a remote control car but I got some stupid Barbie Dolls instead! Grr..rrr... *SHRUGS* I still think my little piglets are the BEST!  :p<br><br>Well, a few of my married uncles and aunts did continue to live in Grandma's old house and I grew up with my cousins! Those are really happy times..... playing everyday anf being so carefree!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> And yes, we have all learnt to be independent, learning to clean our own wounds and never uttering a sound whenever we hurt ourselves! We learnt is the rough way I guess!<br><br>*LUFFZ* Grandma brought us kids to the market all the time, even the guys. It's NOT really about the girls learning how to bargain at a young age, it's really because Grandma was trying to break some of us kids away so that the house would NOT be too roundy with so many kids running around and playing a fool, especially when Grandma was NOT around! Grandma did not want to come back seeing a bunch of kids breaking things in the house I guess! She learnt her lesson..... there was once when we broke 2 vases from the altar while she was out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Ever since that incident, she would usually bring 2 of us out whenever she got out of the house.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>As for Grandpa, he died when I was 7. *SHRUGS* All I remember of him is a really caring Grandpa and I will always remember how I actually paid him $0.05 everyday so that he would do my homework for me when I was in Kindergarten! And he would eventually use the money to buy sweets for me!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Yups, I do cycle but not that great at it. Anyway, I picked up cycling also back in the kampong. I remember that there was a shed and 3 bicycles inside it so we kids learn cycling with these 3 bikes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But sadly, I can't do stunts with bikes.... guess I never bother to try.... *SHRUGS* Maybe I should do that sometime soon.... since I am SUPPOSED to quit boarding! *LUFFZ* You mentioned being careful but how to really think about my own safety when I was like crazily enjoying myself trying out new stunts with my deck! Mum was so exasperated with me most of the time but she would never be able to understand that thrill!  :p<br><br>Eeerrrr, I got the money to buy my deck from my savings. It was not that expensive in the past. I bought my first deck for $50 and it was a really decent one! Was feeling so satisfied with myself then when I got that deck, grining from ear to ear that day like some idiot! *LUFFZ* About that fall 2 years ago during the June holiday, it was NOT all that bad you know! At least I get to stay at home and decorate my room a little and to rest at home. I rarely have such luxury because I am always out most of the time! *LUFFZ* I was in JC first year then and Mum was so HAPPY that I was at home, expecting me to study but of course, I just spend the whole June holiday watching VCD, chatting online and decorating my room!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm, so you are 22..... ORD liao eh? *LUFFZ* I guess the day an NS guy ORD will be one of the happiest day of his life! I still remember how happy my friend was last X'mas Eve when he got his PINK IC! He was beaming to himself the whole day and we were pigging ourselves out at Sakae Sushi! He ate lotsa sashimi that night! *LUFFZ*<br><br>Hey! You mean your kampong really has no pond or lake at all? That's really surprising! Swimming in the lake is fine I guess but realyl chilling and eerrrr, dirty I guess! *GRINZ* The beach is still the BEST! Love to swim in the sea with those little fishes! *LUFFZ* Between, swimming in the lake is safe... no crocodile lah! I still remember that further down Mandai Road where Grandma's house used to be, there is a Seletar Reservoir! In those days, they provided "sampans" which we can hire and row to St John's Island for camping! I recall how my elder cousin used to row those pathetic sampans and the small little boats will only move a little no matter how hard he rowed! *LUFFZ* And we would always tease him saying that he has NO strength to even row a sampan!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>*GRINZ* Ice cream and chocolate sounds HEAVENLY to me! And I love Hagen Daz ice cream! Holland V? Ooohhhhhh.... don't you just love the NYDC there? *DROOLS* I miss my NYDC's cookie monster! *SLURPS*<br><br>Omigosh! It's so late now... think I better get back to my project!~ Ciao!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>
