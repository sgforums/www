            <div class='col-md body'>I dun really remember what's my dream since childhood but then being a leader of some kind is always  something i want when young. Be it as a commander in the army (commander is the term used when young, hey, i dun even know how BIG is a commander then, haha....), or be it being an officer in the Police Force. Now come to think of it, well, yes, childhood dream are very innocent   :p<br><br>Talking abt childhood, maybe like to share a little more. Use to live in a kampong when young (consider my age, think most pple of the same age wun have the chance to). So guess i am one of the luckier one. Well life was carefree then.........we rear ducks and chicken, and have many fruits tress such as papaya, coconut and a hugh rambutan tree. Use to climb that tree, but not very high cos of my age, heh........<br><br>Our games then were really marble and stuff like that...... well as i live in the kampong, learn to cycle at a rather young age, b4 i even finish my kindergarden. well guess its just to much to say......... heh.....and mine, those were the days....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lar ok lar, I better post something LONG man, or else SOMEONE not happy, HA HA HA!!!<br><br>When I was young, I watched WWF pretty often, and I dreamt about building up my muscles until I was as strong as them! I didn't realise that it was all staged, thank goodness, I thought it was for real. I wasn't impressed much with aerial stunts, punches and kicks, clotheslines and other running slams. I was really fascinated with what I called the "Real Slams". Slams which require nothing but technique and pure bull strength to execute. My personal favourites were the German Suplex and Power Bomb.<br><br>I dreamt that I was the greatest wrestler of all time. Not just the greatest but the strongest as well. I would stun my opponents with just one chop to the neck, or a fist to the face. Then I would grab him and do a "real" slam, a really hard one! The crowd would cheer wildly and beg me to do another one. I would of course, and this one would knock out my opponent flat. K.O. If that wasn't enough, I would slam him again and again until he fainted. With much adulation from the roaring fans, I would stand on the ropes and wave my WWF Championship Belt. The crowd would scream and scream, and then I would stand in the centre of the ring and pose here and there, flexing my muscles...<br><br>HA HA HA!!! Boy, it sure was good.</div>

How ANNOYING huh? *LUFFZ* Oh yeah, talking about rambutan trees, I still remember carrying a big haysack to pick up those rambutans which my uncle and aunt cut from the tree. How innovative of them to use a bamboo pole and tying knives to the tip to use as a tool to cut those rambutans from the TALL TALL trees! *LUFFZ* And by the end of the day, we kids will have a good harvest of SACKS or baskets of rambutans!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><strong>colette:</strong> Hey hey hey!

A pixie is a naughty fairy and I sure live in my fairytale fantasy! Always wish that I can fly, like a pixie or any fairy, to see the world, to see people, to help people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Oh yeah, a pixie can make music with the wind, but this music can only be heard by little children because kids have the PUREST mind and can only hear the music due to their INNOCENCE. I always thought I can hear a pixie's music when I was a child.... *LUFFZ* And of course, always dream of making music with the wind myself!

            <div class='col-md body'>Angeldark, said I would support u, so here is my contribution.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, most of my childhood was also spent in a kampong, my mum's hometown in Negri Sembilan. And yes, chicken, ducks, and the animal that lingers most in my mind, the dogs. I was so scared of them when I was young. Those days were carefree. When I woke up early in the morning, I was let to go free to just do my what my heart desires, those were the days of absolute freedom. Was part of this gang in the village, and we used to terrorise the girls there, hahaha, and also in our freetime, we would just cycle around, with no destinations in our minds.<br><br>Occasionally, we would go play among the grass patches, which although we were warned about snakes and things like that but we just defied authority anyhow, a habit which I brought along with me even uptil this date, hahaha. I still remember all the cool stuff which we used to be able to catch, the various species of grasshoppers, (actually i don't know if we called it correctly, but used to call it things like butterfly hoppers, lion hoppers, but we could be wrong, and honestly, no one was there to correct us and we honestly didn't care either).<br><br>Well, I was told by my mum that a few days I was brought back home after I was born, she left me lying on the floor near a door. It happened that the wind blew and the door slammed against my head and I was bleeding profusely (*ouch* that must have hurt you might say, well, I have no recollections of that though), so from the time I knew how to speak, the recital of Tang poems was my bedtime duty. My mum will read to me the poems and I would be able to recite every single line without fail to my mum and so proud was I. Even my sis couldn't boast of such memory, hehehe...... By the time I was 5 or 6, I could recite any of the 300 Tang poems with a click of my fingers, that was how good I was. Unfortunately, as the guy grew older, so did his memory. The only poems I remember now is the one about the moon in front of the bed, and of course the one which so nicely describes my relationship with my mum.<br><br>I guess when I was in Primary school (here in Singapore of course), my reputation wasn't exactly that great. I used to do things like throwing people's bags into the drain, hanging out with those cool guys from Primary 7 and 8, loitering around the ex-Goldhill Square. Sighz, those were the days. It was fun, and if I had a chance to relive my childhood, I wouldn't change a single thing.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Atti:</strong><br>*LUFFZ* Oh boi, the rooster is so IRRITATING and you can actually go back to sleep again after that? You must be one PIGY when you were a child eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Talking about pig, Grandma owned a pig too but sadly, she was sold after she gave birth to a few cute little piglets. Grandma said she had to go because she was old already. *SOBZ*<br><br>As for the knives on the poles to hit the rambutans, we kids DON'T do that of course! We left the task to our aunts and uncles and all of us just busy ourselves running all over to pick up those rambutans! JUICY! Hmm, my neighbour had a small durain plantation near Grandma's old zinc-roofed house and we feasted ourselves with durains when the season arrived. YUM YUM!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Oh yeah, coconut trees are easier to climb, really, and of course, the coconut juice and its snow-white flesh is DELICIOUS! And not forgetting the savoury curry cooked the night after a coconut harvest! I remember how my cousin always making slits on the trunk of the coconut tree to make our climbing process smoother and it sure HELPED! I manage to climb up successfully quite a few times but fell down once! I was 7-yr-old then and was just half way up the tree when my fingers slipped and I fell with a THUD! It hurted so MUCH but I was actually laughing! DON'T ask me why, maybe I am a sucker for pain or what but I was laughing and my cousins all start screaming! But my laughter died when Mum came out of the house and sent me to the hospital in Uncle's car. The PAIN started to sink in more deeply and I felt a bit weak.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Anyway, I was hospitalised for 2 days only and was out with a cast soon after! Hey! It's pretty fun when my cousins started scribbling on my leg cast after I was discharged!  :p They made my day though I was pretty jealous that I could not go out and play hop-scotch and zero-point with them for two weeks!<br><br>Opps, guess I got carried away. Anyway, those were my childhood days but that kampong was pulled down when I was 10. We were asked to move out when I was 8 but I still went back with Grandma to take a look occasionally after everyone had moved. By then, the once lively kampong was hanging with silence. Gone were the children's laughter.....our neighbours' constant bicker.... the barber who lived next-door.....the swing that was our parents' saviour during dinner time (the kids will only take their meals when on the swing!) and LOTSA more.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I think our kampong was one of the LATEST that was evacuated and pulled down and I am glad that I had spent my childhood there. Nowadays, as I take a ride down to Mandai zoo or Seletar Reservoir, I only see a patch of wilderness where the kampong once was. It saddens me but well, life goes on and all I can do is to cherish those memories... clinging on.....  :p<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>

If grandma finds out huh, confirm scold us (till today still dunnoe why she scold us, maybe not on good term with neighbours? heh.....really dunnoe).<br><br>I remember having a few coconut tree at the backyard.......n so sad.....dun even have the chance to climb it!!!! My kampong was pull down when i was 6 ..... so think too young for that hor....... heh......ai yoh, so careless of u to have fallen down...... (do u know that kid dun cry when they fall down on their own but if some1 elses causes him/her to fall down, confirm cry, heh....). Think u not scare yr relative also scare out of their wits liao. Frankly speaking, the 2 week 'confinement' (leg cast lar   :p) must be yr 'pao ying', heh, for being too notti.
