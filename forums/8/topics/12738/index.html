            <div class='col-md body'>Gee.. tats a secret.. can give you other info though..<br><br>When selecting tomatoes at the market, use your nose. Smell the blossom (not stem) end. The most flavorful will have a rich tomato aroma. Don't expect much from those in your supermarket though.<br><br>There is some minor redemption to be had for commercial tomatoes, if you plan ahead. Tomatoes will ripen and develop a bit more flavor if left at room temperature in indirect (not direct) sunlight for three to five days or placed in a paper bag with an apple or banana for a day or two. They still won't be as flavorful as home-grown tomatoes allowed to truly ripen on the vine, but there is some small improvement if you don't have the luxury of a garden. However, if the supplier has not judged properly and has picked those green tomatoes too soon, nothing will help them.<br><br>Select tomatoes that are round, full and feel heavy for their size, with no bruises or blemishes. The skin should be taut and not shriveled. Store ripe tomatoes in a cool, dark place, stem-side down, and use within a few days. Keep in mind that although they may look alike when you purchase them, one tomato may ripen faster than another. Since commercial tomatoes are bred to be firm, the touch test is seldom a good indicator of ripeness.<br><br>Refrigeration is the enemy of the tomato as it nullifies flavor and turns the flesh mealy. The culprit is a compound called Z-3 hexenel, which accounts for the tomato's scent and taste. The development of tomato's linolenic acid to the Z-3 that makes our mouth and nose sing is hindered by cold. If you must refrigerate a tomato, take it out about an hour before using it to let it return to room temperature to revive any lurking Z-3.<br><br>------------------<br><strong>I consider myself an Expert tomato gardener since all of my friends tell me I have the most colourful and sweetest tomatoes.<br><br>"Life is too short to bother with tasteless tomatoes."<br></strong></div>
