              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Questions will be raised in Parliament following the death of SMU student Levin Angsana in a sailing incident off Raffles Marina last Thursday. <br><br>The Chairman of the National Water Safety Council, Dr Teo Ho Pin, will ask what else is being done to improve water safety. The Council and the Singapore Sailing Federation are also planning new safety measures to minimise such accidents. <br><br>On Monday, 22-year-old Levin Angsana was laid to rest. Family and friends of the Singapore Management University (SMU) student were saddened by his untimely death. For many, it raised more questions about water safety, as his family claimed he was a non-swimmer. <br><br>When contacted, the Singapore Management University said they would not like to comment on the incident, but rather focus on helping the family with the funeral arrangements. Any findings or recommendations would be released after internal investigations with a third party are concluded. <br><br>However, the Singapore Sailing Federation is already taking action to improve the competency of the crew on keel boats. <br><br>Mr Low Teo Ping, President of Singapore Sailing, said: "There is a need for the crew and the skipper to be very competent in terms of being able to manage what we call man overboard drills. <br><br>"(A) man overboard drill is exactly what one would do when somebody goes overboard - that you are able to swing the boat around in what we call figure eight to be exactly where the incident took place." <br><br>More also needs to be done at the grassroots level, something the Singapore Water Safety Council hopes to address with new measures. <br><br>Dr Teo said: "Devise a National Swim and Safe Award Scheme so as to encourage all Singaporeans and residents of Singapore to learn water safety, to learn swimming skills, to learn water safety in terms of water survival and learn also, if possible, life-saving skills." <br><br>The certification scheme will be introduced in the next few months for greater consistency in water safety standards. - CNA/de <br></span></p>

              <p>He should be responsible enough to wear the lifejacket.</p>
              <p>Same example when people never wear seatbelt die in accident, the government should only do so much the blame should be on the person himself who did not take the necessary action to be safe. How many people in the backseat wear seatbelt anyway? Almost none</p>

              <p>she's in shock and in grief.. of course she'll want to blame someone else. it's only natural that those who are close to the deceased think that the deceased is perfect, and did no wrong.</p>
