              <p>...the last time kids drown in condo pools, they blamed no lifeguards, poor pool designs.</p>
              <p>Then people drown like nobody business @ sentosa, they also blamed no lifeguards and the under currents despite all the signs already telling so.</p>
              <p>...then who they blamed for the cambodia incdent....the parents blamed the cambodian organisers, rite???</p>
              <p>Now, for this who they gonna blame?? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>We, sinkaporeans jus dun learn!! APA life jackets only necessary if the conditions are bad??? What blardy HUMBUG!!</p>
              <p>Life jackets should be doned the moment one enters the waters!!</p>
              <p>It's the same blardy excuse we are facing at our workplace when getting people to don safety vests....the weather too hot lar, it is too cumbersome lar, it's would obstruct our movement lar.....such blardy complacencies!!!</p>
              <p>Despite deaths after deaths after deaths.....it's still the same blardy mentalities that IT WUD NEVER HAPPEN TO ME <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The body of the undergraduate who went missing at sea after a sailing training session on Thursday, was found on Saturday. <br><br>The body of 22-year-old Levin Angsana was recovered about 300 metres off Raffles Marina - a short distance from where the accident happened - at about 7.30am. <br><br>The SMU student and four other sailors were returning to the marina after their training when the accident happened. <br><br>The five were on board a 24-foot keel boat when Levin fell into the sea. According to a crew member, Levin was at the front of the boat trying to bring down the spinnaker - a sail which catches the wind. <br><br>In the process, the spinnaker got hooked under the boat and he lost his balance and fell into the sea when he got down to a prone position to release it. Levin then tried to climb back into the boat, but was unsuccessful. <br><br>Levin's family members were distraught and upset by the way things unfolded. <br><br>Hannah Angsana, Levin's sister, said: "More precautions could have been taken. Further, rescue measures that could have been done in time were not. The Singapore naval divers were not activated fast enough. They arrived after dark. The fact that my brother could not swim and was not wearing a life vest at the point of the accident showed safety was not a priority." <br><br>But according to the International Sailing Federation or ISAF, keel boat sailors do not need to wear life jackets while training or even racing. Singapore Sailing Federation had also told Channel NewsAsia on Friday that life jackets are only necessary if there are strong wind conditions and treacherous waters. <br><br>Levin had obtained a Class 1 sailing licence last year, a requirement before he could sail. <br><br>This showed he could sail solo and swim for up to 50 metres in open water while wearing a life jacket. <br><br>The family is considering taking further action, but declined to elaborate on what this may be and against who. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Singapore Management University (SMU) says that it will continue to give the family its full support. <br><br>Professor Howard Hunter, president of SMU, said: "We are also trying to help the family in any other way we could....in connecting with the church and other arrangements that they want to make." <br><br>The SMU's counsellor is also in touch with Levin's team mates to provide counselling and help them cope with the tragedy. <br><br>Following the tragedy, SMU has suspended all sailing activities. It will also, together with a third party, review all its water-based activities. <br><br>With the tragedy coming less than a year after the dragon boat tragedy in Cambodia where five Singaporean rowers drowned, some feel safety cannot be compromised. <br><br>Teo Ser Luck, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Community Development, Youth and Sports, said: "If wearing a life jacket is necessary for safety precautions, we do that. I think that's the most important reminder we should give to every administrator and every athlete who has to train or perform activities at sea or in dangerous conditions..." <br><br>Mr Teo added: "I believe Low Teo Ping, president of the Sailing Association, he's taking this very seriously. I believe he is looking into all of the SOPs and he's trying to understand. <br><br>"This is such a painful lesson for every one of us. So we just have to take note of what we have to do now, close all the gaps possible. But we can only do so much with the rules. The system is there. Compliance is important." <br><br>A wake will be held for Levin Angsana at the St Joseph's Church in Queen Street and the funeral will take place on Monday. - CNA/so/ir</span></p>
