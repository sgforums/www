            <div class='col-md body'>AND I QUOTE<br>"Iraq? Nuclear capability? Weapons of mass destruction? Right.<br>I have more "nuclear capability" then Iraq ever had with my atomic fart."<br>**Suckball.com<br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v460/michellegsn/bush.jpg"><br><br>-------------------------<br><br>There are two dates in the last three or so years that will live in<br>infamy in the annals of history, dates of chilling resonance that have<br>come to symbolise things going from bad to worse, and from worse to<br>the unthinkable. The first is September 11, 2001. The second is<br>November 2, 2004.<br><br>November 2, 2004 will go down as one of the greatest man-made<br>disasters of modern times. The day when the people of the Land of the<br>Free exercised their freedom, and in doing so, exorcised that very<br>freedom. November 2; the day they chose to perpetuate the crazed<br>legacy of George W Bush for another four very long and traumatic four<br>years, a president who has, ever since the Great Florida Robbery in<br>'00, exercised his own freedom to fuck up his country and the world to<br>his merry heart's content.<br><br>It is difficult not to question the soundness of mind of a nation that<br>votes in, as a majority, a president who has left a trail of chaos in<br>his wake that beggars belief. It all began four years ago, when, to<br>secure an election that seemed destined to slip from the Republicans'<br>grasp, George Bush and his brother and Governor of Florida Jeb Bush<br>engineered tens of thousands of black people (read: Democrat<br>supporters) to be stripped of their constitutional right to vote. Bush<br>"won" the election by 537 votes, and would have under all scenarios<br>lost it anyway through the recount, had the Republicans not filed suit<br>to stop proceedings just in time, courtesy of their partisan Supreme<br>Court buddies.<br><br>With no mandate to govern, Bush set about governing anyway, the cheeky<br>fucker. It was never going to be pretty; Bush had proven in his<br>history of failure after failure that he is out of his depth in small<br>business, let alone running the world's largest ever economy. Hell,<br>some would say that George W Bush is out of his depth in a Third Grade<br>Spelling Bee. Debt was mounting, the economy was plunging deep into<br>recession, and the pressure had taken its toll on his golf swing. It<br>was quickly apparent Bush was a simple-minded jock whose insolent<br>smirk was increasingly fading to an expression of constant<br>bewilderment. The hard questions were being asked, and George Bush<br>didn't even understand what the questions meant, let alone know the<br>answer. He was a goofball, a stooge, a veritable feast for the Late<br>Night Television vultures to pick at. And hell, when you're making<br>this much of a mess of things, there's only one solution: Homer<br>Simpson's patented diversion technique Â– "Look over there Â– a bear!"<br><br>On September 11 that bear announced his arrival with a roar, when<br>aeroplanes tellingly devoid of Iraqis ploughed into The World Trade<br>Centre towers, the Pentagon, and a paddock in Pennsylvania. Bush's<br>gormless mug could barely hide the spark, the exuberance, the sinister<br>opportunism that lurked behind his steely yet glazed eyes. Behind the<br>scenes, Bush and his demented Machiavellian sidekicks Cheney,<br>Rumsfeld, Ashcroft et al could hardly disguise their excitement. For<br>decades, Cheney and Rummy had been praying for a new Pearl Harbor as a<br>catalyst to roll out their malignant agenda of neoconservative<br>totalitarianism. The rest is history. Under the guise of patriotism,<br>freedom of speech was jettisoned and civil liberties were ground into<br>dust. Criticism of the Bush Administration brought accusations of<br>treason and unexpected visits from the spooks, the Dixie Chicks<br>finding themselves spoken about in the same breath as Al Qaeda.<br><br>And then there was war. War, beautiful war. In a fleeting yet fiery<br>curtain-raiser, Afghanistan was invaded and quickly abandoned as soon<br>as its patsy president signed over the lucrative pipeline, left to<br>slip again into virtual anarchy with an American ground force<br>numbering fewer than the number of cops in New York City.<br>Afghanistan's pleas for further assistance fell on the deaf ears of<br>the Bush Administration, and the media that held Bush and his fellow<br>warlords in trembling deference.<br><br>Then came Iraq. The war in Iraq has been compared to Vietnam, but in<br>fact, the circumstances are more damning; Vietnam was a runaway train,<br>a war that began as a supposedly well-intentioned intrusion but then<br>blew nightmarishly out of proportion. Iraq, on the other hand was<br>pre-empted, premeditated, a war without any real threat, a cynically<br>and cold-bloodedly calculated foray that had less to do with<br>preventing the spread of a disagreeable ideology than of the USA's<br>unquenchable bloodlust for oil and influence.<br><br>And then there was, in Donald Rumsfeld's priceless words, "The Mother<br>of all Coalitions". Such an imposing and multitudinous coalition that<br>the United States only needed to take on 90% of the expense and<br>casualties. United States, Britain, Australia andÂ…erÂ….umÂ….Palau? Oh,<br>and lets not forget the likes of Italy and Spain, whose "responsible"<br>(Bush's words) governments contributed troops to the war against the<br>wishes of the vast majority of their citizens, who took to the streets<br>in their millions. Coalition of the Willing indeed.<br><br>This was no war of self-defense. This was no war of necessity. And to<br>call it a war of liberation is like calling a battery farm a wildlife<br>sanctuary. This was a war built on lies. An illegal war, without the<br>approval of the United Nations. A war without a shred of evidence of a<br>threat being posed aside from some highly creative "intelligence", and<br>devoid of any plan to stop the country from disintegrating into chaos.<br><br>A war that has killed at least 100,000 Iraqi civilians<br>One hundred thousand.<br>At least half of them women and children.<br>That's not collateral damage.<br>That's fucking genocide.<br><br>Saddam a threat? Saddam the threat? Bush had some fucking nerve. In<br>order to kill the same amount of civilians that Bush has murdered<br>under the rosy euphemism of "collateral damage", Saddam would have had<br>to repeat his much-maligned atrocity (The gassing of 5,000 Kurds<br>seventeen years ago, when Saddam was America's willing prison bitch)<br>at least twenty times. Bush claimed they were liberating the Iraqi<br>people. The increasingly docile Saddam couldn't have killed that many<br>people in the remainder of his lifespan if he'd bloody well tried.<br><br>And of course, it turned out that Saddam never had any weapons of mass<br>destruction. He was, in a military sense, impotent. The most dangerous<br>weapons he had were the rusty remnants of an arsenal that a Mr Donald<br>Rumsfeld had sold him in the late 80's. We did find some things. We<br>found out Saddam liked soft porn, and toilets made of pure gold, but<br>who doesn't? We found out he thoroughly enjoyed fine American cinema<br>such as The Godfather, and candy bars. We found out he was a romance<br>novelist, for fuck's sake! The poor guy just wanted to be friends with<br>us all along. He just wanted to be liked. The fact that he was an<br>unredeemable tyrant with an equal disregard for human life and<br>democracy is superfluous; if anything it should have given him and<br>Dubya some common ground. Poor Saddam just got off on the wrong foot<br>with us when he made the unforgivable mistake of, er, unilaterally<br>invading another oil-rich Middle Eastern country that was incapable of<br>defending itself. So we starved his people to death and then invaded<br>his country over a decade later just to serve the bastard right.<br><br>When the invasion came, it was with three words that the Bush<br>administration made it clear they were gunning for outright carnage<br>from the outset; Shock And Awe. Shock And Awe they did, the world<br>watching dumbstruck and helpless from their living rooms as hospitals<br>were flattened, schools reduced to twisted metal and charred,<br>miniature corpses, playgrounds and family homes turned into smoldering<br>tombs, limbless torsos draining claret into the rubble-strewn roads as<br>the survivors wailed in anguish. It has been said that a spin-off of<br>my Big Fat Greek Wedding was mooted in Hollywood. It never came to<br>fruition, after studio executives insisted that the film not end with<br>the wedding party being splattered by a well-meaning bunker blaster.<br><br>But now Saddam is gone, and the world is apparently a safer place. Was<br>it all worth it? Was it fuck.<br><br>The invasion that Bush has undertaken has, rather than make the world<br>a safer place, made the world a far more lethal place. The war in Iraq<br>has stirred up a tenacious unity in the Islamic world. Yesterday's<br>harmless Muslim mosque-squatter is today's unrepentant terrorist<br>determined to spill the blood of infidels. A generation of mighty<br>pissed-off people who have no qualms about killing, and no moral<br>distinction between killing an American soldier or a humanitarian<br>worker, or a Bali holidaymaker for that matter. People who are able to<br>alleviate their consciences with the plain fact that no matter how<br>many innocent Westerners they kill, the blood on their hands will be<br>small beans to how many innocent Arabs are killed by American hands.<br>Or guns. Or bombs. By invading Iraq, Bush has put the entire Western<br>World in peril.<br><br>And remember that the trouble abroad was designed to divert attention<br>from the trouble at home. "Look Â– a bear!" Bush has become the first<br>president since Hoover to lose jobs. He has turned a proud surplus<br>into a disastrous deficit, then has the gall to call the dull but<br>principled John Kerry a liberal spendthrift. He has lined the pockets<br>of his obscenely wealthy chums with hundreds of billions of dollars in<br>tax cuts, while teachers are forced to buy their own school supplies,<br>and parents are required, inconceivably, to buy body armour over the<br>internet for their sons and daughters in conflict. The Bush<br>Administration is the epitome of the abusive father who wastes his<br>entire salary buying rounds at the pub every night and picking fights<br>while his wife and children starve and huddle for warmth in a roofless<br>hovel. America continues to borrow $2 billion per day from the world,<br>and for all intents and purposes, is dead broke.<br><br>Bush's campaign tactic was ingenious; to dig the USA into a dire hole,<br>then, come election day, asserting that he himself is the only man<br>strong enough to dig the country back out. I got us into this mess,<br>only I can get us out of it, he seemed to be asking the American<br>people to believe. By making astonishingly stupid and disastrous<br>decisions and refusing to admit his mistakes, he has somehow managed<br>to euphemise this very foolhardiness, and has sold himself as a strong<br>leader who does what he says and doesn't back down. We should have<br>seen this coming Â– as Bush said once to the Swedish Prime Minister<br>mere months after being elected for the first time, "It's amazing I<br>won. I was running against peace, prosperity and incumbency."<br><br>In a mere four years, Dubya has turned a relatively safe and peaceful<br>world into an irreversible, terrifying vortex of conflict and hatred.<br>He has shunned practically every treaty and human rights agreement the<br>US has ever entered into, including the Kyoto Treaty, the Geneva<br>Convention, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and the Anti-Ballistic<br>Missile Treaties. He has invaded a troubled but ultimately harmless<br>country Â– "liberating" the people from a dictator who in the remaining<br>years of his life could not have come close to murdering as many Iraqi<br>civilians that Bush has managed to in a year and a half. He has<br>stirred the latent, disgruntled Muslim community into a thriving<br>nursery for terrorists, and then had the audacity to campaign on his<br>ability to protect the American people from the very threat that he<br>has unleashed. He has rebuked every country that has wisely chosen to<br>pass on his crusade of wanton imperialist conquest, and made a mockery<br>of the very pillars of International Law that the United States helped<br>found in good faith.<br><br>He has dismantled a strong US economy, and driven his nation into a<br>mire of debt. He has pandered to the extreme religious right,<br>shoehorning religious prejudices into legislation. He has actively<br>marginalised minorities, and run roughshod over civil liberties. He<br>has stirred up hate, division and desperation in his nation, and<br>cynically used it to his advantage. Is this the work of a patriot who<br>loves his country?<br><br>It is of little surprise to see that the states responsible for voting<br>in the Christian Cowboy for a Second Coming were the middle and<br>southern states of America. On a map showing which states voted<br>Republican (red) and which voted Democrat (blue), the country<br>resembled the broad face of a fat sunburnt Texan with blue sideburns.<br>These states - the Alabamas, the Texases, the Georgias, the Utahs, the<br>Mississipis - are the ignorant plains of pitchforks and shotguns,<br>inbreds and Amish, rednecks still smarting from the abolition of<br>slavery. People bound to and blinded by reactionary and repressive<br>religious "values". Gun-happy hicks thrilled at their nation partaking<br>in a war in a distant world that is irrelevant to their sequestered<br>small-town lives. These are people who own three guns to every<br>passport, and anything regarded as progressive, pragmatic and sensible<br>is rubbished as liberal, weak and intellectual. These are people who<br>make their own buffalo look smart.<br><br>This is where half the people are unable to find Mexico on an<br>unlabelled map, where two in five people have been "abducted" by<br>aliens and / or believe that Elvis is alive, where people believe<br>unwaveringly that homosexuality is a symptom of demon possession,<br>where people genuinely believe that it is only a matter of time before<br>these mythical terrorists strike the barn dance in their prairie<br>village. A place where genetically cursed hillbillies strum banjos and<br>shoot cats, the land of the God-fearers and the Godforsaken, of<br>Stepford Wives and trailer trash, an unholy yet terrifyingly holy<br>hybrid of Jerry Falwell and Jerry Springer country. These are the<br>people who gave us country and western music. They should never have<br>been allowed to fucking vote.<br><br>And yet these are the people who decide the leader of the Free World.<br>That's right. George Bush has once again been inflicted upon us by the<br>likes of Ned Flanders and Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel.<br><br>America does have open-minded, politically acute, and culturally aware<br>people. They're generally found in the blue states on the eastern and<br>Western seaboards. It seems that knowing what the ocean looks like<br>does wonders for one's sanity and sense of judgment.<br><br>But while they certainly exist, they're in the minority. And because<br>they usually believe in civil liberties such as contraception and<br>abortion while the people in the Republican districts tend to oppose<br>such evils, the Republicans will continue to breed at a faster rate<br>than the Democrats. We're in for this madness for the long run. So<br>long as the Republicans continue to lie, they will have this gullible<br>sub-nation of fanatical ignoramuses in the palm of their oily,<br>oft-rubbed hands. And lying is one market the GOP have cornered. If<br>Bush were Pinocchio, his nose would stretch from one end of Texas to<br>the other, his puppet strings being pulled by the Geppetto (or is that<br>Gestapo?) personified by the monstrous Dick Cheney. Relying on<br>Hitler's theory that a lie repeated often enough will become the truth<br>in the mind of its beholder, the Bush Administration have taken<br>Hitler's ball, run with it, and spiked it in the endzone. Over half of<br>America actually believes that weapons of mass destruction were found<br>in Iraq. And over half belief that Bush is a trained fighter pilot,<br>courtesy solely from his costumed photo-op on an aircraft carrier.<br>There is little hope for this nation that appears to be getting dumber<br>by the day.<br><br>Naive political commentators have suggested that Bush will be treading<br>a more careful path over the next four years. What a load of<br>horseshit. With an increased majority in the House of Representatives<br>and the Senate, and over 50% of the national vote, the Republicans<br>will see this as a mandate to continue their insane rampage of<br>shameless corruption, secret dealings, ideological repression and<br>violent world domination. Bush's ego will continue to swell, and Dick<br>Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, increasingly senile and living on borrowed<br>time, will only want to hasten America's march of global plunder. I<br>shudder to think of the state of the world in four years time. If<br>Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld had been in charge during the Cuban Missile<br>Crisis, we'd be radioactive cockroach food.<br><br>Our only relief can be that we are lucky enough to live in a liberal<br>country sequestered and forgotten in the far corner of the world, a<br>country where even a golden handshake or the internment of a singular<br>suspected terrorist causes a national scandal. When Bush brings his<br>patented brand of intercontinental havoc to the world over the next<br>four years, let's hope we are overlooked. And if Rodney Hide's the<br>scariest thing our right wing has to offer, bring the rabid little<br>ankle-biter on.</div>
