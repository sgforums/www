Is automatic gear better or manual? i personally prefer manual. </strong><br><br>Not necessarily...I find that for lower CC cars, manual is definitely better due to the lack of power.  Also, Manual transmission cars are more fuel economical and have less problems with the tranny as compared to autos.<br><br><strong>2. How does this COE thing work? Do i have to pay one shot 10 years or what ?</strong><br><br>No, unless you're buying a brand new car.  Pervailing COEs or cars that are extending COEs can go for the 5 year option but once it's over, you cannot renew the COE for the third time (means 5 years later confirmed scrap metal).<br><br><strong>3. And if i want to send my vehicle for inspection before buying it, how to go about doing it? Which is better, Automobile Assn of Singapore or Vicom?</strong><br><br>Just give a call to either AAS or Viacom.  They will be glad to arrange for an inspection for you.  I find that AAS is slightly better than Viacom coz the Viacom receptionist had an attitude problem (The one at Bt Batok that is..)<br><br>Hope all this helps...<br><br></div>

Pervailing COEs or cars that are extending COEs can go for the 5 year option but once it's over, you cannot renew the COE for the third time (means 5 years later confirmed scrap metal). "<br><br>Please and thank you.<br><br></div></blockquote>You do not have to buy COE 1 shot for 10 years if your car is secondhand and it's 10th year is coming up... New cars have a COE that lasts for 10 years.  After the first 10 year period, you have a choice of 2 types of COE to renew.  1 is the 5 year option.  It's cheaper (Â½ price) but you cannot renew it once the car is 15 years old and is therefore gonna become scrap metal.<br><br>The other option is to keep renewing the COE for another 10 years which makes the total car age at the time of 2nd COE expiry to 20 years.<br><br></div>

Much much loaded than me. He's got his Toyota, his father's Audi 100 and a Mercedes.<br><br>He's got friends working in motor workshops who can 'help' him to pass his Vicom Car Inspection.

            <div class='col-md body'>3 owners for the Civic???? Habis, gone case, finished... U can trash it liao. Dunno crash how many times liao.<br><br>Might as well go for the Sunny, but see if u can bring the price down lower... bargain a little? Say.... $48K???<br><br>Dun be so impaitent as of yet, look at other options besides the Sunny and Civic (aiyah, Civic can forget it liao). I am sure u can find a better bargain.<br><br>And always remember to bargain wif the salesman! $47-48K for the Nissan shld be okay.<br><br>And remember, CHECK FOR SIGNZ OF WELDING ON THE BUMPERS AND UNDER THE BONNET COVER! ALSO CHECK FOR RESPRAY WORKS.</div>

I have given up on that civic, coz it has been slighly modified before. The sunny is not bad, but like you say if i really want it, i have to neg the price and send for inspection before making any decision.<br><br>Thanks for your comment anyway.<br><br>Anymore comments from you people out there ??<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
