What matters most is your Attitude - Be rich in your thought &amp; attitude just like what Creative's Sim WH . Rich but always not flaunting &amp; caring for the less well off. I believe other Bizmen of his status wld cash out &amp; retire alrdy - not continuing to work hard. Again our society is at fault always look down on other merely judging on appearance. ----------- shallow View ------------</div>
