Maybe I "ang-moh" very poor, but I didn't see any apologies.<br><br>What he did in the post was to scold me an asshole, and in the same thread, says when did he ever scold me an asshole. Such people are actually very nice people who always forget, and since they have forgotten, forgiving comes automatically.<br><br>I just have to apologise that I do not have an auto-delete function in my brain, and that I usually forgive but do not forget. But in the case when the agressor directs the agression on my frens, I dun usually forgive, let alone forget.<br><br>I apologise for using some vulgarity here. For those who feel that I'm very rude, let me tell you something, during his Jackchen days, GBM was much much worse than this... and I mean it... much much much worse...<br><br>GBM, u're just a bastard and loser who have nothing better to do, and tries to stay in a place where you are very much hated. You can just fuck off from this place and give us some peace. You tried to get this website delisted by complaining to Geocities(or at least threaten to do so), and when you failed, you come back like nothing have ever happen before...<br><br>Guess shameless people will remain that way... if you're that great, go concentrate on your website and make it as successful as this one... don't come in and tell people how great you are, who interviewed you, etc, etc...<br><br>I dunno how old you are, but by reading the rest of the posts, you must be quite young...

            <div class='col-md body'>i actually wanted to skip this whole topic initially, but i really cannot deal with this self-righteousness. gdbkmark/jackchen whatever you want to call yourself, don't you think it's such a wierd coincidence that regardless of your nick people always dislike you? and yet, you can still blame others. you claim we're prejudiced, you claim we've oversensitive, you claim we have a bone to pick with you. are you sure? if you want to start anew, and put all the bad stuff behind you because you really enjoy this forum and want to contribute, fine, we can understand this. but to make the same mistake twice? and still claim that it's our fault? there's something seriously wrong.<br><br>i've blasted you before regarding loletta, but this isn't revenge. yes, you have a right to criticise, to nitpick and insult others, but there is a limit. sometimes, jokes just aren't that funny. look at the thread on romantic stories... why did you have to go ruin it? it was a sweet thread, with lots of touching stories and you just had to poke your nose in. ever heard of not saying anything when you don't have anything to say? some things are sacred, and should remain such, and not 'blasphemised' by 'bohliao' remarks or thoughtless insults. yes, you can choose to exercise your right to a freedom of speech, just like we can choose to take offence and blast you. the same theory that covers your ass covers ours.<br><br>i seriously object to you claiming you have 'won' all the arguments. reading it just makes me want to laugh. how does one argue against unreasonable arguments? how does one carry out an intelligent 'debate' with someone who refuses to listen, who won't even bother to make logical points? frankly, any 'conversation' with you is pointless. reading your posts fill me with a sense of rage at your stupidity and yet... full of pity. that you can actually imagine you're right. that you're so good in self-denial you can turn around and blame us for it.<br><br>i have been rather harsh throughout this post, but i won't apologize, 'cos i mean every word i said. i hope you can actually bother to read what im saying instead of skipping it and thking you know exactly what i said after picking out all the insults. im sure most forumites would agree with most of my points... minus the 'criticisms' of course.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>-------------------------------<br>i hate to have my first post after such a long time be another one blasting someone. but sorry guys, i couldnt resist! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>------------------<br>I believe in the sun, even when it is not shining.<br>I believe in love, even when i do not feel it.<br>I believe in God, even when He is silent.</div>
