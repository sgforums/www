            <div class='col-md body'>i guess its difficult .. i mean .. when a baby is adopted as young as a few months old, the baby doesn`t have the ability to choose .. and its difficult to know how the parents are going to treat the baby. i guess the only thing to do is make sure that the parents treat the child properly .. other than that its hard to do anything else .. you think ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Uhm..adoption is an extremely complicated process where you go through all sorts of procedures just to get a 15% chance of having a child at the end of it.<br><br>I personally know a couple who tried to adopt. If you do it through China, you have to pay for the 9 months expenses incurred by the mother, and she has 1 month post birth to decide if she wants to really give the child up to you. The expenses that you have paid are non refundable regardless of the outcome, by the way. Average expenses for all this stuff is around 30 thousand American dollars. I don't remember if it includes transportation of the child to the United States.<br><br>Do keep in mind that the alternative is a surrogate mother, in which case it costs $16,000 for a 25% chance of the mother getting pregnant, and this chance is furnished with the implant of no less than 5 fertilized embryos.<br><br>As for child treatment issues, those are usually pretty much covered by American laws and constitutional rights. You can get jailed for spanking your kid these days.<br><br>Don't forget that a child who is up for adoption has two 'bad' choices. Take a risk and be a maid, or be treated like a normal child, or the alternative is to go back to the life which forced them to go to the idea of adoption in the first place.<br><br>As for gay/lesbian marriage adoption problems, I have no comment as this is too sensitive a topic.<br><br>Au revoir!<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>
