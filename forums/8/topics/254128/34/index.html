What I said was, the forummers here were too harsh in their comments. If that kid concern is related to them, will the forummers still post such harsh comments in sg forum?? This is my point. I am not trying to say the police or judge to be lenient just because the offender concern is related to them.

I shant post any more in this topic as I can see that further posting will be merely clarification to those who dun read my post carefully and think I am blindly protecting the teen concern. NO! I am not. I dun really care if the guy is from HCI or just from neighboring sch. If the teen concern is from neighbouring sch , my stand is still the same. No jailing....but yes to probation and caning. My path of career is very related to academic though not really related to MOE. And maybe because of this, I would really wish that all teens who commit mistakes in their youth should not be rob away their chance of getting educated.<br>This may be a childish and naive dream but who cares.....</div>
