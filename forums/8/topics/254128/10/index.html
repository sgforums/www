            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz, I think all of us have to look at our assumptions and speculations, it's almost like we are holding 'trail by media', which I feel is unfair to both parties involved in the incident. Yes, the boy is from Hwa Chong, and represents the 'cream of the crop' and as such his actions are viewed as a sign of impunity and arrogance. However, his actions too are reflective of a teenager failing to keep check of his emotions and temprements. Thus, instead of punishing with impunity for every misdemeanour, we should look at the root of his actions and instead elect to help him rememdy his behavior. Punishing him with a criminal record will certainly do the trick some will argue, but then the correction will only go so far as the individual fears the reprisals of the system. Doing the right thing should not be doing the right thing out of fear, but the right thing because from the onset, it is the right thing to do.</div>
