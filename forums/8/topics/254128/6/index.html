            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by dbowie:<br>Just as Mr Wong was about to issue her a retention slip telling her to contact TransitLink, he said the male student snatched the ez-link card from his hand. Both students then went and sat down.  Mr Wong quickly pressed the emergency help button to alert the operations control centre that he was having trouble.  The control centre's operator advised him to drive ahead slowly while waiting for the traffic inspector to catch up with the bus and assist him.<br><br>Six bus-stops later, a passenger wanted to alight said Mr Wong in Mandarin: <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">''I asked the passenger to alight from the front door as I was afraid the students would try to leave</span>.''</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">True enough, he said the students tried to make a dash for it.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He then stopped the bus and stood at the front exit blocking them.</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">He said: ''I held out both my arms and held the poles on either side of the bus to prevent them from leaving.  ''The female student tried to leave,but I refused to budge.</span></strong><br><br>Next thing I knew, the male student punched me on the left side of my face.''<br><br>He said he stumbled forward and fell on the floor, hitting the driver's seat.<br>He claimed that the male student allegedly continued to hit him. Inthe process, Mr Wong's shirt pocket was torn. ''I was too shocked to react. I couldn't believe a kid was beating me,'' Said Mr Wong.  It stopped only after a male passenger came forward to restrain the student, who struggled and shouted until the passenger let go.<br></blockquote>I doubt he would dare do that to any angry adult bigger size than him.  The bus driver purposely stood at the exit to block the two kids from leaving.  SOP does not state that he must do such an act and risk getting a beating in order to detain the 80 cents card.  He was clearly picking on the students and deserved what he got in any case.</div>
