DO YOU THINK THAT JUST BY GIVING HIM PROBATION will he be calmed? let him do community service and at least he will learn to help people and not to be rude to ELDERS. the key word is ELDERS. if he assaulted the bus captain until he was in a coma, i would say he deserved at least 10 years of jail term but in this case, he DID NOT. he needs a punishment which will calm him down and by putting him on probation, it works. but do you think he will repent after that? he will feel that its NOTHING. let him DO SOME WORK in community to learn some hardship. by probating him, do u think he learns hardship? HE DID USE VIOLENCE. but just by that violence, the police came, proving that he's actually SCARED OF THE POLICE. he did bluff though. if he did another offence, he should be given a severe punishment.</div>
