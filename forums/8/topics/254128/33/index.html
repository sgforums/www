If you must reference my use of 'manual-control', at least read my statement carefully before 'jumping the gun'. Each bus has an internal and external manual activation. Since the bus driver is so sure that the students will make a dash for it, why continue to remotely activate it?<br><br>By getting out of his seat and manually activating the door, he will have made his intentions clear to both. And this applies only for one bus stop, after which he waits for the inspector to arrive and 'offload' the errant students.<br><br>Alternatively, if he wants an air-tight senario, he can politely inform the passenger to wait for the inspector to arrive before he can de-bus, ensuring both students have nowhere to run.<br><br>What made you think i was implying that he manually opens and closes for every bus stop right up to the interchange?<br><br><span style="color: red;">[b]<span style="font-style: italic;">he asked the gal to hand over the card but the bf snatched it back, i think this warrant for suspicion, furthermore he already radio the HQ for advice yet the couple tried to flee, which make them more guilty.</span></span></strong><br><br>Whether the above action constitutes guilt or innocence is your perspective, and not FACT. You seemed to have ignored my earlier post concerning the convenient habit of people 'picking up' the ez-link cards that others may have accidentally dropped and use as their own.<br><br>Is that considered petty thievery? Or products of opportunity? Are you so simplistic to pass judgement based on speculation? You seem to be firmly (blindly) on the driver's side before the student has a chance to officially defend himself, while basing your comments on press statements. By your own yardstick, are you not conveniently generalising?<br><br>Learn a little more about how people twist and turn when providing police statements, and where a reliable version of events counts more than what actually happened, before commenting.

Before the person is actually convicted, he is already found guilty by a jury of his peers.<br><br>I recall an incident a few years back when a women accused a swimming instructor of 'molesting' her in a swimming complex. Because he was charged, his name and job description was published. He was subsequently acquitted, and even the judge said he had no case to answer to. Despite that, his reputation and job was already in tatters, all because the mob 'convicted' him based on a false accusation.<br><br>No one is disputing that the student deserves some punitive punishment for assault. But since none of us were physically at the scene, should we lynch him based on what others say?<br><br>As to the driver's actions, i believe he could have handled the situation better. And his outright confiscation would surely have infurated anyone, not just the student. Did he explain that the card may be 'illegal' before asking for it?  Or did he explain this fact only after he had the card in hand? Would the student have beaten the driver if he had performed the former? </div></blockquote>even if he is convicted, he can still cry foul n we can find ppl like u who think he is innocent.<br>so there is no need for witness lah since we cannot put their statement as evidence, pls grow up  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>did u know he didn't explain??<br>u know the student won't beat the bus driver? what r u, his ringworm huh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
