With the number of people who lose things like ez-link cards and people who pick them up (scavangers so to speak), should the immediate reaction of the bus driver be that the student (girl) 'stole' the card?<br><br>Was he dilligently trying to score points by 'catching red-handed' a perceived thief without adequate proof based on mere suspicion? Even police officers require a warrent before searching someone's apartment, yet this driver took it upon himself to play the role of cop, attempting to block the students from 'running away'.<br><br>While the student's overly aggressive response should not be overlooked and merits punitive punishment, was the bus driver oversealous in his approach? I have met my fair share of bus drivers and many of them are also uncouth, rude and bad-tempered. I hardly believe this particular driver forms the minority of 'nice drivers'.<br><br>Instead of attempting to bar the students, he should have radioed SBS transit for advice, have them ferry the closest inspector to his location and stop the bus at the next bus-stop. To prevent them from leaving the bus, he should have left his seat and engage the manual door activation to allow the passenger to alight and then close it back to prevent the students from attempting their 'getaway'. From the story, it seems he opened the doors using the standard remote activation system from the driver's seat, which was a mistake since he guessed correctly that the students would try to make a run for it.<br><br>Then again, with all the witnesses giving the driver the sympathy vote, there's isn't much hope for the student already. </div></blockquote>this shows that you do not know what's happening now.  you are saying that the bus driver is trying to act as a cop so as to earn merit points from the bus company. EVERY BUS CAPTAIN HAS THE RIGHT TO ACT AS A COP if he/she deemed that if this person is using a stolen card, he HAS THE RIGHT to take it away from him. the immediate reaction of the bus captain DO NOT MEAN that the girl has stole the ezlink card. every bus captain's reaction react THIS WAY when he/she feels that someone stole another person's card.<br><br>nextly, this may not be one "nice driver as you said". but at least this bus captain enforces the bus company's law, in which the bus company should/might give him a merit for it.<br><br>thirdly, the bus captain might be at fault, but HE DID try to bar them from leaving. don't forget, if the student and his girlfriend is still in the bus, when the bus inspector come after the bus driver radioed to SBS Transit, for the bus inspector to go in, the front/back door will have to be opened,where they might even make a dash for it once more. even if the driver's door opens and the driver gets out, they can even go out from the drivers door when the bus captain is not looking since the bus captain would most likely be outside the bus. you said about the manual door activation, DON'T FORGET they can make a run from it still, by actually crouching underneath the bus captain. the bus captain couldn't be that fat.<br><br>lastly, giving the driver the sympathy vote is correct because the boy DID PUNCH the bus captain, who is more elder than him. by punching the bus captain, he is showing disrespectfulness to someone who is actually older than him and furthermore do you think people will actually support this person who is only in his adolescence who just punch someone who might be already 50 something years old? there still is hope for this student since people will most likely forget this incident already anyway.</div>

According to eye witness accounts which i read from TNP ( which might just be sensationalised, I would never noe ) i think the student should be prosecuted and given a serious warning.. yes he should be prosecuted, but take note he's only 17 and needs the 2nd chance.. but he has to learn the lesson. let's not destroy his future just yet .. not at 17.. so i believe a warning with some form of counselling or community service might do the trick..<br><br>I also personally hope that he apologizes for what he has done.

And certainly not granted a free pass through some curious sociological phenomenon.<br><br>Generally, respect is shown to a sign of legitimate authority, not the person holding that sign.

            <div class='col-md body'>The student should be canned and assigned with corrective work order. But I tink expulsion from sch or jailing is a bit overboard. Everyone should not be denied a chance of education, by expelling him is equivalent to denying him of a chance to receive educations.<br>Public shaming to a reasonable extent is good, so that it serve as a punishment to this kid and a deterrent to the others.<br>Btw, many ppl here are to anti-elites....Think if that person is ur child or sibling ...will u say the same thing??<br>I am not trying to defend this kid but I feel certain punishments stated by forumers here  are too harsh.</div>
