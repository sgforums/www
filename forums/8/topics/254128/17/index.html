            <div class='col-md body'>IsnÂ’t it refreshing how when such a controversy occurs, suddenly many judicial officials and prosecutors appear online to give their say on such a matter? Seriously, as much as we as citizens of Singapore are entitled to their own opinion, I believe that this media persecution of sorts have been carried too far.<br><br>First of all, to the moralists out there who seem to be well informed of the entire incident, IÂ’ll like to challenge you to look at your source and how viable it is. From my knowledge (which might be wrong, and if so, pardon me), most of your information comes from a particular tabloid called The New Paper. Let me (as a mere being) remind you that it IS a tabloid. Tabloids do provide information, yes. But is the information dissipated 100% accurate? This is regrettably unable to be confirmed. Yet somehow or another, many moralists that seem to lurk this board seem to pounce on every bit of information encapsulated, and seem to buy all the information provided by a tabloid. A tabloid. A mere medium of information that contains some forms of untrue news. How can you moralists, sit on your high horse and accept all the information provided without any questioning?<br><br>What about the boy? Sure, he does come from a so-called elite school, but nonetheless, he IS still a boy. Just like the neighbourhood 17 year old geek, or the 17 year old beng from the opposite street. Being from an elite school, should not warrant him any special mention when compared to that of another delinquent from some other school. Expecting more out of an adolescent due to background is unfair.<br><br>What about his personality? It is curious that upon reading the tabloid article, half of the moralists here seem to know him personally, and to a close proximity at that. Names like Â“BengÂ” or Â“gangsterÂ” have been unjustly stereotyped onto him. But is he really a gangster? Or a neighbourhood scoundrel? No one here knows him personally, and hence none of us should come to a conclusion on the type of person he is. Yes, perhaps he is a troubled child. A troubled child who flares at the slightest provocation and attacks the nearest perpetrator, causing significant bodily harm. But he could also be a hearty teenager, who at a momentÂ’s weakness, attacked the bus driver out of impulse. No one here knows who he isÂ… or how he is as a person. It isnÂ’t fair to slap stereotypes of Â‘scoundrelsÂ’, Â‘delinquentsÂ’ and Â‘BengÂ’ on him, just because he hit the bus driver, details courtesy of a single tabloid. Ultimately, none of us know him personally, and hence cannot criticize him as a person. However, we CAN criticize his actions. And I am saddened that most here have expressed choice words on the boyÂ’s character instead.<br><br>His friends know him wellÂ…the school knows him wellÂ… his parents know him well. If I might refer to the comment Â“well-behaved and good studentÂ” from the school, I would like to point out that there is a good chance that this is an accurate representation of the boy. However, many of you swept it under the carpet, claiming this to be bullcrap. But in reality, no one knows what type of a person he is, and hence no concrete comment/evidence should be entirely disregarded. Also, the fact that his father would kneel down for mercy, speaks volumes of what the father expects from the child. Certainly, the father of a delinquent would not simply kneel down for mercy, especially if he had to do so several times beforehand.<br><br>And the bus driver? No doubt what he had done was in his line of duty, and as a proud worker of the company, he stuck to policy and did what he had to do. Many of the moralists around here seem to realize that, and thatÂ’s good. But perhaps the attitude, tone and action that was taken by the bus driver might have veered off course? Perhaps what transpired between the grabbing of the girlÂ’s hand sparked off a protectionist impulse from the sensitive boy? No, IÂ’m not condemning what the bus driver did or said. But perhaps, there was a better of handling things? Maybe a polite tone and a non-physical action taken would have been more appropriate? Do bear in mind that I am of the stand that the bus driver did what he had to do in his line of duty. But howeverÂ… could there perhaps have been a better way of tackling things?<br><br>Then perhaps counters to my arguments put forth would bring up the eye-witness accounts of a certain Canadian passenger. But that leads me back to the point that The New Paper is, and functions as, a tabloid. While it would be a huge accusation to completely dismiss the eye-witness account as false, but isnÂ’t there a glimmer of a possibility that that piece of evidence is fabricated? Nothing is conclusive however, and hence I urge everyone here, especially the moralists on a persecuting row, to take all information provided with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Indeed, if allegations of the boy hitting the bus driver was true, the boy is definitely to blame.

            <div class='col-md body'>i remembered long time ago there's an article in newpaper about "elite school"s' students vs neighbourhood sch students.<br><br>They did some surveys and conclude neighbourhood students are "stupid" in the sense that they do bad things (potang, bad discipline, copying, late, never do homework, watch porn, bullying, etc) but dunno how to hide it well, how at least hide it convincingly. For example, a neighbourhood student who copied and scored and was not caught, tend to showoff to his other peers, hence exposing himself, risking himself to being caught the next time (someone jealous may report him, or some may copy his method of copying and may be caught).<br><br>The eilite school students also do the same bad things, but as they also excel in their results and dun broadcast the bad stuff they do, they seldom get caught. Even if they are caught, (example: watch porn, copying) by parents, their parents tend to let them off believing its only a one-time thing as their child is very smart and gets As for his tests and exams.<br><br>Dunno if anyone recall that article.</div>
