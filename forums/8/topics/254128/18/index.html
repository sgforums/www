            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Empathy90:</div><div class="quote_body">IsnÂ’t it refreshing how when such a controversy occurs, suddenly many judicial officials and prosecutors appear online to give their say on such a matter? Seriously, as much as we as citizens of Singapore are entitled to their own opinion, I believe that this media persecution of sorts have been carried too far.<br><br>First of all, to the moralists out there who seem to be well informed of the entire incident, IÂ’ll like to challenge you to look at your source and how viable it is. From my knowledge (which might be wrong, and if so, pardon me), most of your information comes from a particular tabloid called The New Paper. Let me (as a mere being) remind you that it IS a tabloid. Tabloids do provide information, yes. But is the information dissipated 100% accurate? This is regrettably unable to be confirmed. Yet somehow or another, many moralists that seem to lurk this board seem to pounce on every bit of information encapsulated, and seem to buy all the information provided by a tabloid. A tabloid. A mere medium of information that contains some forms of untrue news. How can you moralists, sit on your high horse and accept all the information provided without any questioning?<br><br><span style="color: red;">hallo, bashing someone just to get away tell us much about a person character. i am no moralist, i don't have a horse  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>What about the boy? Sure, he does come from a so-called elite school, but nonetheless, he IS still a boy. Just like the neighbourhood 17 year old geek, or the 17 year old beng from the opposite street. Being from an elite school, should not warrant him any special mention when compared to that of another delinquent from some other school. Expecting more out of an adolescent due to background is unfair.<br><br><span style="color: red;">we expect him to be logical, hitting someone isn't logical  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>What about his personality? It is curious that upon reading the tabloid article, half of the moralists here seem to know him personally, and to a close proximity at that. Names like Â“BengÂ” or Â“gangsterÂ” have been unjustly stereotyped onto him. But is he really a gangster? Or a neighbourhood scoundrel? No one here knows him personally, and hence none of us should come to a conclusion on the type of person he is. Yes, perhaps he is a troubled child. A troubled child who flares at the slightest provocation and attacks the nearest perpetrator, causing significant bodily harm. But he could also be a hearty teenager, who at a momentÂ’s weakness, attacked the bus driver out of impulse. No one here knows who he isÂ… or how he is as a person. It isnÂ’t fair to slap stereotypes of Â‘scoundrelsÂ’, Â‘delinquentsÂ’ and Â‘BengÂ’ on him, just because he hit the bus driver, details courtesy of a single tabloid. Ultimately, none of us know him personally, and hence cannot criticize him as a person. However, we CAN criticize his actions. And I am saddened that most here have expressed choice words on the boyÂ’s character instead.<br><br><span style="color: red;">hitting anyone just isn't right. i condemn his actions not his character since i don't even know him </span><br><br>His friends know him wellÂ…the school knows him wellÂ… his parents know him well. If I might refer to the comment Â“well-behaved and good studentÂ” from the school, I would like to point out that there is a good chance that this is an accurate representation of the boy. However, many of you swept it under the carpet, claiming this to be bullcrap. But in reality, no one knows what type of a person he is, and hence no concrete comment/evidence should be entirely disregarded. Also, the fact that his father would kneel down for mercy, speaks volumes of what the father expects from the child. Certainly, the father of a delinquent would not simply kneel down for mercy, especially if he had to do so several times beforehand.<br><br><span style="color: red;">i have posted earlier, most teachers wrote "well-behaved and good student" as a remark on their students' report books becos they don't know much of their students. most of my form teachers don't know me at all or seldom bother to know me, their remarks in my report book r "quiet, well-behaved n gd student, capable of higher grades"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>And the bus driver? No doubt what he had done was in his line of duty, and as a proud worker of the company, he stuck to policy and did what he had to do. Many of the moralists around here seem to realize that, and thatÂ’s good. But perhaps the attitude, tone and action that was taken by the bus driver might have veered off course? Perhaps what transpired between the grabbing of the girlÂ’s hand sparked off a protectionist impulse from the sensitive boy? No, IÂ’m not condemning what the bus driver did or said. But perhaps, there was a better of handling things? Maybe a polite tone and a non-physical action taken would have been more appropriate? Do bear in mind that I am of the stand that the bus driver did what he had to do in his line of duty. But howeverÂ… could there perhaps have been a better way of tackling things?<br><br><span style="color: red;">r u there?? do u know he didn't give a verbal warning b4 he grabbed the gal's arm, even if he did not give a verbal warning, it may becos the gal n the guy were rushing for the door hence he has to act fast.  all these r assumptions cos we r not there. </span><br><br>Then perhaps counters to my arguments put forth would bring up the eye-witness accounts of a certain Canadian passenger. But that leads me back to the point that The New Paper is, and functions as, a tabloid. While it would be a huge accusation to completely dismiss the eye-witness account as false, but isnÂ’t there a glimmer of a possibility that that piece of evidence is fabricated? Nothing is conclusive however, and hence I urge everyone here, especially the moralists on a persecuting row, to take all information provided with a pinch of salt.<br><br>Indeed, if allegations of the boy hitting the bus driver was true, the boy is definitely to blame. But then one must ask themselves, does the blame fall solely on the boy? Or should the bus driver as a mature, and perhaps respected person of society bear a small portion of the blame too?<br></div></blockquote>the hitting part sure is true  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>yalor, the parents oso have to share the blame  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
