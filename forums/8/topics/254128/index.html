I kept repeating my explanation, but he refused to listen.''<br>Just as Mr Wong was about to issue her a retention slip telling ehr to contact TransitLink, he said the male student snatched the ez-link card from his hand.<br>Bot students then went and sat down.<br>Mr Wong quickly pressed the emergency help button to alert the operations control centre that he was having trouble.<br>The control centre's operator advised him to drive ahead slowly while waiting for the traffic inspector to catch up with the bus and assist him.<br>Six bus-stops later, a passenger wanted to alight<br>Said Mr Wong in Mandarin: ''I asked the passenger to alight from the front door as I was afraid the students would try to leave.''<br>True enough, he said the students tried to make a dash for it.<br>He then stopped the bus and stood at the front exit blocking them.<br>He said: ''I held out both my arms and held the poles on either side of the bus to prevent them from leaving.<br>''The female student tried to leave,but I refused to budge. Next thing I knew, the male student punched me on the left side of my face.''<br>He said he stumbled forward and fell on the floor, hitting the driver's seat.<br>He claimed that the male student allegedly continued to hit him. Inthe process, Mr Wong's shirt pocket was torn. ''I was too shocked to react. I couldn't believe a kid was beating me,'' Said Mr Wong.<br>It stopped only after a male passenger came forward to restrain the student, who struggled and shouted until the passenger let go.<br>''The passenger has to hold him back by both his arms, or he would have continued to beat me. Some of the female passengers started to scold him,''<br>Mr Wong recounted.<br><br>nabei la you scrimp 80cent and wanted me to post full how about you do it<br><br></div>
