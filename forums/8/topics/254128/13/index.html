Don't you know that the yellow ribbon project is having trouble taking off? There is still a heavy stereotype placed on ex-convicts.<br><br>If you kill me, I will hate you. You will be punished, given the death sentence and when justice has been served, I will forgive you. Likewise, when justice has been served on the boy, he should be forgiven.<br><br>100 hours of community service, coupled with a $10,000 fine and a severe rebuke by the judge should be enough. The boy cried right? He's not mature enough and mentally tough yet. I believe he's going through a lot of remorse now. Remorse can be mentally torturous and exhausting.<br><br>When was the last time you felt remorse and needed forgiveness?</div>
