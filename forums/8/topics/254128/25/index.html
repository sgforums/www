            <div class='col-md body'>the reason why i said that he should be jailed for his doing, is because, he is from a very educated school and he should be more civilised, but look at his behaviour, first he try to run away, if you are innocent, would you try to run away, but what did he did, he punched a bus driver, and what happen, he has to be restrained, which means that he is out of control<br><br>if these sort of person was to be let go with just a mere warning, how will the rest of the students think?<br><br>we can't just close one eye, just because he is young, nowadays teenage has not been respectful to others, they must be taught that, if you make a mistake, you should own up to it, and apologise, instead of, father beg for forgiveness for your own fault, that is what pissed me off<br><br>if he owns up to his mistake, instead of claiming, it was an accident, and apologise for his doing, maybe he should be let go with an warning</div>
