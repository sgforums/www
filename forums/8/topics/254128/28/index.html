EVERY BUS CAPTAIN HAS THE RIGHT TO ACT AS A COP if he/she deemed that if this person is using a stolen card, he HAS THE RIGHT to take it away from him. the immediate reaction of the bus captain DO NOT MEAN that the girl has stole the ezlink card. every bus captain's reaction react THIS WAY when he/she feels that someone stole another person's card.<br><br>nextly, this may not be one "nice driver as you said". but at least this bus captain enforces the bus company's law, in which the bus company should/might give him a merit for it.<br><br>thirdly, the bus captain might be at fault, but HE DID try to bar them from leaving. don't forget, if the student and his girlfriend is still in the bus, when the bus inspector come after the bus driver radioed to SBS Transit, for the bus inspector to go in, the front/back door will have to be opened,where they might even make a dash for it once more. even if the driver's door opens and the driver gets out, they can even go out from the drivers door when the bus captain is not looking since the bus captain would most likely be outside the bus. you said about the manual door activation, DON'T FORGET they can make a run from it still, by actually crouching underneath the bus captain. the bus captain couldn't be that fat.<br><br>lastly, giving the driver the sympathy vote is correct because the boy DID PUNCH the bus captain, who is more elder than him. by punching the bus captain, he is showing disrespectfulness to someone who is actually older than him and furthermore do you think people will actually support this person who is only in his adolescence who just punch someone who might be already 50 something years old? there still is hope for this student since people will most likely forget this incident already anyway.</div></blockquote>This shows how people so easily believe press statements before actual sentencing. Before the person is actually convicted, he is already found guilty by a jury of his peers.<br><br>I recall an incident a few years back when a women accused a swimming instructor of 'molesting' her in a swimming complex. Because he was charged, his name and job description was published. He was subsequently acquitted, and even the judge said he had no case to answer to. Despite that, his reputation and job was already in tatters, all because the mob 'convicted' him based on a false accusation.<br><br>No one is disputing that the student deserves some punitive punishment for assault. But since none of us were physically at the scene, should we lynch him based on what others say?<br><br>As to the driver's actions, i believe he could have handled the situation better. And his outright confiscation would surely have infurated anyone, not just the student. Did he explain that the card may be 'illegal' before asking for it?  Or did he explain this fact only after he had the card in hand? Would the student have beaten the driver if he had performed the former?</div>
