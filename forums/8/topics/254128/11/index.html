In truth, if it were a MP's son, this story will never have been published.<br><br>He will likely be expelled and then charged in court, albeit not a serious charge. I doubt he will serve any jail time, but hours of community service.<br><br>It's not that a big deal. The school's board will have to evaluate whether the boy will be a serious threat to his schoolmates and people around him. It is obvious he has a short temper and the lack of restraint to act on it. Imagine if a teacher or a prefect was to come up on him for minor offence, will he be provoked and behave in a similar manner?<br><br>Even if the school board decides not to, there are parents with elite status who will influence the decision in such a way that their precious babies will not be risked in any manner, or be marred in reputation of being a friend of this perceived hooligan.</div></blockquote>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>HCI's board won't expel this clown. Why? Cos he did not cause any trouble in the school grounds nor beat up another HCI guy. If he had beaten another HCI student and in the school ground, my bet is the other student's parents will come down hard on the school board to kick the clown outta the school.<br><br>For beating up a bus driver, I'd say HCI board don't give a damn. They will probably just do some counselling to the clown and then do a little PR in the newspaper that they have counselled the clown somewhat and bla bla bla. Just to put a humane face to HCI.<br><br>Well, i do hope and wish that SBS will press charges against this HCI clown for hitting one of their employees, who was just doing what he was suppose to do, as in the SOP.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just because the student is from hci doesn't mean he can do anything. in fact, this student is bringing shame to his family which shouldn't be cordoned at all. this student shouldn't be jailed, but should visit a jail to see what its like to be in jail, see whether he likes it there. he'll learn that its wrong to hit someone elder than him. this boy do NOT have moral values and needs to be counselled. the bus captain HAS the right to retain the concession card if he/she feels that its right to do so because it states that it might be stolen. people who are against this statement are protecting the student. even though the bus captain have kiampah face doesn't mean he isn't civilized. in fact this person is following the SOP and people who say him should actually complain to SBST and nt him as he is following the SOP. every BC HAS TO. if u are a BC, u have to do it. the bus captain can be getting a bit too far, but the boy SHOULD NOT punch someone who is much more elderly than him. if u ever start a vote in singapore as to whether this boy is to get away scot-free for punching this particular bus captain, i'll guarantee u a 0.5% yes and a 99.5% no. in short, this student is at fault, but the BC is also a bit too far.</div>
