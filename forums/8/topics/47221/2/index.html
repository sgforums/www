            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, LV.  Admit some of the products are ugly.  The brand survives because it's prestigeous &amp; ages old, and has a loyal brand/fashion-conscious following.  Can't argue with the quality either although probably can get close enough quality at lower price.<br><br>To use or not to use - I say use it!  The worth of an item that you buy depends how often you use it.  If the bag is $200 but you'll carry it almost every day, then it's worth buying, compared to something at $100 but you hardly use it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe in the bidding process, but not all denim is the same.  Some are rougher, different grades of cotton, the twill &amp; weave, finishing of the cloth, different shades and dyes, thickness/weight too.<br><br>Selling price gets jacked up by the added value like additional fabric processes, the cut and design and therefore the very important resulting fit, and the brand (&amp; its perceived quality).<br><br>Jeans are differentiated by quality and design, but only to a certain extent because like you pointed out correctly, it's still all denim.

            <div class='col-md body'>yah, i mean if the material has the same rating or weight or whatever, Gucci or Baleno, probably comes from the same place and you'll end up paying something like $200 for a pair and $20 for the other because of the label<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by choco B:</div><div class="quote_body">I believe in the bidding process, but not all denim is the same.
