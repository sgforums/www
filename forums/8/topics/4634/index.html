            <div class='col-md body'>Do you sometimes get angry and do things that you regret later you should not have done ?<br><br>Well let me share with you a true story which happened in the States. A man came out of his home to admire his new truck.<br><br>To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint. The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's hands into pulp as punishment.<br><br>When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from the surgery &amp; saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said,<br><br>" Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but when are my fingers going to grow back?"<br><br>The father went home &amp; committed suicide.<br><br>Think about the story the next time u see someone spill milk at a dinner table or hear a baby crying. Think first before u lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired. Broken bones &amp; hurt feelings often can't.<br><br>Too often we fail to recognise the difference between the person and the performance.<br><br>People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever.<br><br>Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient. Understand &amp; love.<br><br>------------------<br>Many of life's failures are people who did not realize how close they<br>were<br>to success when they gave up ....</div>
