            <div class='col-md body'>i'm a teacher at a local sec sch, and sometimes i become very angry just before i go into the classroom becos of some matter, or sometimes i get angry becos of my students during class..<br><br>what i'm trying to say here is, sometimes, i faced students who have tempers on thier own and i get cold shoulders by them. of cos, sometimes, i get really attitude problems with this students who are angry at the time.<br><br>but most important thing is, i just ignore them not because they are giving me attitude but because i know they have the right to be angry and temperamental at times, and i just tell myself that: Fine, i'll just leave him/her alone for today, cos i know they weren't usually like that in my other classes.<br><br>it's my way of being respectful to my students, knowing that they have mood-swings of their own, and i never think otherwise that these students have gone crazy of some other matter.<br><br>and for my case, when i get angry, i'll try to control myslef but i hope students will know that just like when they are angry, it's sometimes hard to contain yourself. yes, i do feel touchy when i'm angry in class, but i'll try my best not to reprimand students for the wrong reasons. and even if i do, i'll try to contain myself but it is not easy.<br><br>so students, do understand that, yes, teachers do get angry. but it really make a difference between a teacher who gets angry and vent thier anger on students, and those teachers who do not. how to see the difference?<br><br>well, a good teacher will reprimand students and focus on the fault made by the student, and NOT on the character on the students..<br><br>and please, don't assume it's always bf/husband problems that causes a teacher to have a bad mood on a day. it can be some other things, and let's just stop guessing what is it that makes a teacher to have a bad day, it's really childish.<br><br>my final advice is, if u see that a teacher is feeling moody, be nice to him/her, ignore him/her nicely and behave, just like how i treat my students when the students themselves are feeling moody. don't just focus on the day when a teacher is angry, but try to recall the other days when a good teacher tries his/her very best to entertain you all during the lessons.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Teachers are also human. Just avoid them if they are having a bad day. Remember they are also very stressed cos they have to deliver the good results expected of them. Always be grateful to the good &amp; dedicated ones</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's because students these day's a lot very spoilt. A lot seem to have quite an arrogant attitude. Last time at least teachers could beat the humility into you but nowadaes no...parents say cannot hit my child. Then at home they spoil the kids. What to do teachers give up all hope. If teacher is sian, it's because he/she/it has lost all purpose. Get a new teacher, new teachers at first very "on" one cause they feel like they are making a difference. After a while, meet all kind of students then sianz already.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that there are times where ONLY and absolutely ONLY threatening young kids with corporal punishment will get them to wake up and mend their ways. No amount of scolding would help. Unforturnately since teachers do not have the right to impose corporal punishment anymore, it's difficult for teachers to do their job.<br><br>and of course if all else fails, the boy/girls 's home is the final alternative</div>
