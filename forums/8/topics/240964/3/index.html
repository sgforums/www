            <div class='col-md body'>I Think the issue is whether the user will feel bad if his photos or actions are posted on Stomp or anywhere.<br><br>Firstly, i think this is an invasion of privacy.<br><br>Secondly, by taking photos or actions, we already made our judgment without listening to why the person did that. And that's unfair.<br><br>I recall in the papers, someone posted a picture of a kid laying down in the MRT but it was found out later that he was sick.<br><br>I think that yes, we should give seats to the elderly or needy when we see them. It is better late than never. What the TS did was right. However, his good intentions were rejected. And I consider that as the old lady's loss.<br><br>However, it is much worse and ugly when the elderly or needy comes in to the MRT or buses, and immediately, people nearby start to act 'blur" or close their eyes.<br><br>I bet most of us would have seen these when a pregnant lady comes to the seats marked for them in the MRT, but those people will pretend to sleep. I am highlighting those who pretend.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha...I will be pissed too. Last time my work was very tiring, 9am-11 pm daily, super stress type. Got once, I was in MRT, in the morn with my laptop. This old lady came, and sort of look here look there (diao me), hinting me to give up my seat. WTF lah...I seriously think I was in a less healthy physical state than her. If I dun sit, i think I might faint from exhaustion. I mean u are old, does not mean I HAVE TO DIE DIE give you seat lor. I understand old people find standing very tiring, but to some young people working 24/7, they are more tired even.<br><br>Anyways next time if old lady niao that "young people should sit", than probably just say " True, you are so old anyways" and promptly seat down. Or say "dun later say i din offer you har, you want to act young is your problem"....err just say softly lah (in case other commuters come and beat u up)</div>
