I prefer my arm to be appreciated in another way.

            <div class='col-md body'>Light,<br><br>I have provided some substatiations to my accusations. It's a pyschographic match of the two personalities. I have never made any claims that it's concrete and it's up to you to accept. On my side, I'm pretty convinced that it's Hata_san.<br><br>Spy made a claim. What kind of substantiation did he provide? What for instance is Hata_san's IP if he claims that he knows it's different? On what grounds should we accpet or reject his claim? So we are supposed to accept it because he said so?!<br><br>Suzi has started to decide who's wrong even though she doesn't know the facts of the case. While we are making accusations, she has already made a judgement. How self righteous and know-it-all! She thinks that by demanding an apology, she will get it. What a naive view of life she has! So if I were to demand that she slaps herself in this posting, does that mean that she will do it? I think she is cleverer than that even though I frevently hopes she does that and wake up from her uppity delusions.<br><br>P.S: How does my job come into this? Jealous old boy? It's incredible that people can infer so much from a statement about what I do. While I didn't declare that I'm superior, they insist on feeling inferior. Guess it reflects on them than on me. An executive job is no big deal nowadays, a fresh uni grad can get one. It's only a big deal to those who with no qualifications other than opening their big gobs to suck in air to make noise   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by twinkle (edited 27 March 2000).]</div>
