            <div class='col-md body'>Many young people dream of becoming rich.. they want to be rich and free of financial freedom.. Talk to any aspiring young men and they will say the same thing.. they want to do business and join the elite.. BUT, most of them dream, want, say, think of becoming rich and they failed.. WHY ??<br><br>Because they are not commited to be rich.. they want, they dream, they say, they think, but they never action.. they never commit.. Of the 100% who do business, 50% failed in the first year.. 40% failed after 5 years, and only 10% live to enjoy financial freedom.. Why ? the reason is simple.. they had their GOAL firmly in sights.. they are commited and never give up no matter how tedious the path to financial freedom is..<br><br>When Mr sim first started creative, the products he had couldn't sell because the price tag on it was too expensive for the consumers then.. he recieved the feed-back and changed his products to suit the consumers.. AGAIN he failed.. but he never give up because he know what his goals are and was sure of his products.. he had a business strategy and he stick to it.. after several failure, he invented sound blaster.. the rest is history..<br><br>All successful person had one common attitude.. they don't believe in luck and destiny.. your destiny is in your own hand.. if you are set about doing it, nobody can stop you.. that's how powerful it is..<br><br>So why do we want to be free of finance ? In the 21st century, there's no more guarantee job.. you climb the corporate ladders for years and all it takes is a phone call from the head office for retrenchment, and that's it.. you are gone.. you have no control to your job at all by being a employee..<br><br>I paid my employees only 1/3 of his capability.. why ? because as a employer, his destiny is in my hand.. I need to cover my overheads as well.. the salary is<br>pay according to his position, not his capability.. god is fair to everyone as all of us only had 24hrs per day.. But a business man have more hours working for them.. they can enjoy their time travelling, knowing that at the same time, people are earning money for him..<br><br>To all forumers, there's no better time to start your business but NOW.. there's no good time to start, its not about when is suitable to start.. people work for marriage, after marriage they work for their kids, after that they work for their retirement.. the problem with many people is they always find excuses for their action until the whole idea of owning a business became a full-stop.. so for those of you harbouring the thought of doing business, I suggest you get your butt off and start now as there will never be a good time to start but <span style="color: red;">NOW</span>...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Retirement blues<br><br>S'poreans conscious of need to save, but end up with little for their golden years: Survey<br><br>Today<br>February 25, 2005<br><br>COMPARED with other industrialised countries' citizens, Singaporeans want to retire the earliest and are most active in saving up for the future Â— but still end up with one of the lowest retirement income levels, according to a recent worldwide survey on retirement.<br><br>AXA Group, a major player in the field of financial protection, asked 9,200 working and retired people in 15 industrialised and newly-industrialised nations last year for their views on retirement.<br><br>Countries surveyed included Australia, Canada, USA, Spain, Italy and Asian representatives Hong Kong and Japan.<br><br>In Singapore, 296 working adults and 307 retirees, aged between 25 and 75 years old, were interviewed between October and November.<br><br>The study found that, on average, the ideal retirement age for Singaporeans was 54 Â— the youngest desired retirement age among the 15 countries. Those in Hong Kong, Canada and Australia opted for retirement at the age of 55, while Japanese wanted to wait till they were 61.<br><br>A successful retirement, said AXA Singapore's executive vice-president Lim Meng Tat, is "one in which you can continue to sustain the lifestyle that you enjoyed pre-retirement".<br><br>Hence he said it was "crucial" that Singaporeans understand their financial commitments to allow them to fund their future needs.<br><br>He added that the discrepancy between the effort put into saving by Singaporeans and the amount of money that Singaporeans actually had after their retirement was worrying.<br><br>Of those surveyed, Singaporeans seemed the most eager to prepare for their post-retirement financial arrangements, with nine in 10 contributing to an insurance policy or a pension fund with their employer, such as the through the Central Provident Fund. Four in five contribute to savings plans, a proportion that outstrips that of other countries.<br><br>Yet the average retired Singaporean has among the lowest average monthly retirement income among the 15 countries, at $1,692. Canada ranked first with $4,216, with Hong Kong last at $1,177.<br><br>This average monthly income is marginally above the average household expenditure of $1,592.<br><br>The study, however, did not take into account factors such as different costs of living in these 15 countries.<br><br>Mr Lim also said it was startling to find that four in five working Singaporeans did not know what their income level would be at retirement, while 57 per cent of retired Singaporeans did not know their average monthly income.<br><br>"Most people assume that they have sufficient retirement income but are unable to quantify the amounts. Hence they are unprepared for the financial liabilities," said Mr Lim.<br><br>"People need to be educated about their financial obligations after retirement."<br><br></div>

Tonight you decided to post this comment, you are commited to post even if you lack of sleep, who can stop you ? people failed for a reason.. they are not FLEXIBLE enough..<br><br>When I first started to sell my products, I met all sorts of people who put me down.. imagine they are my close friends that I had for years.. they did support me by buying something, even then, I had a hard time delivering it to their place, always giving excuses of not at home.. I did all that for only 50 cents profits..<br><br>If I stopped then, I wouldn't be where I am now.. the ultimate business man is always on the look-out for feed-backs, improvised it and delivered it to the best of his capability...</div>
