            <div class='col-md body'>I have to say, u have mislead yourself in the wrong way for studies.<br>Have you asked yourself why did you go through the trouble (Other than money) to go through university study? Are you only looking forward to the piece or paper? or are you there to learn?<br><br>Doing self-study can be possible for O &amp; A levels because they are not specialised subjects. O &amp; A levels is basically a bridge to understand and judge one's ability to study, therefore it does not required complete understanding to that particular subject to get an A or B.<br><br>Going through University for bachelor/Master degree is for the personal touch and learning through the many experience the lecturers went through and catching many things are cannot be learnt in the books. For example, doing assignments, presentations and on-site studies and experiments.<br><br>The price you pay at this time of your life is basically for all the knowledge you are learning from everything you have learnt within the time, excluding the books since it can be self-studied. To be more precise, even if you go for lectures and tutorials everything, but you don't do any self-studies, you still won't get a good result right? But, not getting good results doesn't means that you didn't learn anything. Of course, going for all classes + self-study to get good results is definately worthly since you have successfully grab all the jest of studying in a university.<br><br>Getting good results just from books, is definately not learning. Your aim is definately to get the certificate only. Unless you're telling me that THAT is your only aim for going through the studies, then i'll have nothing else to say.<br><br>I hope this helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

CCNP and stuff like that.. </div></blockquote>I haven't seen that in Singapore. The demand isn't great here.<br><br>But in Western countries such as US, degree is called nearly nothing (not exactly useless, you have to use this degree anyway). Certification is more important.<br><br>But there's one caveat: some certifications requires you to have experience in a particular field. If you don't, you won't get the certification, even if you pass their exams with flying colours. Microsoft is one of those. That's where your degree comes in. Although it's next to useless, it's useful in this sense.</div>

The dip holder gets to work immediately after NS but the degree holder-to-be needs to go univerisity for 4 years before starting work....<br><br>And if im not mistaken, a dip holder is not eligible to be an engineer... for fresh dip holders, they are only employed as assistant engineers... and yes, they will climb to the post of engineer in 3-5 years time... which is also the time when the uni grad comes out and share the same post as him... you may say, "See, they are equivalent!"... But i tell you "NO".... just look at the prospects... the company will most probably groom the degree holder... experience can be earned... knowledge is not recognised by the company if it's not on paper, so the dip holder will lose out... this is the reason why u see many dip holders complaining about wanting to get an overseas degree to boost their job prospects... even degree holders are looking forward to getting higher qualifications.... Sad to say, this is the society we live in... Face it... stop deluding yourself unless you think you are the next Bill Gates...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One misperception that needs to be cleared up here is that the idea of university is not to know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what</span> to think - the point is to develop the skills to know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how</span> to think.<br><br>An unfortunate aspect of undergrad life is that the majority of undergrads simply aren't taken seriously by the teaching staff.  This majority is by and large perceived to be there to jump through hoops and get the paper, and that perception's often not far off the mark.  Tertiary education has generally become an education-for-sale system and in doing so has fostered the jumping-through-hoops mentality.<br><br>There are a few out there that do get the point, and those are genuinely intelligent enough to go out into the real world and make it with or without a degree.  If the system of separating the goats from the sheep is set up right, these are the ones who get past undergrad and get to the real fun stuff.<br><br>That said, the system's not perfect.  At university and now at work, I still come across postgrads who made it by sheer perspiration and no inspiration.  All kudos to them for having made it that far through sheer brute force, but they're generally people I tend to avoid working with because they don't bring aboard what's expected of people of their qualifications and I end up having to carry them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i am saying is that it is better off for people who are qualified to go into university to save the money of high course education like degree unless you are very rich.<br><br>you can easily find out what modules the course if teaching, go to the university bookstores and buy those textbooks and read yourself.<br><br>in terms of job prospects, whatever field you are in. because of your absence of degree, your starting job salary will be lower.<br><br>however with hard work, self learning attitude, and the fact that you save large sum of money that would have otherwise spend on lecture fees, you can slowly progress up the company.<br><br>i believe the company will haves some sort of certification course or system which recognise capable people.<br><br>at the end of the day, as long as you are value added, and with the savings you incurred, the company will be throwing stones at the own legs if they do not promote you according to your real worth and productivity. if they think that becasue you still have no degree cert in the end while your performance has been excellence and as a result don;t promote you accordingly, they are doing themselves a disfavor.<br><br>i quite sure that university education around the world is overcharging us. but as i say, its too late for me. i have already owned the school a large sum liao.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>based on my personal experience, one of a professor mentioned in his lecture.<br><br>"after some time when i was a student, i realise that actually most of the thing you can just self study yourself."<br><br>another graduate tutor once said<br>" i seldom go for tutorial also in the past"<br><br>self study is very possible especially in our current era of fast information age.<br>paying money to listen to professor talk is not really worth it.<br><br>of course, things like lab experiment and test , that one is no choice have to use them and pay them for the fees.<br><br>but for lecture, tutorial fees, it pretty much extra because all these you can read from textbooks.</div>
