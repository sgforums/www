            <div class='col-md body'>If you spend $10k on education, and you earn back only 5k additional in your life time, it's simple maths, you shouldn't study, you're losing money. If you spent $50k on education, and you earn back 100k additional in your life time, then it's well worth it. So there is no right or wrong, an expensive education could be worth it, or a cheap education may not be worth it, in fact even no education could be a good choice, it's about your own judgement to see if you can earn them back.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no offences to undergraduates. a degree might be important if u are into bussiness or management related jobs but for engineering it's a totally different story.<br><br>engineering requires experiences. imagine this, two 20 years old after NS, 1 started working as a engineer and the other goes into university.<br><br>4 years later, the 2nd guy finally graduated. but the 1st guy will already has 4 years of working and engineering experiences while the 2nd guy is only a noob with no working experiences and only textbook knowledge of what he learnt in university.<br><br>from my experiences, employers/customers/clients' expectations for a good engineer is that they don't care whether u are a degree holder or O level, as long as u can set up/troubleshoot and maintain the system, u are the person they want.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lets put it this way:<br><br>To get ahead in life it all depends on how hard you work and your people skills.<br><br>What a degree does is to open more doors for you at the start and potentially give you a headstart. But what happens to you after that really depends on those two things.</div>
