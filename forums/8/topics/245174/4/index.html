I agree! Basically, it all boils down to prospects... Experience alone wont get you very far... You need both experience and paper qualifications to climb up the corporate ladder... If experience alone is sufficient, then the CEOs of all the companies must be at least 100 years old because they are supposed to be the most experienced in the whole organization...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>General statistics show that degree holders are paid more than non-degree holders. Specific examples may deviate from general statistics. Some towkays have no degree and are damn well off. A teen genius can be a trader too.<br><br>From my experience, all things being equal, a degree will open up more opportunities. The HR dept looks to academic qualification to screen applicants. It is not ideal, because they will miss out some non-degree talents. However, HR cannot interview every applicant.<br><br>In many line of work, relevant knowledge is acquired on the job. Most of the things taught in poly or unis are not very useful. In my line of work, I use addition, substraction, multiplication and sometimes division. Don't need trignometric functions, hyperbolic functions, forget about Bessel or Chebyshev functions. I could have left school at O levels and will still be as smart or dumb on the job. However, without a degree, I'm sure I won't get pass HR screening.</div>

Well, let's see.<br><br>You say that:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">let me talk about technician view again. first, by opting not to go university, he has already saved $35000 dollars. he can go out earlier and start working as a technician and start savings. withing the technician system, there will be some levels to rise to be very senior technician.</div></blockquote>So it's entirely possible that non-degree holders can go as far as degree holders because it's a matter of their intrinsic characteristics rather than their education?  Well and good.<br><br>But wait a minute!  Later that you say that:<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by january:</div><div class="quote_body">most non grad dun achieve this because non grad are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">usually not capable than grad in the first place because they have not as good environment when they grow up</span>.</div></blockquote>Well, you've already said that the degree doesn't add anything to the person's capabilities, but you've backtracked here by saying that the non-grads' lack of capability is due to their being non-grads.  Make up your mind - is it nature, or is it nurture?<br><br>Put simply, you've just shot yourself in the foot.  The irony of this is that logical errors like the one you just committed are covered in first-year undergraduate Critical Thinking subjects.  In other words, you could have been outdone by someone who's spent a short six months at university, using something that doesn't even register as a party trick at university-level learning.<br><br>If you want to believe that a university education provides you no value beyond meaningless qualifications, go right ahead.  You've <span style="text-decoration: underline;">said</span> you can achieve the same learning without university but I've just shown you how you've <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shown</span> you can't, and that's just the tip of the iceberg of what you don't know about university education.<br><br>Still and all, if you do wish to cling to your illusions and stick to pithy platitudes, you're perfectly entitled to.  Just don't be disappointed when you get nothing out of it - your argument would never lead to anything actionable because it's got such huge holes in it.</div>
