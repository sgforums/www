I do have friends that have degrees and diplomas and ITCs. The one having the degree is earning less than the dip holders. and that is over a period of 6 yrs.<br><br>Friend A(degree),working 3 yrs gross out @ 2.5k as engineer. Friend B(dip) is grossing out @ 3.3k as engineer as well. he is just into his 2yr actually. furthermore, B just started working a yr later since A got a job.<br><br>Uni students have textbk knowledge but lack hands on experience compared to those of lower qualifications. generally nowadays, ITC students are slowly overtaking dip holders for higher pay. Me, dip holder for example was quoted 1.5k starting salary while the other guy holding as ITC got 1.7k. i was waiting for my turn as the ITC went in 1st.. overheard the interviewer splash the cash actually.<br><br>you can't generalise that uni students hold a better life eventually, because the statistics are being too selective. they left majorities and only take the median minorities. the fact to the matter is, it is all to wayang. so that the general public including foreigners have the 'good' picture in our education system. what they don't know is that certs with a lot of practical experience are becoming an increasing trend in the salary market. this is what is happening to the job industry here.<br><br>yes i do agree that a person has every right to improve himself, but one has to look into his own job industry whether a degree is required to progress in the working ladder. however one should not overlook @ smaller courses like WSQ, Fire Safety Officer or first aid certs. these small certs may increase your pay as well. for me, i call this certs, booster certs. they help boost up ur credentials.<br><br>in all, a degree is just as useless if the person is not productive or lazy simply said. experience, hard work and creativity are 3 main attributes that can help one to become succesful in life.<br></div>

U hv a passion for wat u're learning ,... and u hope to apply those knowledge to the organisations u're working for... Or U use the knowledge to produce products/services to add value to people's Life... I guess... It's WORTH it....</div>
