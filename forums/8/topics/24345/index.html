            <div class='col-md body'>you know ah as a good law abiding citizen who pay road tax i think i am going to write to straits time forum to ask that bus lane be abolish. it is very silly to have bus lane. first of all, car got so many more than bus, and car pay much more road tax than bus in total you know! so out of 3 lane how can 1 lane be just for bus i completely dont agree especially when bus is run by company some more and is a commercial service this is too much man! and i dare say that the big part of the road upkeeping is pay by car user with their parking fine and erp, especially mine since i get fine so often anyway. i think it is very reasonable request for equality, i not even asking for the left lane to be convert into a car lane, where 7.30 to 9.30 is 'cars only'. this is definitely not fair to have a bus lane at all and especially i always get fine driving into the lane at wrong hour, this is not funny. motorcyclist should also ask for a motorcycle lane because it is dangerous to drive motorcycle also. i think i will suggest motorcycle lane to take up the middle lane. sorry to pedestrian ah, i forget to consider you at all. maybe you can have the rightmost lane just for pedestrian since it is also not safe. hmm really need to submit my proposal man, like that can maybe cure the car jam since more people walk.this way also can get the LTA earn more money, maybe they can charge ERP for every pedestrian walking under it eh!? watch out for my letter soon hor</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>first.. u REALLY gotta learn how to paragraph your writing.. really man.. no offence intended at all...<br><br>as for writing in to straits times forum, i suggest u get someone to proof read your comments. someone who is capable of proof-reading that is... er.. again no offence intended, i dun think that u are a suitable candidate in that aspect.<br><br>as for ur views on the bus lane, how do u know they didn't build an EXTRA lane than intended for buses?<br><br>of course there's a whole host of other reasons why the bus lane is there but i'll let someone else take over from here...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>chokky:<br><br>bus lanes are so designated, in order to help buses be as unaffected as possible by traffic jams, in order to stay on schedule, so people would be encouraged to use public transport that is punctual and reliable.<br><br>about the car tax and maintenance you pay, those could be avoided if you used public transport, right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>basically you can't just look at the issue of having bus lanes as a monetary thing (you pay tax and fines). the bus lanes are paid for by civilians who use public transport (a lot of them btw), and they did so because part of the bargain was that the government provide them with a reliable and "world-class" public transport system.<br><br>note that although tibs and sbs are "companies", they have to answer to the government which provides them with the authorization to run a public transport service. this is why the public in general holds the government responsible for the screw-ups of the bus companies. they can't really be looked at as profit-generating private commercial ventures, and hence i think they and the people who use public transport deserve the bus lane. you don't see private bus-hire companies being granted the privilege to use the bus lanes, do you?<br><br>by the way, if you were as law abiding as you claimed, why all the fines you mentioned? (this is not a personal attack, so don't take it as such) as for writing into the straits time forums, perhaps other people writing in response to you might be able to give you more insight into the rationale behind setting aside bus lanes, since what i have said may or may not be correct.<br><br>i think that about sums it up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
