            <div class='col-md body'>erm, primary school level (esp lower pri levels, of age 7 to 9) should be still ok lah. some fathers honestly just care for their little girls, when their mothers are unavailable...at work or out marketing maybe, some fathers take on a more 'feminine role'. if the father still continue doing that even when the girl enters sec sch, I think it's fishy liao loh.<br><br>both my parents don't bother about me bathing even when I was small. but I remembered the 1st time I had my period when I was 12, primary 6, I got such a shock and was so scared till I screamed in the loo. My dad being the only one at home then rushed to see what the problem was and I was with my pants down.
