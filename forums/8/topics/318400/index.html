              <h1 class="clr">Kallang, Paya Lebar to be developed as new commercial hubs</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Kallang and Paya Lebar will be developed into new
              commercial hubs, just like the Jurong Lake District. This is part of
              the government’s Draft Master Plan, which charts land use over the next
              10 to 15 years.</p>
              <p>Marina Bay and the city centre will continue to be the key
              commercial node in Singapore. New growth areas like Tanjong Pagar,
              Beach Road and the Ophir—Rochor corridor will also be developed.</p>
              <p>However,
              more commercial hubs will be needed outside the city, to offer
              alternatives to businesses and bring jobs closer to homes.</p>
              <p>One
              regional centre will be in Paya Lebar. About 12 hectares of land are
              available for development, and half a million square metres will be set
              aside for office, hotel and retail spaces.</p>
              <p>The Urban
              Redevelopment Authority (URA) said at least 1,400 hotel rooms can be
              built in the area. And in the near future, residents will be able to
              shop and dine by the Geylang riverfront.</p>
              <p>National Development
              Minister Mah Bow Tan said: "When the Marina Barrage is completed some
              time later this year, we will be able to stabilise the water levels in
              Geylang River.</p>
              <p>"Around the Geylang River area, we will be able to
              integrate very attractive public spaces, malls and so on. The plan is
              to realign the Geylang River so that it runs through the new commercial
              developments."</p>
              <p>The proposals will build on the area’s distinctive
              Malay identity, so there will be a new Geylang Serai Market and Civic
              Centre. The Civic Centre will house a Community Club, community
              development offices and even a library.</p>
              <p>More activities and bazaars can also be staged at a new plaza, next to the upcoming Paya Lebar MRT interchange.</p>
              <p>As
              for Kallang Riverside, it has been earmarked as the next lifestyle
              precinct. Urban planners said new parks, waterfront residences and
              recreational spaces can be developed at the 64—hectare area.</p>
              <p>About 600,000 square metres of land will also be devoted to commercial use, with 3,000 new hotel rooms in the pipeline.</p>
              <p>About
              4,000 waterfront homes have been planned for the area. And the new
              properties will have a variety of storey heights, stepping down towards
              the waterfront. This will allow those living further inland to also
              enjoy the views of the waterfront.</p>
              <p>Parts of the historic Kallang
              Airport will also be conserved and redeveloped into a new entertainment
              and retail attraction. Also in the works are an integrated
              second—storey linkway to connect Kallang MRT station to the Old Airport
              Square and the future Sports Hub.</p>
              <p>All in, URA said there are plans to add 327,200 new homes around the island over the next 15 years.</p>
              <p>Members of the public can send their feedback on the Draft Master Plan through the URA website.</p>
              <p>The
              Master Plan 2008 will be gazetted after incorporating views from the
              public at the Draft Master Plan exhibition at the URA Centre. — CNA/ms</p>

              <h1 class="clr">Industry players upbeat about plans for 2 new commercial hubs</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE : Industry players are upbeat about the plans for two new
              commercial hubs, noting that both Kallang and Paya Lebar have great
              potential for growth, given their close proximity to the city.</p>
              <p>However, they said the timing of the various projects will have to
              be calibrated carefully, so as not to place additional strain on the
              construction sector.</p>
              <p>In the next 15 years, Singapore will have
              three new commercial hubs. Jurong Lake District, Paya Lebar Central and
              Kallang Riverside will cost billions of dollars to develop.</p>
              <p>According
              to the National Development Minister, Mah Bow Tan, one or two sites in
              these new regional centres will be released for sale fairly soon. But
              market demand will mostly dictate the pace of the developments.</p>
              <p>Industry
              players warn against over—developing and easing plot ratios, which they
              said could trigger another wave of en—bloc sales.</p>
              <p>Simon Cheong,
              President, Real Estate Developers’ Association of Singapore, said: "We
              are one of the highest in the world — higher than Dubai, Tokyo, Sydney,
              New York and Hong Kong — in terms of construction costs. By not
              increasing the plot ratio, I think the government is giving some relief
              to the construction industry."</p>
              <p>The government has already
              announced that it will defer some S$3 billion worth of public sector
              projects. Other projects may also join the list.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah said:
              "I’ve asked the public agencies to consider deferring more projects if
              necessary. It makes good sense, (with) construction cost being so high,
              you won’t get as much value for money.</p>
              <p>"It also helps to even out
              the cycles — when construction demand in other areas goes down, this is
              one way for us to even out the cycle."</p>
              <p>Some infrastructural works
              have already started at the Jurong Lake District, which is being
              transformed into a regional centre for the western part of Singapore. —
