              <p>Are you mentally retarded? Did you even understand the TS's issue? Just because you paid $30 for a 6 minute call to 'some other country' doesnt make it something you should be proud of. In fact, I find it quite stupid and ignorant. Seeing how you could have bought a local calling card for 1/3 the price and spoke to that 'other country'' for god knows how much longer a time.</p>
              <p>Anyway that is far besides the point. The TS asked if he has a case against starhub for CHARGING him as though he was overseas when he was actually in Singapore. Happened to me a few times while I was in Camps down at changi. They HAVE to waive of the charges. Call the call center. Make a big fuss. If they dare to say 'oh you could have passed your phone to your friend who went over seas what' then demand the call list (they have one) and you will see over a span of a few hours some calls 'from' overseas and some from Singapore. Then ask them how that happen? Play tennis with your phone throwing it back and forth from overseas ar?</p>
              <p>Switching to manual detection is a solution to this problem, BUT IT IS NOT YOUR DUTY NOR OBLIGATION. It is your prerogative to use your phone within the confines of your country withouot having to worry or stress. Make uber big noise about this issue. If not all the poor people living in woodlands and changi all kenna taken advantage of. No idea how much they are ripping off innocent people who dare not challenge big companies.</p>
              <p>Good luck and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S - I have personally had very good experiences with star hub customer service. No worries, normally they will just waive it and apologies. Very nice people. Unlike Shit-tel. Retarded customer service.</p>

              <p>guess our telcos here do not have a proper jamming devices to cut off those roaming signal with anti jamming capabilities from malaysia and indonesia, both are hovering over sing dollars here.</p>
              <p>It will be quite difficult for you to claim, cos these amount was taken by malaysia telecom, and starhub just charge you according to what the malaysia telco charged them, it you ask starhub, they will tell you that they also do not gain anything, and even if you prove that you did not go to malaysia, they can said that your give someone yr handphone for a trip to malaysia. Starhub had already paid the malaysia teleco, the most they can do is to write an appeal to malaysia teleco for the wrong charging, but you show know how the malaysian works, for them, anything that goes in, hardly will come out. My suggestion is learn from it, switch off yr data roaming feature will do just fine.</p>
