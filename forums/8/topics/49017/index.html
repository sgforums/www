He would only say: 'We have made it clear to our staff that some degree of retrenchment cannot be avoided.'<br><br>The move, alongside wage cuts and putting employees on unpaid leave, is part of the airline's cost-cutting and restructuring plan to regain its competitiveness.<br><br>Affected by cost-cutting in the global aviation industry, the carrier was also hit hard by the Sars outbreak. It is set to report its first quarterly loss, after bleeding $204 million in April alone at the height of the outbreak. Last month, passenger numbers plunged 60 per cent, to 506,000, from May last year.<br><br>The Straits Times understands that security concerns mean SIA is likely to give those affected immediate marching orders.<br><br>Meanwhile, a special early retirement package has been offered to selected employees with at least 25 years of service, said Mr Clements.<br><br>Letters were sent to about 100 to 200 employees on Friday, said sources. They have until today to decide whether to accept the voluntary scheme, offering a month's pay for each year of service, up to a cap of 25 months.<br><br>Several union leaders contacted yesterday said they had not been told either of the scheme or the actual retrenchment numbers.<br><br>The 1,600-strong Air Line Pilots' Association Singapore (Alpa-S) also said it was unaware of pilots being offered the special retirement scheme or of the layoffs.<br><br>SIA's dispute with Alpa-S over proposed wage cuts of 15 per cent to 22.5 per cent is before the Industrial Arbitration Court but a hearing date has not been set.<br><br>Meanwhile, SIA is still negotiating with its four other unions on wage cuts of up to 15 per cent for the rest of its non-management staff. But sources said the unions would prefer to wait for the outcome of the Alpa-S arbitration before settling on the terms.<br><br>Yesterday, analysts estimated that $200 million will be saved annually with layoffs of up to 10 per cent.<br><br>And most SIA employees interviewed appeared calm about the layoffs. 'I won't be surprised. The company has been losing money and although they said retrenchment is a last option, they did not rule it out,' said a stewardess.<br><br>An SIA executive said: 'Everyone just wants to know what's going to happen.'</blockquote>GLAM!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Probably they have to take in account of the overall operating costs and other investments in other Airlines as well. Things like running the service and maintenance dept, plane fuel, future purchase of new planes from Airbus has to be taken into acct as well I suppose lor.<br><br>But they could have speak and discuss with the respective Unions abt the issues before making the decision. What could have done to prevent the number of jobs lost. Could they possibly even lower the airline tix to attract consumers? That we probably dun know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mi myself oso dun really understand how retrenchment can cut costs...<br>but i guess the management c things that we dun...<br>maybe things like medical benefits, dental benefits, CPF, staff travel tickets, hotels discounts, various subsidies all adds up to the amt saved when someone is retrenched<br>my opinion is that...maybe retrenchment is more of re-organisation of the whole company...leaner cost structure...blah blah...it's like paying a sum of money to make sure the whole company will perform more efficiently<br>instead of keeping them for another year n nothing changes for the better...n u r stuck with the same amt of workers<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nismoS132:</div><div class="quote_body">but that's on the assumption that they'll not be hiring any new blood for the next 22 years. chances are they'll realize they fu[/i]cked up and need to hire staff and give them a crash course 1 year down the road.<br><br>retrenchment has always been more of a knee jerk reaction than anything. we're losing money, we need to cut cost, let's sack people so we don't have to give them any more. and then when the customers come they ask, why aren't there any people around to serve me?</div></blockquote></div>

But once something goes red, they'll all jump about and scream for fast and effective measures to be implemented at once.<br><br>Under the circumstances where:<br><br>1) There is a severe limitation of time allowed for other better alternatives to be investigated,<br><br>2) The pressure on the lower end staff is that the 'recommendation' must be 100% effective in pumping the P&amp;L figures back into the black,<br><br>3) The specialists in the support depts are unable to understand and relate on the qualitative contributions over the importance of the quantitative 'benefiting',<br><br>These are all juz perfect scenarios for textbook ready solutions to be revisited and executed.<br><br>And with SIA being a prominent company that operates supposedly with the 'best' set of management practices and policies, it's no wonder that they, would too use the most sophisticated and common method of problem shooting.<br><br>And that is to hire a team of external consultants who will come in to walk around the company for a couple of weeks and then dish out orders and powerful recommendations in a fashion that confidently suggest that the consultants know a whole lot more than the technician guy on the field who has been working in the hanger for the past 20 years.<br><br>Wa la.....
