Christians here can complain that people are not respecting their religion by discussing their religion in forums, but are they showing respect for other religions when they are trying to convert others? In religious tolerant India, Christians are claiming that theirs is the ONLY TRUE religion. Through thousands of years, India has had many different religions flourish in it, but Christians are now claiming that all these religions in the past are false, and it had to be them to teach the Truth?<br><br><strong>Â“Stop all conversion.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An open letter to Pope John Paul II<br>Conversion is violence<br>Swami Dayananda Saraswati</strong><br><br>Your Holiness,<br>On behalf of many Hindus whom I know personally, I welcome your visit to Bharat. This is a country with an ancient civilisation and unique religious culture which accommodates many religious traditions that have come to this country throughout the centuries.<br>Being the head of the Vatican State and also the Catholic Church with a great following all over the world, you enjoy a highly venerable position and can play a significant role in defusing religious conflicts and preserving the world's rich cultures. You have in your Apostolic Letter tertio millennio adveniente, 38 (November 10, 1994) voiced your intention to convoke a Special Assembly of the Synod of Bishops for Asia. After seeing the report of the Pre-Council of the General Secretariat of the Synod of Bishops Special Assembly for Asia appointed by you, I want to bring to your kind notice the concerns of many Hindus in this country about religious conversion. In the Second Vatican Council, the status accorded to the world religions was that of a means of preparing them for Christ. We all understand that the Catholic religion does not accommodate other religions, except in this context. But I am appealing to you here to accept that every person has the freedom to pursue his or her own religion.<br>In the recent past, you mentioned that reason should be respected. On the basis of reason, no non-verifiable belief is going to fare any better than any other non-verifiable belief. Therefore, according to reason, there is no basis for conversion in matters of faith.<br><br>Apart from reason, there is another important issue which I request you to consider. Among the world's religious traditions, there are those that convert and those that do not. <strong>The non-converting religious traditions, like the Hindu, Jewish and Zoroastrian, give others the freedom to practise their religion whether they agree with the others' tenets or not. </strong>They do not wish to convert. I would characterise them as non-aggressive. Religions that are committed by their theologies to convert, on the other hand, are necessarily aggressive, since conversion implies a conscious intrusion into the religious life of a person, in fact, into the religious person.<br><br>This is a very deep intrusion, as the religious person is the deepest, the most basic in any individual. When that person is disturbed, a hurt is sustained which is very deep. The religious person is violated. The depth of this hurt is attested by the fact that when a religious sentiment is violated, it can produce a martyr. People connected to a converted person are deeply hurt. Even the converted person will suffer some hurt underneath.<br><br>He must necessarily wonder if he has done the right thing and, further, he has to face an inner alienation from his community, a community to which he has belonged for generations, and thus an alienation from his ancestors. I don't think that can ever be fully healed. Religious conversion destroys centuries-old communities and incites communal violence. It is violence and it breeds violence. Thus, for any humane person, every religious sentiment has to be respected, whether it is a Muslim sentiment or a Christian sentiment or a Hindu sentiment.<br><br>Further, in many religious traditions, including the Hindu tradition, religion is woven into the fabric of culture. So, destruction of a religion amounts to the destruction of a religious culture. Today, for instance, there is no living Greek culture; there are only empty monuments. The Mayan, Roman and many other rich cultures are all lost forever and humanity is impoverished for it. Let us at least allow humanity to enjoy the riches of its remaining mosaic of cultures. Each one has some beauty, something to contribute to the enrichment of humanity.<br><br>In any tradition, it is wrong to strike someone who is unarmed. In the Hindu tradition, this is considered a heinous act, for which the punishment is severe. A Buddhist, a Hindu, a Jew, are all unarmed, in that they do not convert. You cannot ask them to change the genius of their traditions and begin to convert in order to combat conversion. <strong>Because it is the tradition of these religions and cultures not to convert, attempts to convert them is one-sided aggression. It is striking the unarmed. </strong>I respect the freedom of a Christian or a Muslim to practise his or her faith. I do not accept many of their beliefs, but I want them to have the freedom to follow their religion.<br><br>You cannot ask me to respond to conversion by converting others to my religion because it is not part of my tradition. We don't believe in conversion, even though certain Hindu organisations have taken back some converted people. <strong>Thus, conversion is not merely violence against people; it is violence against people who are committed to non-violence.</strong><br>I am hurt by religious conversion and many others like me are hurt. Millions are hurt. There are many issues to be discussed regarding conversion, but I want to draw your attention to only the central issue here which is this one-sided violence. Religious conversion is violence and it breeds violence. In converting, you are also converting the non-violent to violence.<br><br>Any protest against religious conversion is always branded as persecution, because it is maintained that people are not allowed to practise their religion, that their religious freedom is curbed. The truth is entirely different. The other person also has the freedom to practise his or her religion without interference. That is his/her birthright. <strong>Religious freedom does not extend to having a planned programme of conversion. Such a programme is to be construed as aggression against the religious freedom of others.</strong><br>During the years of your papal office, you have brought about certain changes in the attitude and outlook of the church. On behalf of the non-aggressive religions of the world, the Hindu, the Parsi, the Jewish and other native religions in different countries, I request you to put a freeze on conversion and create a condition in which all religious cultures can live and let live.<br><strong>Dated: 29 / 10 /1999</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>If god really created man, shouldn't he be responsible on this. </strong></blockquote>Yes, I dislike the church for blaming us for our sins. SInce their god created us, he should accept responsibility for the free will instilled in us, he should accept responsibility for our choices that arise from the free will which HE GAVE US. Ergo, its our fault, and its god's fault. Ofcourse i will still blame and mangle the thief who steals my money, but I am just saying I disagree with the church doctrine stuff. Responsibility is god's, evil and goodness that lies in creation is god's.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I view god and evil as a creation of human mind, a concept. Evil doesn't exist because god allow it. Evil exist because god exist and vice versa. for instance, there is a color called white because there exist a color known as black</strong></blockquote>This sounds very Catharic. You better mind you don't get burned for saying this ha!Just like the way the Church invaded the Languedoc because their Catharic ideas were a threat. But not today, no one listens to the pope today so no fear. Yes what i said on top ties in with you said, very much like what the Cathars believed, existence is evil or something like. I agree.<br><br><strong><br>What i believe about god</strong><strong><br>Oh yes there is a god, but it is not a he nor a she, god is simply existence. Existence/god does not talk to us or pretend to hear us when we "pray", this god has no personality, or if he/she/it does, it does not meddle in the affairs of mortals.<br><br></strong>Good and Evil<strong><br><br>Existence has both, just like nature, kind and loving with deers jumping about over meadows and stuff like that. One the other hand, nature is cruel and dark with flapping birds of ill omen, and people like me. Then again evil and good has its own relativity, what constitues good or evil?Is it good to commit evil in order to attain a higher level of goodness? This is all the stuff of GP material and it gives me a headache.<br></strong></div>
