            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by gasband:</div><div class="quote_body">Maybe let me try to answer your questions on why is there still suffering in this world. It may not be what you want, but I will go ahead anyway.  Hope you get some answers from it.<br><br>We need to ask and answer two questions. First, what is evil? It is that which is against God. It is anything morally bad or wrong. It is injurious, depraved, wicked. Some acceptable examples might be murder, rape, stealing, lying, and cheating. Second, if we want God to stop evil do we want Him to stop all evil or just some of it? In other words, if just some of it then why? If He were to stop only part of the evil, then we would still be asking the question, "Why is there evil in the world?".<br><br>Let's suppose that someone was about to commit murder. God would have to stop him, maybe whisper in his ear, or if that didn't work do something a little more drastic like have something fall on him, or stop his heart, or make his hands suddenly fall off. Anyway, God would have to do something.<br><br>What if somebody wanted to steal? God would have to stop him too, right? Undoubtedly, God's imagination would permit a more practical method than I have suggested, but the end results would be the same.<br><br>What about lying? If someone were to tell a lie, then to be consistent wouldn't you want God right there to stop that person from lying? After all, He couldn't let any evil occur could He?<br><br>Let's take it a step further. Suppose someone thought something evil. Then, of course, God would have to step in and prevent him from thinking anything bad at all, right? The end result would be that God could not allow anyone to think freely. Since everyone thinks and no one thinks only pure thoughts, God would be pretty busy and we wouldn't be able to think. Anyway, at what point do we stop, at the murder level, stealing level, lying level, or thinking level? As your questions implies, if you want God to stop evil, you would have to be consistent and want Him to do it everywhere all the time, not just pick and choose. It wouldn't work.<br><br>Evil is in this world partly because we give it its place but ultimately because God, in His sovereignty, permits it and keeps it under His control.<br></div></blockquote>I think you dont quite understand my point. what i was tring to say is , there are so many ppl suffering and they have never done anything wrong but they just have no choice. For example, some ppl are born with some disabilities. If god really created man, shouldn't he be responsible on this.<br>What human are really ask for? Isn't it happiness?  look at how many ppl are dying of starvation, suffering from diseases. I consider all of us here fortunate because we have a choice , we have the option to fight for a better life, but there a many that dont.<br><br>Christian claims that their god is the onli real one, same thing happen to the muslim and other religion followers. if you can't give a valid/reasonable explanation that others religion isn't the real one then you certainly can't claim that yours are the right one. you can give a very good explanation to support your view, but others can do the same thing. then what makes you think that you are superior than others since others are also human like you.  Do you dare to stand out and say that chriatian are a better human because they are the son of their lord?<br><br>I used to have a religion, but decided to free my self. I view god and evil as a creation of human mind, a concept. Evil doesn't exist because god allow it. Evil exist because god exist and vice versa. for instance, there is a color called white because there exist a color known as black. Let say a new born baby were onli allowed to see white color, do you think he will know what is color? If there is no criminal will there be police? As a human we compare, differentiate and categorices, so that we can identified one thing from the others. it is the same as god and evil. It is just a concept.<br></div>
