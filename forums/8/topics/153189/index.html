            <div class='col-md body'>AM - Friday, 16 September , 2005 08:24:00<br>Reporter: Karen Barlow<br><br>TONY EASTLEY: A megastar of music, adored by millions, has managed to<br>slip into the country virtually unnoticed. Indian composer and<br>musician A.R. Rahman has among his fans Andrew Lloyd Webber, Baz<br>Lurhmann, Cate Blanchett and of course millions of fellow Indians.<br><br>He's composed the music for scores of albums and Bollywood films, and<br>is gearing up for what may be a very controversial project, a stage<br>musical production of Lord of The Rings.<br><br>A R Rahman, who was born a Hindu but who converted to Islam, is in<br>Australia for stadium concerts in Melbourne and Sydney, which are<br>already sold out.<br><br>AM's Karen Barlow reports.<br><br>(Sound of Rahman's music)<br><br>KAREN BARLOW: A classically trained musician from the India's Tamil<br>south, A.R. Rahman, started his career writing advertising jingles.<br>India's prolific and vibrant Bollywood film industry took notice, and<br>since 1992 he's been in demand as a film scorer and artist. Rahman is<br>known for melding traditional Indian music with western ideas and<br>modern instruments.<br><br>(Sound of Rahman's music)<br><br>A R RAHMAN: When I got my first break I thought I don't want to do the<br>same thing, which other people are doing here. I want our music to go<br>around the world, being appreciated by all people around the globe<br>rather than just being the (inaudible) of Indian, Asian people.<br><br>So that made me take efforts to do little changes, changing the beats<br>or whatever and getting harmonies and chord progressions and stuff<br>like that, you know, with traditional Indian melodies. And I think<br>something, some magic happened.<br><br>(Sound of Rahman's music)<br><br>A R RAHMAN: I do appreciate every kind of music and sometimes it comes<br>in naturally rather than intentionally.<br><br>(Sound of Rahman's music)<br><br>KAREN BARLOW: A R Rahman's joyful melodies and rhythms have won over<br>millions of people, including Sydney's Vandana Ram, who's grown up<br>with traditional Indian music.<br><br>VANDANA RAM: It is an experience of discovery, because you feel like<br>you're starting off somewhere, it's often really slow and then it<br>builds up and you go on a little journey with it.<br><br>There's often really strong percussion, so there's a fantastic sort of<br>build up and climax, it's a whole experience. Yeah, I just find it<br>leaves me� it's just fulfilling.<br><br>KAREN BARLOW: While Bollywood is starting to be mass-marketed to<br>western audiences, Vandana Ram says A.R. Rahman is in a class of his<br>own. Rahman says Bollywood compliments his work, but he's starting to<br>reach out to a wider audience.<br><br>Andrew Lloyd Webber got him to do the music for his Broadway<br>production, Bombay Dreams, three years ago.<br><br>Now he's working with Finnish folk musicians on the score for a Lord<br>of the Rings stage musical, which is set to open in Toronto early next<br>year.<br><br>(To A.R. Rahman) Well, tell me about that, because it's really hard to<br>imagine The Lord of the Rings as a musical. I mean, how are you<br>approaching this?<br><br>A R RAHMAN: It's a� they don't want to call this a musical,<br>because<br>there's so much music in it, probably two times more music in it than<br>other musical shows, but it's done in a way where it's not the<br>typical� ok, now, you're going to hear a song.<br><br>KAREN PERCY: It's not Disney?<br><br>A R RAHMAN: No.<br><br>KAREN PERCY: Oh, that's good. Because I suppose there are a lot of<br>fans of The Lord of the Rings, even before the movies came out, and<br>they'll be very particular about this.<br><br>A R RAHMAN: Very true. And I think some of them will definitely be<br>more happy than with the films, when they see the show.<br><br>KAREN PERCY: Really? That's a big call.<br><br>A R RAHMAN: Yeah. We are hoping that.<br><br>(Sound of Rahman's music)<br><br>TONY EASTLEY: Indian composer and musician, A.R. Rahman ending that<br>report from Karen Barlow</div>
