You could be shooting yourself in the foot.<br><br>Yes..I was defending a friend..so what! She was childish and playful..what about you? Are you an 'angel'? On what ground do you go round making comments of peoples. Why don't you take a good look in the mirror yourself before you spew anymore things out from your brain.

I'm bemused to find the same cast of characters. This would be compelete with Hello Kitty and Twinkle. Where are they? It seems like people who behave badly tend to repeat themselves. Anway, Collete, did you really make somebody cry? No evidence leh. Must be your inflated ego at work. Perhaps this would also be the thread where the alliance of LM-Colette-IO-Tommy is formed?<br>[/quote]<br><br>hi bleue,<br><br>kindly do me a favour, please learn to get my name right, okay? my good name and reputation are very important to me. you may not treasure yours, but i do treasure mine and till now i have extended the courtesy of getting your name right every time, surely, you should be magnanimous enough to do the same for me? itÂ’s colette, small Â“cÂ” and a single Â“lÂ”. thank you.<br><br>hmmm, are you behaving any better now than the very ones youÂ’re so trigger happy to criticize? who knows where Hello Kitty and twinkle are? am i their keeper? and may i just ask why are you so hung up on knowing which man i made cry? one big nosy parker, arenÂ’t you?<br><br>ego, ego, ego. which old timers here if they have read my posts before do not know that I am EGOISTIC? *smiles* bleue baby, youÂ’re too late in bringing up this fact to me, it would be my main vice, but then again <strong>it is</strong> my vice, isnÂ’t it?<br><br><blockquote> Originally posted by bleue on 28 April 2000, 9.15 am:<br>Collete, I've seen your "pattern" in the Most Interesting E-mail thread. You like to win, you think that when others don't answer you, you've won.<br></blockquote>*laughs* it just goes to show what a babe in the woods you are. i do like to win <strong>and i always win, especially if iÂ’m in the right,</strong> should i decide not to lose. if you have bothered to read all my other posts, you will find that never have i once shied away from writing that i always play to win.<br><br>bleue, why do you think twinkle dear didnÂ’t rebut me again when i rebutted him in the Most Interesting E-mail thread? because he was sprouting nonsense, much like the way youÂ’re doing now. he had no facts, thus no legs to stand on when arguing with me and if he had continued to wage a war of words with me, he would look even more foolish than i have already made him look.<br><br>unless you would like to do him a favour and rebut me on his behalf to the points i raised to him in the Â“Most Interesting E-mail threadÂ”. believe me, i will always entertain you and should i be shown to be wrong, i would admit it, unlike some people who have such difficulties admitting it when they are in the wrong.<br><br><blockquote> Originally posted by bleue on 28 April 2000, 9.15 am:<br>You like to win, you think that when others don't answer you, you've won. And here, you show everybody that you know you are insensitive and you are not ashamed of it. It really shows up your arrogance and desire to be one-up, even if you KNOW you are in the wrong. You can go on and split hairs about the word "consisently" and insist that I refer to all your posts when I was really really referring to this thread. Do I want to bother with you? What a waste of time.<br></blockquote>bleue, you keep writing i am in the wrong, now surely as a graduate of a reputable university (i hope), you must know that you canÂ’t go round making such remarks without substantiating them. okay, let auntie colette make life easy for you, below is the very first post i posted in this thread prior to all the flaming, pick out the paragraphs that would show me to be in the wrong, insensitive and a desire to be one-up. now, should you not be able to find any below, i wonÂ’t restrict you to look for others in this thread. enjoy.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by colette on 24 April 2000, 11.48 pm:</blockquote></div><div class="quote_body">this is not part of the topic but i think that a basic degree is a must these days and they are common, just a pity i don't have one.<br><br>when i first started working, i was in the Customer Service Department at an Apple (computers) distributorship and manning the Customer Service Hotline is one of my duties. now you know what they say about Macs being idiot proof, but actually not so. i was good at my work but i was denied promotions twice because i only had  an "O" level certificate then. after working there for sometime, a 2nd appraisal [my request for being considered as a Trainer was noted at the 1st appraisal, but nothing came out of it] was up and i expressed an interest in becoming a Trainer as there was a post opened, i know i was good enough for it because manning the Hotline has taught me many things . however, my superior said no, that i need more training before i could be a Trainer. anyway, about 2 weeks or a month later, an overseas graduate was employed as a Trainer who had no idea how the Mac works. yours truly here was not good enough to teach customers but was good enough to train the graduate to train others. ???<br><br>i never despised any of my bosses more than then. needless to say, i quit after training the graduate, even though if i had delayed my resignation for about 3 weeks, i could have gotten the year end bonus. the best thing was that they had to employ two gals to handle my job after i left. hehe ...<br><br>years later, the same company employed me on a part time basis so that they can get SDF grants for the employees of other firms who want to get training, they tried a few of their in-house Trainers and part-time trainers, but their application was denied. when i taught there for a few months, their application was approved, it was sweet revenge. well, this was what the lady who contracted me told me.<br><br>i managed to get another Trainer job at another AppleCentre after quitting the Customer Service Co-ordinatorÂ’s post, i was pursuing my Diploma then, havenÂ’t got it yet. there were 2 trainers, the other held a Diploma, our pay was different by about $400, my workload was double of hers, which would mean, my classes make more money for the company, when i brought up the difference in pay to my bosses, again, they said that because the other party was a Diploma holder while i was only an Â“OÂ” level holder. when i obtained my Diploma in June that year, i showed it to them thinking, hey, itÂ’s about time you adjust my pay right? no, i still didnÂ’t get the pay rise, quit after 2 months.<br><br>i was given a chance to excel at what i used to do only because i was good, patient and my 3rd boss at another AppleCentre (a Hongkonger, not a stuck up local) believed in capabilities and not a piece of paper and she paid me accordingly. lucky breaks like these are not easy to come by and if i had a degree to start with, i wouldnÂ’t have to take so many hard knocks.<br><br>these days, a basic degree is the bare minimum requirement, just look at the classifieds and recruit pages. with only a diploma, many jobs are denied to me because i would not have satisfied their minimum requirements even though i may think i can handle it.<br><br>one can get by in sales and service jobs without a degree because it is how at ease you can make the customers feel and thereby close a sale, however, one must always be able to conduct oneself as if one has had tertiary education, sad fact but true nonetheless. and i do find my lack of a degree a hindrance.<br><br>Â“AÂ” level and Polytechnic education are catered to different aspects of the work market, an Â“AÂ” level holder if he/she doesnÂ’t pursue university education would lose out to the Polytechnic student as Poly education is geared towards the workplace , whereas if the "A" level holder continues his/her education and graduate with a degree, he/she will definitely have more opportunities for promotions than the Diploma holder, even if the Diploma holder is far superior to the graduate in job capabilities, it is a sad mindset employers have. and an Â“AÂ” level student would find it easier to gain entry into universities in any field of study than Poly students, i think thatÂ’s a fact, if i am not wrong.<br><br>er, i have no idea how both of these education system works because i pursued both as private candidates, taking part time classes at private institutions. flunked "A" levels due to personal problems (or maybe it is more difficult than a diploma?) and got the diploma with ease.</div></blockquote>[quote] Originally posted by bleue on 28 April 2000, 9.15 am:<br>You can go on and split hairs about the word "consisently" and insist that I refer to all your posts when I was really really referring to this thread. Do I want to bother with you? What a waste of time.<br>what? now youÂ’re shying away from your yesterdayÂ’s post that contained these words: Consistently, you have adopted a self righteous "I am cleverer and I am always right" attitude.<br><br>why bleue? is it because you came up empty? *smiles* you had no facts to back up that statement of yours at all, didnÂ’t you? if you had the guts to start a slandering match with me, do finish it like a grown up, bleue. no use hiding, cause itÂ’s my reputation that iÂ’m defending.<br><br>oh, by the way, my first post in this thread is just up there, you donÂ’t have to go searching for it, spend some time looking for statements i made that will show me to be consistently self righteous, bleue, if not, kindly keep your obnoxious opinions to yourself and if youÂ’re <strong>truly grown up</strong>, maybe i would be lucky to get an apology but i wouldnÂ’t be holding my breath. well, no biggie, iÂ’m used to losers like you.<br><br><blockquote> Originally posted by bleue on 28 April 2000, 9.15 am<br>Do I want to bother with you? What a waste of time.<br></blockquote>oh yeah, another running away tactic. when someone cannot truly win an argument with facts or logic, this is the classic line to use: Â“Do i want to bother with you? What a waste of time.Â” mind you, i used that on Adam&amp;EveÂ™ too, but to defend my good name, i came back, so should you if you wish to retain your credibility, thatÂ’s if you had any to start with.<br><br>what fun is there in flaming if i am not the winner? yet this time round, it is not even flaming but that i am defending my honour.<br><br>bleue, ever wonder why i am so arrogant? besides natural talent of course. one main reason is because i never fear to admit it if iÂ’m wrong and to make amends, if necessary.<br><br>so should i wait with anticipation for more of your no facts to back your statements up kind of arguments <strong>(just like twinkle if i may add, *a thought just entered my mind: or are you twinkle in disguise? haha .. . that would explain your obsession with the idea that LittleMan = Belittled = colette = the whole forum other than you bleue, CyberAhmad, Adam&amp;EveÂ™ &amp;/or Illegal Operation naturally* and your need to sell and convince this obsessive thought to the rest of the people in this forum)</strong> or would i be surprised to find that you may be actually be right about me?<br><br>by the way, if you quoting me from other sources, please indicate date, time and thread topic so that i can verify if they were indeed from me, iÂ’ve posted more than 400 entries, most of them of this hideous length or like it and i havenÂ’t got the time to look for them if there are no attributions or sources. come, show auntie colette the worth of your years at the university getting educated.<br><br>have a good weekend.<br>auntie colette<br><br>[This message has been edited by colette (edited 29 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How interesting... a repeat of the Most Interesting thread. All the "characters" are more or less here, except Twinkle, so I suppose I'm now taking his position. (Who knows, Tommy may even start insisting that I'm him) And the same thing is happening again, you attack one, you attack all. Soon, this would evolve into another 500 message long thread. Too bad, I'm not like LittleMan, who would waste ONE WHOLE DAY madly typing nearly 100 messages just to "win". Nor could I bother like Twinkle to spend endless days following the thread. In the end, it would just be a hollow victory. I could call you guys childish and fools, you guys call me the same thing back and we repeat and repeat the cycle. Height of bo liaoness? But of course.<br><br>Hello Kitty, do you suppose that I'm the only one who feels this way about you? Well, here's news for you, impressions are built by people who don't know you, not everybody is as indulgent as your friend Tommy or your boyfriend IO. Instead of coming out nicer and stronger, you are showing once again how childish you can be. Better stick to your friends, it won't be easy to find new ones in this forum.<br><br>Collete, the only thing I want to say to you is, you started the offensive by calling CyberAhmad a fool. If you didn't start calling people stupid, why would they argue back with you? Of course, you'll insist that they ARE stupid. But that's beside the point. If you have care and respect for others' feelings, then why should others have towards you? You think that talking most shrilly would earn you points? Well, it only confirms in people's minds what a bitch you are. Go on and argue back. You like to win. Fine, I'll let you win this time. It's so absurb to think that because you typed the last or rudest message, you've won. I'll let you indulge in that delusion and ego masturbation.<br><br>Tommy, try seeing from another's point of view sometimes. You'll understand that not everybody who disagrees with you about your friends are evil or stupid. I don't mind being called stupid or immature, I've never claimed that I am clever or mature to start with. But to insist that because somebody is means that you aren't is laughable. Anyway, I don't care if I lose a place in your esteemed hall of friends. I'll rather not be placed beside people like Hello Kitty, Collete, LittleMan, Twinkle etc, in case I become another laughing stock, thank you very much.</div>

Twinkle got his points stated well..it just that in his anger...he step on all those who came in to defend Kitty or to find a truce.<br>Supporting a friend whenever he/she is down is what friendship meant..isn't it? Real or virtual. She is naughty and playful...yes..I agreed. But..did somebody die or physically hurt from it? Why don't you see it my way? I see her as a 'natural'..you know.. not 'faking'? So you see...my perception of peoples are still better than you. In my search of friend..here or outside..my criteria are quite straightfoward....frank and able to jokes. I don't care whether you are a rich man or general worker son...as long as we can get along.<br><br>Okie..let's get back to subject proper. Well..if you felt hurt by me calling you the greatest idiot.. too bad. You are.. when you went along with them. Whether Littleman is Belittled or not is not important. It is the presentation of the argument on the topic which I look for. Now see..what it turned to?<br><br>Look at the clown..CyberAhmad. He even draws in people like me into the circle. Are you going to agreed with him? Well..he did told you not to trust me..right? And his usage of sexual 'tones' must have rub on you.. to come out with a 'ego masturbation'. By comparing that with Kitty's..am I hearing a pot calling a kettle black?<br><br>Are you and CyberAhmad the same person? You are consistently defending him too. I'm having my suspicion now. Now you will feel how it is like to be at the other end of the flaming thread.<br><br>With that amount of education...I just hope you will come to your senses.<br><br>Good day to you!<br><br></div>

All the "characters" are more or less here, except Twinkle, so I suppose I'm now taking his position. (Who knows, Tommy may even start insisting that I'm him)"<br><br>Hahaha!!! Pls lah! How can u compare urself to Twinkle?!!! Hahaha!!! A few of us, at a point of time, know who he is liao lah! Juz dat we dunwan to expose him n let him have some fun and face! Kaoz! He's a way lot better than u lah!<br><br>"And the same thing is happening again, you attack one, you attack all."<br><br>Oh izzit? Even if it's so, ppl are not attacking someone who's defenceless.<br><br>"Soon, this would evolve into another 500 message long thread. Too bad, I'm not like LittleMan, who would waste ONE WHOLE DAY madly typing nearly 100 messages just to "win"."<br><br>Use your blain, use ur blain!!! It wun if u can juz stop posting.<br><br>"Nor could I bother like Twinkle to spend endless days following the thread."<br><br>Twinkle could do so coz during that period, he could afford the time and he always have to work on SERIOUS stuffs (Twinkle, rite? *wink*) online.<br>Gee... u sound real buzi, then how do u explain u actually BOTHER to go n catch up wif my 'interesting' topic and "contented wif life" or something like dat (i duno what lah coz i DUN BOTHER, LIKE U, too).<br><br>"In the end, it would just be a hollow victory."<br><br>Victory? Who won? Gosh! How can i not know? Was it Twinkle or me? Anyway, a hollow victory is better than having SOME shallow participant there.<br><br>"I could call you guys childish and fools,"<br><br>Ya sure, u can. U have a mouth dun u?<br>Ppl who actually bother to call, childish n foolish, ppl names can't be better themselves. Those who are really that mature n possess damn good judgement of others would choose to switch on their ignore mode.<br><br>"you guys call me the same thing back and we repeat and repeat the cycle."<br><br>Once again, u could choose not to do so. U r so mature, more mature than anyone of us here, u would have known this would have happened, so y keep repeating the same old mistake?<br><br>"Height of bo liaoness?"<br><br>*nod, nod*<br><br>"But of course."<br><br>Boh liao???<br><br>"Hello Kitty, do you suppose that I'm the only one who feels this way about you?"<br><br>Well, i dun. Can u pls go back n read properly huh???

So? Good news or bad news? It's sure not some first hand news wat. Alamak... what are u trying to tell me huh? So u r aware that they duno me rite? That's y i can't be bothered by what they think!

Pls enlighten me.<br>I'm not trying to prove something like u r trying to, rite now wat!<br><br>"you are showing once again how childish you can be."<br><br>Hee. Pls see earlier comments.<br>p/s u dun seem any better too. Dat's y u r so appealing to me and i enjoy talking to u; we share the same frequency of wavelength.<br><br>"Better stick to your friends,"<br><br>I am.<br><br>"it won't be easy to find new ones in this forum."<br><br>I dun intend to wat. Eh, does that mean u r? Aiyoh! Tsk, tsk, tsk. Like this wun do lah! Go post another topic like "Bi2 Wu3 Zhao1 You3" or something like dat lah.<br><br>SOME OF THE THINGS U DIRECTED AT COLETTE...<br><br>"If you have care and respect for others' feelings, then why should others have towards you?"<br><br>Hmmm... u sound as if u have loads of it for others... *puzzled*<br><br>"Well, it only confirms in people's minds what a bitch you are."<br><br>U can onli confirm something if u oladi have the idea in your mindset.

Fine, I'll let you win this time."<br><br>.............................................<br><br>"It's so absurb to think that because you typed the last or rudest message, you've won. I'll let you indulge in that delusion and ego masturbation."<br><br>Hullo, u could have stop at the previous statement; it doesn't really seemed that u have the intention to let anyone win. Ego masturbation? Is this what u refer to as when someone behaves like a egoistics person, he/she attains pleasure in it?<br>Pardon my ignorance, but hope u can help to answer a few queries. Aren't u the same? Or is ur ego bruised in any way? I mean dun u have any ego? Do we then termed it as "ego impotence"? Or izzit juz a matter of having no pride at all?<br><br>"Tommy, try seeing from another's point of view sometimes."<br><br>Strange that u can possibly ask him to do so. Have u practised this in the first place.<br><br>"You'll understand that not everybody who disagrees with you about your friends are evil or stupid."<br><br>Come on, he didn't say dat. Even if he did, he was refering to onli one person.<br><br>"I don't mind being called stupid or immature,"<br><br>Hahaha!!! Then y do u sound so defensive when someone called u that?<br><br>"I've never claimed that I am clever or mature to start with."<br><br>What abt saying ppl being toopid n childish?

Friends are really esteemed assets to us. Look on the bright side. U've never lose it. U never had it.<br><br>"I'll rather not be placed beside people like Hello Kitty, Collete, LittleMan, Twinkle etc,"<br><br>No, no, no! It's perfectly alrite wif us. U can jus stay away. We're more than glad that u r willing to take the intiative.

What great "crime" has he commited anyway, to get you to dislike him? It's so rare because you seem to like EVERBODY.<br><br>You sure claim to be friend to a lot of people, even those whom you hardly know. You said the same things about Twinkle when you first met him in the Most Interesting thread. You defend LittleMan as having so many good qualities when you've never met with him f2f. Yes, yes, we get the idea that you are a selfless, self-sacrifical friend who heroically rescues people from others' clutches. But where is the authority upon you speak when you talk about their characters? You only know as much about them as we do!<br><br>You repeated the same things over and over again about Hello Kitty, Twinkle and Little Man. It gets tiring to listen after a while. Yes, you have provided motives behind their behaviour. However, you did not go into an assessment of their behviour. In fact, you tacitly acknowledged their misbehaviour in recognising their bad qualities. All you have is a bunch of excuses, not justifications. So that means that at the end of the day, what they did is still WRONG.<br><br>Your idea of friendship is really quaint. Yes, we should defend- when appropriate. Just as Hello Kitty won't die from behaving naughtily, she won't die from a bunch of criticisms. By shielding her and encouraging her, she does not recognise where she could have gone wrong. That partly explains her behaviour now. You have to shoulder part of the blame too.<br><br>And may I remind you that just because you tell people to, or even, order them to, people will have a good impression of Hello Kitty? I get the impression that you seem to repeat and repeat the same stuff about her all the time in the hope that they do. Well, respect is won, not given. And up to now, she hasn't done anything to win people's respect back, only to wallow more deeply in her bad habits.<br><br>If it were me, of course I'll lend support. But I won't go to the extent of berating others who don't think highly of her because it's such a futile exercise. And I will try to help her become a better person. Your kind of encouragement is of the wrong tyoe.<br><br>Anyway, I find LittleMan a joke. It doesn't matter to you that he's a petty person who goes around praising himself, but it matters to others. The impersonation would show that he has no intergrity. His self praise would show his arrogance. (C'mon, he even speaks in that all knowing paternalistic, condescending, patronising way!) Even in this thread, he kept a vigil beside the computer to rebut every single person, so that the thread is moving so fast that the moderator told him to slow down. He shows a strong desire to win, but not in the right way. If his arguments are good (which I don't think they are), they are outshown by his bad attitude.<br><br>Okay, I shall go back and study for my exams. I won't be around for a while and I don't intend to reply to this thread anymore. Let people nurse their own delusions of granduer.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bleue..you are not coming back to this thread? That's bad. It is like coming to 'shit' without flushing. Hiak! sorry for my crude remark.<br><br>The main point of you being 'flame' was that you went along with those 2 idiots..can't you see?(They are hanging on to you as a support). Along the way..you pulled all those not involved in the thread into the picture..like Kitty. Those 2 idiots are enjoying it and I was just hoping that you could come to your senses..but *sigh*..what a pity.<br><br>Funny..you do take seriously my comment of you being the same person as CyberAhmad. Do you think I couldn't differentiate that? It was just a passing remark when Littleman was compared to as Belittled. It just proved your lack of maturity in seeing things. So how  could you judge me on my method of making friends..when you are so naive? For your info..even though you are not replying..you could be reading this...it is because of my attitude towards friends and business contacts that I have expanded my business of initial 6 clients to almost 50 now. Yes..and I said it again..'attitude'. That was what pisses me off with that Ng Kai Hoe. It is not a crime. I don't intent to dwell into it. Those who knew him or spoke to him knows what I am talking.<br><br>bleue..we see things differently all the time. What smell good on you..could be a turn off to others. To comments on others will get yourself into troubles. We are not living in a perfect world...and we have to live with it. The best solution is to avoid or ignored.<br><br>Good day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kitty..morning!<br><br>Guess how I fared at the Races?...heehee.<br><br>A 'smile' paints a thousand words. Yes..you are my lucky star. When will I see you again.. now that the main actors and actresses are all leaving. *so sad*<br><br>Kitty..you know what I see in all this commotions? Let me give you a brief ideas. Firstly.. a successful Littleman was operating the same business with another person aptly named Illegal Operation (you can guess his intention). Littleman hired a guy by the name of Belittled (Another person of Littleman's calibre, a consultant). Illegal Operation saw the threat to his business. So he hired CyberAhmad and Adam&amp;Eve from the street to smeared Littleman's operation. They hurled Littleman to Court. The prosecution (the flamers) hired a novice Uni's graduate bleue to fight the case. In her eagerness to win the first case(newbie)..bleue dug out all those not related to the case to the witness stand. In doing so..she became the butt of the jokes created by Illegal Operation and his cronies. Now she has to return to her books as an excuse to covered up the mess. Well..we got to forgive her..she is as innocent as Littleman. For Illegal Operation and the cronies..they will carry on their wayward operations..but it will now become a hide and seek business..and it will not flourished.<br><br>How's  that my dear?<br><br>Me gotta go..Races starting soon. Wish upon my lucky star again...hahaha.<br><br>Bye and take good care of yourself!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 30 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Illegal Operation thanks Tommy for all that recognition. Its really a fine feeling Illegal Operation is getting here now. Hey.. any form of publicity is good publicity.<br><br>Thanks for that warm fuzzy feeling again Tommy.. Illegal Operation has been getting a lot of that lately..<br><br>Illegal Operation will no longer comment on the multiple orgasmic identity of LittleMan since nobody has taken up the "List the IP job"<br><br>Still, it is his belief that LittleMan=Belitted. Well, nobody can proof otherwise. So there. Of course for those who have been actively engaging in conversation with that multiple orgasmic man, truth hurts, and it gets embaressing. Hey, Illegal Operation ain't laughing.. you are not alone.<br>Illegal Operation hasn't smelt the fish until Jennie comes alone...<br><br>So, thanks for the story.. at least I am not a cronnie, I am the big evil villian.</div>

I'm feeling 'high' now.<br><br>By calling me a licker at the other thread..was a ploy by you to trick me into going in..so that you could piece up the puzzle...hahaha. Sorry..Mr. Illegal Operation..I was not born today! Your puzzle will never be completed....hahaha. Hey..what happen to your 2 cronies? Did you terminate them..just like most operation which was done illegally? Oh..so bad of you....hahaha.<br><br>So you think that you are the big evil villian. Hey..hate to disappoint you... my story was censored. For your privilege..let me show you the end content. Here it is:<br><br>"The illegal operation was sponsored by a Mr Big.
