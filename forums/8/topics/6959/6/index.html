            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Tommy,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">Sorry for my extreme example ...<br>[/quote]<br><br>its ok, Tommy, you have to believe that your example works for this argument. Prove that it is relevant and not "extreme" !! Oooppss, looks like i am kinda of helping you    :p<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>but it was a known fact that most listed companies and those yet to be..are founded by Poly graduates.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>it is just your luck Tommy, i am currently doing a research on the companies listed on SGX. You want the facts ? I give you the facts :<br><br>ABR Holdings, Chairman Ang Yee Lim<br>ACMA Limited, Chairman Quek Sim Pin<br>Alliance Technology and Development, Chairman Chang Chin Chuan<br>Asiamedic Limited, Chairman Djeng Shih Kien<br>Avimo Group Limited, Chairmen B. Rocquemont<br>Aztech Systems Ltd, President and CEO Michael Mun Hong Yew<br>ACE Dynamics, Chairman Kong Mun Kwong<br>Advance System Automation, Chairman Lim Kee Ming<br>Amtek Engineering, Chairman Lee Ah Bee<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>.<br>they are degree holders and i have not even gone to the B, C, D, E, F, ..... Z. Only the company names starting with the letter "A" is shown above (and the "A" list is not complete).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It was through the reports in the BusinessTimes that I came to realised that Poly grads have that courage to venture out on their own...<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>there is an intended message. Just like the courtesy campaign, it is targeted to those who are not courteous. The news you read are targetted to those who are not as motivated. Graduates are expected to be <strong>self-motivated</strong> and any external motivation is unnecessary. Hence there is no need to create a big hoo-haa when a graduate founded a company.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But, of course there are failures too. There are always two sides of a coin.<br></strong></blockquote></div></blockquote><strong>but it is a fact that there are many more who failed than succeed. Like i once said, those who succeed are only "sparks we see once in a while" which make us go "hoooo - haaaaa " but they do not keep the bonfire burning. It is the general workforce (the bonfire) which we are discussing here, not the occasional sparks.<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>To bake a cake from what you learn and to bake it from trials and errors are two different method.<br></strong><br><br>yes ! and at least i know i will be able to bake a cake at my first try ! By doing trial and error, you may not even get a cake after the 10th try.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If you follows strictly to the books..you will most likely  get a 'stereotype' cake. The latter method will most probably be 'unique'.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Who will follow "strictly" to the books ? I dunno if you cook but i do. Anyone who is good in cooking will know that we cannot follow the cookbook's instructions rigidly. When it says 250 ml, do you really go and measure ? Cookbook (and textbooks) are just guides.<br><br>We are taught the "formal" and "conventional" way of baking a cake. By acquiring this skill, we will not starve. However, we do not stop there. We go further by improvising the method and finally achieve something unique.<br><br>Let me give you an example.<br><br>Before a writer learns to write well, he needs to read a lot of books. And learn from other good writers how to write good essays. He will <span style="font-style: italic;">copy</span> some writers' style and phrases and use them in his own essays. Gradually, he will develop his own style of writing. He does not learn writing by <span style="font-style: italic;">trial and error</span><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I stand by my argument that a leader is born and not nurtured. When all things are peace and well...we don't see a true leader.<br></strong></blockquote>haha, all Presidents, Prime Ministers and CEOs in this World are not leaders ! Those Indonesian students shouting on the street are !<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It is during a crisis..or a major problem..can a true leader be found..<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>not <span style="font-style: italic;">found</span> but <span style="font-style: italic;">created</span><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>All those training will come handy if he/she can conduct himeself/herself effectively.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>you are contradicting yourself, now you are saying that "training" (nurture) will come in handy.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I'm going to give you an example..but please don't say it is extreme.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>ok, i will let you have your way for once.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>She was just a simple housewife before she became one..<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>simple housewife ??? hahaha My mother IS a simple housewife ! Let's look at Aquino's profile :<br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Cory Aquino received her education at the Assumption Convent in the Philippines, Ravenhill Academy in Philadelphia, Notre Dame Convent School in New York, College of Mount Saint Vincent in New York and Far Eastern University in the Philippines.<br><br>Her honorary degrees include Doctor of Humane Letters, College of Mount Saint Vincent (NY), Ateneo de Manila University and Xavier University (Philippines), Doctor of Laws from University of the Philippines, and Honoris Causa, Boston University, Fordham University, Waseda University (Tokyo), Eastern University and University of Santo Tomas (Manila), as well as Doctor of Humanities, Stonehill College in Massachusetts.<br></span><br><br>so you call this lady <span style="font-style: italic;">simple</span> housewife ? If she is a primary school dropout, then your example will have been more convincing.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Training courses are just..courses. How effectives they are.. will only be known when they are present with a real challenge.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, and these courses are NOT aimed to produce Presidents and Prime Ministers. They are aimed to produce leaders who can lead teams in companies.<br><br>And yes, the effectiveness of the courses will only be checked when they are presented with a real challenge. But we are preparing them for the challenge.<br><br>You can't climb Mt Everest without training, can you ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Littleman..it feel so good to be able to hold a session with you on the topic..and it is an honour..thanks.</strong></blockquote>oh, please dun say that !

It is the general workforce (the bonfire) which we are discussing here, not the occasional sparks.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br>hi everyone, actually we did not know how many people with JC education or Poly education failed in life or career etc . . .<br>so there is no point in arguing about the number that failed. Unless you have the statistics how many people that receive JC education or Poly education failed in life or career etc.<br><br>by the way little man why do you think that due to the fact that they are a poly educated students thus when they are successful in life then everyone reported about him or her.<br><br>The statistics that you gave us about the number of degrees holder that hold high posts in their respective companies. Did they all received JC education before going to university * This is just a question which i like to know *<br>--------------------------------------------<br>Actually what i feel is that polytechnic students and JC students should be given the equal opportunity to go to University at their chosen course based on their results. Which means not saying that only the top 5% of the course in polytechnic is allowed to qualify to enter University.But when everyone apply, they are given equal chances. Prehaps polytechnic students are only qualified to enter courses that are related to their chosen course in their polytechnic. They should know what they want to work as in future if they choose polytechnic education.Thus when they choose polytechnic education, they should think in great details, what they want to work as. If they want to choose other course which is totally not related, then too bad. They should not choose polytechnic education but they should choose JC education which give them the freedom to choose other course.<br><br>*All these are just personal comments from me. I have read almost all the postings but not all so all these comments are not directing in any of the post*<br><br>------------------<br>~@!!snow!!@</div>

My point of bring up the failure rate is to show that there are more failures than those who succeed every year hence we should stop naming all the success stories. Btw for those who are interested, there are 2000+ backrupts in Singapore every year and it is increasing.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>by the way little man why do you think that due to the fact that they are a poly educated students thus when they are successful in life then everyone reported about him or her.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>there are many occasions when companies are founded by graduates but not reported. Some of them are even Awardees. Like for example, Datapulse and Serial System. Chairman of Serial System was awarded best entrepreneur for 3 straight years.<br><br>Did you realise that when it is nearing the release of O'level or A'level results, if one of the students died before he collected his results, and who happened to have excellent results, his case will be amplified by the press ? But there are so many people dying everyday, why are they so special ? Because it makes their death more sad.<br><br>Same goes to the President Scholar whose father is a chicken rice seller. His case was given a lot of attention because the "chicken rice seller's" son achieved the President Scholarship, and this is rare. Why the hoo-haa ? Because "chicken rice seller" can produce "President Scholar" too, this is a source of motivation.<br><br>The theory applies to those self-made-boss diploma holders too.<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>The statistics that you gave us about the number of degrees holder that hold high posts in their respective companies.

Well, that's one area I'm definitely inferior to you...hahaha.<br><br>Your research on the CEO of the various listed companies was well stated. Give me sometime to dig out the Poly grad CEO statistics...as I am not doing research like you..but just based on reports from the Straits Times and the Business Times. One question though...are those that you stated  founders or appointed? There is a different here. The former is a pioneer, the latter an employee status.<br><br>The cake was an excellent example of how one must not depend on textbooks theory alone. How successful you are..will still depend on your ability to innovate what you have been taught. A successful entrepreneur needs the necessary skill..and I meant skill and not education to start a Company beside the finances. He must also have that courage to take risk..knowing that the failure rates are great. No offence..but I think Poly outshines the JCians hand down. JCians tends to be more passive in these aspects. Uni's graduates are a different breeds. They have at least another 3 years of faculty lectures. So let's not compare it with those from Poly..it just not fair. I was told that getting a 'degree' is like having a passport to international pleasures.*wink*<br><br>If industries workers who are appointed Supervisor, Line leader or Section head are leaders..then we have 'tons' of them in Singapore. Just get yourself enrolled in any of the Supervisory courses conducted by the various private (but recognised) insitutions..and wella..a leader in the making. True leaders are not found in that manners. LKY is one very good example..hahaha..another extreme case. His leadership shown when he and his 'old guards' took on the Colonial goverment, then the Communists and later the Independence from Malaysia. These are people of leadership quality born in them. They are not trains to be leader..just that circumstances forced them to become one. So did Carozon Aquino. Even with her outstanding resumes.. she was just a humble housewife living in America with her exiled late husband...before she became a President.<br><br>Littleman..you do not need to be defensive in your approach..heehee. You are so well educated and informed..that I will need use my reserves.. to buck up my knowledge I acquired to thwart your horrendous attacks..hahaha.<br><br>Have a nice day!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 25 April 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Tommy (edited 25 April 2000).]</div>
