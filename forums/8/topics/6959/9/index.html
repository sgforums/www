I was curious and hence I return to the forum.<br><br>But i would like to bring to your attention that when Belittled starting posting in this forum, the flaming has not even started. In fact, i think when i first returned to this forum, the poly vs jc thread was not even here yet. So are you trying to say that i can "forsee" that this poly vs jc thread will end up this way and hence created another person to support myself before hand ? I do wish that i can forsee things, so that i would have avoided this thread altogether.<br><br>Like you say, at the end of the day only me and Belittled will know if we are the same person.

CyberAhmad started to be rude first and finally called me a moron, am i supposed to sit back, just grin and bear it? maybe you can but i canÂ’t and if asserting my rights makes me petty and inflammatory, i wonder if you learnt anything in university. oh but pardon me, what could a non graduate like me know about what you learnt in university, right? and how dare i even argue with you?<br><br>which man i made cry is surely no one elseÂ’s business but my own? yes, i am insensitive at times, that iÂ’ll be the first to admit, i am not here for the Ms Congeniality Award. i come here for fun, to exchange views, makes friends and broaden my mind with the experiences and ideas of others. when people flame me, they asking to be flamed back. now you do not purposely step on a DobermanÂ’s tail and not expect to be barked at in the least or in the worst case scenario, bitten by it, now do you?<br><br>how well do you know me, bleue, that you dared judged me in open forum to be small minded, petty and inflammatory? by making such remarks about someone you donÂ’t even know shows you up.<br><br><blockquote><br>Consistently, you have adopted a self righteous "I am cleverer and I am always right" attitude.</blockquote>now bleue, <strong>consistently</strong> is such a strong word and words are cheap. maybe i am really so arrogant that i'm not aware that iÂ’m self righteous, so please do support your claim with examples from my previous posts and do remember to quote in context, not out of context, okay?<br><br>also pray tell, how badly did i behave in this thread given that i was provoked first and dear bleue, since when did you become the judge and jury of this public forum?<br><br>calling myself an auntie, you also have a problem with that? bleue, what is it about me that irks you? is it my ability to flame, flirt and post reasonable posts? if it makes you feel good about yourself that i am an ugly old hag, please do so, it is your right and i will never interfere with that, why would i deprive you of the pleasure of the delusion?<br><br><blockquote>Before you start seeing red and hurling flames without bothering to read properly, I HAVE NEVER AT ONE POINT SAID THAT THE BOYS ARE RIGHT. I am saying the supposedly mature people (as shown in their proclamations, not actions) are behaving badly and should be ashamed of themselves.</blockquote>oh please. is this paragraph supposed to be an olive branch? you threw so much dirt at me and you expect to keep my silence and let things be? grow up bleue baby! welcome to the real world where and when people dare confront you with your baseless allegations made against them, in this instance, now that would be me.<br><br>for the record, i defend myself in this forum because of my reputation, no one likes having their names sullied, especially a brat like me. i have always stood up for myself since young and i certainly do not see the need to stop doing so once i'm grown, especially when i'm not even in the wrong. for those who find flaming a waste of time, that i do agree even though i do flame people, but i never flame them for fun, i observe them and think carefully before doing so.<br><br>however, defending my own good name is not a waste of time, it is easy to say it is so when the person being accused is not you, when the shoe is on the other foot, i believe most of you will sing a different tune.<br><br>so bleue, please support all your allegations against me with facts and kindly do not posts something baseless and inflammatory again, thinking that it will make me lose my head, that is a tactic iÂ’ve long learnt and overcome years ago.<br><br>i look forward to your response and supporting facts, if you have any, that is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>colette</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is getting more and more interesting.<br><br>First off, I have only said that LM= Belittled. I found it hard to believe that Jennie is real but I did not at all suggest who she is. I have never made any references to iambird too, or anybody else.<br><br>LM, why is my name in bold? Belittled said you use bold very judiciously to highlight your points. I'm sorry you have disappointed him this time round. It is beginning to look like thuggish behaviour on your part to resort to this to intimidate me. And as aunty Colette would tell you, it is extremely rude to mess around with somebody's name. It's common sense of course, but since you and that aunty get along, you might want to listen to her.<br><br>I also find it strange that you and Belittled make competing claims. You said that he imitates you, he said that you introduced him to the forum. Who is telling the truth? And it's strange that he knows things about you and can even say stuff to the effect like NUS sponsored you overseas because you worked hard. Huh? How would he know all that? I certainly wouldn't if I just followed you from post to post. A stalker online and offline perhaps?<br><br>Jennie, how noble of you. Could you be kind enough to tell me, where did you suddenly find the courage to speak up? I assume that you have kept quiet all this while because you haven't been confident of your English. Where did that the sudden boost come from? It must have something powerful because you went to the extent of berating others. I have trouble keeping up with all this, it would be kind of you to enlighten me and the rest.<br><br>BTW, does everybody know that LM is in England or am I the only one in the know? Did he just say he was? Because I could also say I'm in Japan when I'm in good old Lion city.<br><br>Anyway, I've been to the thread that aunty Collete directed me to, the one on Most Interesting E-mail. I'm bemused to find the same cast of characters. This would be compelete with Hello Kitty and Twinkle. Where are they? It seems like people who behave badly tend to repeat themselves. Anway, Collete, did you really make somebody cry? No evidence leh. Must be your inflated ego at work. Perhaps this would also be the thread where the alliance of LM-Colette-IO-Tommy is formed?<br><br>Okay, now to my main point. I am shocked to discover that LM spent one whole Sunday posting messages nonstop. He must have posted like 100 of them? Sorry, I didn't count. Some of his postings are as lame as one liners like "Haha, what can I say?"<br><br>If I have been following LM like Belittled and Jennie claim that they have, I wouldn't come to the same conclusion that he is intelligent, he reasons well and that he is a nice person in general. I would think that he likes to act hero (exhibited by having characters praise himself??), he is bo liao (which balanced person would spend ONE WHOLE DAY doing this?), he is petty (he takes it like a personal affront when it was not directed at him) etc.<br><br>It's also strange to see in other threads that LM keep saying that he would leave but somehow keep coming back. I'm not asking him to go but I'm trying to understand his motivations. Is it because he likes to keep hearing people asing him to stay? Because I'm piecing together an image of an ego-maniac.<br><br>All the things I have pointed out are not meant to be personal attacks. I don't know LM personally, I only have an impression of him. Foe all I know, he may be a nice- but flawed- person in real life. I am just pointing out what I see as discrepancies so that his supporters can put up a stout defence and convince the rest of us.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've just read the thread on "Contented in Life". I find it difficult to buy that too. How could somebody be using your computer and sending out numerous messages IN YOUR ROOM without you noticing it???? I assume that the person must have spent quite some time typing since he sent numerous messages. It's a little far fetched if you ask me.<br><br>Also, if a friend has been found to be imitating and revealing personal details about a perosn's life, a normal human being would feel a range of emotions- anger? disgust? fear? LM seems more bemused than anything else. Even now, when Belittled continues to imitate and quote him. Is that plausible?<br><br>Collete, I've seen your "pattern" in the Most Interesting E-mail thread. You like to win, you think that when others don't answer you, you've won. And here, you show everybody that you know you are insensitive and you are not ashamed of it. It really shows up your arrogance and desire to be one-up, even if you KNOW you are in the wrong. You can go on and split hairs about the word "consisently" and insist that I refer to all your posts when I was really really referring to this thread. Do I want to bother with you? What a waste of time.<br><br>May I remind you that impressions are formed by others as well and one day, all this will come back to haunt you. You may win the battle but you have lost the war.<br><br>[This message has been edited by bleue (edited 28 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How interesting.... Belittled claimed that he made repeated postings in page 4 and 5 of this thread. However, there isn't an "edited by......" All we see is his "paiseh...." and signature.<br><br>Doesn't this point that he's trying to pretend to be new at this? What's the point unless he's trying to differentiate himself from somebody else, a regular in this forum? He claims that he wants to imitate that person but carefully leaves traces to show that he's not. Could this be an attempt by the same person to cover his tracks?</div>

If you insist it is an apple, i cannot do anything. If you buy what i say, fine, if not, fine. You have your rights. I don't have to go to the extend of describing my daily life cycle and my relationship with Belittled to prove my point. This is just a forum, I don't take it that seriously.

            <div class='col-md body'>bleue....please take notes that I have not say anything sensitives toward you..so please don't pull me into something like an 'alliance' with them. Littleman and I only spoke to each other recently. We didn't even speak to each other at the Hello Kitty thread. Talking about it...I was in this forum because of her...and that thread. She kept asking me to come in.. way back to January..but I did not..partly because of my poor command of English. I came in because of some forumites 'assualts' on her. People like Twinkle and Terence (Now you know why I insulted him..because he deserved it) and others. These are forumites of calibres and yet they 'swarm' a poor little girl like piranhas when they see a wound. Twinkle is someone pragmatic..but just that he let his angers got the better of him..sad ending.<br><br>SHOULD Littleman and Belittled be one..I still admired him. He for one is willingly to teach us the finer point of rebuttals. I have to admit that I learns a lot from him.<br><br>If you have read my earlier reply here...I said that we must not be too emotional into discussion..or we will end up hurting each others..which is what I am seeing now. The endless 'uncalled remarks' of Littleman..sometimes gets to the nerves of other forumites. There is even one who came in as Eve&amp;Adam just to spite him. Kinda of childish, isn't it?..or should I say idiotic.<br><br>Whoever he is..it is his chosen right here. At the end of the day..it is still us forumites to decides for ourselves. For me..he is still that Littleman I spoke too...and I believe in him.<br><br>Good day!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On a more serious note, look at the IP LOGGED hyperlink on the bottom right hand corner of your messages.<br><br>To prove the claims by Littleman, Belitted and Jennie, get a moderator to reveal the IP addresses behind all these post.<br><br>Technically, all ISP has a DHCP server that issues a different IP address everytime we dial in.. its seldom the same. But then, considering the fact that Littleman and Belitted are in UK, we know that their IP address should never looks like any ISP's IP in Singapore. Jennie's IP shouldn't look like anything in UK. We can know, by looking at the first, and 2nd qualifier of the IP address. The 4th qualifier (maybe 3rd also)are normally issued by the DHCP server.<br><br>And the splat of constant Jennie-Belitted-Littleman post shouldn't be made with the same IP address.
