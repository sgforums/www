            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm,after reading all the threads,i feel that we are comparing apples and oranges,the teaching styles and subjects that JCs and polys teach are entirely different,so therefore there is no common ground for comparison unless poly and JCs teach the same subjects,polys teach technical stuff more related to industry and more emphasis on practical while JC teach more theory and the emphasis is to get the students into Uni where they will have a chance to learn more practical knowledge related to the discipline they have chosen.It is sad to here that such biaseness is practised in Uni where poly students are considered 2nd class and i always thought that Uni students are mature enuff to not practice this class system,but of cos what i could be hearing is just a few bad apples spoiling the whole bunch,and i hope that's true  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

I should have stopped long ago but i thought it is just a form of courtesy to reply any post that is directed to me and i try to redirect the discussion back to the topic (which i tried !) but Adam&amp;Eve just choose to continue with the Uni Vs Poly despite my numerous attempts to clarify .... sigh.<br><br>Adam&amp;Eve :<br><br>if you have reduced your argument to such a personal level, i think there is really no need for further discussion.<br><br>CyberAhmad :<br><br>forget about the challange otherwise it will end up having another thread created for us ! hahaha<br><br>miss the discussion with Maya and Yubaddoobs in the "You Are a Chinese..." thread, they are so pro .... it was a wonderful discussion.
