            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Illegal Operation,<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>Illegal Operation wonder where did your additional 223 phantom O Level takers for 1999 comes from. In his hands, Illegal Operation holds a press release by MOE. 33057 sat for the Os in 1999.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>it is taken off MOE homepage, go search for it if you want. However, the figure 33280 (which you claimed to be 33057) <strong>is not</strong> taken into consideration during the calculation. Even if it does, it only incur an error 0.7 % (223/33057 x 100)<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>(the below 20 pointers)<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>why didn't you say this earlier ?? Now you see the figures are to your disadvantage and so you are trying all ways to fight a way out.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Your assumptions took 180 students.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>if i were to use the EXACT value, this number would have been higher. How can good schools like ACJC and CJC only have 20 12-pointers ? Even if i reduce 180 to 90, the percentage only goes up by 1.9%, does it make a lot of difference ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>then you magically added another 223 students.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>that number is <strong>not</strong> used in the computation at all.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Fabrications aside. On his argument on dot.coms and new economy, here's what Illegal Operation have for you.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>i really wonder why you have to dig into this old issue. Do you have to go all the way out to prove that you are right and i am wrong ? Is winning really that important to you ? If you think it is, fine, you win. I don't like to see people going to such extend to put another person down, i do not like to bring out the bad side of you. Everyone has their nice side, i hope to see that side of you more often.<br><br>Thanks for your URLs, i will read it when i am free, i am now busy with my report.</div>

It does just not prove anything.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Of course it does.  The fact is that one experience IS still an experience, the way one evidence presented in court is still an evidence.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>look at the figures i represented to IO, i will like to put this "rare" and "not rare" thing to a stop.</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Even if ALL these 203 students go to Poly, what's their percentage ?<br>203/4733 x 100 = 4.3 %<br></span></blockquote>So I take it that your conclusion is that it is still <span style="font-style: italic;">rare</span> for 'O' achievers to prefer a poly?<br>You shouldn't just end and conclude with a figure you assume is correct because you calculated based on just a SINGLE course's intake. What about the other courses with students holding good 'O' results?<br>Perhaps I can give you a few of them:<br><br>Singapore Poly &gt;<br>Multimedia Software Engineering<br><br>Ngee Ann Poly &gt;<br>Mass Communications<br>Film, Sound and Video<br><br>And like I said, these are just a <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">few</span></strong> of them, and there're lots more, not to mention the other 2 polys as well.  Even courses that take in lots of students or students with poorer grades have high scorers among them as well, and my friend is an example.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>you don't seem to be able to differentiate a joke from a serious discussion .... hmm .... should I have a serious discussion with you ?<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>I believe that such an issue is very sensitive to girls especially, so of course you don't go around joking about things like that.  If you have had been able to differentiate what's serious and what's not, you wouldn't have even brought up a sensitive thing like this to be a joke in here in the first place?    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  If you consider what you've written a little joke, then perhaps you shouldn't have taken what IO had said abt you having 'a small brain' as a personal attack?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>(again, no offence meant of course.)<br>IF you would seriously like a discussion with me, sure why not? I like to learn from people who have different views with me the way we learn lessons from figures in history.<br>But perhaps that'll have to wait until I finish my exams then.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[quote]<strong><br>its not <span style="font-style: italic;">my</span> thinking that is important, it is the <span style="font-style: italic;">society's</span> thinking that is important.<br></strong></div></blockquote><strong>I take it that the society you talking about is the group of people like you who still thinks that JC education is better?<br>The fact lies here that the persons in this group, or this society as you preferred to call it all thinks the way like you do.<br>If we didn't have them thinking this way, we wouldn't be having this kind of a prejudice present today.<br><br>I guess that enough for now.
