            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i guess this the how far the discussion can go.

And every path produces graduates which meet different market requirements in Singapore. Therefore, no meaningful comparison can be made between a JC student and a Poly one. We can't compare a hammer and a walkman can we ? They have different functions.<br><br>However, their path may meet when they enter the Uni but unfortunately, they are not viewed equally. As most people still bear the mentality of "only weak O'Level students go to Poly", which to some extend, still true. They have also choose to disbelieve that even weak students can excel in later life cos the examples are too few to justify a strong stand.<br><br>Mentality does not change overnight. You're probably sick of this sentence liao but i have to say it again ... "It takes GENERATIONS to change the mindset of people".<br><br>Polytechnics do have to prove their worth and only they themselves can change the mentality of the people.

It is about how each of these schools equip the students with knowledge.

            <div class='col-md body'>Personally speaking,<br>i do feel that poly grads going into local uni should be given more chances. As a lot of pple have the perception that uni is a place for JC students only and so in that way they are "smarter" than us.......i think local uni should give poly grads more chances to upgrade ourselves !!!!<br>Agree?<br><br>------------------<br>Music is Life.<br>Get Cool With Music !!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my point of view, don't know whether is it true or not.<br><br>I notice that JC students when enter NS do not excel better than poly student. They are mostly more blur as compare to most poly student. Most JC students are easily being manipulate by people as compare to poly student.<br><br>JC students are more proud and arrogance than poly students. That is what I notice from my friends around me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know why there's this obsession about which education level is better, which institution is better or not, I for one never argue that JC is better than poly. BTW Littleman, not trying to sound arrogant or critical, but if you are in uni you will understand what I mean by <strong>essential basic</strong> modules. They are the level 1000 modules we first year students need to take, and they are essential only because they are so called <strong>prerequisites</strong> to the other modules we will need to take in our later years. Without these modules, we cannot progress and graduate, and obviously, different courses ask for different essential modules, different even for honours or non honours year. And it's <strong>logical</strong> that the poly students who get into uni to skip all these modules as their syllabus in poly already covers what these essential modules teach. So isn't it logical to save them time? I for one am struggling with the core essential modules though..hehe Hope this clears things up for you so you can understand what I really mean. (all the lau-chiao uni students here, please correct me if I'm wrong as I'm er..still a freshie.)<br>But after reading your quote of my post again, Littleman,..I wonder...are you from Uni? I mean if you are...how long ago since I don't think the system changed that much in the last few years did it? I have the utmost respect for the poly people who get into NUS though...got one friend whom I knew from army. They stand a much better ground than us JC-to-uni students especially when comparing some of us who go to "not really related" courses to what we studied in JC(and that is a lot, especially for computing. probably because computing only needs Maths C and it's the only subject I did well at the As....the rest is ...horrid. And no, I don't mean computing is a dumping ground, just that I'm one of the er...less impressive students...hehe..oops out of topic.)<br><br>True that JC gives a easier route to uni due to the exams and entry system, but so what..just follow what you are interested in, JC and poly's teaching styles are somewhat different(factual vs technical), so whatever you feel good with, go for it. True that a few(I emphasize a few) JC students do appear more stuck up, but to assume most or all are is simply a too sweeping statement, and you can make many sweeping statements about anything, and remember <strong>racism</strong> is also a sweeping ideology(wrong word?). But is racism "correct"? No.  BTW if you all are curious I went thru the JC route to NUS. And for goodness sake, I say again don't argue who's better or not, just study.(which I'm not doing a lot right now....exams beckon and I'm still not studying..arggh)<br><br>[This message has been edited by theychosenone (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>
