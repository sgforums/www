            <div class='col-md body'>Better students who plan to go to university tend to choose JC over poly because it is a shorter course of study. But for those who plan alternative paths of education, they choose poly, but they make up the minority number.<br><br>There are good students in every school, but the best students study in view of getting a degree. I think that should explain that the supposed 'inferiority' of poly education is actually due to circumstance.<br><br>[This message has been edited by BluErf (edited 23 April 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How good are the JCians compared to the Poly students...that I can't comments..as I am not qualified. But...if I will to choose(employing) between them...it don't really make a difference. I will rather look for a person who can work smart..and not hard...and come 'cheap'. In the working world...whatever you are trained to be..can be easily replaced. This happened to someone I known. She was recently retrenched from an MNC...and her last drawn salary was above $8K. I doubt..she will be able to get that kind of job and salary again.<br><br>It is a fast changing world. Whatever you learn today will become irrelevant tomorrow. So you got to keep upgrading yourself to keep pace with the changing world..or you will be out of the race..irregardless of whether you a JCians, Poly graduates or a Degree Holder.<br><br>The only difference(but not inferior)I notice so far is that Poly students are more courages to strikes it out on their own when they graduated..eg Sim Wong Hoo..Creative Technology.<br><br>Littleman...it is still a joy to read your arguments with them.

            <div class='col-md body'>the topic says "is polytechnic education inferior to junior college education".<br><br>the impt pts in this argument are<br>a) inferior in what sense? with regards to which context?<br><br>b) are these 2 systems comparable in the first place?<br><br>ok, if u look at it really from the myopic pt of view, where the most difficult to get in one wins (like pple usually think that the more expensive thing is better...crap, but still..), JC wins hands down. enuff said.<br><br>if u're looking at it as a stepping stone to higher qualifications, JC still wins hands down. good results or not, a poly grad cannot get into NUS or NTU without his diploma being relevant to his intended course of studies. think nautical studies. which course in NUS or NTU can u get into, even if u're a perfect scorer?<br><br>JC is tailored for U, poly is tailored for the industry. so with regards to U, it's a no-contest.<br><br>that brings us to the question of whether these 2 systems are comparable in the first place. remembering that of course they are tailored for different things to being with.<br><br>now, let's look at it from the society pt of view. if u're a poly grad, u'll work earlier. will u earn more in the end? depends if the JC grad goes to U. if he does, changes are that he'll out-earn u in yr lifetime, assuming that u get the same job and rise at the same pace. simply coz he's on a higher pay scale. given 30 odd yrs of work, he'll catch up and overtake the poly grad. i'm NOT going to dispute this pt with anyone here, i have stats to prove this from research sometime back but normal argument abt the reliability of stats and the way it's presented is bad enuff. argument here would be worse.<br><br>so, given these is JC education superior? hardly.....<br><br>essentially, if u're looking at the BIG picture, the person himself/herself matters more than anything else. all the EQ stuff and all. attitude. GP teaches u some analytical skills and how not to see things microscopically, but is it effective? i look at the numbers of GP failures from the recently released A level results. i was part of a team which went down to every single JC (except Pioneer) on results day and looking the GP results, i'm beginning to wonder what JC students have learnt from their GP lessons. is it the system's fault or is it the student's fault. i have a inclination to believe it's the student.<br><br>results always go up, more or less. GP is the one which never goes up. marginally maybe.<br><br>so if u're taking GP as an indication of "thinking" skills JC put in u, it failed. period. it might have benefitted some, but not enuff.<br><br>so, are poly grads more creative and more useful in society? it would take more than a few Sim Wong Hoo examples to convince me.<br><br>if u read his "Chaotic Thoughts of a New Millenium", u'll realise that poly had preciously little to do with his success.<br><br>Ability is NOT measured purely by grades. Pure academic results simply means that you did well in that exam. The question I studied for came out. So, I scored. Does that mean I'm good? Even if it's because I'm smart, is that all there is?<br><br>Vision. Drive. Attitude. Tolerance. All these important characteristics of a successful person will not necessarily be present in a person with academic capabilities.<br><br>Still, the piece of paper is the first impt step to society. dun give me the dot.com crap. the time has passed. pple make it big because they were ahead of their times. think Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo!, Creative. there are fewer and fewer "new" dot.com ideas left. some will still make it, but most will probably fail.<br><br>most of us will probably be employees in our lifetimes and the paper is the start.<br><br>however, there's more to life than money and a career. it's u as a person. the system can help u, but in the end, the only thing which can really help u is yrself. even a good system can produce bad eggs.<br><br>conclusion.<br>the most impt thing is personal development. it's nothing to do with the system. both are not perfect and are tailored towards different things.<br><br>products from both systems can succeed. in the end, the benchmark for success is yrself. You rate how successful you were.<br><br>To argue which system is better by comparing success stories from both sides is thus a moot point.<br><br></div>

I used to think that a cert only helps when it comes to the application of jobs. Whether I will do well in the job have to depend on my performance. Hence in short, the cert is only a "gateway". True. But.<br><br>Sometimes, it is this gateway that determines a person's life path. We studied for sooooo many years only to hope that what our potential will be given an <strong>opportunity</strong> to be unleashed. And a good cert can buy you the <strong>opportunity</strong>.<br><br>A good cert does not guarantee you success, but it buys you the <strong>opportunity</strong> which you need before you fight your way to success.<br><br>So which is better ?

            <div class='col-md body'>After all those heated arguments, finally I see that at least there is someone who is talking some sense out of it.<br><br>LittleMan<br>Your point that degree does helps in the long run does stands, meaning opening new and more advancement for careers.Why dun we put it this way? In an organisation, there is a always a part for everyone. Different jobs needs different expertise and expectations as well responsiblities...Overall, it is the attitude of a person that thrives and survive...one has got to learn to accept the spirit of the company and work towards the good of the company.It does not matter if u are a degree holder or diploma holder, to them as long u can contribute to the company, you are a good employee.<br>Let me give u an example, a female worker at HP, she actually has helped the company to save million of dollars, by simply indentifying the problem by seeing things in a simple manner. All the so called professionals rely on the big equipments spending tons of money to actually think that it is more feasible. And u might say that how many simple ppl who come out with such an idea? Well, at least she did and she won the best employee award...and I think she is only an "O" level certificate holder.(Note:One does make the difference.) She did what she thinks is best for the company and she never expect that she could contribute so much. So sometimes, education does not seems to play a part in how one perceive things.<br><br>Another example, is my personal experience.<br>I have been into jobs where I have to compete with degree holders and ultimately at that interview, there is one question which was being asked,"Among all the candidates, why do you think I should choose u? For the fact that you are a diploma holder, and there are a couple of degree holders outside fighting for this very position?"<br>I replied," First and foremost, the requirements of the position that is needed totally fits into my disposition. For the very fact, that I knew that the competition will be steep, that is why I am here to tell you why I can be the outstanding candidate to get this job. Do you need a worker with good acedamic results or a worker who produce outstanding results? Since this is a sales engineer job, it requires the personality that suits the job. It is not about what u have acheived in your tertiary education but what I am willing to contribute for the company. I do not use my results to tell my clients why they should trust in our company but what the company have to offer him, the best deal to provide a win-win situation.<br>Secondly, if a person with the same abilities in getting the deals and as a diploma holder, the company gives me a lower starting salary, which is a benefit for the company. You need not spend lotsa money to train me up and realise that I am up to the job, thus wasting the time and money. Thus, it is not the education that is going to bring me to the managerial position but my amount of contribution in the long run."<br>And yes, I got the job.<br><br>So the thing is how u are going to convince your employee that u are capable and able to do the best for the company. Yes. the competition is greater if I were to compete with degree holders but ultimately, mindset of the employee is important and to stay with the company as long as it takes.<br><br>It seems that the correlation of degree holders job-hopping is more than that of the diploma holders(correct me if I am wrong) becos there are better opportunites elsewhere. Diploma holders will tentatively stay on becos they knew they lack of the education to compete so they will stay for experience to mostly about 5-8 years before they start to look else where. But in the least, the company has not wasted their time training up the person, since he has also contributed to the company considered the amount of time the employees has put in,<br><br>I know the thread is about "A" level vs Diploma holders but in my realm, it is more suitable to argue versus the degree holders cos it has much more stand in the sociey nowadays.<br><br>------------------<br>We have no right to ask when sorrow comes, "Why did this happen to me?" unless we ask the same question for every moment of happiness that comes our way.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rinoa,<br><br>here's my reply to your post :<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Rinoa Heartilly:<br>In an organisation, there is a always a part for everyone. Different jobs needs different expertise and expectations as well responsiblities...<br><br>It does not matter if u are a degree holder or diploma holder, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">to them</span></strong> as long u can contribute to the company, you are a good employee.<br></blockquote>you have chosen to look at things at the view point of the company (note the italic bold words in your quote). However, in most of my argument, i have chosen to look at things at a personal level. Just like to highlight the difference.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Overall, it is the attitude of a person that thrives and survive...one has got to learn to accept the spirit of the company and work towards the good of the company.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, but you first must be accepted into the company before you can talk about "thriving" and "works towards the good of the company". And a good cert though does not guarantee your acceptance, will give you a <span style="font-style: italic;">higher chance</span> of getting in.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Let me give u an example, a female worker at HP, she actually has helped the company to save million of dollars, by simply indentifying the problem by seeing things in a simple manner....and I think she is only an "O" level certificate holder.(Note:One does make the difference.)<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>yes, one does makes a difference. Companies nowadays believe in developing the potential of ALL the workers, no matter what level they may be. It is part of the modern "behavourial control" kind of management (i can elaborate more on this if you are interested). They believe every individual has their own unique capabilities which we call "core competencies". And they think that the company will function at its "optimum" if every individual worker puts in their best.<br><br>May i know what "idea" had she came out with which saves the company millions of dollars ? Some problems can be better solved by the lower level workers. Why ? Because the problems are better understood by them. For example, an assembly line supervisor (O'Level) will be more familiar with the problems a worker will face in the factory than a researcher (PhD) who works in the lab.<br><br>So your example does not lead to :<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>So sometimes, education does not seems to play a part in how one perceive things.<br></strong></blockquote>because the problems may not be better understood by the so-called professionals since it is not within their working environment. Hence their incapability of solving the problem need not reflect on their abilities.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Since this is a sales engineer job ...<br></strong></blockquote>yes, to some jobs, the personality of the person is much more important than the grades. Sales job is one (which is wat you applied for) I myself had been doing sales in the past and I know very well that grades do not reflect a salesperson's performance.<br><br>I will like to remind you that the sales job market is an extremely heterogeneous one. You can see salesperson with qualifications ranging from N'Level to Master's Degree (or even PhD). It is a very <strong>unique</strong> job market because the job is more character-demanding. This is unlike many other jobs.<br><br>And due to its uniqueness, your example, though a nice read, fails to represent the general job market.<br><br>By the way, your acceptance is no surprise unless the company state in their ad saying that "only degree holders need to apply". If not, the company is already prepared to take in a diploma holder. It just happened that you have the personality that they are looking for, which is the most important criteria for a sales position. What if there is a degree holder who has the same personality as you ?<br><br>Well, i will not like to go on with this sales example cos like I say, it is a very unique job market which fails to represent the job market as a whole.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>It seems that the correlation of degree holders job-hopping is more than that of the diploma holders(correct me if I am wrong)<br></strong></blockquote>you are right.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But in the least, the company has not wasted their time training up the person, since he has also contributed to the company considered the amount of time the employees has put in<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>i dunno if you have been keeping in touch with what is happening in Singapore. But i can briefly touch on this "job-hopping" thingy.<br><br>In a knowledge-based economy like Singapore, talent is a liquid asset. Talents flow.<br><br>SM Lee and Dr Tony Tan had recently encouraged people to "job-hop" (they might have used some other words). The reason is simple. For a company and an employee to work well together, each has to satisfy the other's needs.<br><br>The company has its own corporate life cycle, especially if it is a young company. The employees will also have their own life cycle. And their needs change depending which part of the life cycle they are in. Once they (the company and the employee) do not meet each other's needs, they should stop working together. The employee should leave and look for another company which he can fit in.<br><br>This issue is briefly touched on in "Career Guide 2000".<br><br>As a result, by having an employee in the company for a long time does not mean that the company is benefitting. In fact, these "old" employees may become a barrier to the company's growth. Their abilities and ways of working may not already be what the company requires. Hence these "old" workers should leave the company if they cannot be "re-trained".<br><br>"Loyal" employees are only favoured by the old Chinese boss nowadays. They have already lost their value in the new economy.<br><br>Before I end off, i will like to give you an example of my auntie.<br><br>She is a diploma holder. She worked as an accountant in a Japanese firm for 27 years. It was her first job.<br><br>She was promoted a couple of times in these 27 years. However, the highest position she ever attained is senior accountant.<br><br>She was extremely upset about it cos she is very competent in her job (even her boss dotes on her) and she is so "loyal" to the company. One fine day, she finally stepped into the GM's office and asked why isn't she promoted to a managerial post.<br><br>The GM said this :<br><br>" XXX, I am very sorry, i understand that you are a very good employee and have contributed tremendously to the company's growth. However, you can never be promoted to a managerial post because nobody will like to be managed by just a diploma holder. We need someone with a degree to do the job. I can only increase your wages, in fact you are already drawing a large amount of money considering you are only a diploma holder. "<br><br>My auntie was heart broken. She resigned and found a new job. Her current pay is only about 70% of what she drew in that old company.<br><br>[This message has been edited by LittleMan (edited 24 April 2000).]</div>
