            <div class='col-md body'>wa lau, i really cannot tahan must say something. I am not as good tempered as LittleMan so don't pray with me.<br><br>IO --&gt; what history are you talking about ? LittleMan is refering to the "history" in Internet Explorer, you know what that is or not ? The records of what sites you have been surfing for the past few days lah ! Bodoh ! What March what April ? Not yet Christmas lah, don't count !<br><br>And the error is only 0.7 % you still want to fight until your nose bleed. What does the 0.7 % stands for ? And the error may not be there in the first place. And please go and check the calculation again, that number DOES NOT involve in the computation, so what even if there is a 100000000000000000 % error ? NO EFFECT ! What course you take in uni ah ?<br><br>And you say there are many assumptions in his calculation and i tell you. YES THERE ARE LARGE ASSUMPTIONS. And these assumptions are to YOUR FAVOUR you know ? Where got one JC only 20 students with 12 points and below one ? I am from one of the lousiest JC in singapore and even my JC has more than 40 of them ! Without all his assumptions, that percentage would even be smaller ! He trying to give you some face leh ! dude !<br><br>And you are soooooooooo petty, you should be the one being called LITTLEman. You are truly "little", the ngkaihoe thread so long ago liao and you still keep it in your heart, jia lard leh you, let go boy ! He may be out to irritate ngkaihoe but he did not call him names or resort to any form of direct personal attacks, not like you ! And he did not start the attack in the first place, it is ngkaihoe who started it. And LittleMan avoid you liaoz you still attack him at 4 am in the morning ! my goodness ! what kind of character do you have ? Education really fails on you leh. You not having exams now meh ? Wish you fail  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>and you ask littleman to be wiser, my goodness ! You know he top the uni in uk or not ? and the 2nd position is FAR FAR away from him you know ! You know he broke many records in NUS or not ? When did you see a NUS student fly from Shanghai to London to Chicago one ? and take up a final year project which is offered only to Masters and PhD students ? He was offered an overseas scholarship by the government but he rejected it because he want to pursue his own dreams. You should go study for your exams now and try to catch up with him lah though i doubt you will ever catch up !<br><br>changni --&gt; what single courses are you talking about ? the number is the enrolment of the WHOLE 4 polys lah ! Duh !<br><br>LittleMan had stated again and again and again that he is only presenting "the other side of the coin" and "what he states in this thread need not be his personal believes" but yet you people choose to ignore his clarification and take things at a personal level.<br><br>You people understand what "the race is long, in the end is only with yourself" means or not ? He means he still believes a person's own fighting-spirit is most important and all races/competition with other people are not important. That is his personal stand, but you people choose not to see it. Or you just don't understand that statement ? Oh yeah ! you guys never take GP ! sorry sorry, not your fault, it is the education's fault, the society's fault and the government's fault, or LittleMan's fault, never your fault, you always win, especially IO, you always champion, you Mr Super Kiasu King ! Want to fight until you win than happy one, like little kid you know !<br><br>It really vomit blood to discuss with the low intellects, i wonder how LittleMan can tahan all these !<br><br>------------------<br>Why is it so difficult to mend a broken heart ?<br>Cos it is broken and it is a <span style="font-style: italic;">heart</span> -- LittleMan</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh c'mon...let's all relax here.<br><br>I disappeared to concentrate on my last paper for just less than 36 hours and so many flaming posts have been made here.<br><br>Belittled, colette, LittleMan all started off nicely with intellectual posts. Let's not degrade ourselves by going into mudslinging here shall we?<br><br>Those interested in mudslinging shouldn't participate in intellectual discussions as u'll always be clouded by this desire to flame pple and win yr pt. If u're really so interested, take up politics and LKY will teach u a few things or 2 abt flaming pple.<br><br>If you want to look at it generally, U grads indeed have a better life (from the pay pt of view). Poly grads lose out simply because they're on a different pay scale.<br><br>If you have good grades, you can go ANYWHERE you like. If you choose poly, good for you. However, most top scorers will still choose JC. I refuse to join the argument on statistics as I commented on statisical arguments in my earlier post and I know that it's pointless to argue it with someone who refuses to see it.<br><br>Let me give you an example of my friend. Supposedly the first(dunno whether really the first or not, but still..) in my batch to be offered SAFOS. The SAF Overseas Scholarship. Second only to the President's Scholarship. What did he do? He dumped it. yah...some of us would probably scream on hearing that someone dumped SAFOS....i know tons of frens who would die (figuratively) for it.<br><br>Why? He wanted to do Medicine in NUS. So there he is now, doing Medicine in NUS.<br><br>What does this prove? If you have the grades to do something, JC or Poly, it's up to you to choose. Just because you choose Poly isn't a sin. Just live with your choice.<br><br>With regards to the good grades pple in Poly thingie, let me offer an analogy.<br><br>NUS and NTU. Both offer Engin. It's well known that NUS Engin has a higher entry requirement. So is NTU Engin the dumping ground for pple who can't make it to NUS Engin.<br><br>Crap. You can't prove it. From what I know, the NTU Engin degree is highly regarded in the industry too. Pple in the industry tend to complain that NUS Engin grads are too theoretical. No one can conclusively prove which is better. It's a matter of choice. Though from entry requirement, NUS Engin probably have pple with better grads.<br><br>This doesn't mean that NTU Engin pple don't have gd grades. I'll always be able to find u some 4 As student in there.<br><br>Like poly and JC, there has always been a debate on the 2 Engin schs in the Us. At the end of the day, you don't prove anything at all. So what's the point?<br><br>A few outstanding individuals don't make up the whole thing. It's called the fallacy of composition.<br><br>There's this prize for the best A Level English (Lit) script unless I'm wrong. A few years back (b4 95), it was won by a Yishun JC student. He was an ex RI GEP student who chose to go Yishun as he lived very near. So...does his win prove that Yishun is damn good?<br><br>In every establishment, there will ALWAYS be a few outstanding individuals. Why harp on them? There'll always be someone good out there.<br><br>The thing is : ARE YOU GOOD YOURSELF?</div>

Every individual has his/her rights to discuss the topic in their own way..presenting facts and figures. If you have to challenge the authencites of its..do it in a mature way.<br><br>In my opinion...Littleman was doing his explainations and rebuttals sensibly. In his efforts to reply to our posts..he present facts and figures to substantiate his rebuttals. We must not get too emotional into the discussion..or we will end up hurting one another. Jokes are most welcome. I for one can take jokes. You can even throws 'explicits' at me. It doesn't hurt me one bit. It is just word.

            <div class='col-md body'>A diploma can be said to be more superior to an "A" level cert. We can see that if employers are given a choice bet a diploma holder and an "A" level cert holder, most will choose the former and in fact the salary for the former being higher proves that diploma is better. However, A levels prepares one to go into U and U can say it is the easier route to get into U as 80-90% of those in U like me comes from JCs/CIs. And once U get into U, it will be a different thing. Thus, if U want to get into U, it will be better for U to go JC unless U are sure U can be the top 5 or 10% in the poly. If you intend to come out to work earlier, poly will be better than JC. Reason why ppl choose JC is coz it is easier to enter U and once U get the degree, ur pay and position will be higher. Like in the govt sector, diploma holder can only be junior officer while U grads are all senior officer.</div>

Have you ever watch or participate in a school debate before ? If a candidate is the proposition team, does it mean that he supports the debate motion at a personal level ? Please !

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, I am new here but I read littlemanÂ’s posts many times. he got 600+ posts I think I read all of them. My english is not good because I am not singaporean so I never post. I post now because I think it is very not fair to littleman. he think very well and his posts are very good and funny. his english very good too. his posts are also very in order, this shows that he is very responsible in talking. but you people want him to keep quiet. sometimes, I donÂ’t know why singaporeans always ask people who are good to keep quiet and let others not so good one talk so much. those who need to keep quiet one are the one who use personal attacks. if you have nothing to say, donÂ’t say, why insult people ? littleman is very patient with his posts, if you read you can tell, he write every word carefully and even use bold and italic to tell us what is important. singaporean only like to hear the things nice to their ears, littleman says things not nice to their ears and they got angry. I used to study in polytechnic in singapore, I agree totally with what littleman said. very true. those who are still in poly now will understand after they work. littleman, I support you, your argument is good and strong, I believe there are many out there like me who do not post but read a lot of your posts. I learned a lot from you, thatÂ’s why you make me like this forum. those who do not learn from you are losing out a lot. they are too proud, they will never learn and be better. there is nothing wrong with using the 12.5 points also, because the discussion is about Â“goodÂ” students going poly. when I first came to singapore, MOE told me the Â“goodÂ” students are 12 points and less. 13 to 19 are average students. so we are talking about good students why cannot use 12.5 ? Illegal Operation, you are proud. I do know have high education but I can tell you are very proud person. you do not talk like educated people, littleman leave the thread to avoid you and you continue to attack him. the ngkaihoe post so long ago and you still angry, you are very petty, you are not a man. you even stay up until 4.06 am to attack littleman. even you are in uni so what ? you have bad character. you always want to win. you say littleman is crap ? you are the crap. he is an educated man not you. he may be naughty in the ngkaihoe thread but he did not call names and personal attack people, not like you and other forumites like Adam&amp;Eve. you say he act nice guy and you is wrong. I read all his 600+ posts and I can say I know him well, his thinking always the same, not acting. last time a forumite insult him he also choose to leave, very gentleman. and some forumites here have very stupid argument, if I am littleman I will not even reply them. people like cyberahmad, adam&amp;eve and changni and illegal operation have very stupid argument, they talk about not important things and feel so proud about it. I donÂ’t understand the numbers but I can tell you the very few good students want to go poly, donÂ’t bluff yourself. when I came to singapore, even MOE ask me to go JC if i can, they encourage me to go JC and not poly. even when i search the MOE website, there is a site which encourage us to go jc, but no site to encourage us go poly. but my result no good so I cannot go jc. littleman, you have my support always because your thoughts are clear and strong and you always choose to see the real things in life like what you said in the Â“moral questioinÂ” thread. and even when many people are attacking you you still remain calm and cool. you have the brains and the character, and that is what makes a boss. Illegal Operation is lousy man, it will be great if you can leave this forum and I mean it. if all singaporeans are like you, singapore will have no future.</div>

I used to study in polytechnic in singapore, I agree totally with what littleman said. very true. those who are still in poly now will understand after they work. littleman, I support you, your argument is good and strong, I believe there are many out there like me who do not post but read a lot of your posts. I learned a lot from you, thatÂ’s why you make me like this forum. those who do not learn from you are losing out a lot. they are too proud, they will never learn and be better. there is nothing wrong with using the 12.5 points also, because the discussion is about Â“goodÂ” students going poly. when I first came to singapore, MOE told me the Â“goodÂ” students are 12 points and less. 13 to 19 are average students. so we are talking about good students why cannot use 12.5 ?

I read all his 600+ posts and I can say I know him well, his thinking always the same, not acting. last time a forumite insult him he also choose to leave, very gentleman. and some forumites here have very stupid argument, if I am littleman I will not even reply them. people like cyberahmad, adam&amp;eve and changni and illegal operation have very stupid argument, they talk about not important things and feel so proud about it. I donÂ’t understand the numbers but I can tell you the very few good students want to go poly, donÂ’t bluff yourself. when I came to singapore, even MOE ask me to go JC if i can, they encourage me to go JC and not poly. even when i search the MOE website, there is a site which encourage us to go jc, but no site to encourage us go poly. but my result no good so I cannot go jc. littleman, you have my support always because your thoughts are clear and strong and you always choose to see the real things in life like what you said in the Â“moral questioinÂ” thread. and even when many people are attacking you you still remain calm and cool. you have the brains and the character, and that is what makes a boss.

And most of all the ppl in this forum are very sensible.By the way I am a Uni-Grad too. I graduated in the year 1993. I am not proud of what I am. I still feel that i am nothing. What's the point of u ppl urgueing in here with what u have, If u find it u have a low level cert, go for a higher one.<br>Well let me remind this to everyone,<br>"Education can be attained at any age" There isn't any limitaions to the amount of knowledge we can attain even thru this forum.<br>There are some ppl in, who are just here to have fun.

For all those years of education you had....is this the kind of postings you churned out. Kinda of disgrace..isn't it? I don't think it is funny..but rather childish. On what basis do you ask someone to leave the room? Why don't you leave instead as requested by Jennie. Jennie had her point stated clearly..she is like me..not very good in our English..but we enjoy Littleman's postings. I learns a lot from him..and I do admired him..even if I have to repeat it again and again.<br><br>You? what can I say? I reserved my comments...but I rather see someone different from what I'm seeing now.<br><br>"Cluedo"?..are we playing a 'who dun it' game here? Who done what? I'm in a state of loss...maybe you can clarify..Mr. Illegal Operation. Now that Littleman is gone..do you think you can carry on what he left? Do you have his charismatic way of rebuttals.

I find it even more incredible to believe that on top of this, you took the effort to read 600 postings. Most of all, for somebody who claims to have a bad command of English, you sure can write long messages. I find it impossible to believe you are real.</div></blockquote>As i have told all of you,Everyone can make an account,sorry its accounts to support yourself.But not for me,an account is enough....am i right?Littleman...sorry it's Jennie<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bleue:</div><div class="quote_body">Belittled, was that a quote from LM?

Check some of the old threads on pre-marital sex. And his views on this topic and way of separating quotations point by point is very similar to LM's.
