            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it depends on what you want in life. Some people like the courses and the field of work that will be leading to offered in the poly, etc. But JC prepares the student foundation for U, whereas poly applies the know-how.<br><br>But this is not to say good students in poly do not go to the U. In fact, those who were hardworking and put in the effort made it. Some may say the percent is small, 5-10 or so but this percent out of the population in poly is about, say 70 or so percent of the JC population. Thus, chances are quite ok if one is willing to strive.<br><br>Those who do not make it at least have a diploma, which you all do agree will command a better salary than an A level. The decision to go JC or poly invloved some risk in a sense. Also, some A level students do go to the poly, to get a diploma and have another shot at U if that is their intention.<br><br>And thus, poly education is not inferior to JC, just that it depends on what do you want to achieve. Of course if one plays afool, whichever he goes to, he will screw up big time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do know that if you're very confident you can get to University after Poly it's better if you go to Poly first. Thru that route you will be exempted most of the essential basic modules, thus saving you one year. And even if you can't get into Uni, you can still do well since  you will be better paid than those who only have a A level cert(from JC) and can't get into Uni.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but long ago in my father's time,poly education was considered inferior to JC due to the fact that for poly,u need best 5 sujects while JC need best 6 and under 20 points right?People think that JC is harder to get in so it must be better,but it seems that time has shown that poly people are no way inferior to JC and command a higher pay as poly studies what is relevent to the industry,not generic subject like chinese,maths in JS  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am here to post a very controversial post. I find it boring if everybody has the same view hence i guess i should help you pple see the other side of the coin. But please remember not to flame me, cos i am just a Little Man with a Little Brain  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><strong><br>snow said :<br>i can find people that scores good o-level results entering polytechnic.<br></strong></blockquote>yes, i have a fren who is a 7-pointer going to poly too. Why ? Cos his family cannot support him all the way to Uni and needs him to work "as soon as possible".<br><br>Yes, you may say my friend's example is rare but students with good O'levels results going to poly is just as rare.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Adam&amp;Eve said :<br>"A"Level student doesn't earn much than Diploma holders.Unless they're in U.<br></strong></blockquote>Yes, if an A'Level student and a Diploma student apply for the same job, the latter will most probably get the job. But people dun just look at your current state. People look at your FUTURE.<br><br>A'Level students HAVE a better chance of going into Uni. The curriculum in A'Levels is planned in such a way as to prepare the student for University education. As for the curriculum of diploma courses, it is planned in such a way to prepare you to work. The aims of JCs and Poly are already different.<br><br>For JC student, as long as you satisfy the entry requirement of the Uni, you will be accepted if there are placements but for poly students, besides meeting the entry requirement of the Uni, you also need to be the top 5% student in your poly. Do you see a difference ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Shinya Nakano said:<br>And last thing I have a lot of friends who scored less than 15pts going to poly instead of JC.<br></strong></blockquote>some of my students choose to go poly instead of JC even though their aggregate is below 20 because they have no confidence of doing well during A'Levels. If you choose to go JC, you better work hard, otherwise, if you fail to enter Uni, your future is not too good ..... hence some people do not like to take the risk and not that they don't like JCs. If they make it to the Uni after their diploma, good, if not, you have a diploma to survive with. It is this "buffer" that attracts them, at least for my students.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>theychosenone said :<br>Thru that route you will be exempted most of the essential basic modules, thus saving you one year.<br></strong></blockquote>it is funny you know ! You say they will be <strong>exempted</strong> the <strong>essential</strong> basic modules. If they are <span style="font-style: italic;">essential</span>, the more we should not exempt them ! Otherwise you are "handicapped". And sometimes, it is this "essential modules" that makes a JC student different from a poly one.<br><br>Take General Paper for example. Poly students do not take GP but GP is a VERY IMPORTANT subject u know ? You can be a genius but if you have problem expressing yourself, delivery your commands etc, your knowledge will remain "lock up" in your head. Most companies are looking for people who not only can think and work well but also talk well, deliver well, explain things well and all these are communication skills which one learns from language courses which is compulsory in JCs !<br><br>People with better communication skills will take up management and leadership posts where people who do not possess those skills will remain as "workers" or "followers".<br><br>Btw, why do you want to save that one year ? You have to live with your cert for the REST OF YOUR LIFE you know ? Is that one year of short cut worth it ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Carrots said :<br>a lot of people fail jc then come poly one...<br></strong></blockquote>are u indirectly implying that poly is a dumping ground, accepting students who have been rejected from JC ? It contradicts your "poly education is superior to that of jc" opinion you know ?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Carrots said :<br>poly education is more practical and thinking. JC is just to understand and dead memorise only<br></strong></blockquote>Yes, poly students are well verse in technical work, real practical stuff and JC students are more of a thinker. We are trained to think more than to do work.<br><br>But brains are more important than workers you know ? Workers can be replaced by robots (industrial automation) but brains can NEVER be replaced. We always see many countries worrying about "brain drain", but have we ever heard of any country worrying about "worker drain" ?<br><br>Some questions to ponder :<br><br>What is the frequency of a poly student getting the President Scholarship ?<br><br>What is the frequency of a poly student getting the SAF Overseas Scholarship ?<br><br>What is the frequency of a poly student getting the PSC Overseas Scholarship ?<br><br>These 3 scholarships are the most prestigous and recognised scholarships in Singapore. Think about it.<br><br>One last thing, even if a poly student managed to enter Uni after his diploma, do you think he will be viewed as the same as other JC students ?<br><br>In our society, we do not only look at your last result slip. We look at all your result slips. CONSISTENCY is what companies are looking for.<br><br>I know there are a lot of poly students in this forum, sorry if i offend you, this is just a discussion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Remember, I am a LittleMan with a Little Brain, don't flame me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

One of them is even a President Scholar. My brother-in-law is also a PSC Overseas Scholar. From my interaction with them, I got to know that their job is not technical but involve more management and decision making. For instance, my brother-in-law is the Manager of a GRC even though he did electronic engineering overseas.<br><br>As a result, their work are never "routine" and "normal". It involves a lot of decision making. And they are definitely people who big corporates will like to grab after their bonds have matured. Some companies are even willing to pay the balance of their bonds for them (asking them to break bonds). So do you think they are just bunch of useless people who adopt the "if it ain't broken,don't fix it" attitude and are not willing to foster new and cutting edge ideas ? In the contrary, they are a bunch of self-motivated people who are initiative and proactive. How can managers motivate his workers when he is not self-motivated ? And how can they be "National Scholars" when they are not creme de la creme ?<br><br>By the way, our government are all civil servants, are you implying that they too have such attitudes ? Do you know how many members of parliament are directors of big corporates ?</div>

Yes, i agree that it is a very difficult paper. I am a polytechnic student. Prehaps my english language is not great, but in polytechnic we have core modules that teaches us how to communicate, presentation, etc. But these subjects are more related to our future work. We learn how to write proper reports to hand in to our supervisor in future. We do things that are RELATED to OUR WORK.<br>Core modules are subjects that you have to pass.

It is not only about communication it is about EFFECTIVE communication.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>We learn how to write proper reports to hand in to our supervisor in future.

How long can your fish last ? If everyone has the mentality of "what i learn in school will last me a life time", we'll be died. My point is, it is no big deal that what you learn is REALTED TO WORK, cos they become obselete very quickly, sometimes even before you graduate !<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Core modules are subjects that you have to pass.
