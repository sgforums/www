            <div class='col-md body'>c'mon, let's not just look at isolated examples. The problem with a lot of people out there is that they pick on one or two examples and go "ahh....see, someone did it"<br><br>full of crap. for every success story from not so highly educated side or rag to riches stories, there are probably 10 on the other scale.<br><br>so, does it prove anything in the end?<br><br>ok, so does it mean that a highly educated person will make it? if only it was so simple...<br><br>Times have changed as I keep telling everyone. Yes, once upon a time, anybody can make it, given the opportunities. Now, you NEED the education.<br><br>Granted, there will always be some outstanding individual from the not so highly educated side every now and then. It doesn't mean a thing as these rare people are grossly outnumbered by the "other" side.<br><br>Education is the key. Look at Japan. One of the key features of the Meiji Restoration was focusing on education. Without it, they would never have caught the West in a short 50 years. Now, they are potentially in trouble due to their education system (it's to do with English...read today's Straits Times for more details).<br><br>Where would all of you in this forum be without your varying degrees of education?<br><br>The most important thing is the willingness to learn. The will to upgrade yrself continually.<br><br>The fact in society now is that you NEED the paper. Full stop. I challenge anyone out there to debate me on this, looking at the general, average Singaporean and NOT isolated examples of success stories. Many of these stories can no longer take place today.<br><br>True, sales and entreprenuership doesn't need the paper. So, how is the AVERAGE young S'porean who can't even afford a house without working for a few years going to find the money to jump onto the entreprenuership wagon? In the past, it was possible. The latest of these stories are the dot.com stories, but the time has passed. The market is getting tighter. All the success stories had their origins in 98/99 or earlier. The really BIG ones are mostly gone. While there will still be success stories, there will be more failures than successes.<br><br>The average S'porean will HAVE to end up as an employee for their whole lives. Some will make it up the ladder, but most won't. That's a fact of life.<br><br>Sad...but true<br><br>However, material success is not all there is. I would trade EVERYTHING I have and will have in the future for inner peace and peaceful times with my potential wife.<br><br>anyway, we're straying from the topic. so there....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like I just said...Poly graduates are more courages to strikes out on their own from my observation..and Sim Mong Woo was just an example. There are many more like him..but less well known. Take a look at the brochures of IPOs of the Companies..which seek listing in the Singapore Stock Exchange and those that already been listed. Many of the company's directors are Poly graduates...but that doesn't mean that JC students are inferior. Most of them will go on to complete their Uni studies to become doctors, lawyers and other professions...and in time..they too will strikes out on their own and go into private practices.<br><br>A person self worth is not measured by his educational level alone. Whatever you are taught in school and the examinations you sat..are just the theory side. It takes more than those schoolbooks and examinations to be successful. This Fashion owner did not passed his PSLE...so did the sole proprietor of Johnson Lock's Chicken and Duck..but they are millionaires in their own rights.<br><br>Littleman was half right when he said that educational level play an important role in your ability to secure the job. In Shell..the management's assessment of the applicants is not through the educational level alone. Those applicants are divided into groups when they are call up for their 2nd interview inside a room. They are then given a project to work on. Through the glass panel..they observe each individual applicant on his/her merit in working as a group and those who are able to lead. Leaders are born....not nurtured. Not all 'A' level holder make good platoon commander.<br><br>Like they used to say..if you have it..you have it. What's there to compare? *wink*<br><br></div>

Yes, it can be increasing, probably due to the fact that some courses can only be found in poly (some forumites mentioned it before, go check it) and the students have no choice but to choose to go to the poly. And remember, "increasing" can still mean that it is rare (as the actual number is small).<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Please check out the facts before jumping into any groundless conclusion.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>show me the facts then.<br><br>The growth rate (how much it has increased) do not prove anything here.

            <div class='col-md body'>this is not part of the topic but i think that a basic degree is a must these days and they are common, just a pity i don't have one.<br><br>when i first started working, i was in the Customer Service Department at an Apple (computers) distributorship and manning the Customer Service Hotline is one of my duties. now you know what they say about Macs being idiot proof, but actually not so. i was good at my work but i was denied promotions twice because i only had  an "O" level certificate then. after working there for sometime, a 2nd appraisal [my request for being considered as a Trainer was noted at the 1st appraisal, but nothing came out of it] was up and i expressed an interest in becoming a Trainer as there was a post opened, i know i was good enough for it because manning the Hotline has taught me many things . however, my superior said no, that i need more training before i could be a Trainer. anyway, about 2 weeks or a month later, an overseas graduate was employed as a Trainer who had no idea how the Mac works. yours truly here was not good enough to teach customers but was good enough to train the graduate to train others. ???<br><br>i never despised any of my bosses more than then. needless to say, i quit after training the graduate, even though if i had delayed my resignation for about 3 weeks, i could have gotten the year end bonus. the best thing was that they had to employ two gals to handle my job after i left. hehe ...<br><br>years later, the same company employed me on a part time basis so that they can get SDF grants for the employees of other firms who want to get training, they tried a few of their in-house Trainers and part-time trainers, but their application was denied. when i taught there for a few months, their application was approved, it was sweet revenge. well, this was what the lady who contracted me told me.<br><br>i managed to get another Trainer job at another AppleCentre after quitting the Customer Service Co-ordinatorÂ’s post, i was pursuing my Diploma then, havenÂ’t got it yet. there were 2 trainers, the other held a Diploma, our pay was different by about $400, my workload was double of hers, which would mean, my classes make more money for the company, when i brought up the difference in pay to my bosses, again, they said that because the other party was a Diploma holder while i was only an Â“OÂ” level holder. when i obtained my Diploma in June that year, i showed it to them thinking, hey, itÂ’s about time you adjust my pay right? no, i still didnÂ’t get the pay rise, quit after 2 months.<br><br>i was given a chance to excel at what i used to do only because i was good, patient and my 3rd boss at another AppleCentre (a Hongkonger, not a stuck up local) believed in capabilities and not a piece of paper and she paid me accordingly. lucky breaks like these are not easy to come by and if i had a degree to start with, i wouldnÂ’t have to take so many hard knocks.<br><br>these days, a basic degree is the bare minimum requirement, just look at the classifieds and recruit pages. with only a diploma, many jobs are denied to me because i would not have satisfied their minimum requirements even though i may think i can handle it.<br><br>one can get by in sales and service jobs without a degree because it is how at ease you can make the customers feel and thereby close a sale, however, one must always be able to conduct oneself as if one has had tertiary education, sad fact but true nonetheless. and i do find my lack of a degree a hindrance.<br><br>Â“AÂ” level and Polytechnic education are catered to different aspects of the work market, an Â“AÂ” level holder if he/she doesnÂ’t pursue university education would lose out to the Polytechnic student as Poly education is geared towards the workplace , whereas if the "A" level holder continues his/her education and graduate with a degree, he/she will definitely have more opportunities for promotions than the Diploma holder, even if the Diploma holder is far superior to the graduate in job capabilities, it is a sad mindset employers have. and an Â“AÂ” level student would find it easier to gain entry into universities in any field of study than Poly students, i think thatÂ’s a fact, if i am not wrong.<br><br>er, i have no idea how both of these education system works because i pursued both as private candidates, taking part time classes at private institutions. flunked "A" levels due to personal problems (or maybe it is more difficult than a diploma?) and got the diploma with ease.<br></div>

He once said that each one of us possesses a "knowledge box" where we keep all the knowledge we learned. Whenever you need to think, you'll search through this knowlegde box for ideas.

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems that everyone is debating on the benefits on degree and poly,but there is also 1 factor that is important and not taken into heavy consideration,that is the person's own personal ability,some people may have a degree or masters,but fail horribly when comes to presentation whereas a poly student may not have the necessary qualifications,but excels in presentation,this is dependent on each individual's nature as no amount of study or academic books a person reads,he will be able to change his own nature,so therefore i think that whether it is a degree or a diploma,how good the paper is really worth depends on the nature of the person who holds it, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">))</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Littleman..Hi. Lucky... I'm still awake to see your rebuttal on my posting.<br><br>Sorry for my extreme example ...but it was a known fact that most listed companies and those yet to be..are founded by Poly graduates. It was through the reports in the BusinessTimes that I came to realised that Poly grads have that courage to venture out on their own...when the Paper stated their stories before their IPOs release. But, of course there are failures too. There are always two sides of a coin.<br><br>When I said more than schoolbooks and examinations..the ingredients have been added. But it take more than that to bake a delicious cake. To bake a cake from what you learn and to bake it from trials and errors are two different method. If you follows strictly to the books..you will most likely  get a 'stereotype' cake. The latter method will most probably be 'unique'. See the different?<br><br>I stand by my argument that a leader is born and not nurtured. When all things are peace and well...we don't see a true leader. It is during a crisis..or a major problem..can a true leader be found..who will lead the rest through it. All those training will come handy if he/she can conduct himeself/herself effectively. I'm going to give you an example..but please don't say it is extreme. Carozon Aquino was elected to became Philippines first lady President after the murdered of her husband. She was just a simple housewife before she became one..not by choice but cause. From then on..a leader was born. She did quite well during her job as a President. So did some others like..Indira Gandhi. Training courses are just..courses. How effectives they are.. will only be known when they are present with a real challenge.<br><br>Littleman..it feel so good to be able to hold a session with you on the topic..and it is an honour..thanks.</div>
