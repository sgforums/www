If the person is obviously with no intent of buying and only wish to waste time, then there's no point dallying with such a 'customer'.<br><br>Also, there are some customers (which tend to be from one particular country) who ask many pointless questions about the item they are buying, and sometimes even go to different sales person at the same booth/shop asking the same lame questions. And yet in the end, they buy only the cheapest item there.<br><br>Moreover, these particular people from a particular country expect Ferrari quality for Proton Saga price. And will demand you give them as such.<br><br>And no matter how good a recommendation you give them, they will always find faults with what you recommend. Even if the recommendations was based on things they asked for, they will still find fault and sometimes contradict the things they said earlier.<br><br>I'm not saying it's right that sales persons should discriminate against a particular type of '<span style="color: black;">customer</span>', but it's sometimes really just a waste of time and it'd be more worthwhile not to serve these '<strong>customers</strong>' from a particular country.<br><br>Occassionally, if the sales person happens to be free or they're new and less aware of what certain cutomers might be like, they may still try to serve these "<strong>customers</strong>".<br><br>Some types of people are just not worthy of the good service.</div>
