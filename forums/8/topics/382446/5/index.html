              <p><br>You're missing the point, when people say Singaporeans have no fashion sense, it means Singaporeans do not have self-awareness and isn't self-conscious enough to in effort to dress up nicely when they go out.</p>
              <p>You need pictures of fashionable people on the streets in Singapore, that's almost impossible when you take a second look at the topic and realise how silly your pictures request are.</p>
              <p>Do you bother to dress up nicely whenever you go out? If you don't, then you don't have any desire to look good when you're out and you may be missing something up there in your head.</p>
              <p>Dressing up nicely and displaying your best effort to improve your dressing is a form of courtesy and respect which you can give to the shops/places which you will be visiting and the people you will be meeting up with.  </p>
              <p>No pride or confidence in your own appearances? Then by all means please continue to dwell within your own backwards mentality cos you're right by choice.</p>
              <p>Even some animals will try to look good by cleaning themselves when they're dirty.</p>
              <p>But still, if you imagine yourself residing in a jungle with cavemen, I wouldn't be surprised if you decide it is the NORM for you to dress up like cavemen.</p>

              <p><br>Trendy doesn't mean that you have to layer yourself up...fashion could be also about  "individuality" "Swag" does not means that you have to wear branded stuff....</p>
              <p>Example:</p>
              <p>There are tank tops and there are singlets...There are colored tank tops with print and there are singlets.....There are tank tops with embrodiary and there are singlets....there are stone tank tops and there are singlets. There are tank tops with lace and there are singlets.....want somemore......</p>

              <p>Singapore is hot....</p>
              <p>Also.....</p>
              <p>Singapore is a relatively well-developped country...</p>
              <p>What does this mean...</p>
              <p>It means people cannot wear complicated stuff which makes them feel hot and sweaty....and......it also mean....people are less motivated to "show off" their status.......Thusly, the main fashion sense is one of *semi-casual*.....</p>

              <p>Funny thing is when westerners wear T-shirt and bermuda in Singapore, no one say anything but when Singaporeans wear the same outfit (exactly the same) people say Singaporeans no fashion sense. Have you ask yourself why if you're one who thinks this way?</p>
              <p>The weather affect the so called "fashion", I believe we all have been instilled with the idea that westerners are fashionable so what they wear is fashion...but the main factor that everyone ignore is that they have four seasons we have only one, HOT SUMMER.</p>
              <p>I feel that it's ok to wear bermuda to orchard road heck those westerners wear bermuda to orchard and people kept slient.</p>
              <p>So during summertime in New York, New Yorkers wouldn't wear bermudas or other loosely fit outfits out to the streets?</p>
              <p>And I don't think it's polite to attend a roadshow, meeting or any other gatherings sweating all over just because you want to look "fashionable".</p>
              <p>As long as you're not wearing something that is dirty or not apporiate (like singlet and shorts to Orchard Road) and look presentable, who cares?</p>
              <p>What can fashion sense get you in life? Unless you're a model.</p>

              <p>Here's one reason why singapore (for the most part) is such a fashion disaster of a country. One thing many singaporeans dont seem to understand is that 'the person comes before the clothes'. This means that you shouldn't wear clothes because they look nice, or are fashionable. Rather, you should wear clothes because they FIT you. </p>
              <p>It takes just one walk down orchard road to understand what i mean. You'll see hoards of clowns in their colorful skinny jeans, ridiculous gangsta wannabe t-shirts, fugly shoes and with caps 'floating' on top of their heads. Sure, those things may look good on some celebrity but thats because it FITS their image. On most people you see on the street, they're simply ridiculous.</p>

              <p>wear T-shirt is ok to place like orchard,wearing bermuda is ridiculous!!bermuda is create for leisure only but singaporean wearing in a<span style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;"> inappropriate way in a inappropriate place.wear jean is still ok.I hate those people wear bermuda walk on orchrad or city centre.</span></span></p>

              <p>I don't think bermuda short is created for leisure only.</p>
              <p>One interesting fact on bermuda shorts:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>In Bermuda, a <span class="mw-redirect">British Overseas Territory</span>, they are considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like material and worn with knee-length socks, a dress shirt, tie, and blazer.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Will you make noise if these people wear bermuda made of suit-like material and worn with knee length socks, a dress shirt, tie and blazer? Lol.</p>
              <p>And I don't believe westerners all wear jeans to their "Orchard", just like a few of them who I seen wearing bermuda at Orchard.</p>
              <p>You said bermuda is created for leisure only, but isn't it a leisure going for shopping or taking a walk at Orchard? I do not wear bermuda to Orchard but I don't see the reason why others can't if they want to. But is three quarters pants more accepted than bermuda?</p>
              <p>And those who pile branded clothes on themselves thinking that they will look "fashionable" are "disasters".</p>

              <p>you say singapore is hot so you cannot wear that kind of clothes,the people say that is obviously never watch before fashion show,fashion show got a lot of fall,such as winter fall,and spring/summer fall,so for singaporean you watch the spring/summer fall fashion show as we all long is summer,you see liao,they got wear bermuda meh?you tell me.</p>
