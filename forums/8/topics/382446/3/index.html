              <p> </p>

              <p>Weddings, Formal dinners, Funerals, Visiting Heads of State-</p>
              <p>Men always just wear some trousers and open collar shirt.</p>
              <p>Shoes- both men and women wear flip flops. Even more formal ladies shoes are preferably open at the toes. </p>

              <p>seriously i think it depends on the situation. Singapore has no seasons, throughout it is rain or flood or sunshine like hell. unless you go dating or got a job or at the frontline in customer service, sales or meeting people probably a little fashion sense or appropriate wear is highly recommended. otherwise if you cloth like a deer in the desert i say unless you are sick with an illness from the cold you are going to be branded like a weirdo. more so if it tags to what you are doing. a guy with 'good' fashion sense but looks like beng and sway ku is what? Nothing but shit to me. a professional wear like some good fashion sense but produces work like sht or is just a wannabe is what? like shit only to me so don't make em laff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so good in fashion sense but don't even have the means to pull through next month without a job is like what? shit to me. so good in fashion sense but no skill low educated in a society or country thriving but still more than 80 percent of the people are sway ku peasants and still need to go to another country to work is what? shit fashion sense to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fashion is a thing on its own. but using fashio to high the failure side of you is another very real thing. so stop using fashion sense to cover all the flaws one has as a person. there's a time for fashion and there's a time for the truth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so with no peektures of how good these people's fashion sense are who the mother fucker to say they have good fashion sense? post peekturres lah tud</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Different countries got different taste of fashion. Singapore is this kind of fashion &amp; to us it's our modern way of dressing. Other countries got their own taste of fashion, to them it's their modern way of dressing. You go everywhere around the world sure got people critisizing other countries fashion taste. You can't expect to wear T-shirts &amp; shorts to china during this time of winter right?? But yet, you can't expect to wear thick fashion clothing &amp; catwalk to orchard road to show off right?? People would say that you're siao. This is what I feel lah, other people might have a different point of view &amp; thinking. So in other words, fashion taste around the world is one interesting topic to discuss. There is neither no right or wrong answers. It's the culture of each individual countries I must say.</p></div>

              <p>I totally agree that Singaporean have absolutely no fashion sense at all, if they even knew or know anything about fashion sense in the first place.</p>
              <p>People with good or keen fashion sense will know how to dress themselves up to express themselves based on their moods and how they need to express their thoughts and emotions through their dressing.</p>
              <p>But Singaporeans ... sigh, they feel like it's perfectly normal for them to dress up the same every single time on a daily/weekly basis, just because everyone else around them is doing so. I believed it's probably because Singaporeans are used to wearing uniforms since they were young.</p>
              <p>I hated Singapore uniform but I got myself a set of Japanese uniform for fun and attending themed parties. It's so much more comfortable wearing Japanese uniform than Singapore uniform, but the price difference is also between Heaven and Hell (not Earth).</p>
              <p>Most Singaporeans who couldn't be bothered to dress up nicely are usually those who doesn't drive and takes public transport, but that's just an excuse for not desiring to look better.</p>
              <p>The real reason is that Singaporeans are uncomfortable and afraid to express themselves, either subtlety through their dress sense or among their own friends. They are too afraid of expressing themselves because they are unable to accept any form of criticism or whatsoever. They cared too much about what others may comment on them, so they ended up becoming individuals who aren't confident with themselves subconsciously, appears not to be particular concern with other people's opinions (actually they are afraid to deal with any form of questioning themselves because they aren't use to it).</p>
              <p>The only thing that Singaporeans aren't afraid is bragging. We are living in a society full of braggers. I can say Singaporeans brags too much among Asia countries and probably throughout the world. They bragged about their school results, careers, financial status, relationships, partners, ambitions and their past (especially their army life - pls pls pls stop bragging about it to us girls, we had enough already).</p>
              <p>If only Singaporeans knew how to channel their bragging powers to their dress/fashion sense, then I wouldn't mind telling people that Singaporeans are indeed one of the world's most well-dressed fashionable people.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't even dare to brag about this until it became a reality.</p>
