              <p>(1) Fees payable in full every month. However during February and December when Chinese New Year and Christmas/New Year's Day occur, there are only 3 lessons in those months as opposed to the usual 4. But you still pay the full fees for those 2 months.</p>

              <p>I know music isn't cheap. i've changed so many teachers/schools to know that already. The problem lies with the teacher is just an employee of the school, most of the time just there to earn a living without any care to see if you progress or not. I've more passion than the teacher sometimes. Why should I pay for the rubbish fee in that case? Why should I be at their mercy when I'm paying my hard earned money?</p>

              I've to agree with you that most of the teacher here are just teaching for the sake of teaching and not teaching with passion. But i feel that its because singapore doesn't have the market for grooming musical talents or maybe because people find music as an impractical solution as a future. Sure there are successful cases, but what are the odds and most of them went to abroad for training. I'm not saying that there are non of those passionate teacher in singapore, but chances are very slim. I'm sure you're more familiar with this situation then me since you've already been to so many musical school in Sg.

              <p>agree on the teacher front - the place I'm at (not sg so unless you're made of money not really helpful but www.acm.ac.uk) the regular teachers range from past students to the likes of Pete Friesen (The Almighty &amp; Alice Cooper) plus loads of people come in from time to time for masterclasses etc (eg, Mark Richardson - Feeder/Skunk Anansie, Chad Smith - RHCP, Jimmy Page, Dave Stewart) - experience counts for a lot.</p>
              <p>Really depends what kinda music you want to do, if you're into rock stuff it doesn't have to be expensive - the nets full of stuff to learn your trade on guitar/bass/drums - just get in a band with some mates, learn some songs, get some gigs... best education you could get in that kinda music.</p>

              <p>agree on the teacher front - the place I'm at (not sg so unless you're made of money not really helpful but www.acm.ac.uk) the regular teachers range from past students to the likes of Pete Friesen (The Almighty &amp; Alice Cooper) plus loads of people come in from time to time for masterclasses etc (eg, Mark Richardson - Feeder/Skunk Anansie, Chad Smith - RHCP, Jimmy Page, Dave Stewart) - experience counts for a lot.</p>
              <p>Really depends what kinda music you want to do, if you're into rock stuff it doesn't have to be expensive - the nets full of stuff to learn your trade on guitar/bass/drums - just get in a band with some mates, learn some songs, get some gigs... best education you could get in that kinda music.</p>

              <p>Well the problem is I'm not getting any younger. nearing my 30s already. I doubt any teacher who's like yours would pay any attention to me. I can ask shit loads of questions sometimes. That's why I'm also fussy about my teacher, whom, sometimes is even younger than me. But I know I'm not talented at all. I've tried all that net stuff, self help books etc. Theoratically I understand quite a bit of things but that's not how music works unfortunately. that's why I'm convinced I need guidance.</p>

              im a classical music teacher, and i teach both pte and in a music school. well, and since im on my way to clearing my grade 8 this year, im also a student. 
              
              i used to be under a music sch, and i hear my teacher complain about how in a music school, most of the time, they have no choice but to turn art into business, and soon, nuturing the next generation becomes a business.
              
              speaking for music teachers now, i guess i love this job because i love to work with kids (zero office politics), and its flexible. some of us have a full time job, while others may have a family to take care of, and we as teachers hate to cancel lessons unless nesscessary. 
              
              while in a music sch i guess its different. u know i get paid so on time in the music sch, because there is a system, and my pte students on the other hand, (their parents) will delay payment, and im the type who appreciates automatic-ness. 
              
              we have our difficulties as well.
