She wears a wig and smells like a skunk!!! ARGH!  When in her class, I would always chit chat here and there and when she gives us time to do our homework I will never do it and continue chatting.  She always calls me Miss Social Butterfly! ahahhahaa  But what irks her the most was that I get the highest mark on all my exams! HA! The hell with her! She always suspects that I cheat, so during one of the exam she assigned me to a seat right next to her.  It was just me and her...ahhhh...the b!tch! So, I was there taking the exam and my friend passed me her eraser for no reason.  AH-HA! There was a note in there and she asked for some answer.  So, I being such a good friend, gave her the answers to all the questions and told her to pass it arnd the whole class room.<br><br>HAHAHAHAHAAA!!! Won't you be surprise if you were the teacher and you are grading papers knowing that all the answers are the same and correct?!  hahahahhahaa<br><br>There....my little notti story... =P<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...</div>
