              5 Expat Blogs about Malaysia You Should Read06 June, 2013
              
              The authors of the following blogs have all cited a distinct lack of sufficient information about the expat lifestyle in Malaysia as a primary source of information. As such, readers from all backgrounds will be pleased to discover that the archives of these sites are veritable treasure troves of colloquial information that are sure to make the expat experience seem just that little bit more enjoyable.
              
              1: Retired in Malaysia: Steve Sovie
              
              Nationality: American
              Location: Penang
              
              http://www.ifoundmalaysia.com/
              
              In this informative, down to earth and easy to read blog, Steve Sovie provides the reader with a detailed account of his experiences living in Penang, as well as his thoughts regarding the expat experience. Having lived in Boston U.S.A before retiring and immigrating to Malaysia under the MM2H program, Steve believed that a great deal of cultural acclimatization would be needed in order to settle down. He was pleasantly surprised to find the locals extremely welcoming and the climate easy to adjust to.  
                 
              As the driving motivation behind Steveâ€™s blog is to give prospective expats first-hand information about day to day living in Malaysia, the reader will be happy to find numerous helpful hints including: what to expect during Chinese New Year (and why it is important to stock up during this period, especially in Penang), how to minimize your chances of falling afoul of crime, and the best places to nosh on fish-head curry! One article that Steve has penned that is sure to be appreciated by expats of any background is entitled â€œWhatâ€™s a typical day like for an Expat in Penangâ€� in which he neatly fuses his own encounters and daily activities with other options and suggestions that the reader may find equally appealing. 
                 
              One aspect of Steveâ€™s blog that is sure to be appreciated by American expats is the way his articles always draw comparisons with the customs of his home country in order to better contextualize the Malaysian subject matter. 
              
              2: UK Expat Living the Good Life in Johor Baru: John J Foster    
              
              Nationality: English    
              Location: Johor Bahru
              
              http://jbblog.fastlinxs.com/about-us/
              
              This extremely informative and well-presented blog gives handy advice to anyone considering leading the Expat lifestyle in Johor Baru (including where to find some excellent home furnishing bargains here. John J Foster, hailing from the UK, has made Johor Bahru (JB) his home for six years and, during this time, has garnered a considerable level of know-how when it comes to getting around the area, what events are on, what new expats can expect, etc. What makes the blog so appealing is the way in which the entries are neatly divided up into categories so the browser can locate the subject he/she is looking for (e.g Fitness in JB) with relative ease. There are also sections on what makes Johor Baru a golf heaven (including a link to course lists and golf events) and the picturesque Danga Bay Marina. Some specific articles of note entail the comparisons between condo and professional gyms, and one (which road trip enthusiasts are sure to appreciate) on tips for acquiring a B2 motorcycle license in Malaysia.

              Hi Demon Bane. You have been repeating that question over and over again most of the time. Have you work it out yet? Thought you said you are doing some research about retirement in JB...so what is your plan?

              Hello BukitIndah007. Wow! Your aunt is also following you. How about her husband and kids? Ok....roughly.....not exceeding RM1000 per month. My advise you should calculate dollar for dollar. See one ringgit as one dollar then you will not spend excessively.

              again most of the time. Have you work it out yet? Thought you said
              you are doing some research about retirement in JB...so what is
              your plan?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I make a list of what I needed to do with the exterior of the house. Draw a diagram of the exterior of the house and see what were needed to be repaired or mended. Cemented the those cracks in the drains in the front yard, the side of the house and the back yard area. Did some repairs on the fences. And replanted some plants in the garden and plant pots. Pulled out those grasses and weeds. Did all those tasks myself and it was a great way to past my time. I felt a sense of satisfaction and gave a good pat to myself for a job well done. Next...need to repaint the exterior walls of the house, the fence walls and some parts of the house roofs.</div>

              Thanks, I am. When you lived on a freehold landed property, when you are on full retirement there isn't any monthly maintenance fee unlike when you live in the condominium which will cost RM300 to maybe RM500 per month. However, you need to maintain the condition of the house...and for me I enjoy doing DIY handyman kind of things to past time but if I can't handle it then I will simply call the local handyman to do it for me.

              My second eldest sister was living in Arizona with her husband (a Singaporean) and daughter. Then they shifted to Texas because her husband was transferred to that state. Recently, my niece was married to an American from that state and they even came back to Singapore to celebrate their wedding with the family, relatives and friends. She is living with her husband in Texas. Don't know which states, Arizona or Texas, my sister and her husband will retire. They are happy there. She told me that in Arizona, there are many Singaporeans and Asians living there..so maybe Arizona.

            <div class='col-md body'>Just a suggestion and reminder for those who has landed property and living abroad in a landed property. Besides installing an alarm system or having a license to own firearm or kitchen knives in the kitchen or having your mobile phone next to you while you are sleeping...keep a handy weapon like a baseball bat close to you. I have a hockey stick in the living room downstairs and a golf club in the upstairs master bedroom just in case I hear someone trying to break into the house or within the house. Though you have called the police for help in the event this thing happen...while awaiting for the police to arrive...you need to protect yourself. Just a thought I think I should share with you.</div>
