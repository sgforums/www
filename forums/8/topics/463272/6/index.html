              By then the price will be higher and could be even more expensive. Singaporeans living in JB work in Singapore. We don't find work in JB. We follow the ways of the Malaysian workers working in Singapore but live in JB. Many Singaporean taxi drivers, bus drivers, hawkers, office workers, etcs are doing that now. Even the expatriates working in Singapore are doing that....you will be surprised. I know a foreign banker working in Singapore but live in JB. Its all about dollars and cents at the end of the day. You can actually start saving your retirement money from your income monthly.

              Yes, it is about choices here for Singaporeans. Most Europeans, Australians and Americans themselves do not actually want to retire in their own countries basically because they can't afford it or they want to stretch their retirement fund. Usually south east asian countries like Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia will be their choice of countries for them to retire. You see...none of them choose Singapore as their retirement country.

              Yes and I like to take a walk. Nearby my place there is a provision shop whereby if you don't have enough money to buy your groceries...they will have the 555 book for you...just like old kampong days in Singapore in the past...lols. My water bill is only RM5 the most is RM7. Electricity bill is RM30+ to RM40 if I don't use aircon so much. My monthly food groceries is around RM200+.

              Yes, its cheap...that is the reason I chose to live in JB and retire in JB. By the way, with aircon is only about RM70+ and besides that I can still watch Singapore TV channels and also listens to Singapore radio channel. Its still like living in Singapore and the different is we are much more happier and contented here. You will know what I mean when you stay here. Good luck to you and your research, Mr Bane.

              The Awakening
              
              A time comes in your life when you finally get it ... when, in the midst of all your fears and insanity, you stop dead in your tracks &amp; somewhere the voice inside your head cries out "ENOUGH!" Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on.
              
              And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears and begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening.
              
              You realize it's time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness, safety, and security to come galloping over the next horizon.
              
              You come to terms with the fact that you are neither Prince Charming nor Cinderella. And that, in the real world, there aren't always fairy-tale endings (or beginnings, for that matter).
              
              And that any guarantee of "happily ever after" must begin with you ... and in the process, a sense of serenity is born of acceptance.
              
              You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate, or approve of who or what you are ... and that's OK. They are entitled to their own views and opinions.
              
              And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself ... and in the process, a sense of new-found confidence is born of self-approval.
              
              You stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.
              
              You learn that people don't always say what they mean or mean what they say, and that not everyone will always be there for you, and that it's not always about you.
              
              So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself ... and in the process, a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance.
              
              You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and overlook their shortcomings and human frailties ... and in the process, a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness.
              
              You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is as a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche.
              
              And you begin to sift through all the junk you've been fed about how you should behave, how you should look, how much you should weigh, what you should wear, what you should do for a living, how much money you should make, what you should drive, how and where you should live, who you should marry, the importance of having and raising children, and what you owe your parents, family, and friends.
              
              You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.
              
              You learn the differences between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with ... and in the process, you learn to go with your instincts.
              
              You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive. And that there is
              power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a "consumer" looking for your next fix.
              
              You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life.
              
              You learn that you don't know everything, it's not your job to save the world and that you can't teach a pig to sing.
              
              You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO.
              
              You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake.
              
              Then you learn about love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving and when to walk away.
              
              You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You stop trying to control people, situation, and outcomes.
              
              And you learn that alone does not mean lonely.
              
              You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs.
              
              You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK, and that it is your right to want things and to ask for the things you want ... and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands.
              
              You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity, and respect ... and you won't settle for less.
              
              And you learn that your body really is your temple. And you begin to care for it and treat it with respect.
              
              You begin to eat a balanced diet, drink more water, and take more time to exercise.
              
              You learn that being tired fuels doubt, fear, and uncertainty and so you take more time to rest.
              
              And, just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play.
              
              You learn that, for the most part, you get in life what you believe you
              deserve ... and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
              
              You learn anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working towards making it happen.
              
              More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline, and perseverance.
              
              You also learn that no one can do it all alone ... and that it's OK to risk asking for help.
              
              You learn the only thing you must truly fear is the greatest robber baron of all: FEAR itself.
              
              You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your own terms.
              
              And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.
              
              You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't always get what you think you deserve, and that bad things sometimes happen to unsuspecting, good people.
              
              On these occasions you learn not to personalize things. You learn that God isn't punishing you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life happening.
              
              And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state ... the ego.
              
              You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy, and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you.
              
              You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls.
              
              You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about: a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower.
              
              Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never, ever settle for less than your heart's desire.
              
              Hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind.
              
              Keep smiling, keep trusting, and stay open to every wonderful possibility.
              
              Finally, with courage in your heart , take a stand, a deep breath, and begin to design as best you can the life you want to live.
              
              CHOICE BY CHOICE.

              Since in the 80s, many foreigners said that, "Singaporeans are always thinking about money, money. Why are Singaporeans always thinking about money from the moment they wakeup until the moment they are going to sleep." I realized the day I decided to shift totally to JB, my heart and mind said this to me, "You will never have peace and happiness if you always think about money until you see happiness in what you have and be contented with your life. I shifted for this reason...to seek my path of happiness and serenity. The house is already there in JB, I need to stay there and be contented. Find a new life there and slowly be happy there.

              I understand. But surprisingly, many Singaporeans are leaving Singapore and looking for a new life in a new country where there are violence etc.. U.S. , Australia etc. Don't you find it an irony. This is also an act of faith and they made it...without regret as time goes by.

              RETIRE IN NEPAL
              
              When most people think of retiring in Asia, they imagine the warm beaches of Thailand, the exotic super-cities of Japan and China, or the beautiful colonial buildings of Vietnam. Itâ€™s an image that is filled with clichÃ©s â€“ some of which are fairly true â€“ and fantasy. Itâ€™s also an image that rarely has a backdrop of snow-covered mountains or immense steppes as a part of it.
              
              But one small landlocked country in South Asia is beginning to change that perception. Once one of the worldâ€™s most impoverished nations known only for its incredible natural surroundings, Nepal is now one of Asiaâ€™s top spots for tourists, expatriates, and retirees seeking a significantly different life to that which can be found in East Asiaâ€™s gigantic cities and Southeast Asiaâ€™s scenic beaches.

              The city-state of Singapore, with just 4.6 million people, is the safest country in Southeast Asia. English is the official language. It is one of the cleanest and greenest city in the worldâ€”even chewing gum was banned for more than a decade. In 2010 it will boast two new world class casinos. Its airport is consistently ranked one of the best in the world.

              So You Want To Retire In Paradise
              Thoughts On Bali, Singapore And New Guinea
              By Bruce E. Pohlmann
              
              February 2005
              
              Once upon a time, there was a man with a band of children, a lovely wife and a house in Bali. Life was good, but this man thought that life could be better if only he didnâ€™t have to work. This is the story of that man and his dream.
              
              Bali. For some people the name says it all - warm seas, soft sands, cold beers, vibrant colors, exotic sounds, friendly people, large smiles, laughing children, a multitude of inexpensive small hotels and homestays. Bali. A land of wonder and magic set in the warm waters of the Bali Sea and the Indian Ocean. Hand planted rice, homemade religious offerings, vibrant cloths used in ceremonial clothes.
