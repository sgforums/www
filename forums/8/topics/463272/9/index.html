              <p>@summer hill....genie approves yer retirement plan :-)</p>
              <p>but...there is 1 flaw</p>
              <p>said condo is prob at least 700k. taking that as yer first property by the time u gain enuf equity to buy another its time to leave planet earth. yer only chance is via cap apprec which is time consuming and luck/skill based. there is a reason ppl say sg is a playground for the rich....the real estate in sg is for the wealthy to invest. the low tax makes it attractive.</p>
              <p>all is not lost however. get a 3-4 rm hdb flat then look at overseas mkt. </p>

              YACHT OWNERS
                  
              Johor Bahru is accessible for yachts whose height of mast is less than 25 meters from waterline. Sail 13 miles up the western arm of Jahor Straits, past Raffles Marina and under the centre span of the Tuas Bridge, (the "Second-Link" bridge), which has a minimum vertical clearance of 25 meters at HWS. Proceed upstream, staying away from the Singapore coast and keeping close to the Malaysian mainland all the way.
                  
              All yachts requiring clearance here must ensure they fly the Q flag, otherwise they may be fined.
                  
              Yachts coming from Sebana and other ports in Malaysia also have to do harbour clearance here.
                  
              Clearance can be completed at Puteri Harbour, but still not possible at Danga Bay marina itself, however, the marina will arrange for free transport to the apropriate offices and facilitate clearance.
                  
              Immigration is at the causeway and the Harbour Master (in Jabatan Laut), 1km along the waterfront from the anchorage, towards the causeway, as is the Customs office.
                  
              Customs is only required for outward clearance and issue of Port Clearance after clearing out with the Harbour Master.
                  
              Immigration outward clearance is not required if stopping at further Malaysian ports. Passports receive a new entry stamp, which is good for three months stay in Malaysia, each time you return across the causeway from Singapore.
                  
              Last checked February 2012.
                  
              ANCHORING 
                  
              Anchor close to the causeway but on the Malaysian side. There is plenty of room between the Customs wharf and the causeway and the holding is good.
                  
              There is no charge and the boats seem to be safe here with no thefts reported so far. The dinghy can be tied up at the Customs pontoon and left for days whilst you go into Singapore etc.
                  
              Visitors from yachts are advised to wear shirts when walking through the Customs base and to wait while the men are on morning parade and prayers - or at least walk discreetly at the rear of the parade. This is of concern to the Commandant at times. This is a free and secure mooring and it would be a shame if it were to be discontinued because of the annoyance caused by a few.
                  
              Yachts can also anchor in 4.0 to 7.0 meters with excellent holding in mud/clay at Lat 01.28.47N and Long.103.43.37E just off Danga Bay Marina for free. A member of the marine staff will come out in a dinghy to welcome you and give you a choice of the best places to anchor. A floating pontoon dinghy dock is directly in front of the anchorage and has 24/7 security. Free water is also available at the dinghy dock for either jerry cans, or yachts can come alongside for water by prior arrangement.
                  
              In addition there are three yellow buoys for mooring by yachts. Although is is not clear how much has changed since the marina has been built here. Close by are shops, restaurant, a reasonable supermarket, internet access and a laundry.
                  
              MARINAS
                  
              Danga Bay Marina, previously an entertainment centre, is now under new management and much improved. It is situated 5km by road from the centre of Johor Bahru and the causeway to Singapore. Buses to and from Johor Bahru stop right outside the complex every few minutes. You need to have the exact bus fare of RM1.10. Taxis also pass by regularly (marina information updated September 2013).
                  
              A new marina, Puteri Harbour, opened on 15th January 2009, and is situated 30 minutes away from Johor Bahru. Clearance formalities can all be completed at Puteri Harbour.
                  
              CRIME
                  
              Penang and JB are reported to be the worst areas for crime in Malaysia. Take necessary precautions when going ashore and if cycling, be sure to cover baskets/crates to avoid bags being snatched.

              Danga Bay Marina is located just after a floating fish farm on your left, with several large fisherman houses on stilts on the right. From the entrance you can also see the distinctive roof line of the complex and four 14 storey apartment blocks which are part of the Danga Bay development. The marina entrance has now changed significantly as the entrance channel is being dredged. 
                  
              Probably the best approach is to the west of the dredgers. DON'T go between them and the reclaimed land as before, as they are tied to steel drums attached to the shore. Keep 100 metres to the west in 2 metres of water. Because of dredging operations it may be necessary for your boat to be moved. Call on 74 on approach for advice on where to berth. If no answer, anchor off and dinghy in.
                  
              There is usually plenty of empty berths. Toilets above the office with 1 shower in the ladies toilet. Berthing is 100Rm a week plus power. 50Rm a week extra if you leave the vessel unoccupied. Water is currently free (requires filtering and/or treatment to be potable) as is Wi-Fi.
                  
              Staff very helpful but VHF not always monitored, so best contacted by phone. Very handy for supplies.
                  
              Marina will arrange free transport to facilitate clearance. They also arrange fuel &amp; gas runs twice a week. Laundry drop off close by. Currenly (Feb 2013) there is a daily shuttle bus sevice to to Danga City Mall at 10am.
