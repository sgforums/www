              Paradise on a pension 
              
              by: Deborah Cassrels  From:The Australian  October 01, 201112:00AM
              
              That's Paula Gillham, a 64-year-old Sydney pensioner and mother of two who came to Bali three years ago with just one acquaintance living on the island. Gillham smiles often, is dressed youthfully in a short dress and seems perfectly content in her adopted home, where she now has an established social network. On a part age pension, she rents a $10,000-a-year, two-storey home at Kerobokan with a swimming pool facing emerald rice paddies, and has a daily home help (pembantu).
              
              At $100 a month, the pembantu makes Bali life seductive. "She cleans, cooks, washes, irons, runs messages, pays the billsâ€¦ she found me this house," enthuses Gillham, a three-time divorcee and retired shop manager. Then there's the gardener and pool man, the $6 massages, the constant dining out.

              I lived in Bali before for three and the half years. Its an international community with foreign residents from all over the world. You can have cheaper yearly leasing homes depending where you want to stay. One residential area which is consider an elite housing estate which I can recommend is at Perumahan Taman Griya Nusa Dua and the home yearly leasing is much cheaper. The residential area is in between Kuta and Nusa Dua, very near to Jimbaran area well known for its Bali Cliff and Fisherman Village. The other housing estate that I can recommend is at Perumahan Taman Kuta Permai. Its very near to the famous tourist's district of Kuta and its a walking distant about 15 minutes walk. The yearly home leasing is even cheaper. 
              
              English language in Bali is not a problem because most of the locals can speak English. Singaporeans can adapt very well in Bali too its not a problem.

              RETIRING ABROAD: ONE EX-SINGAPOREAN EXPERIENCE
              
              I HAVE read many negative comments on the plight of Singaporeans retiring abroad and I would like to share my personal experience. 
              
              I have been retired for more than 10 years and have and spend my time between Guangzhou in China and Vancouver in Canada. Both these cities are inviting, fun and less expensive than Singapore. 
              
              In Guangzhou, I live in a penthouse apartment I bought for $150,000 five years ago. It is situated in Tian He district (similar to District 10 in Singapore) and next to the beautiful 400ha botanic garden condo residents can access for free through a side gate. It is a gated community with a clubhouse and first-class facilities, an Olympic-size swimming pool and modern security services. A similar apartment in Singapore would have cost at least $900,000 or more. For about 5,000 yuan or about S$1,000 a month, I live extremely well. A similar lifestyle in Singapore would cost me at least $5,000 a month. One can easily survive in Guangzhou on 2,000 yuan. It is cheaper if one decides to live in smaller cities like Fushan or Chungshan. A Singaporean who speaks proficient English can easily get a part-time job teaching English and earn 3,000 to 5,000 yuan a month. 
              
              A retired professor from Nanyang Technological University in Singapore lives in the same estate as me in Guangzhou for the past few years. He teaches science at a local university and earns about 10,000 yuan a month. He too can testify to the cost of living in Guangzhou. He is unlikely to return to Singapore as he has liquidated all his assets there. 
              
              In Vancouver, I live in a 5,000 sq ft waterfront property that costs me less than $1 million. A similar piece of waterfront property in Singapore would cost $3 million or perhaps more. I drive a Honda Civic Hybrid I bought brand new five years ago for $25,000. A similar new Honda Hybrid in Singapore would have cost close to $100,000 if you include COE. If one prefers a more prestigious cars like a new Mercedes 250 or a BMW 325, these cars cost less than C$50,000 (S$67,000). The cost of living for my wife and me, not including housing as it is relative, is less than $2,000 a month. The cost of living for me in Vancouver will drop significantly when I reach the age of 65 when I am entitled to old-age pension from the Canadian government. My wife and I will then receive more than $2,000 a month from the government. This pension is given whether one is rich or poor. 
              
              If you factor in savings in the cost of buying a house and a car in Vancouver and in Singapore, the difference is more than enough to pay for a happy and comfortable retirement for the rest of one's life. 
              
              If one is more adventurous and hands-on, the cost of living in Vancouver can be only a few hundred dollars a month. This can be achieved when you fish, catch crabs and prawns, grow your own vegetables, hunt and so on. There are lots of places to fish and hunt. All you need then is to buy rice, sauces, spices and pay for essentials like gas and electricity at home, telephone bills and transport. These items amount to no more than $500 a month. I have tried it and it is fun. 
              
              It is impossible to find similar possibilities in Singapore where one can survive solely on Mother Nature. 
              
              Some readers have complained with depressing tales about lack of friends for retired Singaporeans living overseas. To these people, I suggest we shed our introvert and 'kiasu' mentality. If one is an extrovert and willing to engage in and be proactive, one will have lots of friends. I have lots of friends of all races in both Guangzhou and Vancouver. I participate in dragon-boat races in Vancouver, San Francisco, Guangzhou and Hawaii. I am the only Singaporean with the rowing team and the oldest. The rest of the team are from Hong Kong, Taiwan, China, Thailand and some European countries. I play golf with friends of all races. I give free English lessons to Guangzhou university students, as well as local businessmen. I am a member of both the Guangzhou and Vancouver Toastmasters clubs, Guangzhou Canadian Friendship club and Friends of Taiwan club. I am always welcome by friends in Guangzhou and Vancouver. We have activities all year round, such as snow hiking and skiing in winter, fishing, gardening, cruises to Alaska, and barbecues during summer, pot-luck, mahjong and hunting the rest of the year. There is hardly a dull moment. 
              
              My wife, who is a retired teacher from Singapore, gives free English lessons to doctors and nurses at Chungshan Hospital in Guangzhou. She does volunteer work in Vancouver. Life is so rewarding and there is no time to be depressed. 
              
              There have been a number of comments that we are treated as second-class citizens in our adopted countries. It is inevitable there will be a small minority of people who are racists and bigots. These people even hate their own kind. It is not the norm and it happens in any country, including Singapore. 
              
              I have kidney failure and it costs the Canadian government $8,000 a month to treat me at no cost to me. There are nine friends willing to donate a kidney to me. They include a Caucasian, a Taiwanese, a Malaysian, a Korean, a mainland Chinese (a doctor herself) and four members of my family. It not true to say we are second-class citizens when people like Dr Ron Werb, head of department at St Paul's Hospital, accompanies us in dragon-boat rowing practices twice a week, together with other doctors. As immigrants, we have the same opportunities and rights as other citizens, regardless of race. 
              
              I remember when I first emigrated to Canada more than 20 years ago, my three children were given C$250 each as 'milk money' until they reached high school. This policy is still on going. There are a lot of support and help organisations for new immigrants of different cultures and race to help them assimilate into Canadian society. 
              
              I was born without a father, expelled from Outram Secondary School in Secondary 2 and worked for less than $100 a month at the age of 15 years in Keppel Shipyard as an apprentice. With that kind of credentials, I doubt I could achieve much in Singapore. But in Canada, we have a level playing field where we are rewarded by what we can do and not strictly by academic qualifications. Please don't tell me we are treated as second class citizens. 
              
              The Canadian government pays for my medical treatment when I travel overseas. Health care is very costly and an important factor for retirees. To have access to good free medical treatment during retirement is like striking a million-dollar lottery . 
              
              The benefits of free health care offered in Canada make Singapore's claim of a lower cost of living meaningless. 
              
              I welcome any member of the press to visit Guangzhou or Vancouver and stay with me for a month and experience the truth. However, there is one condition. Don't send an introvert or eternal pessimist who engages in self-pity and complains. 
              
              Retiring overseas is not a bed of roses, but only if one is not prepared to make the necessary adjustments and sacrifices to suit the environment. If one is prepared to work hard, stay positive and stop complaining, it is hard to fail. For me and many others, we are happy immigrants. Life could not be better. There is no shame and we certainly have a clear conscience when immigrating from Singapore.

              Retirement: how much is enough?  
               
              AT A FAMILY function, my 60-year-old cousin Peter asked me for my views on retirement planning. He said that over the last 35 years he has worked hard, consistently saved and prudently invested his money. When he retires in two years' time, this should provide him with a nest egg of about $500,000. As I listened to him, it seemed that he had secured his financial future. But he kept asking: 'Is it really enough?'
              
              At this age, many would expect to have a significant retirement nest egg. If they don't, they had better do something about it now.
              
              In Singapore, our official statistics show that there are more than 300,000 individuals aged between 50 and 54 who are due to retire in 10 to 15 years' time. As a financial adviser, I often discuss this subject with my clients but often this issue is not treated as a top priority. Understandably, there are other priorities, such as children's education and mortgage repayments or other immediate needs, that take precedence over retirement planning.
              
              Given the current economic volatility, the outlook for those planning their retirement is very cloudy. Over the last two years, we have seen the cost of living here increasing yearly, making retirement more expensive and resulting in many more Singaporeans having to put off retirement for a few more years. With higher longevity and people not saving enough, the working population of those aged 60 and over will inevitably continue to rise.
              
              In Peter's case, he and his wife are healthy and they are likely to have a long life ahead of them. So it would be a mistake to concentrate solely on what's happening now or even on what might happen months from now. Rather, they should focus on coming up with a spending and preservation plan that can assure them of enough money to live comfortably for the next 25-30 years, if not longer.
              
              Hence, funding your retirement years is a trade-off between playing it safe, taking risks and spending prudently.
              
              With the nest egg that Peter has accumulated, he can create a cash flow, and that is the most important consideration during his retirement. At this point, he has to set a reasonable withdrawal rate that will give him the spending cash he needs but won't deplete his nest egg too soon. Peter asked: 'How much can I safely withdraw from my retirement fund every year?' It is obvious that a miscalculation could result in an involuntary return to the workforce or having insufficient funds for retirement.
              
              To help Peter understand how much he can withdraw, I produced a table to show the number of years his money will last.

              4 in 10 Singaporeans not saving for retirement, blames high cost of living
              
              Many put the blame on high cost of living, according to survey
              
              By Magdalen Ng
              
              MORE than four in 10 Singaporeans say they have not set aside a single dollar for retirement - that was a startling finding from a new survey.
              
              The HSBC survey also learnt that people were not saving mainly because of the high cost of living.
              
              Retirement planning has been a major headache for many Singaporeans, who continue to rely on their Central Provident Fund savings as their basic nest egg, a reliance many financial advisers say is outdated.
              
              Still, 41 per cent of about 1,000 Singaporeans polled in the survey said they have never saved for retirement.

              A Wealthy Nation That Can't Afford to Retire
              
              Published: Wednesday, 20 Feb 2013 | 3:42 AM ET
               
              By: Rajeshni Naidu-Ghelani 
              Assistant Producer, CNBC
              
              The Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore may boast of the highest percentage of millionaires in the world, but retiring in this wealthy financial hub is becoming even more difficult for the common man.
               
              According to a latest study by HSBC, the citizens of this country, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, face the grim prospect of running out of their savings almost halfway through retirement as the high cost of living and increased life expectancy eats into their nest egg.
               
              Singapore has gradually moved up human resources firm Mercer's global rankings of the world's most expensive cities, moving to sixth place in 2012 from eighth in 2011 and eleventh in 2010.
              
              "There is cause for concern from the finding that the retirement savings of people in Singapore will run out after nine years, which is about the time they are entering into frail retirement and a stage of their lives when medical costs and other elderly care expenses are expected to rise," Paul Arrowsmith, head of retail banking and wealth management, HSBC Singapore, said in the report released on Wednesday.
               
              "People are living longer, through tougher economic times, and expectations about their standard of living in retirement have risen," Arrowsmith added.
               
              More than half of the 1,000 Singaporeans interviewed for the survey said that either they were not adequately prepared or not prepared at all for retirement as they expected to continue working beyond the age of 65 to be able to afford their desired lifestyle.
               
              One also needs more money to fund one's retirement in Singapore. According to the study, the annual household income required to lead a "comfortable" retired life in Singapore is the third highest among Asia's major economies, behind Australia and Hong Kong, at $48,773. This figure is 68 percent higher than what was needed in 2011, the survey, which has been running for eight years, found.
               
              The rising cost of living in Singapore has 58-year-old Singaporean Janice Tan worried about her retirement.
               
              "I think the cost of living is really escalating a lot," Tan told CNBC. "During the Chinese New Year season, when I went to buy the goodies, it really shocked me, because the cost is really going up too fast."
              
              Tan and her husband are currently paying for the education of their two children, including a 21-year-old daughter studying in Perth, Australia. While Tan, an administration professional, hopes to retire soon, she says she knows it might be another 10 years before that happens.
              
              "As human beings we want more - a more comfortable life. That's where the worries come in on whether you will able to survive," Tan said.
               
              According to the study, of those not saving for retirement, nearly half said they were being held back by the cost of day-to-day living.
              
              High costs have become a major cause of discontent among Singapore's residents. This prompted a rare protest over the weekend in which about 3,000 people participated. They were voicing concerns over swelling costs driven by an influx of foreigners.
               
              Foreigners, who account for almost 40 percent of Singapore's 5.3 million people, have been blamed for pushing up housing prices and taking up jobs in one of Asia's major business centers.
              
              Retirement Fears
               
              The top three fears about retirement cited by Singaporeans were poor health, financial hardship and not having enough money to provide for good healthcare, according to the study.
               
              With retirement savings drying up at a time when Singaporeans are most vulnerable to health problems, funding medical bills could become a big burden, HSBC said. 
              
              Tan backed that sentiment, saying that medical bills from a motorcycle accident that her husband was involved in last year have been a drain on their finances.
               
              "As we get older, I realize it [funding health costs] is a more important thing to sort out," said Tan. But the high cost of living is coming in the way. "I can't imagine how much more the cost of living is going to go up to," she added.

              The Best 5 Countries to Retire in Outside of the United States
              
              Many Retirees Want to Know Where to Go If Staying Within the United States is Not the Best Option
              
              With healthcare and cost of living, being a huge issue for many American who may be looking at retirement, some could consider a unconventional answer, leaving the US. Each year, American retirees leave the United States for various reasons. Here are the top 5 countries to consider.
              Panama: Van Halen knew what they were talking about. This place is all about affordable living and the enjoyment of amazing beaches. One of the easier places to retire to, they welcome you and your money. You only have to prove income of $500 a month or $600 for a couple. That includes social security benefits. You are also exempt for import duty charges on a new car every two years. Retirees also qualify for discounts on attractions by as much as 50%. It offer a great healthcare system, and is within reasonable travel expense to come back to the US. Most people in the city speak English but learning some Spanish would be helpful. Also, the summers can be brutal if you are not use to the weather.
              
              New Zealand: This countries beauty will blow you away. It doesn't have a capital gains tax, and the seasons are reverse of the United States. The main drawback is that this country caters to young working immigrants rather than retirees. So you may have to maintain the "snowbird" mentality of living there part time. However, the cost of living is worth it.
              
              Eucador: The cost of living is so low that a couple can live comfortably for under $2,000 a month. In the city of Cuenca you can rent a apartment or $300 or buy a condo for under $50,000. If healthcare costs are a concern, don't worry for the cost of a co-pay you can see a doctor and get first class service.
              
              Italy: Americans are in love with Italy. This country combines charm, history, friendly people and most of all a low affordable cost of living. For under $75,000 you can buy a beautiful home in many of the cities. If healthcare is your concern, this is the country to look at. It ranks high on affordability. Travel back to the US can be expensive, so you may have to plan ahead to find the bargains.
              
              Dominican Republic: With family retired here, I can say, the experience they have had has been amazing. Finding Americans and Europeans on this island is usually only a house or condo away. Affordable living, a beautiful country, amazing food, friendly people and good healthcare have made this island a huge attraction to retirees. Your American dollars go very far here and travel back to the US is reasonable. The weather is also very attractive.
              
              Years ago most Americans would be adverse to leaving their country behind. But, as the cost of maintaining a lifestyle, investment values being down and cost of healthcare continuing to skyrocket, many are looking at better options. If you are looking to relocated, spend several months in the country you are considering to make sure you can handle the changes that will occur such as culture and convenience.
