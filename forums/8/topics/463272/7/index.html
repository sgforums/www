              Retirement in Spore- An inconvenient truth
              
              Retirement is often pictured as golden period where one enjoy the fruits of decades of hard work.  To some, it could be having a stress free life and doing the things we enjoy. For others it might be enjoying the company of family and friends or engaging in a religious or social cause.
              
              However, due to the pragmatic nature among Singaporeans, not having to worry about money is often ranked as the most important aspect of a happy retirement. Many "planners" among us understand that having sufficient funds is a pre-requisite for retirement and this financial security also helps in creating peace of mind.

              Why Singapore Is (Nearly) A Perfect Retirement Choice
              
              Nov. 21, 2011, Singapore: In many ways, Singapore is the most appealing retirement haven in Southeast Asia. The only downside to retiring to Singapore is the cost of living in Singapore. Singapore is the most developed destination in Southeast Asia, but Singapore is also the most expensive place to live in Southeast Asia.
              
              Dear Live and Invest Overseas Reader,
              
              "Singapore is the most developed country in Southeast Asia," writes Asia Correspondent Wendy Justice, "and, in many ways, it is the nicest.
              
              "Singapore is super-modern and squeaky clean, with parks dotting the entire country, amazing shopping, pretty beaches, and enough activities to keep you busy for a lifetime. Health care here is as advanced as you'll find anywhere in the world and very affordable. The government is stable, and the economy is growing. Crime is practically non-existent.
              
              "Sounds nearly perfect, doesn't it?
              
              "Located at the southern tip of Southeast Asia, the city-state of Singapore is less than 100 miles north of the Equator. As a result, the weather is consistently warm, humidity is high, and precipitation is frequent throughout the year. Temperatures are in the high 80s to low 90s during the day, cooling down to the low to mid-70s at night. The winter months see a little more rain than the summer, but even this is a relatively minor variation. There are no distinct wet and dry seasons.
              
              "Mandarin and English are both official languages in Singapore, and all school children are expected to become proficient in these two languages in addition to any other language they may speak at home. As a result, practically everybody speaks and understands English. In public, though, you'll hear a wide assortment of languages spoken, including, most commonly, Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, Tamil, and Malay. Because so many foreigners live in Singapore, most employed by multinational corporations, you'll also hear a range of European and Middle Eastern languages.
              
              "Here's the downside: Singapore is definitely not a budget destination. With a cost of living slightly higher than that of New York City, Singapore is, unfortunately, not a realistic option for many. If, though, you can meet the income requirements and are prepared to purchase real estate in the country, you'll qualify for a five-year renewable social visit pass. In other words, full-time residency is an option if you've got the means.

              Though I have chosen to go into semi-retirement in Malaysia, JB now because it is very close to Singapore. I can still work part-time in Singapore to earn Singapore currency. Should I have not chosen JB as my retirement place, I would have chosen other countries as an alternative for my retirement. 
                          
              1. BALI - Why Bali? Because I had lived there for 3.5 years and Bali was like my country too. I know the paradize island very well, its people, the customs and traditions there very well too. I know how to survive there too. And the cost of living there is still cheap.
                          
              2. THAILAND - PHUKET - Its almost like Bali. However, I need to know the people, the customs and traditions there. 
                          
              3. PHILIPPINES - This country will be my last option because the cost of living there is still much higher than in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. The prices of their food and groceries are almost the same price like in Singapore.

              ARE SINGAPOREANS SUPPOSED TO RETIRE ABROAD
              
              I donâ€™t think we should begrudged people their good fortune. And it is indeed their good fortune to work in Singapore and live in Malaysia or Philippines etc.
              
              What is not acceptable, is that our own Ministers, when they talk about us competing fairly, that spurs be stuck into our asses coz we are not competitive, have never considered the long term imbalance of a system that they have advocated and promoted. The system keeps cost low for employers but lowered the standard of living for most Singaporeans.
              
              And this will overtime, means that our retirees will start to move overseas to boost their standard of living or at least lower their cost of living; this inadvertently means that Singaporeans will lose their sense of nationality. Who wants to serve a country that sucks up our youth and displace us when we are old?
              
              Yes, foreigners do have a place in our society, some more, some less, but there is no serious discussions to have a strategic plan to see how a Singaporean remains to live viably in Singapore. We already know that retirement savings will not be enough for most.
              
              We cannot ask for all the luck in the world. But we have all the right to ask what is our Governmentâ€™s plans for Singaporeansâ€™ retirement? In other words, how is our ability to make a living commensurate with retiring in an increasingly expensive Singapore?
              
              We have talked about the same starting point for our children through education. But what is the use of that, when they go into the working world, they find that they are already 3 steps behind other foreign workers?
              
              In fact, if you take globlisation through its conclusion, we will definitely be retiring abroad. If that is the case, please prepare the plans and the groundwork. And how is the concept of being a Singaporean mean in this scenario? What is our game plan?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello PlushHome, interesting suggestion. Thanks. I think those who have lived outside Singapore before for a couple of years, they will know whether they want to retire in Singapore or outside Singapore. As for my case, I prefer to retire outside Singapore especially in a country where the cost of living is cheaper so I can stretch my own retirement saving and fund. Most of the people from the first world country like the Americans, Japanese, Koreans, Europeans, Australians etc are retiring outside their own country mainly because its cheaper and they can afford it. Singapore now is a first world country and its going in that direction whereby many Singaporeans will need to see whether they can afford to retire within their own country. Its not a surprise this happens because its about the question of affordability and survival.</div>

              <p>It is quite hard to even consider retiring at the age of 65 in Singapore now. With the uncertain inflations and external factors, coupled with the high standard of living in Singapore, our income is actually the money we're earning back from our expenditures from month to month. </p>
              <p>It's a crazy rat race here. People are working non-stop just to earn back what they spent. Also, there's no guarantee that your savings can even last you a month after your retirement, especially if you have old age illnesses.</p>
              <p>Recently there was an article that showed the statistics comparing the working hours and productivity level among countries. And guess what, Singapore topped the working hours chart, and the lowest in productivity. </p>
              <p>Instead of slogging our guts out for money, why not let money work for us? Passive income, that's what most people are looking for but not everyone would dare to take the risk. </p>
              <p>For the sake of a better retirement, why not work hard now in stabilising a business that will earn you passive income till retirement age, instead of slogging your guts out earning what you're spending month to month?</p>

              Hmm...the way you say about earning back our money is a very interesting point of view. Usually, we see like this that whatever we have earn from our daily hard work are taken back by the government like increase of transportation fares, water and electricity tariffs, taxes etc. Well, they say money makes the world go round.
