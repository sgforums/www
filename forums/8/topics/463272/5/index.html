              Maybe we can meet up and discuss? I am trying to form a early

              Hi Atake, sorry for the late reply. Not for leisure but to go to work, walk from Woodlands checkpoint to Marsiling mrt station or from Marsiling mrt station to Woodlands checkpoint if Kranji mrt station is crowded or when there is a road jam from Kranji mrt station to Woodlands checkpoint lols. Ok.

              I understand what you mean there. If by the age of 40 if you see yourself that you cannot afford to retire at the age of 50, 55, 60 or 65, then you better hope you strike a big prize lottery lols...just joking. I have a friend who had told that his father spoke to him like this, "I can't afford to support your University fees. You must find a way to support your own University fees."And so he did by working part-time and study very hard. At the end, he got a scholarship and was sent to Australia. My own niece had to work part-time and look for corporate sponsorships to continue her studies in the University. I guess this generation of young SIngaporeans are different from the past generation of Singaporeans. After secondary or college education, if our family cannot afford it, we had to work, support family and our own education. I think to own a car in Singapore is not the priority now. Teach your children to be financially independent by the age of 18 or 20 would help the parents to have a better future and their own future. Paper chasers could end up nothing for most young Singaporeans.

              I guess for most Singaporeans they have to weigh the pros and cons of retiring in Singapore and then decide what is best for themselves. Do not depend too much help from the Singapore government because you will only get disappointed and unhappy when you have not enough money to retire later.

              Downgrade to small unit flat and pay the full amount. No more loans and then start saving and buildup your CPF again. Through my own observation, people living in 2 or 3 rooms HDB flat are much better off that those staying in bigger units. Its like this, you see those hawkers selling food, you think they have no money but they are driving mercedez bens. In other words, living in the small unit the chances are you have more money in the bank than those living in the bigger unit.

              Insurance is a long term planning and off course it would help you some financial support in your retirement later. But you must get it done when you start working but you can never know what is going to happen future along the way. What happens if you can't afford to pay the premium and lapse your insurance policy after you got married and supporting your family? Other alternative is to look overseas for opportunities in properties or business.

              <p><br> Downgrade to small unit flat and pay the full amount. No more loans

              observation, people living in 2 or 3 rooms HDB flat are much better
              off that those staying in bigger units. Its like this, you see
              those hawkers selling food, you think they have no money but they
              are driving mercedez bens. In other words, living in the small unit
              the chances are you have more money in the bank than those living
              in the bigger unit.</p>

              <p>I'll try to adopt this strategy...I think its feasible. Yeap you may be right, but the bigger unit can lease out rooms and make some money, then sell away at very good price! In the  end, if they are willing to downgrade, of coz will be rich! But if they choose to buy condo, then will not have cash anymore...</p>

              Think like this Mr Bane, whatever wealth we have accumulated in our life, you will not bring it with you in the grave. Live a simple life and be contented with what you have. To live a life with no more loans to pay is better than living in the life of a millionaires with many loans to pay until you cannot sleep well at night and have a peaceful life.

              I think you know where I live now....hope you have read my past postings within this topic or in other topics. To migrate to other countries for better future or retirement when your age reach 50 and above is already too late. It takes time for you to adjust to the country you have migrated to even if it is in JB. You should do this early around the age of 40 or early 40, the younger you are will be better. I know because I have shifted to JB fully at the age of 41 to adjust my new life there.

              I'm happy and contented. My wife is still working. I'm into semi-retirement now and working part time in Singapore. The house in JB, was purchased in 1992 during PM Mahadir reign. It is an international lot for foreigners to purchase under their own name. To invest in oversea property you must not wait because you can never know that one day you will ended up living and retiring outside Singapore.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have met and seen many Singaporean families shifted to JB and live there. Though they have children still studying, I have seen many of them sending their children to schools in SIngapore and some of the young children go to their schools in Singapore by themselves or their parents have chartered the school bus from JB to Singapore. The immigration at Woodlands or Tuas give special priorities for these students studying in Singapore and school buses are given the priority to pass the immigration too. Not only SIngaporean students but also Malaysian students from JB wake up early in morning to go to their schools in SIngapore, regardless whether they are in Primary, Secondary, College, Poltechnic or University in Singapore. They wakeup early and go to their schools early like past generation of Singaporeans going their schools, we either walked or took buses.
