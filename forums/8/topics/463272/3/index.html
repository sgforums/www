              Retiring Overseas on an Australian Age Pension
                  
              We very much support the idea of Australians spending all or part of their retirement offshore - cost of living differences mean that they can potentially have a much more relaxed and enjoyable lifestyle. It's not for everyone - you need to factor in the impact of prolonged absences from family and lifelong friends - but it is certainly an option that is worthwhile considering. One significant factor for many people considering the possibility however is whether the Australian Age pension would be payable to them offshore.
                  
              The Australian Age Pension can be paid overseas permanently, with some estimates suggesting that more than 60,000 Australians are currently receiving their Age pension overseas. However, the rules in this area are both complicated and unclear in certain areas - particularly for current expatriates - and it is suggested you seek advice from both Centrelink and financial advisors regarding your entitlements. Much depends upon the detail of your situation, and we have just tried to present a short summary below:
                  
              1. Entitlement to an Australian age pension is dependent upon applicants meeting both income and asset tests - with pension entitlements progressively reducing if an applicant's assets or income exceed specific levels. Obviously, there are no issues about self-funded individuals or couples retiring overseas - just make sure to check out how your income is assessed in your new home. Happily, most Asian countries do not (yet) tax income generated outside the country.
                   
              2. To qualify for an Age pension you must also have been an Australian resident for a total of 10 years, at least five of these in one continuous period. You must also be an Australian resident and in Australia on the day your claim is lodged, unless you are claiming under an International Social Security Agreement (see below).
                   
              3. As mentioned, you need to be a resident of Australia at the time the first claim for the age pension. Note that if you have been an expatriate (former resident) and have been living overseas, the restriction for former residents means that you need to remain in Australia for two years before you can leave and be paid overseas. In practice, many Australian expatriates return home two years prior to becoming eligible for an age pension - this ensures eligibility from a residency point of view and "should" mean the two-year restriction does not apply - although this needs to be confirmed.
                   
              4. When a person goes overseas their rate of Age Pension is paid according to their Australian Working Life Residence (AWLR) or years in Australia between the ages of 16 and Age Pension age. A person who has resided in Australia for 25 years between the ages of 16 and Age Pension will get the full means tested rate, less any add-ons; while a person with less than 25 years will get a proportionate rate. For example, if you have lived in Australia for 10 years between the ages of 16 and age pension age, your proportion would be 10/25 multiplied by the normal income and asset tested rate of Age Pension. This rate change, however, does not occur until a person has been outside Australia for 26 weeks.  This is because all Age pensioners can go overseas temporarily for 26 weeks regardless of their AWLR.
                   
              Alternatively, you can make a claim for a pension without returning to Australia, if you are living in a country with which Australia has an International Social Security Agreement.
                   
              Finally, one issue that many people overlook when considering retiring overseas is access to health care - international health insurance, particularly in retiree age groups, can be very expensive. And you cannot just rely upon going home to Australia when the need arises - if an emergency develops and you need to be evacuated to Australia at short notice it may cost $100,000 from some destinations.

              Six out of 10 Britons would like to retire overseas
              
              Nearly six out of 10 Britons would prefer to retire overseas, making us the most unhappy Europeans about the quality of life in our home country, new research suggests.
              
              Fewer than half said Britain was their preferred retirement location, with many instead planning to pack their bags and retire to sunnier climes. 
              
              Only the Germans and the Irish among other Europeans voiced nearly as low levels of satisfaction with their home countries, according to the survey by benefits consultants Aon. 
              
              It suggested 46 per cent of Germans and 49 per cent of the Irish plan to retire in their home country. It is in contrast to 87 per cent of Spaniards who wish to stay put to enjoy their golden years. 
              
              Oliver Rowlands, head of retirement at Aon Consulting, said: â€œCheap air travel and the communication tools available over the internet means that retiring overseas doesnâ€™t necessarily mean being completely absent from your familyâ€™s life, making the prospect of emigration to other countries on an previously unseen scale a real possibility. 
              
              â€œNot surprisingly, most people want to spend their retirement predominantly in countries with good weather and good social and government benefits, and ideally close enough so that they can get home quickly if they need to.â€�

              A Wealthy Nation That Can't Afford to Retire
              
              The Southeast Asian city-state of Singapore may boast of the highest percentage of millionaires in the world, but retiring in this wealthy financial hub is becoming even more difficult for the common man.
               
              According to a latest study by HSBC, the citizens of this country, which has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world, face the grim prospect of running out of their savings almost halfway through retirement as the high cost of living and increased life expectancy eats into their nest egg.
               
              Singapore has gradually moved up human resources firm Mercer's global rankings of the world's most expensive cities, moving to sixth place in 2012 from eighth in 2011 and eleventh in 2010.

              Retiring abroad
              
              It is moderately common for people to retire in countries other than their home. There are two main reasons. One is climate; people from colder places flock to the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia and the South Seas, while others choose a dry desert climate because that is easier on asthmatic lungs or arthritic joints. The other major reason is saving money; a pension that is just a pittance in a relatively wealthy country may be enough to live well in a lower-income country, and a substantial pension or a few good investments might let you live in luxury. In particular, lower health care costs may be an issue; see medical tourism.
               
              There are various other reasons as well. Some might retire abroad out of an urge to see the world, perhaps using Bariloche as a base for roaming around South America, Penang for Asia, or Barcelona for Europe. Others might choose a retirement spot to suit their interests â€” perhaps Queensland for the diving, Austria for the skiing, or Peru for the Inca archaeology. Still others might choose to retire abroad as a way of keeping active in their later years, perhaps learning a new language, exploring a region, or taking up a new hobby.

              Malaysian living in Singapore: Why I will never want to retire here
              
              Iâ€™m a Malaysian who has been living in Singapore for the past 13 years and I have to say that Alvin is right. I miss the laid-back easy life back home. But I chose to focus on my career and Singapore is the place to do it. If I want a lil Livinâ€™ and some soulful action i just hop across the border. In SG i switch off. In Malaysia i switch on. It has worked well for me and i simply learn to enjoy the best of both worlds.
               
              The thing I love about Singapore is the Safety factor. The thing I hate about Singapore is how they tend to blow things out of proportion esp about the crime rate. The crime rate in malaysia is the same as what you get in Sydney, New York and London. Singaporeans will pay thousands to fly there for holiday but squeal at the thought of driving across to JB. Seriously, if you keep reading Straits Times, then you will have been thoroughly brainswashed by the bullshit newspaper that scares the crap out of you about driving into Malaysia so that you will spend your money in SG and not in MY.
               
              Both countries have their good and bad. However, I will NEVER want to retire in Singapore simply because I wont be able to afford it and I donâ€™t think i want to be surrounded by concrete jungle when Iâ€™m in my 60â€²s and 70â€²s.

              A frugal route for US retirees 
              
              BEIJING - Most Americans dream of retiring on the Florida coast or in the quiet countryside, but a growing number are looking East to spend their golden years of retirement in China where their nest eggs will last a little longer. 
              
              For 56-year-old American Jim Bryant, who's lived in Beijing for almost three decades, sandy shores and leisurely strolls on a golf course are far from desirable. 
              
              "I've been here 30 years, I don't have anywhere else to call home," the former New Hampshire resident said. 
              
              China's draw for Bryant and others looking East for their golden years is the opportunity to live an adventurous and laidback lifestyle while making retirement savings last longer. Though the number of foreigners looking to retire in China is not currently being tracked, anecdotally speaking, foreigners already in China say the count is rising. 
              
              "There's everything here in Beijing that you want and usually it's more affordable," Bryant said. "Housing is a hell of a lot cheaper." 
              
              Bryant's long-term residency, Chinese spouse and home ownership in Beijing makes it relatively easy for him to get a visa. But for many Americans looking to retire in China, the challenges of overcoming visa restrictions bar them from enjoying an unhurried retirement. Often this results in would-be retirees having to pick up low-paying teaching jobs that support visas or finding ways around the system. 
              
              "They want to fly below the radar," Bryant said. "There would be a lot more people retiring here if they could get visas to live here without working." 
              
              Bryant, who brought the Subway sandwich franchise to China in the late 1990s, retired from his business in 2005. 
              
              He now lives in a quiet suburban home with his wife and child in the Shunyi district on the outskirts of Beijing where he operates Jimbo's Classic Sidecars, a customization shop, as a hobby. 
              
              But while some like Bryant look to retirement as a time to relax without working, Doc McCoy, a 59-year-old American living in Nantong, Jiangsu province, said working through retirement is one of the main reasons he started his retirement career in China nine years ago. 
              
              "I am not your typical retiree - I cannot just sit around and be a perpetual tourist or sit at home and do little of nothing," he said. 
              
              McCoy stays active in his "semi-retired" lifestyle as the lead foreign teacher at Nantong University School of Business. He also posts to his tongue-in-cheek blog, oldcodger.org. 
              
              Living in the second-tier coastal city on a monthly wage of 4,450 yuan ($700), McCoy works 10 hours a week, seven months a year. He has basic medical insurance and his yearly payments are equal to the monthly amount he'd pay in the United States. 
              
              For him, returning to the US would be almost impossible, he said. 
              
              "It would be impossible for me to live on the equivalent of $700 per month in the States despite owning a mortgage-free home there," he said. "It would also be impossible to find a job that allows me to work only 10 hours a week, seven months a year that would allow me to live a 'middle-class' lifestyle. Going back to working a 40-hour week with one or two weeks a vacation a year is not an appealing thought." 
              
              But should McCoy ever stop his employment at the university, maintaining his residency in China may become problematic. 
              
              Without work sponsorship, the only obtainable visa is an L tourist visa, meaning that retirees would have to leave the country every two months to renew their visas, said Wendy Wang, visa immigration specialist at American-based Allied Pickfords relocation services. 
              
              But for those over 60 years old, even teaching jobs are unobtainable due to China's current visa structure, she said. 
              
              "If people are more than 60 years old, it's very, very hard to find a job. There are almost no employers that will offer a sponsorship," she said. "Even if they have an employer's sponsorship it's hard for them to apply for a work permit." 
              
              While retiring foreigners currently face many challenges obtaining long-term visas in China, those who have worked in the country for more than 15 years will soon be able to start collecting a pension, according to a policy introduced earlier this month by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security. 
              
              "They will be able to collect money they have put in over the years after they retire," said Tang Jun, a social policy researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. 
              
              But even as policy begins shifting in favor of aging foreign residents, retirement homes geared toward Western retirees have yet to be established in China. 
              
              "As of yet, there are no foreign senior housing players in the Chinese market," said Tuscon Dunn, CEO of Hanovera Healthcare Management, which provides hospital and senior care management and consulting services in China and Asia. 
              
              Dunn tried launching a foreign retirement service, American-based Silver Age International, in Beijing in 2005. He said shortly before construction was planned, land developers who carried clout in the local community bought the land and investors pulled out. 
              
              He said there has been a massive rise in interest in retirement homes for both foreigners looking to retire in China and Chinese nationals. 
              
              "Many seniors dream of having their own apartments in a senior living village," he said. "This is now a financial goal of many families." 
              
              Though there are no official retirement facilities for Westerners in China, online communities and travel forums are awash with foreign retirees offering advice to those looking to come East. 
              
              One website, Retire-in-Xiamen.com, launched by Singaporean Ken Zhong, caters to foreigners from abroad looking to retire in China's coastal provinces. Zhong, who said he is more than a decade away from retiring, launched the community after he began searching for his own ideal retirement location. 
              
              For Zhong, the small city of Changtai, just outside Xiamen in Fujian province, was the perfect spot. 
              
              "It had what I wanted. A modern apartment out in the countryside. But modern amenities within the development," he wrote in a blog on the website. "I bought an apartment immediately." 
              
              Zhong wasn't the only one interested in capitalizing on Xiamen's easy, countryside lifestyle. After creating a website showcasing the location, he was overwhelmed from people overseas asking questions about the area. 
              
              "It attracted membership from all over the world, including many Westerners, many of whom may have a Chinese spouse, worked in China previously or are very interested in Chinese culture," he said. 
              
              The site now has more than 150 members, a majority of which come from the US, Canada and Singapore. 
              
              "Frankly, I am a little surprised that Caucasian and USA/Canadian Chinese formed the largest interest group," he said. 
              
              But for McCoy in Nantong, the blooming overseas interest is alarming. 
              
              "My sincere hope is that people will overlook retiring in China," McCoy said. 
              
              "Westerners seem to be prone to bringing their attitudes and lifestyles with them as opposed to making a sincere effort to assimilate into the culture of their host country." 
              
              It's the difficulty to adapt to the new culture and language that McCoy said provides the biggest hurdle for aged-Americans looking to retire in a different country. 
              
              "Chinese culture can be extremely complicated and at times is a direct and complete opposite to Western culture," he said. 
              
              But for him, it's the culture he's grown to love. 
              
              "I have a very good life here in China and truly want for nothing. Life is not perfect anyplace, but it can seem like it is if you are able to adapt," he said.

              I'll retire in China with pension
              
              Who: Chen Ping, 50 
              
              Job: Chief physician at Bao Zhong Tang TCM Centre 
              
              From: China 
              
              Came to S'pore: In 2008, after the hospital he worked at posted him here.
              
              Do I belong? 
              
              For now, but Singapore is not home.
              
              On the surface, Singaporeans seem to be welcoming of foreigners, but there is more than meets the eye.
              
              When the accident happened between the Ferrari (driven by a Chinese national) and a taxi (driven by a Chinese Singaporean), the comments about mainland Chinese circulating on forums and websites were discouraging.
              
              When I speak the Shanghainese dialect with friends or my son on the MRT, sometimes I receive stares which look less than friendly.
              
              Still, I believe Singaporeans are a kind lot.
              
              This country is a good place for mainland Chinese who are young and willing to work hard for potentially-bright futures.
              
              But to me, home is still China.
              
              My wife and elderly parents are there.
              
              I hope to retire in China because the government provides a generous monthly pension, which is not what I have here.

              Retire in Xiamen China
              
              In 2007, I traveled to Xiamen, China for the first time. Although I had traveled to China for a number of times, this was my first trip to Xiamen.
              
              I liked Xiamen immediately.
              
              I had also been thinking of retiring to somewhere out in the country-side but still near to modern amenities for quite some time. I wasnâ€™t sure where. Maybe Malaysia. Maybe Thailand. But I found what I wanted in Xiamen instead.
              
              By coincidence, I visited a housing development out in Changtai, Xiamen. It had what I wanted. A modern apartment out in the countryside. But modern amenities within the development. And a short 40 minutes drive to Xiamen city.
              
              I bought an apartment immediately. Photos that I showed friends gained a lot of interest. I decided to post that information out in the internet. Within a couple of years, we had over 150 people from all over the world on our mailing list. A number of readers even traveled to Xiamen to check out the development for themselves.

              How to Retire Richâ€“Even if Youâ€™re Not â€“ Indonesia
              
              Thereâ€™s a world out there where people like you and me (middle class earners) are living the life of Riley without millions of dollars. 
              
              Many of them are reluctant to talk about itâ€“preferring to keep their little Edens to themselves and a tight group of friends.  But when I find someone living like a Rajah on a paltry retirement income, I listen.  And then I dig to find more.  Iâ€™ll share my findings here in a fascinating three part series.
                
              Indonesian Paradise
              
              Fraser Rea likes getting value for his money, but he isnâ€™t the kind of guy whoâ€™s going to scrimp on luxuries.
              
              He and his wife Shary, both in their mid 60s, created an idyllic retirement solution allowing for a winter get-a-way in tropical luxury, without breaking their pocketbook.   With many peopleâ€™s retirement portfolios still reeling from the stock marketâ€™s battering, and with layoffs sending many North Americans into an economic sand trap, Fraser and Sharyâ€™s retirement paradigm is one that a growing number of people are warming up to.
              
              The Reas own a small villa in the quiet seaside town of Sanur, where they spend six months a year on the idyllic island of Bali, Indonesia.  A 20 minute drive to an international airport, Sanurâ€™s shoreline boasts an endless sandy beach and year-round 30 degree (87F) water.  Honeymooners frequent the romantic evening stroll along the tastefully lit, brick, beachside path, while the six kilometre route attracts morning walkers and joggers as they pass lushly surrounded restaurants, quaint seaside chalets and luxurious resorts.  Bali might be one of the few places on earth where you can stand 10 meters from the border of a 5 star hotel and not even know itâ€™s there; the Balinese built many of their resorts into the dense tropical vegetation.
              
              Fraser, who worked in the marketing and sales department of a British Columbia based electronics firm, first came to SE Asia on a business trip in 1988.  Frequent, progressively lengthier holiday visits convinced him and Shary to buy a Balinese villa near the beach last year for a fraction of what a comparable place in North America would cost.  Foreigners canâ€™t own land in Bali, but they can buy a home and lease the property. 
              
              Fraser has a 17 year renewable lease on the property which was included with his purchase price.  He and Shary enjoy escaping the cold, wet winters of Sidney, British Columbia. â€œOur Villa complex is managed by a Balinese based company, owned by a professional Indonesian and her European husband who live, work and are raising a family in the local community. This combination of East &amp; West brings a lot of value and expertise to the Management of our complex,â€� explains Fraser.   And while theyâ€™re back in Canada for the summer months, their management company rents out their villa for them.
              
              Fraser admits that you can find accommodation for a lot less than he paid (such as cheap, long term rentals) but he likes dealing with an efficient management company, suggesting that it makes the lease, purchase, maintenance and rentals a lot easier to deal with.  And itâ€™s the affordable, luxurious living that really attracts the couple.
              
              Retirees on a tighter budget can enjoy the neighbouring island of Lombok for more of an undiscovered feel.  Getting there from a major North American city, youâ€™d fly to either Jakarta, Indonesia or to Singapore, before transferring to a Lombok-bound flight. 
              
              A man weâ€™ll call Denis Leroux, a doctor and former resident of Quebec, Canada, has lived on the lush, volcanic island for seven years.   An enthusiastic bike racer in his 50s, he joins a pack of local racing cyclists for regular 140 km cycling rides around the beautiful island and enthusiastically supports Lombok as a retirement destination.  â€œThe lifestyleâ€™s fabulous,â€� he says, â€œAnd you can rent a house in Lombok for just $250 a year.â€�  He just laughed and gave me a funny look when I asked if that price included a hot shower and flush toilets.  Of course, it does.
              
              Despite the cheaper prices in Lombok, Fraser Rea prefers Baliâ€™s added conveniences, where he lives luxuriously on less than $2000 a monthâ€”including massages twice a week, eating out at least once a day, having a maid service six days a week, and enjoying evening wine by their private plunge pool at night. 
              
              Other Bali bargains include prescription eye glasses.  Fraser found that they cost a third of what they cost in Canada.  And thereâ€™s a top quality dentist they see who charges between $25 and $30 to check and clean their teeth. 
                 
              Despite the benefits of living luxuriously on a small retirement portfolio in SE Asia, thereâ€™s something besides friends and family that many Canadians and Europeans are reluctant to leave behind.  Popularly demonized as a socialized symbol of inefficiency by our American Republican friends, many of us recognize that Canadian, European, Australian and Kiwi medical plans arenâ€™t always easy to pull ourselves away from.
              
              That said, Fraser insists that the sun also shines beyond the socialized medical nets.   â€œThere are reasonably priced, international medical clinics servicing tourists and expatriates in Bali,â€� he says, â€œAnd they can adequately stabilize serious injuries.â€�  Insurance policies are also available to cover medical evacuation to Singapore or Thailand if higher levels of care and facilities are required.
              
              The average retiree might shudder at the thought of hanging their hopes on Thailand as a medical salvation, but Fraser Rea views it differently.  After receiving medical treatment at Bangkokâ€™s top international hospital he vows that â€œThe Medical care facilities at the Bumrungrad private hospital in Bangkok are as good as or even better than what is available in Canadaâ€�.

              For workerholic Singaporeans, I think they should try go into semi-retirement first before they go into full time retirement. Most workerholic Singaporeans, when they retired, they don't know what to do and that make them feel bore about being retired.
              
              Semi-retirement would help them to adjust and expect what it would be like to retire fully. Plus they will still need to find out what is the good things about retirement because it is not about just sit back and relax at home doing nothing or go travelling...its more than that and they need to know what they can do when they retired fully. They can also see how much money that they need to budget if they go for full retirement in the future and during semi-retirement period though they are still working part-time, they can really see what is in store for them when they go for full retirement in the future.

              Hi Zul,
              I am trying out semi retirement by doing a part time job. I would like to retire in penang or jb. But I prefer the seaside. How do I start? I quite dislike staying in Singapore as a retiree.
