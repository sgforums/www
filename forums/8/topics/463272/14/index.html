              In the past, we caught many Chinese nationals who were supposedly Malaysian citizens with Malaysian passports and IDs applying for work here in Singapore...during the application process and renewal process. If the authority finds out that it were 'fake' documents to get the genuine Singapore Citizenships or already given Singapore Citizenships....the authority can revoked that genuine Singapore Citizenship...detained them....then Malaysian authority would like know how those documents were obtained. To be a Malaysian citizen...the Father must be a Malaysian. Malaysian authority will not issued citizenship anyhow especially to those especially from China.

              The difference between you and me is that I'm born in Singapore and I'm a Singaporean so is compulsory to serve NS...in fact I served in the same SAF insignia with LHL while you were still running naked with a running nose at your kampong in Malaysia...lols. As for your case, you born in Malaysia but came to Singapore later......you want to become a Singaporean and desperate to become a Singaporean....so you served NS and to become a Singaporean. About your question,"why would Malaysian government want to give citizenship to china or indian? they only want Malay lah.." Good question and point there.....then how your father from China became a Malaysian and then came to Singapore to become a PR and later a Singaporean?

              No, I never regretted being born in Singapore, serving my NS and reservist. I was never disappointed with my belated parents choice of staying foot in Singapore when Malaysia and Singapore broke away in 1965. I don't care about Malaysia politics and what the Malaysian government do to their citizens. You keep forgetting that you said its good for Singaporeans to retire in JB..hehe. Your father came to Malaysia in 1960s prior to 1965. He should have come straight to Singapore state from China then he probably don't have to face all the obstacles and hassles while living in Malaysia and then came to Singapore. About you serving NS and not going to Canada or Australia because you already a PR in Singapore and need to serve NS because the Singapore Government would punish your parents financially if you fled to other countries. Besides you probably have weighed and calculated your situation that it was easier and better for you to serve NS and get a new citizenship faster as a citizen of Singapore rather than going to Canada or Australia whereby your status there were uncertain.

              straight to Singapore state from China then he probably don't have
              to face all the obstacles and hassles while living in Malaysia and
              then came to Singapore. About you serving NS and not going to
              Canada or Australia because you already a PR in Singapore and need
              to serve NS because the Singapore Government would punish your
              parents financially if you fled to other countries. Besides you
              probably have weighed and calculated your situation that it was
              easier and better for you to serve NS and get a new citizenship
              faster as a citizen of Singapore rather than going to Canada or
              Australia whereby your status there were uncertain.</p>
