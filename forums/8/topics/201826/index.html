Its history and a nice novel though. Pretty sad the characters I liked in there died quite sadly. Sun Ce is one good example. Zhou Yu too. BUT Lucky Zhao Yun lived long and died of old age. Sad abt Zhuge Liang and Cao Cao too. (And I dun like da eng pronounciation of their names in Dynasty warriors... too weird and corny) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
