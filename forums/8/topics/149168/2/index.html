            <div class='col-md body'>Good, this topic allows me to rant my thoughts out.<br><br>Singapore Idol? Ok. I missed most of it but the judging is by professional judges and not entirely or mostly by voting right? And Taufik CAN sing. Slyvester is better in chinese songs, not english. He joined the wrong competition but he still make it.<br><br>Project Superstar! WTF, I have the exact same thoughts as the threadstarter. Voting by public is 70% in semi finals and 100% in the finals, WRONG, Totally screwed up! Its a singing competition ffs, the judging system makes it look like its a popularity competition. I've only watched the semi finals and the finals and all I can say is, the wrong person emerged champion.<br><br>During semi finals. Sin Huey and Junyang were better than Kelly and Weilian. Judges selected Sin Huey and Junyang as finalists. Public with no sense of hearing (Well, sad to say, most of them) selected Weilian and Kelly (No offence to fans of these 2 here, I'm just being very frank about it). Fine. During the finals, judges felt that Kelly is better than Weilian in her performance. In the end? Weilian is the champion.<br><br>Have you notice Weilian gets more and more nervous, screwing up his performances more as the judges revealed that Kelly is better?<br><br>And one more thing I wanna attract everyone's attention to is the interviewing of passers-by on streets about Project Superstar...<br><br><strong>Who do you support and why?</strong><br>"Oh, I support Weilian cos he is blind, yet he still went to participate in this competition"<br><br>Notice anything yet?<br><br>"I've seen him singing in Orchard Road before, and I pity him for being blind and still he has the courage to go for such a competition"<br><br>And whats worse is<br><br>"Of course I support Weilian lor. Cause I find him very handsome"<br><br>THIS IS TRUE. I REALLY SAW SOMEONE SAYING THAT<br><br>But one thing that stopped me from throwing my sofa at the television is<br><br>"I've always admire his singing and looks forward to meeting him everytime I come to orchard"<br><br>At least there are some sensible people<br><br>If you ask me which is my favourite, I'll say its Project Superstar, since I'm interested in chinese songs. But if they don't change the judging system in the next season of Project Superstar, My interest will definitely fly to Singapore Idol<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="small">My above post has absolutely no offence to anyone. I'm just saying out all my thoughts. This is a forum. You know right? Good</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i hate both =D singapore idol is trying realllll hard to copy american idol, which is of cos the best idol contest globally. i mean, they try to have judges who act simon cowell style, wtf??!! then about sly, i dun like him. many girls like his "trademark" smile which is on posters everywhere...i see already wanna puke lor. he looks like an ahbeng but cant decide whether to act like one or not... the way he dresses -.- sad la.<br>then project superstar, the name already sounds so corny...i dun listen to chinese songs but, my frends tell me good singers get kicked and constipated-sounding singers remain. i was reading life! newspaper and they kept calling the blind singer BLIND BUSKER..i mean, wtf is up with that? super corny show if u ask me...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>although Project superstar got more babes (Kelly!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> xinhui!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ), i support sg idol becos the qualities of the show is better and they have better judges unlike project superstar. English songs at least have more substance than those chinese (the chinese song added wif english rap sound like shit).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Project superstar. They got more exposure even after competition and got a show of their own ('Super Funkies'). Unlike SG Idol, after competiton not much news abt them. Only got 3 (Sly, Taufik and Maia) manage to get recording contract. Good singers like Leandra and Jessea are 'missing' after the show 'shooting stars'. Project Superstar is still better then SG Idol.</div>
