The grass is greener on the other side, but in the case of local women liking ABCs, it's not only greener, but it's exactly the type of grass they like to eat.<br><br>ABC men are raised under Western standards.  Maybe.  That's not saying Chinese ways are not good.  But we all like to try things that are different or 'taboo'.  But for the ABC, it's like having a taboo thing inside something that won't be seen as taboo, namely a Chinese bloke.  I'll say that it's the same over here in Australia.  ABC women are more attractive to overseas students than their overseas counterparts.<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
