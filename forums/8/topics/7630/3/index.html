            <div class='col-md body'>utterly disappointed and shell shocked after England lost the two goals cushion...i think it is not that the players are inferior to the opponent, its just that the English mentality is too weak...moreover, ever since when u see England goes ahead by two in early time in recent tournaments!!!! suddenly they don't know whether to defend or attack, they just fell apart...<br>one critical error that England has always not learned, that is to defend from the midfield, not in defence...Look at how Figo scored that spetacular, he ran the whole midfield without challenge!!! where the hell is Paul Ince....Playing against team with highly talented midfielders, u just gotta flood the midfield, do a lot of running to spoil the opponent setup....and yes there is one player i fell is getting from bad to worst, he is Sol Campbell!!! I think he better leave his current cock up Spurs to progress..if he continues, he sure to be dropped from England...</div>

Another figure which I think which should be dropped is Tony Adams. He has lost it. And I think Keegan should really give Nigel Martyn a chance. I feel that he would do a lot better than David Seaman. Seaman's form is going from bad to worse.<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>
