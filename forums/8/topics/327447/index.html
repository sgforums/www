Menlo Park, California<br>Tom Biscardi, CEO<br><br>BIGFOOT BODY FOUND - EVIDENCE AND DNA DETAILS TO BE PRESENTED AT A PRESS CONFERENCE ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 15th<br><br>FROM 12 N00N TO 1:00PM AT THE CABANA HOTEL-PALO ALTO IN PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA<br><br>A body that may very well be the body of the creature commonly known as “Bigfoot” has been found in the woods in northern Georgia.<br><br>DNA evidence and photo evidence of the creature will be presented in a press conference on Friday, August 15th from 12 Noon to 1:00pm at the Cabana Hotel-Palo Alto at 4290 El Camino Real in Palo Alto, California, 94306. The press conference will not be open to the public. It will only be open to credentialed members of the press.<br>Here are some of the vital statistics on the “Bigfoot” body:<br>*The creature is seven feet seven inches tall.<br>*It weighs over five hundred pounds.<br>*The creature looks like it is part human and part ape-like.<br>*It is male.<br>*It has reddish hair and blackish-grey eyes.<br>*It has two arms and two legs, and five fingers on each hand and<br>five toes on each foot.<br>*The feet are flat and similar to human feet.<br>*Its footprint is sixteen and three-quarters inches long and five and three-quarters inches wide at the heel.<br>*From the palm of the hand to the tip of the middle finger, its hands are<br>eleven and three-quarters inches long and six and one-quarter inches wide.<br>*The creatures walk upright. (Several of them were sighted on the same day that the body was found.)<br>*The teeth are more human-like than ape-like.<br>*DNA tests are currently being done and the current DNA and photo evidence will be presented at the press conference on Friday, August 15th.<br><br>The creature was found by Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer (residents of Georgia) in the woods in northern Georgia. (The exact location is being kept secret to protect the creatures.)<br>Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer will be flying in from Georgia to be at the press conference. Also present at the press conference will be Tom Biscardi, CEO of Searching for Bigfoot, Inc.<br>Whitton is a Clayton County, Georgia, police officer, who is currently on administrative leave after being wounded in the course of duty pursuing an alleged felon. Dyer is a former correctional officer. Whitton and Dyer are co-owners of bigfoottracker.com and Bigfoot Global LLC., a company that offers Bigfoot expeditions. Whitton and Dyer are working with Bigfoot hunter, Tom Biscardi, and Biscardi’s Searching for Bigfoot, Inc., to present and conduct the scientific study of the evidence and information on this body.<br>A few weeks ago, Whitton and Dyer announced the finding of the body on the “Squatch Detective” radio show, an internet based radio show hosted by Steve Kulls. While on that show, the commentator asked Rick Dyer “Would you allow one of our people to come down and verify the body?” Dyer replied, “The only person we would allow to come down and verify the body was ‘the real Bigfoot Hunter,’ Tom Biscardi.” The next day, the producer of the Squatch Detective show contacted Biscardi with pertinent information on how to contact Dyer and Whitton.<br>Extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist, an anthropologist, a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location. The studies will be carefully documented and the findings will be released to the world, according to Biscardi.<br>Biscardi is known as “the real Bigfoot Hunter” because of his extensive investigations out in the field. He has been searching for Bigfoot since 1971 and over the past several years, he has been criss-crossing the United States and Canada tracking down the hottest leads on Bigfoot sightings.<br>Videography on the studies will be done under the supervision of Scott Davis, an independent producer and owner of TV Biz Productions in Phoenix, Arizona.<br>Currently, Tom Biscardi and his Searching for Bigfoot Team, in conjunction with Bigfoot Global LLC., are preparing to capture another of these creatures alive. That expedition will start very soon. The dates and the locations are being kept confidential.<br>The body that is currently being studied is being referred to as the “RICKMAT” creature, a name derived from the names of Rick Dyer and Matthew Whitton. [Cryptozoologist Loren Coleman recommends the term “Georgia Gorilla” be used to remove any taint of ego from the discovery, and so the general public, media, and science will have a comfortable moniker until a formal zoological name may be bestowed.]<br>Last year, a film that Biscardi produced about his investigations, called “Bigfoot Lives,” won first place in the Documentary category at the Pocono Mountains Film Festival. Biscardi also hosts a Bigfoot oriented internet radio show that can be heard on Wednesday nights from 7:00pm to 8:00pm PDT at [url]www.bigfootliveradioshow.com[/url]. The show is heard in over thirty countries.<br>Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. has exclusive rights to all publishing rights, photo rights, television and film rights, production and distribution rights and other commercial opportunities related to the discovery and findings regarding this body and these creatures.<br>Interested parties may contact Searching for Bigfoot, Inc., in writing, at their mailing address, 1134 Crane St., Suite 216, Menlo Park, California 94025. <br><br>In a news conference on Friday, April 15th, to be held in San Francisco, the DNA results of a probable new species of primate, call it “Bigfoot,” “Georgia Bigfoot,” or “Georgia Gorilla,” if you wish, will be announced. You have read the press release already.<br><br>Also a photograph of the body was to be released, but a mistaken uploading and premature release of the photograph tonight on Tom Biscardi’s website has rushed that timetable.<br><br>I, Loren Coleman, author of The Field Guide to Bigfoot and Other Mystery Primates and Bigfoot! The True Story of Apes in America, was given an exclusive first look at the body, via an early email delivered photograph today. <br><br>Is it real? It certainly looks like the real deal, and with a surprising variety of features.<br><br>The hominoid (please note, not hominid) body, found in the Georgia woods, is now in a secure location, under armed guard, and set to be examined by a battery of academic scholars, skeptical scientists, Bigfoot researchers, and debunking writers.<br><br>Who is to say the discovery of Bigfoot won’t happen this way?<br><br>With offers of millions of dollars, just for the photographs of the body, Loren Coleman and Cryptomundo was given one copy of the first image to share with you, our readers today.<br><br>The body doesn’t look exactly like people thought it would, because the Patterson-Gimlin Bigfoot has been the model in our minds. However, this looks as if it is an actual apelike primate. Indeed, the gorilla-like facial features, the robust lack of canines, and the grinding surfaces shown in the teeth suggest a bulky vegetarian with a mixture of higher primate characteristics.<br><br>Will further tests and the proposed live capture of others prove beyond a doubt that Bigfoot is a new species? Stay tuned.</p></div>

              <p><strong>Researcher says bigfoot just a rubber gorilla suit</strong></p>

              <p></p>
              <p>ATLANTA - Turns out Bigfoot was just a rubber suit. Two researchers on a quest to prove the existence of Bigfoot say that the carcass encased in a block of ice — handed over to them for an undisclosed sum by two men who claimed to have found it — was slowly thawed out, and discovered to be a rubber gorilla outfit.</p>
              <div class="lrec">The revelation comes just days after a much ballyhooed <span id="lw_1219189260_0" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">news conference</span> was held in <span id="lw_1219189260_1" class="yshortcuts">California</span> to proclaim that the remains of the creature found in the <span id="lw_1219189260_2" class="yshortcuts">North Georgia mountains</span> was the legendary man-ape.</div>
              <p>Steve Kulls, executive director of <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ap/ap_on_re_us/storytext/bigfoot_claim/28684596/SIG=10tcvs0ts/*http://squatchdetective.com"><span id="lw_1219189260_3" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #003399;">squatchdetective.com</span></span></a> and host of Squatchdetective Radio, says in a posting on a Web site run by Bigfoot researcher Tom Biscardi that as the "evidence" was thawed, the claim began to unravel as a giant hoax.</p>
              <p>First, the hair sample was burned and "melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair," Kulls said in the posting.</p>
              <p>The thawing process was sped up and the exposed head was found to be "unusually hollow in one small section." An hour of thawing later and the feet were exposed — and they were found to be made of rubber.</p>
              <p>Matt Whitton, an officer who has been on medical leave from the <span id="lw_1219189260_4" class="yshortcuts">Clayton County Police Department</span>, and Rick Dyer, a former Georgia corrections officer, announced the find in early July on <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/ap/ap_on_re_us/storytext/bigfoot_claim/28684596/SIG=10psi9dkb/*http://www.youtube.com/"><span id="lw_1219189260_5" class="yshortcuts"><span style="color: #003399;">YouTube videos</span></span></a> and a Web site.</p>
              <p>"Everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words," Whitton said at the time.</p>
              <p>Phone calls to Whitton and Dyer went unreturned on Tuesday. But the voicemail recording for their Bigfoot Tip Line — which proclaims they search for leprechauns and the <span id="lw_1219189260_6" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Loch Ness monster</span> — has been updated and announcing they're also in search of "big cats and dinosaurs. If you see any of those, give us a call."</p>
              <p>On Tuesday, <span id="lw_1219189260_7" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">Clayton County</span> Police Chief <span id="lw_1219189260_8" class="yshortcuts" style="background: none transparent scroll repeat 0% 0%; cursor: hand; border-bottom: medium none;">Jeff Turner</span> said he has not spoken to Whitton but processed paperwork to fire him.</p>
              <p>"Once he perpetrated a fraud, that goes into his credibility and integrity," Turner said. "He has violated the duty of a <span id="lw_1219189260_9" class="yshortcuts" style="cursor: hand; border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed;">police officer</span>."</p>
