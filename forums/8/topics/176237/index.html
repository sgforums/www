            <div class='col-md body'>There is also a mind twister scene where the villagers unable to solve the dilemma of the 2 person who look alike, one the spirit , the other is the real husband of the girl who returns unexpectedly  . To identify who is the fake On the way to see the King to solve their problem they meet a wise sheperd who suspects witchcraft  and devises 3 plans to identify the real person...............<br><br>1st plan :- he asks the 2 to touch hot coal and if one of them is burnt , then he must be lying. One  man steps forward to touch but he wthdraws showing typical human nature. the Spirit fake refuses to touch it (for obviously it is burns) but remains calm.  Again both men showing human nature<br>This plan seems unhuman way but actually its a human way to find out<br><br>2nd plan: Cannot remember except that to round up some sheep in less than a minute which again the supposed real guy steps forward having difficulty exibiting human traits while the fake one just stands there and watcheds as if he is not interested and remains cool and calm and says this is a stupid idea and refuses to do it...Again both men showing human nature<br>This plan seems to be a decoy for of the sheperd..<br><br>3rd plan: The sheperd proposes a unbelievable method. he says who can go into his empty water container is the real person. But his trumpcard is that he lures the spirrit's emotional nature into his trap . He says " ..to prove your love for your wife..." statement..the spirit very well aware and  unable to withhold this test decides that it is his test of love and he gives himself away by vaporising himself and entering the container. But this time one of them showed supernatural abilities............<br>Again , this plan seems unhuman way but actually its a human way to find out<br><br>Ending:  The spirirt returns again to the girl  but no one is sure how after being trapped...MY QUESTION IS ( to those who seen the film) WAs the real man in the above 3 test who was fumbling actually the spirirt putting up a show showing human nature as percieved by by other humans in the  most typical way (fumbling) ? And ONLY ONE MAn was alive, So was this man in the final scene the Spirit as he claims he possessed the real human husband, He says " I am a spirit and i can possess or take on any form"?  or Could he be the real husband telling a lie that he was the spirirt she loved in order to be accepted?<br><br>If then why did the SPirirt not possess the real husband right from the beginning when he was leaving for his business venture and come back as one  to love the girl?</div>
