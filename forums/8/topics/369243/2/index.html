              <p>DUSHANBE, July 23 (RIA Novosti) - <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tajikistan's president has
                          proposed banning the Russian language from being used in public
                          institutions and official documents, a move he said would promote the
                          development of Tajik and bolster patriotism in the country.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">
              </span></span></span></p><h1>"The dignity of a nation is determined, above all, by how people
                          preserve and respect their language,"</h1>
              Emomali Rakhmon said in a
                          televised address late on Wednesday.<p></p>
              <p>Rakhmon urged a new language law to amend 1989 legislation that
                          defined Tajik as the official language and Russian as a language of
                          "interethnic communication," which gave the latter a de facto official
                          status allowing people to use it in dealing with authorities, and
                          receive information and documents in Tajik or Russian.</p>
              <p>The new draft law proposed by the president and submitted to
                          parliament obliges all nationals to know Tajik and speak it in official
                          situations and public workplaces.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The president criticized newspaper journalists for a poor knowledge
                          of Tajik, for using clumsy or misleading phrases and terminology, and
                          even making spelling mistakes.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>In the Soviet period, Russian was the lingua franca among the
                          various ethnic groups in Tajikistan and other ex-Soviet republics. Many
                          ethnic Russians have fled Tajikistan since the breakup of the Soviet
                          Union and the ensuing civil war, but Russian is still spoken by much of
                          the native population.</p>
              <p>Russian is still an official language in Belarus, Kazakhstan,
                          Kyrgyzstan, and it is also widely spoken in Ukraine and some other
                          parts of the former Soviet Union.</p>

              <p>Already when we studied Sociolinguistics, the answer is an affirmative Yes</p>
              <p>The most classical example in Synchronic Linguistics is the notable case of <strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Welsh Colour Scheme Vs English Colour Scheme</strong>.</p>
              <p>Let's consider as a relatively simple example the colour terminology in English and Welsh (Aitchison 1995, 82). English and Welsh speakers have in the past led fairly similar lives, yet Welsh <em>glas</em> traditionally covers not only the area that English speakers would call <em>blue</em>, but also part of what they woud call <em>green</em> and <em>grey</em>, as shown in the table below.</p>
              <p><img src="http://i720.photobucket.com/albums/ww205/Bangulzai/WelshEnglishColours.png" alt="" width="178" height="150"> <span style="font-style: italic;">This example shows that languages may differ even in apparently quite basic areas.</span></p>
              <p>Speaking in a different language which has a different set (called a Linguistic Set) shapes the worldview of one who speaks it. We may agree on the superficial level that Singaporeans speaking English language are still Chinese, but when we engage our cognitive skills in the English language, we have already bought over the English's worldview.</p>

              <p>The grammar, syntax, vocabulary of a certain language will have a profound influence on the speaker and will shape his outlook and worldview. That is true.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ordinary African is very remote from either future preference
                  or infinitely expandable material demands. He generally has preference
                  for the present, and his demands are often nonmaterial and even
                  non-economic, such as his desire for leisure or for social approval.
                  The African has a fair recognition of the immediate past, a dominant
                  concern for the present, and little concern for the future.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Accordingly, his conception of time is totally different from that of
                  the average Western man. </strong></span></span>The latter sees the present only as a moving
                  point of no dimension that separates the past from the future. The
                  African sees time as a wide gamut of the present with a moderate
                  dimensioned past and almost no future.</p>
              <p>This outlook is reflected in the
                  structure of the Bantu languages, which do not emphasize the tense
                  distinctions of past, present, and future, as we do, but instead
                  emphasize categories of condition, including a basic distinction in the
                  verb between completed and incompleted actions that places the present
                  and the future (both concerned with unfinished actions) in the same
                  category.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We do this occasionally in English when we use the present
                  tense in a future sense by saying, "He is coming tomorrow," but this
                  rare use of the present to indicate the future does not blur our
                  conception of the future the way constant use of such a construction
                  does in Bantu.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact the average asian in the 19th century, did not share the same "outlook" or understanding  on time, space, world as a western man. This however has changed through the course of 20th century.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example General Yamashita's tells us:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Second, I would like you to promote education in science. No one can
              deny that the level of Japan's modern science, apart from certain minor
              areas, is well below world standards. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>If you travel outside Japan, the
              first thing you notice is the unscientific way of life of the Japanese.</strong></span></span> To search for truth with <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Japan's irrational and cliquish mentality is
              like searching for fish among the trees...</strong></span></span></p>
