            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Since early March 2005, my grandmother (82 yrs old) was diagnose with this cancer called esophogeaus which means the cancerous tumour grows in her food passage way. My granny had also been in &amp; out of the hospital for alot of times. She always get choked by food (even water or porridge)<br>Ever since then, she had been gettin slimmer &amp; slimmer. Currently, there are already 2 stands implanted in her food passage way to expand her food passage way in order for her to allow food to pass through.<br><br>On 9th Nov, 2nd stand was implanted to expand her food passage way.<br>On 12th Nov, my grandmother tried eating a soft papaya but ended gettin choked.<br>On 13th Nov, we sent her to the hospital since she is unable to eat and keep vomitting. First bad experience, the moment i step in, I saw the language preferred stated for my grandmother is "Chinese".<br>So I asked the staff nurse (Florence) "why do you put chinese as my grandmother dont speak chinese?"<br>Guess what nonsense she said? She said "oh I dunno how to speak hokkien."<br>So i said back "you dont know how to speak hokkien doesnt mean my grandmother preferred langauge should follow your language. Pls change to Hokkien"<br>And she look so unhappy changing the paper.<br><br>On 14th Nov, my grandmother started to be able to eat as she had vomitted out everything after a scoping test. She hate doing scoping because whenever the tube goes in her throat, she will vomit tremendously.<br>The test was to check whether there is anything wrong on the stands implanted. Result was nothing wrong.<br><br>On 15th Nov, she is still able to eat. Hospital serve soft diet. But that night, the weather is damm cold as it is raining. And the nurse never even bother to check whether the aircons are too cold for the patients.<br>In the end, my grandmother suffered from coldness in the room. Because she was only given a thin blanket.<br><br>On 16th Nov, things happen. I called my grandmother. She told me that she got choked during dinner as the nurse served her hard rice with very hard meat. She rejected the rice as she jolly know well enough she is not possible to swollen them. But the nurse told her she cant change. My grandmother was left with no choice but to eat the rice. And she got chocked after 2-3 spoonful. After that, the nurse came with a bowl of porridge. The food had already stuck inside and she is vomitting terribly. So what the use of the porridge now??? WHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS?!!!<br>So I asked my grandmother to press the emergency bell as I wanted the nurse to explain to me why they serve rice to my grandmother? Guess how long I waited? 10MINS!!!<br>And when the nurse came, she told me that the kitchen prepare the wrong food. I was like how can your kitchen prepare wrong food and your nurse still want to force my grandmother to eat the rice!<br>She said there was no special order stated in the e-menu system as e-menu only have special diet for those diabetics patients.<br>I was even more angry. Isnt my grandmother's consider a special case?<br>In the end, she said she will request for soft diet for my grandmother. I was so angry and said all the while in the hospital, my grandmother was eating porridge and you still dare to tell me there was no special diet requested for my grandmother.<br>And all she said is she is new, just back from leave and she dunno anything.<br>I AM EVEN MORE PISS OFF!!<br><br>On 17th Nov morning, I called the nurse again.<br>I demand her to ask a doc to explain to me why a rice was served to my grandmother?<br>So in the end, one of the Medical officer called and explained the whole thing and apologise for the wrong food served.<br>Is that all they can do &amp; said!!! Committing a crime and said sorry after tat. Is that the way???<br><br>What is the point of saying sorry now when the hospital serve a wrong food to my grandmother, causing her not able to eat soft food again and vomitting terribly?<br>If the doc/nurse give a wrong injection and cause the patient to die, and then said sorry.<br>I heard of this incident that the doc/nurse give a wrong antibiotic injections and in the end the patient die due to allegergy and overdose.<br>I do not wish my grandmother die because of a MISTAKE SGH HAD MADE!!!<br><br>This is not my first time complaint. There are lots more complaints about SGH!<br>Everytime their sister nurse (senior nurse) called and check out the complaint I lodge, and said will follow up, but in the end, they NEVER!<br><br>SGH services really sucks!! If we are rich enough, we will not even step into this government hospital!!! And a govt hospital like SGH, shouldnt they be doing a betterr job to the old &amp; poor patients??!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been admitted to SGH for more than 5 times this year, not including day-treatment in outpatient wards. Some nurses are pretty nice and really sorry to hear that your grandmother had been given such treatment. Have you tried to speak to the doctor that your grandmother is seeing ?<br><br>I've faced a very bad service ward during my admission and I just told the nurses there straight that if they continue their attitude, don't be surprise if I call up my doctor immediately as I have my specialist's number. Only then, they became more "obedient". It's actually the management that really results in the service. If the SSN isn't strict and let their nurses do all these, it will result in more complaints.<br><br>Complaints aside, I've been admitted to very good wards which the nurses even accompanied me in the night when I was awake prior to a upper and lower scope test due to the laxative given to me that night. Such nurses deserved to be complimented too.<br><br>I understand your worries, and I wishes all the best to you.</div>

Some nurses are pretty nice and really sorry to hear that your grandmother had been given such treatment. Have you tried to speak to the doctor that your grandmother is seeing ?<br><br>I've faced a very bad service ward during my admission and I just told the nurses there straight that if they continue their attitude, don't be surprise if I call up my doctor immediately as I have my specialist's number. Only then, they became more "obedient". It's actually the management that really results in the service. If the SSN isn't strict and let their nurses do all these, it will result in more complaints.<br><br>Complaints aside, I've been admitted to very good wards which the nurses even accompanied me in the night when I was awake prior to a upper and lower scope test due to the laxative given to me that night. Such nurses deserved to be complimented too.<br><br>I understand your worries, and I wishes all the best to you.</div></blockquote>oh ok..noted...will take this advise</div>
