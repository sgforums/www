If born this child will really suffer, no name sake, no birth right, no father's name in birth cert. YOu are feeling miserable enough. Dun make someone come to this world and feel as miserable as you and let ppl call the child names. End this at your generation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>since you are wif E now.. i guess it better to tell E wat happen.. if you jus keep quiet , that not fair to E at all.  NOw you already got the baby, you should take the responsibilty , in the first place you already know that J is married and both of you wouldnt have any gd ending and yet you still do that, that very foolish of  you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's wrong breakin up a family...u should have put urself in J's wife's shoes in the first place.. if u were to be married to J and some other younger gal comes into ur marriage, messes up with your husband and gets pregnant?<br>How will their kid feel?<br><br>Well this happened to my family b4...and luckily my mum was tolerant enough and dad's r/s with that *&amp;#^(*@# is shortlived. But for that 2 years or so, I was feeling damn depressed and unhappy. U said u were happy with J.. but it was in the expense of his wife and kid... Well.. anywayz just a piece of my mind here..<br><br>Abortion's the killin of a life...it's murder! killing your unborn may be a fast way to end your problems.. but it's really unethical to do so...<br><br>well, seems like the kid's gonna pay for your sins if he/she's born. However, it's the 21st Century... I doubt a kid from a Single parent family will be discriminated by the society... just bring him/her up well and he'll be just like anyone out there...Since u have made this mistake , you should at least be responsible and not to kill your unborn to hide your sins right?<br><br>But if the kid is born, are you still going to get together with J?<br><br>Perhaps you can discuss with E if E accepts your unborn child....<br><br></div>

In this case you are talking about four lives here.<br><br>I agree with some of the posters here.  J didn't love you enough to leave his family for you.  Although you feel you are happier with him, it may be a case of "forbidden fruit taste sweeter".  As for E, you have to be honest with him if you are bent on having the baby.  But I fear, life ma not be the same anymore with E.  And at your young age, you are confident that you can take care of the baby?  You are only just starting to get a life yourself.<br><br>Please take care, stay strong and calm and speak to an adult whom you trust in your family nuclear.  You really shouldn't go through this alone.<br><br>All the very best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">So wat did J say after knowing that u are pregnant?  Just asked u to take care of yourself?  Did he say that he will be responsible?  In the first place, since he's married, why did u sleep with him?<br><br>You are below 20..OMG!  If J dun want to provide for u and the unborn child, what are u going to do?  If E finds out about this, how will he feel?  Betrayed and heartbreak.  Have you ever thought of the consequences?  Be prepared for the worst.<br><br>I dun encourage abortion.  But since J is already married, it's also not encouraging for him to get a divorce.  No matter what he do, he will hurt either one or both of u (u and his wife).  My instinct tells me that he will never leave his wife and kid.<br><br>2 months already..can't drag any longer.  Talk to J and E..talk to ur family...I dun think you can support the child by yourself if u were to bring it to this world.  Whatever it is, plssssssss be responsible for your own actions.  Dun want hear another news about newborn baby being thrown in rubbish chute. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>p.s: my advice is for this case tat "think with ur head, instead of ur heart"<br></blockquote>Totally agree... U should let rationale rule over feelings....<br><br>Perhaps your family can help you to bring up your child first? Talk to E..and if he's uncomfortable with the situation...then forget about him bah... it's a test of love here.. if he can't accept you and your plight, it ain't called true love anymore...<br><br>As for J...  Sometimes guys can be really nice and sweet with their words...but do you even know what's really on his mind? Usually, when older married guys messes ard with little girls... it's for the fun and pleasure niaz.. in the hearts, their wife and family's still their essence of life... (which may not be your case though)<br><br>Perhaps..your true love's somwhere out there...he'll accept you and your child...with open arms.. you are still young and u won't know what's gonna be in for you in the future.. so just don't limit ur chances now... I'm sure you can live w/o a guy for the moment right? Talk to your parents , i bet you will get their full support, don't bottle things up...or maybe you can talk to some counsellors..<br><br>Pregnancy Crisis Service (Family Life Society) - Unmarried mothers and mothers-to-be having trouble coping with their pregnancy.<br><br>Tel: 6339-9770<br>(9:00am - 5:00pm Mon-Sat)<br>(Answering machine after office hours)<br><br>Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have been consulted with these kind of problems so many times by so many people.<br><br>At the end, i realized that all these people (including yourself) already have an answer regardless how much advice other people have given. You just try to avoid the answer that lies at the bottom of your heart(brain) and need someone to support your decision.<br><br>i think you have to sit down by yourself quietly and think through this...<br>A few paragraphs of posts in this forum cannot make us to understand totally your situation. Only you yourself can clear out and walk out of this situation.<br><br>Although you already have an answer, I must make my opinion know. (success rate to get in your mind is 0-1% if my opinion doesn't click with yours)<br><br>just don't abort. the kid is innocent and they are life. although you will have a tougher life, you are still considered lucky. Many people could suffer in worse situation than you in some part in this world e.g. war, hunger, entire family died of earthquake etc. It is because you are in singapore, we all are well taken care of by government (sadly? or happily? i don't have an answer for now)<br></div>
