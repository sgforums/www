That, is something each couple have to work out themselve.<br><br>Me? I treat my ex like bao all the time.

Oh well, looks like we gals must learn that the sensitivity of the guy during courtship can be false.   :p<br><br>And maybe guys should not throw in everything in knows to a gal during courtship, or else, it will be difficult to add in new hobbies to rekindle the relationship.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>But, Mr Hata san, are u sure that he will take it that itÂ’s like some new chase all over again and not sick of the galÂ’s constant feeling of wanting something different?<br></div></blockquote>Dear Churra,<br>I still prefer guys who dun put up a front and behave like they are someone else... *sigh* I mean I prefer guys who dun act act... so fake... I can usually see thru this type of guys so fast such that I lose interest with them even before they can get my phone number...<br><br>Well, as for "throwing in everything a guy knows to a gal during courtship"... well , I dun think it makes any difference before or after... the best way to test if the relationship is substainable is after the courtship, when the couple find out if they can be together for years to come... from then, they can develop their interest and grow together as a couple than as a person.<br><br>And if someone thinks that starting a new relationship will bring back the thrill of a romance, I think the person is very wrong... the person, esp the guy, will have to spend money on roses and chocolates courting a girl, and then go through the usual quarrels and eventually heart-breaks... quite a waste of time !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

What work for me might not work for others and what do you know, my ex is so desirable that she will still attract men when with a gold ring on her fourth finger.

Why do guys usually treat a gal very good during courtship and change completely when he get hold of the gal?<br><br>For example,<br><br>[b]During courtship:</strong><br>He knows that she loves tennis. He will make it a point/effort to arrange a date with her for a session of tennis once a week.<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will say things like, "Not tennis again? Why do u like to play tennis so much? No, dun felt like playing tennis today. I'm very tired."<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He knows tat she loves the beach. He will make use of every opportunity to go to the beach with the gal. Sitting down, enjoying the sea breeze, chit chat....from nite till sunrise...<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will be telling u, "Go beach for wat? Nothing to do there. Sit there for whole nite, must as well go home and sleep."<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He knows that she loves to eat a certain food. He will go all out, to tampines or Hougang or chinatown, just to get the best one in singapore for you.<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will say things like, "aiyah, why so troublesome? The food here is also nice wat, y so picky?"<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He will be especially romantic during Valentine's day, christmas, birthdays etc....and planned a lot of surprises for you, giving u gifts, etc<br><strong>When in together:</strong><br>The gal will ask the guy wat he planned to go during valentine's day and he will reply, "Valentine's day only, what's so special? It's just a day to for the florist to earn more money...."<br><br>and the lists can go on and on....<br><br>I'm not trying to say every guy is like that. I have seen guys who treat his gf even better when they are together. But it seems tat the above cases happened all the time to almost all the gals i know, and even me myself.<br>Can any guys (or gals) give me a very good explanation on the different treatments?<br><br>------------------<br>On the fourth day of Christmas<br>my true love gave to me<br>4 Calling Birds<br>...<br>and a Partridge in a Pear Tree[/b]</blockquote>not really true ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
