            <div class='col-md body'>I guess going after a girl is similar is taking part in a race for a guy.  When participating in the race, you try your very best and do whatever you can to win the prize trophy.  Once it is in your hands, you would take it for granted and not put in the same effort and energy to care for the trophy.  Of course, ocasionally, you would put in some time to polish it, but you would rest assured that it is already in your possession and does not really need extreme attention.<br><br>Weird analogy, but hope it makes some sense.  ;p<br></div>

Pray, do sit down a moment and curb your urge to quickly type out the words you can't wait to show.<br><br>Of course, it would seems so terrific to be in the 10% of guys mentioned and i would not be lying when i assume ALL of the guys posting in here think of themselves as that. And no, they are not lying. What they are, however, is accused of mixing of dreaming aka wanting to be and reality. Yes, we all can be such lovely fantastic lovers who can sacrifice everything for our partners and yes, this will not end even when we hold their hands and pop their cherries.<br>And I myself have fallen into this trap often enough...deluding myself into believing that I can be everything and more.<br><br>The fact is, this category of guys diminish when the years grow longer. After, say 3 years, ask again and see what the percentage is. I would safely say in the group of 5 percent and less. Nobody can sustain such an interest for long, especially young virile males. And females have this peculiar instinct of wanting everything to remain the same and when the discover the fervour of the guy is dying down, she automatically jump to the conclusion that he loves her no more and that there is a bitch lying around somewhere waiting to snare him.<br><br>Hey, eating sweet pies everything for 3 years can be real sian man. However, that does not mean that I don't like sweet pies. So dearest Churra, the love is not extinguish yet...all you need is to rekindle it again. And add in new hobbies. I am sure he will take to it like some new chase all over again. After all, attention denied is attention sought!<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agrees whole-heartedly with the Point System... somehow, guys just dun get it into their mind that most gals would appreciate it more if they remember little things or little touches than precious present or explicit expression of love. I would be very touch if my bf gives me a call in the middle of the day, or just an sms, telling me that he's thinking of me, missing me; And compared to a birthday present he spent a lot of time cracking his brain thinking over, I would be over the moon if he got me something he knew I always wanted (need not be expensive... can be something cute, preferably not predictable).<br><br>Again, is the difference in treatment (before &amp; after) becos of lack of maturity?

            <div class='col-md body'>This reminds me of an incident that happened to me few years back.<br><br>Well, you see, I am an avid AD &amp; D fan and i was absolutely estatic Baldur's Gate was going to be released. Set in Forgotten Realms, fantastic graphics and a chance to meet Drizzt Do'Uerdon! Needless to say, I bought the first original copy i could get my hands on.<br><br>First coupla times, I was absolutely fascinated by the game - i had fun creating the characters, marvelling at the magnificent graphics and landscapes, great narratives and ability to customise the way my characters looked.<br><br>After a while, I began to get tired as to why it took me so long to walk from one place to another, why the computer AI was so ridiculously stupid.<br><br>Much later on, I discovered that my level advancement was capped to 8(to my disgust) and how much space this piece of crap was actually taking up on my hard disk thus preventing me from installing and playing other much newer and better games.<br><br>Well, the point of the story? I'm not saying girls are games but we always allow the fascination of the unknown make us think what we are after is much more exciting and fantastic then it really is. At the same time, this blinds us to the flip side of things while we chase with all our might.<br><br>Be don't despair, they are always classics out there that you don't get bored of(like space invaders, hahaha!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

If he feels that all you are capable of is whining and attracting his attention, either you had a serious talk with him about his attitude or just plain dump him.<br>There is no magical formula in re-igniting your spark and fiery love after a long period together. That, is something each couple have to work out themselve.<br><br>Me? I treat my ex like bao all the time.

            <div class='col-md body'>talking about games as an analogy.....<br><br>There was a very old sega genesis game which I played in my childhood....called Super Shinobi. At the time it was a game that I truly thought was a first of its kind.<br><br>Now, played so many other games, many of which looked better, sounded better, and played better.<br><br>But I still remember it fondly....the atmosphere of the game....the sleekness....the original soundtrack. The style of the presentation and all. It still has an appeal to it...an "X-factor".<br><br>So just goes to show, that sometimes its not the best that counts, but the first that touches your heart in an inexplicable way.<br><br>=p<br><br>------------------<br>Blue Fire.....</div>
