            <div class='col-md body'>Guys. They usually treat a gal very well during courtship. But when he got the gal he wants, she will never get the good treatment again.<br><br>Guys. Why do guys usually treat a gal very good during courtship and change completely when he get hold of the gal?<br><br>For example,<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He knows that she loves tennis. He will make it a point/effort to arrange a date with her for a session of tennis once a week.<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will say things like, "Not tennis again? Why do u like to play tennis so much? No, dun felt like playing tennis today. I'm very tired."<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He knows tat she loves the beach. He will make use of every opportunity to go to the beach with the gal. Sitting down, enjoying the sea breeze, chit chat....from nite till sunrise...<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will be telling u, "Go beach for wat? Nothing to do there. Sit there for whole nite, must as well go home and sleep."<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He knows that she loves to eat a certain food. He will go all out, to tampines or Hougang or chinatown, just to get the best one in singapore for you.<br><strong>When together:</strong><br>He will say things like, "aiyah, why so troublesome? The food here is also nice wat, y so picky?"<br><br><strong>During courtship:</strong><br>He will be especially romantic during Valentine's day, christmas, birthdays etc....and planned a lot of surprises for you, giving u gifts, etc<br><strong>When in together:</strong><br>The gal will ask the guy wat he planned to go during valentine's day and he will reply, "Valentine's day only, what's so special? It's just a day to for the florist to earn more money...."<br><br>and the lists can go on and on....<br><br>I'm not trying to say every guy is like that. I have seen guys who treat his gf even better when they are together. But it seems tat the above cases happened all the time to almost all the gals i know, and even me myself.<br>Can any guys (or gals) give me a very good explanation on the different treatments?<br><br>------------------<br>On the fourth day of Christmas<br>my true love gave to me<br>4 Calling Birds<br>...<br>and a Partridge in a Pear Tree</div>
