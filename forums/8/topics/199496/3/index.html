I am not saying there are stupid people in polys, definately NOT. Just that not all can do well in paper work. It would be very unfair if you force all to take A'Level. Some people who go to poly just like to learn things in a different way. They too contribute to the society, though differently from JC goers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Scraping the Jc/poly system is definitely not the way out. Lets be honest. Differences are always the source of competition. World Cup 2006 has clearly proven this theory. If you are not capable, you will be ousted out of the competition. However, in this case, it is not a degrading process. The Government is just trying to diversify the bunch of young people to learn different skills.<br><br>The way they count for Jc and Poly may have caused some misunderstanding between these two batch of students. Yes, we cannot deny the fact that it is harder to get into a JC. It is also difficult for entry to NUS. Does that mean they have a greater level of intelligence? We can only safely say that they do know more in their head, and whether they have the ability to manipulate it in this fast and furious society, is another matter, totally.<br><br>In Chinese, we have a saying that goes " ge you qian qiu"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . It means that everyone has their own innate capability that others may not excel in. So, now then, why are we so hard over this matter? People from Jc will still need the help of poly students. Everyone is interrelated in that sense. Just like a flower and a butterfly. The butterfly is doing all the hard work and the flower just stays still with no contribution to help the butterfly at all. But, doesnt the butterfly benefit from the flower as well? SO in other words, arent they both as important to the biological world?<br><br>Besides, everyone was given the chance to take O levels. Was there anyone who was posted to poly without a chance to justify his place for a JC?<br><br>The hard truth is, we are going to work together few years later. Its time to grown some maturity and stop comparing people of two boundaries, that will meet and combine forces someday. So I believe that we should not divide the two institute into rungs, what we should do is look ahead into the future.<br><br>Peace out.<br></div>

Just that I had an upheaval from a foreign land in my younger days to reenter the Singaporean system whereby I had to learn mandarin instead of the second language I was taught overseas. Literally I was dumped into a chinese class where the rest of classmates had some base to go on and left behind. Why ? Because I am chinese and Singaporean.<br><br>Do I really want to let one subject condemn me for life? No thanks . I rather much choose a system which does not enforce mandarin on me hence poly.<br><br>How do you propose to change the system to A levels to suit everyone?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, firstly you are a Singaporean Chinese so I guess you ought to be learning it.

They are foundational subjects - you need them for any uni in the world and even the polys in Singapore.<br><br>Besides poly is ok ... I went to uni - got my degree and work overseas . Now postgrad.<br><br>So why should we scrap the system ..it worked well to my advantage as well as to others so far. I am just not good in the second language . A big F in A level mandarin would have affected your future academic and career aspirations. Who is daring enough to say it won't ?<br><br>That alone would have condemned me and alot others who are not good in certain academic subjects . Some of us are practical people who like certain set of skills , not generic type. Hence polytechnic is best suited to some of us while jc best suits others may like the generic pursuit of theorectical subjects or pure subjects like physics.<br><br>Explain in further detail the purpose of making  A levels  compulsory .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, so no Chinese for you. Don't worry if you got F9 for Chinese, I got many classmates and friends who got F9 also but all still can get in... Seriously, when you apply for Uni, the computer simply will not calculate your Chinese score in.<br><br>If you are not proficient in Chinese, then of course it will affect your job prospect in future whether you get a F9 or not. It depends on the job scope and requirement doesn't it? If you work in Japan then I am sure your F9 in Chinese will not affect you if your Jap and English is good...<br><br>Precisely because English/Maths/Physics etc etc are elementary foundation for Tertiary education that I advocate my viewpoint. Many countries have a single University entrance exam, whether it is japan, china, korea or almost every single country.<br>That is why there is SAT, IB and A levels. They are all Uni entrance exams that are of world class standards. Everyone in England takes A lvls to enter Uni and so does everyone in the U.S take SAT.<br><br>I think Sg is one of the few places where there are two different set of standards in entering University. If we can take O levels to determine whether we enter Jc or Poly, then why not A lvls or some other exams to determine whether we enter Uni or not. It is this discrepancies that I find wierd. Who is to say that Poly is not tougher than A lvls or the other way round?</div>
