League cup??? Come on, which self-respecting top manager will take pride in winning that?? UEFA cup is just a loser's Champions league. Winning a second-class treble DOES NOT equate to Man U's achievements in 1999. Do not forget that they disposed of Liverpool, Chelsea and Arsenal on their way to the FA Cup triumph. What kind of FA cup opponents have Liverpool faced this seasion?? Wycombe Wanderers??? Ppurrlease! Man U also disposed of Inter Milan, Juventus and Bayern Munich to win the Champions league. So please don't taint the achievements of 1999 by according Liverpool the same status. They are still far from it. Maybe they should start by beating all the small teams first. Coz they have shown once again this season that they are not good enough. So what if they win the treble??? That wun guarantee them a Champions league spot next season. What an irony, champions of 3 cups but no Champions league spot!

But name me a player in the 1999 team that is not in the current team, and I will name you 10 in the Liverpool 80's team that are not in the current team. Fact is, Liverpool fans always like to remind us of their supremacy in the 80s, and how they have won the most league wins.

            <div class='col-md body'>Seifer, that's precisely what we are trying to say. Although the members of the 1999 treble-winning team is still there, they are nowhere near that level in 2001.  The standard of football has been stagnant for the manu team while the rest are fast improving.  The success of the 1999 team is because the other teams have not found a way to deal with their strategy.  Look at this year, even teams like Bayern Munich can complete a double over Manchester United.  No offence to Bayern Munich though.</div>

If I am not mistaken, Man U is the ONLY team who has made it to the quarter final stage in the last 4/5 champions league.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Manchester united's style of playing seems to be stagnant. Opposition teams have found ways to stop them from winning.<br><br>Look, Man Utd have already lost against arsenal away, liverpool, bayern munich home and away, psv eindhoven, anderlect away, west ham at home, failed to beat valencia in both legs. What is this? That's already 8 defeats. Guess the man utd team needs some overhauling, juz like pool which is rebuilding.<br></div>

That's a lot of $$$. Wonder if he's worth it. I would think Man U seriously needs a creative midfielder...somebody who can do the defence-splitting pass...somebody like Zidane. Somemore, that element is gone with Cantona. Also they need a better partner for Jaap Stam. Sorry but Wes Brown just don't cut it....Johnsen was good but injury-prone. Hopefully, they can sign Sol Campbell  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
