            <div class='col-md body'>wah liew.....why start this kind of topic sia....<br><br>lets be fair lah, women got no good one, also got good one. Men got good one, also got bad one.  Equality is nothing wrong, I am totally for equality, I have no problems with that. But if a woman in the process of fighting for equality, puts another man down, then she is no better herself. and MEN need to evaluate why so many WOMEN wants equality nowadays.<br><br>That IS because of OUR FAULT. We always LOOK DOWN on them, think they are fit only for kitchen in the past. So now, they got the means to hit back at us, they will. I know a girl who says, if only my husband will give me respect and make me feel that I am not useless and loves me with all his heart, I am willing to stay at home and give up my career. So, MEN before we have to live with FEMINISM because we caused it in some way or another, so now its up to us to clear that mess, show more respect, I believe women will learn to respect you too.<br><br>And women, trust me when I say its your nature to stay at home and look after the family. Not because I look down on women's abilities, they are as good, if not better. But somehow like what I say abt my fren, she is more than willing to stay at home and be a "xiao nu ren" to her husband. Unlike men, who yearns for recognition from many people, a woman needs only respect and recognition from the one she loves. So ladies, continue to seek equality if you must, but dun step on men and put them down, or else this will never end and soon you will become just like men.<br><br>Cheers!!!!</div>

She spent 9 mths giving birth, and since then the rest of her life raising you. That's almost two decades of her life, and you say wat? Your 2 years of life in ns is hard? Get a brain. A new, semi-intelligent brain. Ask your mother how much sacrifices she made for you! Then you decide, you want the 2 years of hardship? Or the two decades, of pain, hardship and heartbreak (seeing as the way you turned out... haiz~)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>B) People who do not believe in FS, have a right to do so. They are intelligent, logical people as well, so there is no need to make it look as though they are not! By showing off what very little knowledge you have, both inside HoFs and now out, you are actually proving that you are a man of little brain capacity... One thing I can tell you is that people who knows a lot, really do not bother showing off, or casually 'name-drop' or in this case, post usless facts and then smirk coz the other have not yet grasp the info. There is no need to. Try eating the humble-pie, it doesn't taste as bad as you think, and you may find that people might finally accept you.<br><br>C)Fs and Wc is very different. And you are right, it was indeed miraculous that whatever ritual you tried worked. If you are just going to follow a book whole-sale, without understanding and adapting it to suit you, and that it actually worked, it's such a pity you didn't get a lottery ticket that day.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
