Anything more than the first chance - forget it. Please note that, giving him this chance is an opportunity for him to prove himself and boy, he has ALOT to prove, since he is the one who ruin this trust in you. If he fails to work harder to prove himself, forget it as well. People must appreciate the chance given BECAUSE ITS<strong> NOT </strong>A RIGHT.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Of course you can chose not to grant him this 'boon'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>

As each and everyone here have a different prospect on this issue and a different mindset already. As what we may do is not necessary a good guide for you. Because every situation and encounter is different by anyone of us. Do think it over carefully and hopefully it will turn out to be good for you be it to forgive or seperate.<br><br>Just dun have any regret for the decision tha you have made.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
