            <div class='col-md body'>e reason is very simple.... most wrestlers start at the very bottom of the roaster n work their way up to gain their title shots n GOldberg even when he wAS in e WCW was groomed as an unstoppable force....he was on a unbeaten streak for e longest time..... he was also like steve Austin in certain ways as he refused to lie down for other wrestlers which means he refuse to fake losing.... thus it made him very unpopular....add that to the fact that e WWE has always been a bitter enemy of WCW n Goldberg was the icon of WCW ....u will know y they hate him so much.....<br><br>Triple H n Golderg go way back...they were attending an event several years back n Goldberg refused to shake Thriple H's hand thus upmtill now....triple H still hates Goldberg's guts.....<br><br>Everyone had to work their way up e ladder n there was a similar case regarding RVD  as he was rising up too fast ...... so they held him back....<br><br>Besides...there are several locker room leaders n if they dun like u...u can be sure u will not get far in e business..... two of those leaders r e undertaker n Thriple H....so need i say more?</div>
