            <div class='col-md body'>I was also involved in the project and felt somewhat cheated too. It was holidays then for me and the pay was really pathetic. I was under andy and later under eugene and ken. Basil paid me only $200 and there were really lots of communication problem there. Hope you guys can get ur full pay back. I cant be bothered to get that few $$$ back....not wrth my time</div>
