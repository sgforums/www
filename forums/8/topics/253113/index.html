            <div class='col-md body'>LONDON - A MAN who spent his life savings after being told he had months to live is seeking compensation after doctors in Britain conceded they had got the diagnosis wrong.<br>Mr John Brandrick, 62, was told two years ago that he had terminal pancreatic cancer.<br><br>He decided to spend his remaining time in style, quitting his job and spending his savings on hotels, restaurants and holidays.<br><br>A year later, doctors at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in south-west England revised their diagnosis: Mr Brandrick was suffering from pancreatitis, a nonfatal ailment.<br><br>'My life has been turned upside down by this,' Mr Brandrick said.<br><br>'I was told certainly, by the doctor, that I had cancer, and from that day I lived life in full. I was told I had limited time to live. I got rid of everything - my car, my clothes, everything,' he said.<br><br>Mr Brandrick said he did not want to take the hospital to court, 'but if they have made the wrong decision they should pay me something back'.<br><br>The hospital said there was 'no clear evidence of negligence' on its part.<br><br>'Whilst we do sympathise with Mr Brandrick's position, clinical review of his case has not revealed that any different diagnosis would have been made at the time based on the same evidence,' a spokesman said. -- AP<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A few years ago, I got a friend in similar position.  Told he got cancer and only had a few years to live.  He took out all his saving and travel round the world.  Came back a very different man.  ( Put on hell lot of weight ).  Then doctor told his misdiagnosed.

After that he spent most of his time travelling whenever he can ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
