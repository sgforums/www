            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore kids in general now are getting weaker and weaker mentally. In the past, kids won't get bothered by an exam paper, even one they have failed.<br><br>From my experiences, children nowadays that are acadamically not so good are mentally stronger than those who are.(because their used to not doing a paper well.) Even those who used to be not so good, but got better now acadamically are stronger mentally. The problem with those children who'd been doing well(like topping in class,top 5 etc.) is that they have worked hard and been smart(natural you can say.) since young and had never experienced failures. Or even if they do, they'd break down and cry that very moment.<br><br>I have a few friends who are like this, smart from young, so called ''genius'' and if ever a paper was set so difficult that even they could not to do it, they'd break down and cry. Even once i had a friend not finishing her paper only, and she cried.<br><br>Parents though, do not see the how failures and setbacks are able to mature a child faster than anything else. Children nowadays in this fast going society have to be able to take setbacks, and not only that but to climb up with an ongoing spirit.<br><br>A burning ongoing spirit to keep going on is all the children need, this is afterall, Youth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
