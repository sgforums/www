Their reactions, including that of the good and gifted ones, were one of despair and discouragement upon encountering problem sums that were set beyond their capabilities. Some even broke down right after the examination.<br>My son is in a top class. Mentally strong and confident in mathematics, he returned shattered boy after the exam.<br>I immediately checked with friends and teachers from other classes and schools, and the same story was heard.<br>Although schools have been equipping pupils with the skills of applying mathematical concepts, many could not complete half or more of the problem sums.<br>Is there a huge gap between expectations and ability? In the mind of a child, he has either failed or done badly. With his confidence ripped by the mathematics paper, how can a child recover in less than 24 hours to face the next paper?<br>Tearing children apart mentally at a developmental stage snuffs out the joy of<br>learning. The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) had previously said Â“the exams were a means to differentiate students of diverse abilities by setting questions of varying difficulty levelsÂ”.<br>It stated that an examination paper should be comparable in difficulty from one year to the next and Â“teachers know how to prepare their students for the examinationsÂ”.<br>SEAB also stated that different teams of experienced setters, moderators and examiners conduct several rounds of checking of each question and for the paper as a whole.<br>The fact different teams are involved is no consolation as it may be a systemic failure from pegging the paper at too high a standard.<br>For some parents and students, education is seen as a source of mental torture. All I ask is this: Please give the children of Singapore the confidence to face their future with a lionÂ’s heart.</span><br><br>Whaddaya think???</div></blockquote>If your son like that my nephew how? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Their reactions, including that of the good and gifted ones, were one of despair and discouragement upon encountering problem sums that were set beyond their capabilities. Some even broke down right after the examination.<br><span style="color: red;">My son is in a top class. Mentally strong and confident in mathematics, he returned shattered boy after the exam.</span>I immediately checked with friends and teachers from other classes and schools, and the same story was heard.<br>Although schools have been equipping pupils with the skills of applying mathematical concepts, many could not complete half or more of the problem sums.<br>Is there a huge gap between expectations and ability? In the mind of a child, he has either failed or done badly. With his confidence ripped by the mathematics paper, how can a child recover in less than 24 hours to face the next paper?<br>Tearing children apart mentally at a developmental stage snuffs out the joy of<br>learning. The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) had previously said Â“the exams were a means to differentiate students of diverse abilities by setting questions of varying difficulty levelsÂ”.<br>It stated that an examination paper should be comparable in difficulty from one year to the next and Â“teachers know how to prepare their students for the examinationsÂ”.<br>SEAB also stated that different teams of experienced setters, moderators and examiners conduct several rounds of checking of each question and for the paper as a whole.<br>The fact different teams are involved is no consolation as it may be a systemic failure from pegging the paper at too high a standard.<br>For some parents and students, education is seen as a source of mental torture. <span style="color: red;">All I ask is this: Please give the children of Singapore the confidence to face their future with a lionÂ’s heart.</span></span><br><br>Whaddaya think???</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>shattered &lt;-----  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>next time go work kena scolded by boss then how?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>this parent also laughable (the last sentence in red)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I dunno how today parents think.  If exams are set to his son's "TOP" standards and he scored A* - so what ?  His son is living in a FALSE SENSE OF ACHIEVEMENTS when life is actually much tougher.  When this son go to working life - haha.... you know what happen.. crying to the father...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me too, my tuition kid have a very damm demanding mum.   Everytime say this is not his best, that is still not his best.  hello? her son has scored 40/45 for just a normal test already.  She is damm demanding, just becoz her son is not the top in the class that the guy got 42.  She even told me i think his results dropped u know... She would even tell me, this section A mcq he shouldnt get wrong one... That section B qn I heard is quite easy but dunno why he cannot answer.  So now she is blamming me lah?<br><br>Dunno what's with these parents these days.  I feel like telling her, Mdm since u think u know so much and ur so smart, why dont u come and do his paper? I think these parents got to know that u cannot always be no. 1 or the best.  Doesnt mean that ur a top in primary or secondary means that u will be forever good.  And most importantly, being good in studies really doesnt mean everything, for u can be a person who is not street smart, and it also need not mean that u will have a bright future.  It just means that ur good at books.  Being a top doesnt say anything about the person's future or personaility.  Thats what i think, pardon my language.  =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think this issue is not just a problem about scoring the PSLE maths, its a big issue we are facing, being parents, teachers, school, MOE and worst of all the students (victims)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>many parents send children for tuitions to ensure they can do well....then exams' standard set even higher (afterall exams can't hv all scoring, its would not be an exam anymore, right?) then school/teachers' responsibilities becomes higher, then students' standard becomes even higher, exams becomes even tougher...it goes on and on.....can't imagine what it would be in another 5 yrs' time.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>i heard one college student telling me everyday studied till 12 to 1 pm.....quite tough (even with tuition for various subjects).........yoz... scary.....<br><br>gone are those days when u go home and throw your bags ...study only when exams round the corner....<br></div>
