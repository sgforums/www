The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) had previously said Â“the exams were a means to differentiate students of diverse abilities by setting questions of varying difficulty levelsÂ”.<br><br>It stated that an examination paper should be comparable in difficulty from one year to the next and Â“teachers know how to prepare their students for the examinationsÂ”.<br><br>The fact different teams are involved is no consolation as it may be a systemic failure from pegging the paper at too high a standard.<br><br>For some parents and students, education is seen as a source of mental torture. All I ask is this: Please give the children of Singapore the confidence to face their future with a lionÂ’s heart.</span>[b] [b]<br>------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Ok...ok.....let's look at some of the above boy's father's quote and put in his expectations and perspective in a different light......hehehehehe.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Father to son on the eve of PSLE exams: "Son, you're in the top class and a top student, know what you must do to uphold this image? (and save my farking face in front of relatives and friends!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> )"<br>Son: "Hmm.....not actually....what must I do??"<br>Father: :Huh, you don't know?? Well.....for starters.....I have spent tons of money to get tutors to torture..ermm.....I mean tutor...you after school, drill into your thick skull....I mean....inbibe in you...all the information and data you need to be a top student and every year successfully put you on a pedestal for all to see how good....you......my son has done in school!"<br>Son: "Hmmmm.............:<br>Father: Stop Hmmmm....and just listen to me you dumbo...I mean...my boy!!. This year is the final year ...the PSLE exams!! I want you, no, I demand you pass this examination.....and I mean ALL the subjects.....with not less than an A*. Do you understand......SON??<br>Son:"Urrrr......"<br>Father:"Now you go and do what I demand you to do and no questions !!! Come back with A* for ALL subjects!!" (I will have a lotta explaining to do and be a laughing stock to my relatives and friends if my dumbo did not get all A* ...after all the boasting that I did ....sigh!).<br>Son:" Urrr.....ok....but dad..."<br>Father: "No buts......my......i mean.......your......future rests in you outperforming all others in the PSLE.....I mean.....do very well in your papers"<br><br>The period after the Maths paper.................<br>Son: " umm....dad.......I screwed up on the Maths paper today......"<br>Father:"YOU WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!"<br>Son:"I screwed up on the Maths paper today....dun think I can get an A* for this Maths paper." (on the verge of bursting into tears...not on boys inability....but on failing to meet dad's A* expectations).<br>Father:"HOW DID YOU SCREW ON ON THE MATHS??????? WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT THICK SKULL OF YOURS????????"<br>Son: "I dunno........I dunnooo....(tears streaming down cheek......for failing to meet daddo's expectations....sigh)<br>Father:"Oh WTF....HOW AM I GOING TO FACE MY RELATIVES AND FRIENDS !!. LOOK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ME!!!!!!!!!<br>Son: (Sobs hysterically)<br>Father:" okok......I know what I must do to save my face......"<br>Son:"Huh......??"<br>Father:" I mean......it's ok son.....it's ok......i can figure out an excuse why you did not perform to MY expectations......dun worry son.....it's not your fault.."<br><br>The next day, daddo wrote a letter to the forum........putting ALL blame to the way the Maths paper is being set.......all blame to the examining board for setting a paper which his son screwed up ......... not to daddo himself for asking the moon from his poor overworked, slave driven son.<br><br>Somemore.....got the cheek to say school should make children enjoy study and exams and set easy questions.......but omitting to the fact how much pressure he himself place onto his poor son.......just so his son can be the top student and the apple of his selfish self esteem   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
