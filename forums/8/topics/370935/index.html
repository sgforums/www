              <p>my wife and i moved from Germany to Singapore since Jan 2009. we are just wondering if any of you have ever encountered bad services from both UOB banking and Credit card service.</p>
              <p>recently i had these problems:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>two months ago, i wrote to UOB Credit card centre asking for the urgent credit card approval due to my 3 weeks trip to USA. my wife (a medical doctor) and I (Manager) are both overqualified for the platinium card. two days upon submission of my application, i received call from the UOB CCC (Credit card centre) saying that the my application has been denied. when i asked why? the caller says she cannot disclose the reason. However, a week later they send me another letter saying that they have overlooked my qualification and asking me to send in additional documents to support my application. well, i did it and now it's been 1 month over, I receive neither call nor credit card from them at all. On the other hand, I have to say that i am very satisfied with America Express, they listen to me carefully and make a special arrangement so that i receive the card within 24Hr. at the end i selected Amex.</p>
              <p>two days ago, my wife and i went to UOB wanted to open safe deposit box. to my surprise, we're required to keep a fixed deposit of S$10,000 in UOB before we could open a safe deposit box account. of all the banks i asked, none of the require us to fixed deposit S$10,000. btw, their safe deposit box is the most expensive among all other banks.</p>
              <p>My wife and I have decided to close our UOB bank account.</p>
              <p>Curious to know about others' opinions.</p>

              <p>my credit cards with UOB were approved pretty eassily and fast. Not sure why you got that. Maybe they had problems verifying your records due to foreign country. Not very good service there.</p>
              <p>Bbut I must say the not revealing of reasons for rejecting appears to be pretty standard. Can't blame them as they may want to avoid people gaming the system.</p>
              <p>No idea about deposit box. Maybe you can try other banks. But I see no reason for you to close the UOB bank account. Just because you don't like one of their products (deposit box) doesn't mean you need to close your other products too. If you're closing the account due to bad service alone, it's a different story.</p>
