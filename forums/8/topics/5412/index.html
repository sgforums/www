            <div class='col-md body'>Well there is actually no use trying to use the Right-click alert to prevent other people from "stealing" the pictures here.

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about you guys. But I feel that it's so lame of people to actually copy your images or your pictures and post them on your site or circulating them around as if it was theirs. I mean it's basic internet ettique ( is this how to spell it? ) not to do that right???<br><br>I think there's no real way to actually protect your images on the Interent unless you use erm... Java??? or CGI =) Maybe that way people can't find out the real address. I wanna try using that way to actually block off my direct addresses to anywhere.<br><br>Anyway person who knows how to create homepages would be able to bypass that right-click alert =)<br><br>Just my two cents<br><br>------------------<br>Yours Sincerely,<br><br>*~RoMeo~*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I was wandering when someone is going to complain abt the copyright issue. Seems that SGgirls have started to offend some orledi.<br><br>Not a good thing (offend your viewers)to do   but i guess the webmaster of this site have their reasons.<br><br>But I think that SGgirls should not stop people for copying the pictures cos it doesn't belong to you(SGgirls) in the 1st place. I wanted to copy one of the photos(the one with the white labrador) as it looked like one of my friend..the gal not the dog. And wanted to forward it to her. Furthermore wat financial benefits do you get from preventing your viewers from downloading the pictures?<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i honestly do not see the whole crux of the argument against the copyrights. what do you want the pics for? to wank off to? to pass ard? IMHO this is prolly the only defense they have against ppl abusing the site and to prevent others frm complaining... afterall wld you allow your pic to be posted on the net if you know tt any loser can dl it and wank off to it daily? or worse, what if he doctors it and you come out looking like some XXX porn star?<br><br>i guess my major query is: why the hell do you want those pics for? for killjoy, i can understand if you want your fren to see the pic to ask if it's her and if she knows abt it, but how abt juz asking her to come to the website and chk it out herself? a lil more inconvenient perhaps but is tt too much to ask? it seems to me tt you guys thk jcgirls are actually depending on you for their survival. true, whether jcgirls cont to exist does depend on their supporters but it is still essentially their site, and they do not have to cater to your every whim and fancy. if you have any suggestions or comments i'm sure chief and madzzie wld be glad to listen to them but in the end, it's still up to them to decide if they wanna take action on it.<br><br>"now my online time will cost more" i dont understand this. do you regularly come to the site to ... erm.... do whatever it is guys do to pix of beautiful gers? which of course differs frm guy to guy........ although the pix are contributed, they're contributed to JCGIRLS, not for your personal pleasure. if the contributor wanted you to have it, he/she wld have sent it to you dearie, not jcgirls. and i believe tt when contributors do send it pix, they do so in the safety of knowing tt chief and madzzie are doing their best to prevent their pix frm being abused or doctored. if it wasnt for this "trust" i dont thk jcgirls wld exist.<br><br>so guys, pls do spare a thought for the ppl who are wking so hard to give you this site... stop being so selfcentred and start thking for the "common gd". not tt i esp enjoy looking at the contributors' segment but.........<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm! actually I think a bulk of the pix are contributed by guys and I noticed a lot of them to be little-known stars from Japan,Hk,Taiwan or even Korea that pple can download from other sites and contribute. I mean, hey, there's even a picture of Speed and Ayumi Hamasaki here but the more the merrier, this is after all a site for viewers to view beautiful girls.<br><br>Good move on the part of Madzzie and Chief to try to prevent the pix from circulating. Although I dun personally know any  of the girls in the pix, I think it is only fair.<br>It is also a measure of safeguarding against more complaints from irked people.<br><br>Licker, if you want to rightclick on pictures of beautiful girls for your pleasures, I suggest you go to porn sites. There will be pictures galore tailored to your fantasies and oh, while you're at it, you may go lick your monitor.<br>It's guys like you who inspire women to call us loony losers.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, alright people...at first I passed this posting up, but now after seeing so many people posting, I think it's time the Firewire posted something on this..<br><br>As far as the copyright pop up screen is concerned, it just tells you that it's a copyrighted material, but if u still want to download it, u can...I have all the pictures in my hardidsk right now....and to the Chief...Don't worry, I won't be using them or posting them on any other sites..including mine....just pure net intiqette.  AS for why I download?  to view it offline what?  It gets very irritating to wait for the pictures to load...it's irritating waiting for any page anywhere to load right?<br><br>AS for the copyright, when people send it to SG Girls, it comes under protection of their site administrator/webmaster, so he does have some kind of responsibility to let people know that he would prefer u not copy the fotos...of course, it isn't going to stop some, but the intention is there and it will save them if anything should arise.<br><br>Pictures on the net do become public property of sorts...When it's on the net, it's well known and accepted that these items become domain of everyone who can see it, but the initial responsibilty is still from the guy who posted it, so he has the right to tell u that if u decide to do anything with the items, he won't be held responsible...but u are because he warned u already... It can poass any lawsuit...as long as there's a warning....just like those porno sites...all they have to do is warn u not to enter if u r below 18 or 21yrs old...because there's porn, and they escape any and most lawsuits....<br><br>God, that's a mouthful!!!:-)<br><br>I have no problems with the Java popup...and it does irritate u not to save it to ur hard disk right...if even a little, then it's served it's purpose...Because even I almost don't want to bother saving them...almost.:-) Sorry Chief.:-)Ur dealing with a determined surfer here..ha ha....and like I said, u have my promise that these pictures won't be circulating around to anywhere... all my pictures posted by me are my own, so I can post those....others cannot.<br><br>So I hope everyone understands the rationale behind it...I know I do, but my own words almost conused me also...almost...:-)</div>
