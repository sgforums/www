              <p>I disagree on the statement that "Science ... also approaches a subject from only one line of thought".</p>
              <p>In fact, Science encourages different lines of thought, otherwise how are the following assumptions corrected?<br>- earth is flat <br>- earth is at the centre of the world <br>- room-temperature water freezes faster than warm water</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What he means is that science does not waste its time with rubbish, useless, illogical speculations and of course he is right. Why would science waste its time on moronic theories that have no good basis? Science is a discpline. Stupidity is just stupidity.</span></p>

              <p>I disagree on the statement that "Science ... also approaches a subject from only one line of thought".</p>
              <p>In fact, Science encourages different lines of thought, otherwise how are the following assumptions corrected?<br>- earth is flat<br>- earth is at the centre of the world<br>- room-temperature water freezes faster than warm water</p>
              <p>Scientists are always questioning and improving science, even for the established theories like Quantum Mechanics and Theory of Relativity. If a scientist can prove that an established theory is wrong, his reputation improves.</p>

              <p><br>Logically that's how it's supposed to work, but scientists are just as prone to politics as much as anyone else. I'm just saying in practice it's a lot more complex and less clear cut when you put humans and their biase into the equation.  </p>
              <p>And to work with reason is to assume you have all the facts and most of the time you don't. You would always have to assume such numbers are indisputable when you don't have the capability to measure them. I mean there are still different camps on whether humans are causing global warming and scientists are still divided on whether we have hit Peak Oil/Population.  </p>
              <p>Again, i do not say that scientific approach is wrong. I'm just stating that it is flawed when you put in the human factor because you would always have to assume certain things as facts. It's not that clear cut as 1+1.  </p>

              <p>Religion(AKA worship of  god/gods) is to me outdated and is impeding human progress rather than improving it. But even in the age of reason and science, we're still going to be prone to making faith based conclusions.</p>

              <p>religion also have their products. Like the cross they wear around their neck to ward off evil/vampire... The holy water which can... i don't know what holy water does.</p>
              <p>Than got the tailsman that you are suppose to burn and drink... and stabbing yourself and walking on fire, which is suppose to be miracles of those who are believers, but was proven to be able to be done by non believers too...</p>
