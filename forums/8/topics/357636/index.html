              <p>Of course you are not expected to believe straight away (though I HAVE heard testimonies of people who accepted Christ immediately after they heard the message/step into the church). What I am asking is for you to be open to the message that was shared during the Good Friday cell meeting.</p>
              <p>If your friend's church was under LoveSingapore, I'm pretty sure you've watched "The Crossing". It was a pretty old film but it sorta brings the message "Christ died for the unbelievers too" across. Certainly, Christianity is more than just a film or a page in the Bible or History book. It's a relationship with God.</p>
              <p>Question: Do you feel a prompting /stirring in your heart when the message was shared or during the worship session?</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">There are two ways to live your life. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Believe in things that are not proven </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Believe only in things that are proven</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">From these two alternatives, you have:</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1a. If you choose one, you can believe any crap like A Magical Pink Unicorn is living among us and takes care of us even though we cannot see it.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"> 2a. To be scientific and logical is difficult.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So most people simply find something to believe in, and live their lives according to some organisation, so that they do not have to try to figure it out for themselves.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">So to put it simply, if you are lazy and stupid, you should just cling on to the beliefs of one of the major established beliefs system (small off-shoots of these can be dangerous) for that will eliminate the need to think intelligently and logically.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">I always tell people, dont, laugh at religious people, they have it easy. It is so much easier to say, Jesus, Buddha, the priest, the pastor said this and so this is what I do. It is so difficult to try to determine the probability of each relevant fact and then logically string them together to find a valid conclusion.</span></span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1a. If you choose one, you can believe any crap like A Magical Pink Unicorn is living among us and takes care of us even though we cannot see it.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">So to put it simply, if you are lazy and stupid, you should just cling on to the beliefs of one of the major established beliefs system (small off-shoots of these can be dangerous) for that will eliminate the need to think intelligently and logically.</span></p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The argument is that people experience god, jesus, holy spirit, evil spirits, lord krishna, lord ganesh and so on and so forth but they do not experience The Pink Unicorn</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why should one claim that their experience is "of god" and then claim that oether people's experience is "of the devil"?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Just because people claim that their experience is "of god", "of the holy spirit" "of the son" "of the father" you believe them???!!!</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Look at Thaipusam. When people go into trance, and claim that god was in them, christians and people not fo their religion will say that the devil was in them or it is just a natural phenomena of mind over the body.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">The key of course is that if someone choose to say that their expriences are "of Jesus" or change his mind and say (the same person with the same experiences) that they are "of Lord Ganesh" nobody can say that they wrong or prove that they are wrong.<br></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">You want to believe things that are not proven or do you want to stick to things that are logically backed up with empirical data?</span></span></p>

              <p><br>Physical rules dominate every aspect of our lives, even evolution. I'm just personally fascinated with the idea of what intelligence you would need to create the world around us. Reverse engineering how the world and life is shaped.</p>

              <p>I don't advocate worshipping any beings to ask for any advantages in life, that's the human trait of establishing control over one another. I certainly don't see why any beings would neccessarily think like humans and regard the universe as we see it.</p>
              <p>There's no proof saying there isn't a god that created the universe and vice versa. Your views aren't exactly any more valid than mine, i don't pretend i know more of the universe than anyone else but if the facts aren't there i'm just going to pursue my line of thought.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">I never say you cannot believe to "ease your irrational fears" and yes religion and beliefs are excellent in easing people's "irrational fears."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Yes I have irrational fears but because they are irrational, they pass. You need to have coping strategies that are reality based to cope with the occasional emotional upheavals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">What is worse and can have long lasting damage is when people make decisions base on illusions, delusions and beliefs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">You need to make decisions base on facts, logic and not let your emotions and beliefs interfere in your decision making.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">That is intellectually difficult and tiring/time consuming and that is why I said, religion is good for lazy and stupid people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">If you cannot cope with your irrational fears and you do not have the intellectual capabilities to reason and find logical solutions to your problems, then I recommend religion to you. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">As a believer you just cling on to some beliefs as "god given truths" and you do not have to find the truth, to make your decisions. If the decision turns out to be wrong, you say "It is god's will" or "It will eventually turn out for the better". </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">No matter how delusional that is, it helps you emotionally to cope! Which is why I tell non believers not to look down on believers because they have found a way to live life, even if it is based on stupidity and laziness, that is simple and elegant.</span></p>
