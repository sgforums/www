              <p>Pardon the tone there.</p>
              <p>It wasn't an attempt to divert and refocus on him personally, the nature of the topic is of one that has no answers, thus the need to do so wasn't there at all.</p>
              <p>It was just a response to the way he was talking like he had the answers, dismissing with a sneer every plausible explanation raised, which was made worse by the absense of a well-constructed argument of his own belief being provided.</p>

              <p>The replies I give r not new. In fact some of the arguments u given is debated before a few years ago in eternal hope. If u felt the things I said is wrong, just rebuked it.

              <p>earlier there was someone who feel tat probably my agressiveness had made the discussion muted. If tat is the case, I can exit the thread and let people continue.

              <p>However now u seems to have a lot of grieviences on the way I reply especially on the fact tat I seemed to ba able to respond to the points u had made. Tat is why I state u r unhappy with the things I said.</p>

              <p>Let me ask u. When u see debate in television shows, do they really pamper the other party, become courteous and add a lot of courtesy wordsÂ and talk in circles hoping the other partyÂ get the hint ? When u see parliament debate in USA, do they become courteous, talk about how well the other person is, the clothes they wear is so nice etc ?</p>
              <p>Tis is not aunt agony</p>
              <p>IÂ am sorry but u should get used to discussions. I did not spurt vulgarities or talk out of point and go personal attacks. I pointed out wat should be said directly. If provingÂ my own stand is being insensitive, then u r really just seeking for self affirmation. U don't want opposing views</p>

              <p>Â  Hello people.</p>
              <p>Â  Hmm, as usual, I ask forgiveness from mebers involved inÂ this thread, so whatever that is stated in the latter is well taken care of.</p>
              <p>Â  Humanity, though within innumerable years have progressed, flourishing the earth with its bloodline, from generation to generation; yet it is in 2009 that we traversed back in Time once again in realization, perhaps: Humanity is off track, from the very reason of its existence.</p>
              <p>Â The birth of Humanity was of a beauty delicate, and the world was made in perfection to its preference. Humanity is bounded in Life as such the presence of it was a mystery in nature and of, a cure; purpose of Life. And thereby the concluding of purpose of Life procuresÂ solution to theÂ mystery of Humanity via revelation of its existence.</p>
              <p>Â  Humanity in cosmology value of humans were shaped in both ways of the unseen and the visible that to which, renders the capability to pseudo-operating of physcial and psychological aspects under every circumstances; as such the sum of Humanity as a whole is that of a pseudo-quality observed, when subbed in to the world, constitutes to the sustaining factor that is to be understood in the explanation of the duality of things in nature. The pseudo-operating of physical and psychological aspects of Humanity vary in hierarchical form in order of chronology with the psychological factors as the onset of the whole formula in like of the first domino that when in collision to the next, contributes to the infinite motion and momentum with Life over Time. (The <em>infinite motion </em>illustrates the philosophy at which in Time the notion of all things set in infinity with <em>Probability </em>at play, and the inability to the halting of the change of things; while the <em>infinite momentum of Life </em>is defined as the unending momentum of Life via the maintained order at which speed is and that is of unalterable.)</p>
              <p>Â  Humanity, as of individuals, and the emphasis of entirety, was not only able to walk the corners of the world, but also stranded between the illusionary of the duality of things; being informed of its state in a world impermanent and at change. The duality of things in nature coerces Humanity in the inability to distinguish true and false; together with the aid of Time, the sole manipulation of the isolation of the universe to be trapped from beyond the boundary: thence the fixation of all things before and after the creation which with the use of word "limit" suggests the connotative stage of definition transcending the grasp of language. Humanity is then, as of individuals or communities subjugated to judgments based on the reference of transitive qualities of Time; place over Time, thoughts over Time. The effects of the erroneous acts of Humanity has yet to come fully, and it will continue to affirm its roots as habit in Humanity whom is fallible. The constant value in mathematical term was to be observed and held dearly, but it has been in obsolete for eon, in denial by Humanity. Apparently, Humanity is attracted to the impermanent attributes of the world just as how the young prefers performances by magicians.</p>
