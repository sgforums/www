So why plasma wasn't mentioned in the book before? Do you think light can be considered a state too? If yes why and if no what would make it a yes. or electric current? What kind of state is a black hole? Plasma?

              Does this confuse you? because it confuses me. And yet o many people are so convinced that there is no God though they are just as confuse as you and me when reading this. <br><br>
              
              <br><br>
              When one is so utterly convinced he could only be so right which is unlikely or so wrong. Keep an open mind.

              <p>If u mean observable as something which cannot be tested out by any means, then u r right. It is like empty talk. If it is not observable, u cannot just come out with any claims u want and say it is right. On wat basis can u say it is right then ? Just because u think it is right, then it pops up and become right ?</p>
              <p>I do not wanna talk too much about tis. It is very simple... u prefer to trust the tangible, observable and verifiable, then do not believe in a religion because most r just philosophy. If u like the intangible and unverifiable but it sounds better and make more sense to u, then u should believe in the religion. Tat is why u need faith in religion.</p>

              <p><br>To me, Science is the study of the all things in the universe through intentional observation both of nature in nature and in man-made condition made to mimick natural phenomenon which the observant wishes to study and find out more so that the knowledge gained from it may be applied for the betterment of fellow man.<br><br>So basically we cannot study what we can't observe, and for things that we can't observe the best thing that we can do is to make or postulate theories which should be verified one way or another by other means applicable for it to be accepted as 'knowledge'<br><br>By this definitionj of science itself there's an inherent weakness that since men cannot observe everything our knowledge is limited to the extent of our observation.<br><br>For example only recently(few decades) that scientist know that atom is not the smallest building blocks of things. There are sub atomic particle inside an atom.<br><br>Thus even for things that we can observe our knowledge is limited to the extent of our observation and since we cannot observe everything our knowledge is impartial and imperfect and most important dynamic.<br><br>So even science is still ever evolving so what is accpeted today maybe proven inadequate tommorow.<br><br>When I was in my school days we were taught the basic element of states: solid material, gasses and liquids.<br><br>All along we knew fire and fire is not one of those shape elements mentioned. . .until a smart person added plasma. So why plasma wasn't mentioned in the book before? Do you think light can be considered a state too? If yes why and if no what would make it a yes. or electric current? What kind of state is a black hole? Plasma?<br><br>Does this confuse you? because it confuses me. And yet o many people are so convinced that there is no God though they are just as confuse as you and me when reading this.<br><br><br><br>When one is so utterly convinced he could only be so right which is unlikely or so wrong.

              <p>A more correct interpretation is that Science states that there is no proof of God. Science did not state that there is no God.</p>
              <p>Let's take alien life forms as an example: <br>- Science studies bizarre issues like aliens. The current stand is that there is no proof that alien exist, but it does not mean that there is no alien. Science is constantly improving, and aliens is a highly possible event, as Science notes that we humans are not some special creations, but merely one of the many possible creations of mother nature.<br>- In contrast, Christians have denied the existence of aliens. I still remember that there were many Christian evangelists going door to door with pamphlets (circa yr 2000) to convince people that extra-solar planets (and therefore aliens) are impossible.<br>- In recent yrs, scientists have been making waves on the observations of many extra-solar planets, but the Christians are strangely quiet on this issue. In fact, I do wonder from time to time how those Christian evangelists are feeling now. Betrayed? Misled?</p>

              <p>Sorry, I will need to go off-topic for a while. My home is not your home and your thoughts are not my thoughts, therefore, my previous post will not make sense to most people.</p>
              <p>However, one point I would like to share with everyone is that:
                      To me, personally, whether a person believes in aliens, ghosts,
                      spirits, God or whatever is not really that important. In my opinion,
                      the most important wisdom/intelligence a human being truly needs, is
                      that each and everyone of us should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understand ourselves extremely well</span>.</p>
              <p>I do not require you to believe in anything or proof anything.</p>
              <p>Just understand yourself, thats all.</p>

              <p>Sorry, I will need to go off-topic for a while. My home is not
              your home and your thoughts are not my thoughts, therefore, my
              previous post will not make sense to most people.</p>
              <p>However, one point I would like to share with everyone is that:
              To me, personally, whether a person believes in aliens, ghosts,
              spirits, God or whatever is not really that important. In my
              opinion, the most important wisdom/intelligence a human being truly
              needs, is that each and everyone of us should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understand ourselves extremely
              well</span>.</p>
              <p>I do not require you to believe in anything or proof
              anything.</p>
              <p>Just understand yourself, thats all.</p>

              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yes and to understand yourself well, you must not go into a delusional mode and imagine weird things about yourself.</span></span></p>

              <p>i hope TS can wake up.</p>
              <p>i'm now researching into the facts and science of who was the first human who officially invented the concept of religions, and also who thought of the idea of God and all those wonderful stories of Jesus etc.</p>
              <p>that person is even more creative than Jin yong (aka Louis Cha, writer of Legend of the Condor Heroes, Heavenly Sword &amp; Dragon Sabre etc)</p>
