              <p>Like others have pointed out, it looks as though you are the one doing the segregating.</p>
              <p>I was a top 5 JC student. And guess what? With the exception of that cousin of mine, everyone else still saw me the same, because they all know I was the same old Fudgie they all knew and loved.</p>
              <p>As for that cousin, well, sucks to her for having your kind of attitude.</p>
              <p>My own wife was a poly student. Are you telling me that I am an arrogant prick who looks down on her?</p>
              <p>If you don't know what a '<em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em>' is, well, you're living one. Y<span style="line-height: 1.231;">ou totally deserve to have people looking down on you. Not because of your educational level, but because of this messed-up attitude of yours.</span></p>

              <p>Nice try, but your words were (I quote you exactly): <strong>'.....<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;">not necessarily jc  is so superior lorh..but ppl in top jcs are for sure damm arrogant'.</span></strong></p>
              <p>If that is not a sweeping statement, then I don't know what is. You only started adding all these caveats after the harsh riposte I sent your way. And even your caveats don't quite cut it, because it still looks as though you are taking the actions of a few black sheep to represent the majority.</p>
              <p>I will agree that there are a few arrogant pricks among JC students, but they also exist everywhere else. As I previously pointed out, there are poly students with exactly the same mindset. That does not cause me or any other JC student here to hate polytechnic students as a whole.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Re-read your posts, especially the one that caused people in here to remark that you are the one doing the segregation.</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> That was seriously smacking of the same outright arrogance that you were accusing JC students of exhibiting.</span></p>
              <p>Until such time that you abandon such an attitude, you totally deserve to be looked down on, and your level of education has nothing to do with it.</p>
              <p>And as the evil talking bus has pointed out, if you hold on to this mindset, you can't expect to do well in your education anyway.</p>
