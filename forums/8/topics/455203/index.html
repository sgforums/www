              <p>I need some help right here. i am a thin guy and wanted to gain mass and hence consulted a
               fitness training website which provides fitness trainers to suit our 
              needs. I was provided with a personal gym trainer and started out with 
              him on 27 april this year. He signed me for a 30 lessons +5 free. Each 
              session is $70/hr. I have paid $2100 in total by two installments of 
              $1050 for 2 x15 sessions. However, 10 weeks have passed and I have gone 
              for 12 lessons only so far. My foremost reason is that I am very 
              intimidated by my trainer, he seems so cold and sighs a lot when I can't
               go ahead with my training. He is not open to questions, and always 
              brushes me off and tells me to follow his "advice" perse. Secondly, I am
               working and I find myself having to accomodate his timeslots -  he 
              trains me at his private gym at his condominium. He gives me odd timings
               which i find a hassle as I have to rush to my workplace. Thirdly, I 
              find that he always changes the program. I find myself paying the money 
              and obliging him as well. I have decided to quit at the 15th lesson. I 
              have not spoken to him anything about this. However, I would like to 
              find out how i could go about getting my refund for 15 lessons. I have 
              the receipts that were issued as proof of payment. I did not sign any 
              contract with him. I contacted the owner of the website, who's a gym 
              trainer himself, and spoke to him privately. He said that they're just 
              functioning as an agency which recommends trainers to clients. He said I
               can negotiate with my gym trainer regarding this issue. I do not want 
              to oblige the trainer anymore. I think it's a lesson learnt, i've 
              decided to hit the gym on my own as i learnt it's a matter of 
              discipline. i m sure he'll try to secure me so that he does not lose his
               money OR say he's binded by agency, but i've already sorted this out 
              with the agency. How do i handle the gym trainer on the issue of refund?
               I am worried i will be cheated.Really appreciate your help</p>

              <p>Put on a nice dress with lipstick and talk to him nicely make sure you find out what hair colour girls he like so you can dye your wig.......</p>
              <p>Just tell him you want to stop the lessons la then ask him about refund.......tell him you want to forfit the 1st 15 lesson de payment, sounds fair since u go for 12 lessons liao remaining 3 you forfit.</p>
              <p>That way he cant make excuse about rejecting other clients and loss of income etc etc because of you..</p>
              <p>Then the remaining 15 lessons you ask for the refund la...</p>
              <p>If he ask why just say you are going overseas for some job la or you just simply tell him what you feel about him...who knows out of desperation he might change his attitude..</p>
