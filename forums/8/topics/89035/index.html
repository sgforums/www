            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>RELATIONSHIPS</strong>: First, a man does not call a relationship a relationship - he refers to it as "that time when me and Suzie were boinking on a semi-regular basis."<br><br>When a relationship ends, a woman will cry and pour her heart out to her girlfriends, and she will write a poem titled "All Men Are Idiots." Then she will get on with her life.<br><br>A man has a little more trouble letting go. Six months after the breakup at 3 am early on a Sunday morning - he will call and say "I just wanted to let you know you ruined my life, and I'll never forgive you, and I hate you, and you're a total floozy. But I want you to know there's always a chance for us." This is known as the "I Hate You/I Love You" drunken phone call, that 99% of all men have made at least once. There are community colleges that offer courses to help men get over this need; alas these classes rarely prove effective.<br><br><strong>SEX</strong>: Women prefer 30-45 minutes of foreplay.<br><br>Men prefer 30-45 seconds of foreplay. Men consider driving back to her place as part of the foreplay.<br><br><strong>MATURITY</strong>: Women mature much faster than men. Most 17-year-old females can function as adults.<br><br>Most 17-year-old males are still trading baseball cards and giving each other wedgies after gym class. This is why high school romances rarely work out.<br><br><strong>COMEDY</strong>: Let's say a small group of men and women are in a room, watching tele- vision, and an episode of "The Three Stooges" comes on. Immediately, the men will get very excited - they will laugh uproariously, and even try to imitate the actions of Curly, man's favorite Stooge.<br><br>The women will roll their eys, groan, and wait it out.<br><br><strong>HANDWRITING</strong>: To their credit, men do not decorate their penmanship. They just chicken-scratch.<br><br>Women use scented, colored stationery and they dot their "i's" with circles and hearts. Women use ridiculously large loops in their "p's" and "g's." It is a royal pain to read a note from a woman. Even when she's dumping you, she'll put a smiley face at the end of the note.<br><br><strong>BATHROOMS</strong>: A man has at most seven items in his bathroom - a toothbrush, toothpaste, shaving cream, razor, shampoo, a bar of soap, and a towel from the Holiday Inn.<br><br>The average number of items in a typical woman's bathroom is 437. A man would not be able to identify most of these items.<br><br><strong>MAGAZINES</strong>: Men's magazines often feature pictures of naked women.<br><br>Women's magazines also feature pictures of naked women. This is because the female body is a beautiful work of art, while the male body is hairy and lumpy and should not be seen by the light of day.<br><br><strong>GROCERIES</strong>: A woman makes a list of things she needs and then goes to the store and buys these things.<br><br>A man waits until the only items left in his fridge are half of a lemon, and something turning green. Then he goes grocery shopping. He buys everything that looks good. By the time he reaches the checkout counter, his cart is packed tighter than the Clampett's car on The Beverley Hillbillies. Of course, this will not stop him from going to the 10-items-or-less lane.<br><br><strong>GOING OUT</strong>: When a man says he's ready to go out, it means he's ready to go out.<br><br>When a woman says she's ready to go out, it means that she WILL be ready to go out, as soon as she finds her other earring, finishes putting on her makeup...<br><br><strong>SHOES</strong>: When preparing for work, a woman will put on a Mondi wool suit, and then slip into Reebok sneakers. She will carry her dress shoes in a plastic bag from Saks. When she arrives at work, she will put on her dress shoes. Five minutes later, she will kick them off because her feet are under her desk.<br><br>A man wears one pair of shoes for the entire day.<br><br><strong>CATS</strong>: Women love cats.<br><br>Men say they love cats, but when women aren't looking, men kick cats.<br><br><span class="small"><span style="font-style: italic;">(more to come.  stay right there and we'll be right back)</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>MIRRORS</strong>: Men are vain; they will check themselves out in the mirror.<br><br>Women are ridiculous; they will check out their reflections in any shiny surface - mirrors, spoons, store windows, toasters, Joe Garagiola's head...<br><br><strong>GARAGES</strong>: Women use garages to park their cars and to store their lawnmowers.<br><br>Men use garages for many things. They hang license plates in garages, they watch TV in garages, and they build useless wooden things in garages.<br><br><strong>MOVIES</strong>: For women, their favorite movie scene is when Clark Gable kisses Vivien Leigh for the first time in "Gone With The Wind."<br><br>For men, it's when Jimmy Cagney shoves a grapefruit in Mae Clark's face in "Public Enemy."<br><br><strong>JEWELRY</strong>: Women look nice when they wear jewelry.<br><br>A man can get away with wearing one ring, and that's it. Any more than that, and he will look like a lounge singer named Vic.<br><br><strong>MENOPAUSE</strong>: When a woman reaches menopause, she goes through a variety of complicated emotional, psychological, and biological changes. The nature and degree of the changes varies with the individual.<br><br>Menopause in a man provokes a uniform reaction. He buys aviator glasses, a snazzy French cap, leather driving gloves, and goes shopping for an expensive foreign sports car.<br><br><strong>THE TELEPHONE</strong>: Men see the telephone as a communications tool. They use the telephone to send short messages to other people.<br><br>A woman can visit her girlfriend for two weeks, and upon returning home, she will call the same friend and they will talk for three hours.<br><br><strong>LOW BLOWS</strong>: Let's say a man and a woman are watching a boxing match on television, and one of the fighters is felled by a low blow.<br><br>The woman says, "Oh, gee, that must hurt."<br><br>The man doubles over and actually feels the pain.<br><br><strong>DIRECTIONS</strong>: If a woman is out driving and she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings, she will stop at a gas station and ask for directions.<br><br>Men consider this to be a sign of weakness. A man will never stop and ask for directions. Men will drive in a circle for hours, all the while saying things like, "Looks like I've found a new way to get there," and, "I know I'm in the neighborhood. I recognize that White Hen store."<br><br><strong>ADMITTING MISTAKES</strong>: Women will sometimes admit making a mistake.<br><br>The last man who admitted that he was wrong was General George Custer.<br><br><strong>RICHARD GERE</strong>: Women like Richard Gere because he is sexy in a dangerous way.<br><br>Men hate Richard Gere because he reminds them of that slick guy who works out at the health club and dates only married women.<br><br><strong>DRESSING UP</strong>: A woman will dress up to go shopping, water the plants, empty the garbage, answer the phone, read a book, get the mail...<br><br>A man will dress up for: weddings and funerals.<br><br><strong>NUDITY IN MOVIES</strong>: Every actress in the history of movies has had to do a nude scene. This is because every movie in the history of movies has been produced by men.<br><br>The only actor who has ever appeard nude in the movies is Richard Gere. This is another reason why men hate him.<br><br><strong>DAVID LETTERMAN</strong>: Men think David Letterman is the funniest man on the face of the earth.<br><br>Women think he is a mean, semi-dorky guy who always has a bad haircut.<br><br><strong>CAMERAS</strong>: Men take photography very seriously. They'll shell out $4000 for state- of-the-art equipment, and build darkrooms, and take photography classes.<br><br>Women purchase Kodak Insta-matics, and often produce better-looking shots.<br><br><strong>POLITICS</strong>: Men love to talk about politics, but they often forget to do political things such as voting.<br><br>Women are very happy that another generation of Kennedys are growing up and getting into politics, because they will be able to campaign for them and cry on election night.<br><br><strong>LOCKER ROOMS</strong>: In the locker room, men talk about three things: money, football, and women. They exaggerate about money, they don't know football nearly as well as they think they do, and they fabricate stories about women.<br><br>Women talk about one thing in the locker room - sex. Not in abstract terms, either. They're graphic and technical, and they *never* lie.<br><br><strong>LAUNDRY</strong>: Women do laundry every couple of days.<br><br>A man will wear every article of clothing he owns, including his surgical pants that were hip about eight years ago, before he will do his laundry. When he is finally out of clothes, he will wear a dirty sweatshirt inside out, rent a U-Haul and take his mountain of clothes to the laundromat, and expect to meet a beautiful woman while he is there.<br><br><strong>WEDDINGS</strong>: When reminiscing about weddings, women talk about the "ceremony."<br><br>Men talk about "the bachelor party."<br><br><strong><br>GYM SOCKS</strong>: Men wear sensible socks. They wear standard white sweatsocks.<br><br>Women wear strange socks. They are cut way below the ankles, have pictures of clouds on them, and have a big fuzzy ball on the back.<br><br><strong>TOYS</strong>: Little girls love to play with toys. Then, when they reach the age of 11 or 12, they lose interest.<br><br>Men never grow out of their obsession with toys. As they get older, their toys simply become more expensive and impractical. Examples of mens toys: miniature TV's, car phones, complicated juicers and blenders, graphic equalizers, small robots that serve cocktails on command, video games, and anything that blinks, beeps and requires at least six "D" batteries to operate.<br><br><strong>PLANTS</strong>: A woman will ask a man to water her plants while she is on vacation.<br>The man will water the plants.<br>The woman returns five days later, to an apartment full of dead plants.<br>No one knows why this happens.<br><br><strong>NICKNAMES</strong>: With the exception of female body-builders, who call each other names like "Ultimate Pecs" and "Big Turk," women eschew the use of nicknames. If Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle get together for lunch, they will call each other Gloria, Suzanne, Deborah and Michelle.<br><br>But if Mike, Dave, and Jack go out for a brewski, they will affectionately refer to each other as Peckerhead, Scumbag, and Louse.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Wedding shoes </strong><br><br>On the day of her wedding, Kathy was getting dressed, surrounded by all her family, and she suddenly realized she had forgotten to bring her wedding shoes. Panic.<br><br>Then, her sister remembered that she had a pair of white shoes from her wedding before, so she lent them to Kathy for the day.<br><br>Unfortunately, they were a bit too small. By the time the festivities were over, Kathy's feet were in agony.<br><br>When she and bridegroom, Anthony, withdrew to their room, the only thing she could think of was getting her shoes off.<br><br>The rest of the family crowded around the door to the bedroom, and they heard roughly what they expected -- grunts, straining noises, and an occasional muffled scream.<br><br>Eventually, they heard Anthony say, "Goodness, that was tight!"<br><br>"There," whispered Kathy's mother. "I told you she was a virgin!"<br><br>Then, to their surprise, they heard Anthony say, "Now for the other one."<br><br>This was followed by more grunting and straining, and at last, Anthony said, "Goodness, that was even tighter!"<br><br>"That's my boy," said Anthony's father. "Once a sailor, always a sailor."<br></div>
