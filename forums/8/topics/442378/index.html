              <p>It's like asking why Sgforums is dead...? Why are there more visitors to EDMW forum or Asia1 forum ? Why are there more visitors to several other forums ?</p>
              <p>It's like asking why more people use Facebook but not many use MySpace ?</p>
              <p>I believe in order to understand the real reason, you must investigate further and deeper. Maybe you can study the other blogshops which are popular and making money.</p>

              <p>Thanks for posting the link. I shall offer my professional 2 cents worth to help improve the bottom line of the sales. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>I have went to this blog few months ago and it had created a big lasting impression such that I still remember now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Site-layout</strong></p>
              <p>The site layout is grossly under industrial standards, that's why your friend aren't getting enough traffic to the site and was not able to retain potential customers.</p>
              <p>1. It lack of a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">bottom</span></strong> navigation bar which includes the (T&amp;C, Privacy Policy, About us, Contact details</p>
              <p>2. The site is pretty much unsafe for e-commerce due to the fact that it didn't have SSL in the login page and carts. A good investment is to beef up the security and add some SSL to the important pages like</p>
              <p>a. login page<br>b. cart page<br>c. payment page</p>
              <p>3. Lack of a theme. Any website without a theme is sure to meet it's doom. Personally, I have worked with website designers and programmers to create awesome blog/website. Their portfolio can be found at <a href="http://themeforest.net/">themeforest.net</a> and I purchase the high quality website design there on a weekly basis. I suggest choosing a color as a set theme.</p>
              <p>4. Your friend's blogshop have enough products to start with already. One of the main reason why you aren't getting customers back is because of the photography pictures. The photo reflects poor photography skills that violate almost all photograph techniques. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"> My suggestion is to use paid-photographer services. They charge at a reasonable price, but trust me, the photoquality is definitely much attractive than that.</p>
              <p>5. Does not reflect the scale. Apparantly, this blogshop have an actual shop at bugis. The feeling of this blog give me the impression that it's done out of hobby and not business oriented. There are pretty much more that I can comment, but there are the few points that you can highlight to your friends.</p>
              <p>Read point no.3. Change the whole website, and customers will come back</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In summery, the whole website is a failure. <a href="/users/270233">éŸ©é£žå®˜</a>, since I know you, if your friend hire me to be the website designer and programmer for $1500 for 90 days, I guarantee sales will come in.</p>
              <p>Best regards,<br>Chin Seng</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*copy and past this to your friend* this will get delete tomorrow by an old lady.</p>

              <p>I am a tutor for 8 years teaching secondary school kids, offer academic advices to parents, students, company, and recently  I acquired programming knowledge.

              <p><br>for heaven's sake, if you are the moller, i probably will not give the blogshop owner the photos i took in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>by the way for your knowledge about potray photography, the very important aspect is the subject, if client wants a full shot with face. otherwise if client only want bofy shot the figure and build of the subject is very important. secondary is the phtoogrpaher's skills.</p>
              <p>cost if the photo sucks, althe client can do to reverse the situation is to get the raw or original unedited full resolution jpeg files, get another better person to edit it and done <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Well, for the latest update from the above multiple income streams which my friend recommend above to me and in this forum and try himself, it seem to be an scam, as my friend whom did not agreed to use their service for his internet business website, he later found that he had an "unauthorized" deducted from his bank account 's transaction which he previously key in his Visa card number for the multiple income website to check what big bucks is installed for him for killing : <a href="http://onlinecareerpackage.com/">http://onlinecareerpackage.com/</a> , the details of his transaction are : "Misc Dr - Ve/Vd cbhostfee.com" and most certainly all the so-call multiple income website systems appear in the whole world 's internet is under the same company : <a href="http://cbhostfee.com/">http://cbhostfee.com/</a> (Luckily I never try this "suspicious" scheme and he is also nice to share his experience with us so as to avoid us being "conned")</p>
              <p>The moral of the lesson, there is no such thing as easy money from Internet,Writing Blog, MLM, Any cheap sales in the street like "I am not selling you anything and I am doing this charity ... " that can be wonderfully earned (maybe the so-call testimonial in the money scheme website is also fake ! ).And do not believe in all these "high reward" scam. Working 8 am to 5 pm is the only most secure source of income and that is the ABSOLUTE TRUTH !</p>
              <p>Finally below are the statement from uwccorp/universal web consulting corp which my friend previously signed up and is posted here for all fellow Singaporeans references :</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br><strong>Search Engines</strong></p>
              <p>Just about all online shoppers use Search Engines to find products and services that interest them. Search Engines "crawl" the Internet regularly and add information to their database about websites. Search Engines analyze the text contained in websites to determine what information, products or services are offered by each individual website. Search Engines will then store that information in their database. And when an Internet user enters words or phrases into a search bar, websites that appear to be relevant to those words are displayed in the search results.</p>
              <p>Make your website "Search Engine friendly"! Try adding words to the text on the pages of your website that you feel people are likely to search for. If you’re selling auto parts, include the words "auto parts" in several places in your website’s text along with the names of several specific items that are available on your site. Make sure you watch the "Back Office Quick and Easy Video Tour" on the home page of your back office to see how easy it is to add Search Engine friendly text to your website!</p>
              <p><strong>Attracting Visitors to your website</strong></p>
              <p>Use the suggestions outlined above to help Search Engines understand more about the products you’re selling on your website. In addition, insure that your website achieves the highest rank possible in the search results. How do you do that? Simple; Add text as suggested above and you’ll be helping your website appear relevant to specific search methods and techniques that the Search Engines use to drive visitors to your website. This will improve the popularity of your website, which in turn will have an impact on where your website appears in search results.</p>
              <p>Once you’ve determined what types of products you want to focus upon, perform a quick search for "forums" or "discussion groups" on the topic. Sign up for a few of these and get involved. Look for forums and discussion groups that will allow you to use your website’s name either in the content or even just with your signature. Links from sites like this that lead back to your website will also increase your website’s "popularity" ranking with Search Engines. Our Business Development Consultants can tell you more about this technique as well.</p>
              <p>There are many other ways you can promote your website both online and off line, too. Here are just a few things you can experiment with:</p>
              <p>    * Search Engine Optimization<br>    * Banner exchange programs<br>    * Free-For-All Sites<br>    * Online Classified-Ads - Many sites offer free classified ads<br>    * Chat Rooms and Message Boards<br>    * Newspaper Advertising<br>    * Flyers<br>    * Internet Traffic</p>
