            <div class='col-md body'><strong>17 Warning Signs of a Lousy Girlfriend<br><br>You know the girl you're thinking about marrying is wrong for you if she has no friends, your siblings don't like her, and her credit history doesn't check out. Sometimes the best words of wisdom don't come from academics or scientists with impressive titles and educational credentials. Sometimes the best advice comes from people who have been there and done that. Such is the case with a recent letter published in the syndicated Dear Abby advice column that listed 17 signs that your girlfriend is NOT the one you should marry.<br><br>A married man who said his wife now wanted a divorce passed along tips for the not-yet-married. If you see these red flags, he advises, dump the girl:<br><br>1. If your parents or siblings have doubts about her, pay attention. Listen and check it out.<br><br>2. If your intended has nothing good to say about her ex, beware. This is a pattern. Divorce is rarely only one person's fault.<br><br>3. If her children have nothing to do with her, do not believe her if she says her ex brainwashed them against her. My stepchildren have told me it was because they hated her, and they have good reasons.<br><br>4. Look closely at her credit and job history. They are sure predictors of what your life will be like.<br><br>5. If she's over 30 and has no money, do not let her move in with you, and don't marry her until she's financially solvent. If she has any respect for you (and herself), she'll insist on it.<br><br>6. Be sure in your heart that you can live with her AS IS. You cannot change another person.<br><br>7. This is a biggie: Beware if she has no friends. It is not true that they all chose to side with her ex.<br><br>8. If your friends dislike her, pay attention. This is also true if she hates your friends.<br><br>9.If she has more than one beer and still drinks, run!<br><br>10. If she is one personality at work or with others, and another person alone with you, run.<br><br>11. If she has nothing to do with her parents, investigate why. Don't take her word for it.<br><br>12. If she's an expert at everything and brags a lot, understand that she will turn off a lot of people, eventually maybe even you.<br><br>13. If she has sexual problems, go with her to a doctor before you marry her. Believe me, her problem will become your problem.<br><br>14. If she is emotionally or verbally abusive, it will only get worse. Yelling, name-calling and glowering are classic signs of an abuser.<br><br>15. If she is never wrong and never apologizes, everything will be "your fault" forever. And after years of hearing it, you may even start to accept the blame.<br><br>16. If she does something wrong and says, "That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't ( )," that's another sign of an abuser.<br><br>17. And if she's mean to children, pets or animals, recognize that she's pathological, and the next victim could be you.<br><br>.....................................</strong></div>

He has to learn to deal with it... as outsider.... one can never understand and no one can help. Sometimes helping backfires. You can drop hints but don't get involved. Its advice for your personal sanity and future as a sibling together.<br><br>For all the points. I see it in both my ex- Sis-in-law and my own brother.<br>they did not last .... 1 week of marriage, she want divorce.<br><br>I am already not for marriage... and as I go along .... I feel even more doubtful of marriage. Worse is that me feelings are dying or died and every hurt he's done, goes deep .... its hard to go on...and I don't feel reciprocal even though i try to inject whatever's left in me into the relationship... and I grow empty and tried. I feel like the dog he owns.... when he was interested, he took care of it... when he lost interest ... said... I should be happy he makes effort to be around ...  anyways, there's just too much hurt ... and things keep coming back that I should go back to where I began.<br><br></div>
