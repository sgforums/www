              <p>For me, I don't care about trends and what's hip, what's cool,
              what's in, what out. I'm not a crowd follower. I don't care about
              what other people think or label me.</p>
              <p>If something is good, I will continue to use it and see no
              reason to change it.</p>
              <p>Example: Been using Yahoo mail all my life and never intend to
              change. The new Yahoo mail can store 6,000 years of email and it's
              free and easy to use. That's great enough for me.</p>
              <p>Btw, Singapore's younger generation (born after in/after year
              2000) is only like what 0.0001% of the world's population. Alot of
              old fogeys (born before year 2000) around the ENTIRE world are
              still using email and even Yahoo mail.</p>
              <p>Nobody around  the world is going to care about Singapore's
              younger generation's trends. A few years later, the current younger
              generation is growing old and becoming old fogeys too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>I have had Hotmail for quite long, but rarely use it... Gmail also (since Google suddenly made Youtube and Blogger go together with it), but not much... You might say I'm also not a trend follower either. Even though my Nokia 208 is actually only a few months old, it is a keypad phone, so I don't use a touchscreen phone.</p>
              <p>I try not to use my phone a lot in public, because everywhere I go, I see people (both youngsters and even adults) using touchscreen smartphones with apps on them... I do have Twitter and Facebook on my phone, but I never use them as I always use my home computer to surf the internet, unlike people who do both (mostly mobile)... It's just a waste of my SIM card money for me to use them, when the internet at home is free.</p>
              <p>When it comes to music, I'm also like this. I don't follow the modern songs they love to listen and make parodies of (trends), while I listen to mixed songs (old and new alike), not caring the trend they make with those songs... I think I have been pampered with too much old stuff in my childhood, that's why I still use a keypad phone and often listen to old music.</p>

              <p>You don't have to be self-conscious. Using a nokia phone in public is not illegal. Not only I used nokia phone in public, I even took out my notebook and pen every so often when needed to write down things that came to my mind in case I forget. In this high technology era, there are still people like me using hard-copy notebook and pen, holding hard copy book to read.</p>
              <p>But I find there is absolutely nothing wrong. I'm being myself, I don't care about what latest galaxy ipad or tablet iphone there is selling now. Those people freely spend money when they've got it but sunny days don't last forever and there will be a rainy day when they will need all the cash they can find and then they will regret DEEPLY how much needless money they've wasted on smartphone ipad galaxy universe and expensive data plans.</p>
              <p>Adopt this mentality: Don't talk to me about smartphones and data plants and fashion unless I'm a billionaire. We're all peasants, low-nett worth people, spend so much money on latest technology for what? Can use can already.</p>

              <p>I'm quite like you. I don't have a data plan and do use a notebook to take things down, instead of my phone. BTW, your Nokia is a keypad phone, I guess? Somehow, I'm just not interested in latest smartphones and don't like it when I see people getting the same smartphones and using them in public. I feel that this is not how we people should be viewed as, people who likes phones and apps and so on... I'm not in the pack.</p>
