              <p>Don't waste money on data plans, fancy smartphones, apps and games. Don't give in to peer pressure, when you leave the company, you'll lose all your friends.

              get there before you step out of the house, very useful website,
              even got bus routes when you click on bus stop.</p>
              <p>Don't waste money on data plans, fancy smartphones, apps and
              games. Don't give in to peer pressure, when you leave the company,
              you'll lose all your friends. One day, when you're in serious need
              of money (eg; retrenched suddenly), you will regret all those money
              spent on data plans and smartphones. It's actually alot of
              money;</p>
              <p>2-yr data plan, $58 each of the 24 mths = total $1,392<br> plus, $200+ for the smartphone = total <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>$1,592</strong></span></p>

              <p>You don't need whatsapp, you only need a basic nokiaphone with prepaid to call, receive
              calls, send &amp; receive SMS. A $10 prepaid card should last you 2-3 months.</p>

              <p>Last time, only my sister (iPhone) and brother (Motorola) used Whatsapp... Then a few weeks ago, we upgraded on data plans and my dad and brother's phones changed to Sony Xperia phones, with my mother taking my brother's phone which has Whatsapp... Being the only person wtihout Whatsapp left in my family, I am being pushed to install it, but I refuse. Should I or not install Whatsapp?</p>

              <p>Personally, I think sms is better... Even though it is about 5 cents for a sms, I know that I am paying for privacy, which Whatsapp does not have. Whatsapp has the 'Last Seen' feature, which can cause people to find out private personal info of the person you are messaging (e.g what time one sleeps or is awake)...</p>

              <p>Tell your parents, 24 mths x $___  is alot of money.</p>
              <p>$10 prepaid can use for 2-3 months if you're disciplined enough to use it for important/urgent matters. Those "what's up", "how r u doing" chit-chat messages are redundant. Reserve chit-chat for email.</p>
