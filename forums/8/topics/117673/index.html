            <div class='col-md body'>It all started when someone wanted some particular seat on the SBS bus to be in green colour. That is the basis of the tale I'm about to tell.<br><br>There was this old lady who was arguing with another girl, supposedly a NTU student over a seat. Not just a seat. It's a green seat. The seat that was meant to be given up to elder people.<br><br>I don't know how it started, but the ramblings went on from how people who can't give up seats can be university students to how the parents didn't teach the girl to behave to how she was too young to be even her grand daughter to threats on going to the police station.<br><br>It's just a seat. Some people really take it too seriously.<br><br>As if it's against the law not to give up the seat.<br><br>Well, after her tirade, not surprisely, she received a fair part of scolding from the passengers on board. Note that this bus prowls the route inside NTU and most of the passengers are students.<br><br>Some part of me wanted to ask the lady," Are you any happier now?".<br><br>But I decided against it. It would be a waste of my effort.</div>
