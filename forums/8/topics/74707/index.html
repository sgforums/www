            <div class='col-md body'>With all the talk about stressful education system, high cost of living, unemployment, unequal opportunities (lee family and non-lee family), more suicide cases, more personal vendetta...LKY vs Ryan Goh etc....My advice is to at least get a PR from a country that is less stressful. What do you guys think. I have even considered getting a malaysian PR if the buniputra law is abolished. If I take out all my CPF when I retire and sell my home, with the exchange rate of 2.24 to ringggit, i can be a millionaire in Malaysia and not worry abt high cost. Singapore really pushes its citizens away. Another way is to wait and see what happens when LKY kicks the bucket. Whatever it is. Better get that extra PR in hand for emergency use. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think one reason why ppl are running away is not just becos we are loosers or quiters. I think PM Goh is mad to say that without finding the root of the problem. He speaks as if we never saw life in other countries where things are much more stress free and peaceful. Singaporeans are now second class citizen in our very own country, most expatriates get the better deal. We get the raw deal. If Singapore is so good, why didnt Ryan Goh accept citizenship after working for SIA for more than 20 years and held Sg PR since 1980??? Unless.....he is not sure right?? why not sure then?? he is making good money as a pilot, isnt he? think abt it.</div>
