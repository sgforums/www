You have great respect for traditions and will not take up anything which is not in line with your basic beliefs. It may appear at times, as if you are scared of the possibility of falling in love. The idea of love and romance do not agree with your concept of a well organized and systematic universe. Even on rare occasions, when you want to take the initiative, you fail to express or demonstrate all what you feel and want to communicate. Generally, you are a conservative person and prefer to adopt the middle of the road approach. You have to be a bit more adventurous to conquer the girl you love. Once a word of promise is given, you will never change your mind. Moreover, you will do anything for the girl whom you trust. You generally appear neat and punctual. It should be remembered by your lover that you are not at all impressed by flowery and honey tongued words. On the other hand, you may be generally considered unapproachable, inflexible and narrow minded with fixed views, by the girls who are not close to you. This may not be to your advantage anyway. Being a Buffalo man in love, your compatibility with your Rooster girl friend is 80%. You will be attracted by the lively and positive Rooster girl. She will be a good asset to you.

But the mutual interest may not last for long, unless both of you want to be so for ever. She may be interested in deriving pleasure in her own style and fashion, rather than trying to meet your emotional needs. Moreover, she is lavish in criticism. You are also equally good at it. This could be a stumbling block in improving your compatibility rating further.<br><br>Both of you are conservatives and old fashioned, giving great importance for traditional values. She is proud of her fine features and feels confident that she is attractive. Further, she will narrate her adventures and accomplishments more often than necessary. You may get irritated at this. She is very talkative, where as, you are a man of few words. Rooster girl is egoistic and imposing a personality. She wants you to give her constant reassurances about her worth. She is not all that sure of herself, as she pretends outside. Both of you are good critics. Perhaps, you can sit around for long hours making analytical comments about your common friends and the by standers.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
