            <div class='col-md body'>http://www.keralanext.com/news/?id=382067<br><br>BY Nasreen Mohammed<br>SINGAPORE : There are few superstars who can sell S$500 concert tickets in Singapore at a snap. Indian composer AR Rahman one such star.<br><br>He is the musical brains behind such varied hits as the West End's "Bombay Dreams," Hong Kong's "Warriors of Heaven and Earth," and Bollywood's Oscar-nominated film "Lagaan". Singapore, the first city Mr Rahman says he visited outside India 20 years ago and which he says is special, is also the only Asian stop on his 3rd Dimension World Tour, which kicked off in London.<br><br>From the stirring national anthem that rocked the country in the mid-90s, "Vande Materam," Mr Rahman has gone on to constantly re-invent himself and create music that defies pigeon-holing. "I can't define my music -- a lot of other people define it," he told Channel NewsAsia.<br><br>His work, though, kick-started a trendy and international sound that incorporated mixed influences into Indian film music, which had been languishing under tried-and-tested methods. Said Mr Rahman, "When I started doing music 15 years back and composing, I thought Indian music was on a shelf and it has so much potential to break barriers and get exposed all over the world. One of my intentions was to package it in such a way so people could relate to it -- there's reggae, hip hop, world music and African music."<br><br>And it doesn't stop there. He is now working on the music for the stage version of "Lord of the Rings" in Canada, which will premiere in March next year.<br><br>The maestro, who usually works through the night, pays a price though for his inventiveness. He said, "The problem is, once you do something and then there are like 10 people getting influenced by it and then if I do it again, people get upset. In a way, I could never do the same thing again."</div>

The star-studded line up included Hariharan, Udit Narayan, Chitra, Sadhna Sargam, Madhushree, Kathik, Rajesh "Blaaze" Raman and Kailash Kher.<br><br>Songs such as Chaiyya chaiyya, Dil se, Mitwa, Taal se taal mila, Saathiya and Humma humma had the crowd dancing along, while Tamil audiences were enthralled by Thithi ke rain, Valihari and Blaaze's punchy rap rendition of the title song of the hit movie Baba.<br><br>Excellent pyrotechnics and thematic stage props made the concert a visual treat, too.<br><br>Special mention must be made of percussionist extraordinaire Sivamani.<br><br>In an improvised version of the song Konjum yerrupu, he let loose a 15-minute-long drum solo that whipped the crowd into a frenzy.<br><br>Along with Bosnian singer Alma, Rahman also performed a much-appreciated number he composed for director Ping He's Warriors of Heaven and Earth.<br><br>The best was saved for last, though. All the performers joined Rahman to croon the patriotic Maa tujhe salaam that brought the entire stadium to its feet.<br><br>No one could possibly have left without getting goose bumps.<br><br>All hail the maestro. - TODAY /dt</div>
