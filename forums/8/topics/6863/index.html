            <div class='col-md body'>Ignore the 2 of them, they are just bickering. And as for your scenerio posted, I think A is definitely not childish but seems a little obessessed with B. Since B already has a girlfriend (who knows that A has a liking for B), why keep contacting her (I assume the frequency is quite high) and risk A's friendship with C and B's relationship with C.<br><br>But of course, whether it is right or wrong for A to do so is definitely not for us to decide or comment as we can only percieve it in a very objective manner.<br><br>------------------<br>If you could have told me everything<br>You would have found what love is<br>If you could have told me what was on your mind<br>I would have shown you the way<br>Tomorrow i am going live without your love<br>I've never thought beyond that time<br>I've never imagined the pictures of that life<br>For now I will try to live for you and for me<br>I will try, try to live with love,<br>With dreams and forever with tears</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>asumming you are A, how good are you with C? childhood frens? pals? classmates only?<br><br>Is B the one who initiates or is C the one?<br><br>If it's B who makes the first move, I think A have no right to hate B and C cos everyone has the right to love. C might know that A loves B but C herself could be madly in love with B too. And her might not be able to reject B bcoz are many factors, eg: location, mood, B's words..blah...... If that's the case, then A should accept it.<br><br>If C is the one who initiates, then it's a different case.<br><br>these are based on my opinion only, you need not agree and act upon.
