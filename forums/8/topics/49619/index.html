This is exactly the kind of place that should be left alone, because it has an identity.<br><br>'It means something to people who used to live around here. They often come back to use the beach,' she said.<br><br>Ms Nora Abdul Rahman, 38, knows what Ms Hall means.<br><br>She was born and bred in Sembawang, and moved out when the land where her zinc-roofed home stood was acquired by the Government.<br><br>The pre-school teacher lives near a bigger beach now, at Pasir Ris, but she still returns to the Sembawang beach at least twice a month.<br><br>'It's not about a bigger or a better beach with more amenities. It's what a place means to you. Sembawang is my home and when I feel homesick, I go back there,' she said.<br><br>'Everything about old Sembawang has been taken away except for this beach. I don't want them to do anything to it, just leave it alone.'<br><br>At least three kampungs were located near the beach, and the population was relocated mainly to nearby Woodlands, Yishun and Sembawang new towns in the 1980s.<br><br>Beyond the former local community's sentimental links to the place, Ms Hall pointed out that the fishing jetty, which stretches out from Beaulieu House to the sea, is an important historical landmark which may be lost to reclamation.<br><br>The jetty looks plain, even ugly. But its construction was started by the British in the early 1940s. When the Japanese invaded and took over the island in 1942, they completed it.<br><br>'It would be a shame to get rid of such a historically interesting structure,' said Ms Hall.<br><br>Visitors told The Sunday Times they had no clue about the reclamation plan.<br><br>Madam Jameah Ghani, 47, a housewife in Yishun who often goes to the beach, with her husband, daughter and nephew, was surprised to hear of the reclamation.<br><br>She said: 'They need more land? It will be a pity if the beach is gone. It's a good place to relax; it's like our neighbourhood beach.'</div>
