            <div class='col-md body'>I applaud the generosity and kind-heartedness in some of you.<br><br>When my son got married last year, lots of invites were sent out to his former and present colleagues, friends and relatives. There were invites sent out by my hubby and me also.<br><br>Supposedly close friends and relatives didn't even bother to reply to the RSVP and when calls were made to them, their excuses were 'Sorry, I can't make it, I have another commitment on that day'; "Aiyah! I will be out of town leh!"; 'Pai seh leh, my father-in-law is sick so our family members gotto take turns taking care of him. Your wedding falls on my shift wor." There were so many excuses but that didn't bother us as all we wanted to know was the total head count.<br><br>Even on the wedding day, some guests who confirmed their attendance also did not turn up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Talking about hong baos or gifts - most of those who said they could not make it did not give any hong bao. Then again, someone who turned up for the wedding gave $2 hong bao.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  There was even a gift of a desk organizer set (writing pad and pen)!<br><br>However, my son came up with a NUMBERED guest list so whoever handed the hong bao or gift at the reception desk will have their corresponding number to their name discreetly written down on the hong bao or gift. In that way who gave what was duly noted.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>TS, if you are tight, you don't really have to give a hong bao to your colleague. A gift will do. It's the thought that counts.<br><br>Another thing is, isn't it the usual practice for office colleagues to POOL their funds to buy a gift for a fellow colleague's wedding or birthday?<br></div>

Its a celebration of a union of 2 people.  Not to demand for monies from outsiders who frankly dont even know you or the 2 newly weds well enough.<br><br>But if we are discussing the event in the western practise.  Gifts are best purchased from the Bridal Registry with pooled funds from good friends, collegues or family members.<br><br>Any group can pool their funds and buy the bridal couple a set of un-use-able ugly cutlery set &amp; sofa set.  But its the practical portion of those gifts that you might have to consider.<br><br>Like buying 6 barrels of beer for the couple when the bridal couple are allergic to alcohol?</div>
