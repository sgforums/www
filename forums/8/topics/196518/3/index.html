There had been so many deaths in the army and all of us know it mainly comes from the Commandos. Their training is too tough and they keep thinking that when the trainnees claimed that they cannot tah han anymore, they think they cao geng. Then people keep dying. This is the dunno number what person that die le. Then everytime someone died, they say they will "improve" the safety measures, but apparently not at the problematic part. LT Commandos die, they change some safety measure for the recruits at Tekong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> . And Fatem is right!! They force you to drink so much water. Everytime during water parades, people will be vomitting!! They are so inflexible. They force people to drink so much water even if there is not much vigourous training. After personally going through the army, all singaporean men will know how shitty The Army is. When I read the army magazine, they make it as if its some glorified act to be in the army. I think the person feature in the picture is not even in the army, just some male model~<br><br>RIP my dead comrade. We all grieve for you and know the injustice you suffered. </div></blockquote>precisely, these trainers do NOT know whether the trainees are kenging or not...they are NOT taught how to see potential signs of dangers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

One interesting point to note is that he collapsed so fast after sounding out to the instructor. This might imply that he was trying very hard to tahan but in the end left it too late to declare that he couldn't take it anymore. Hence pride might have played a factor in this. Instructors should be more alert in these cases to spot the danger signs before they make themselves obvious, so as to prevent any cases of soldiers who refused to sound out when feeling unwell due to personal pride issue.</div></blockquote>No?

The keyword here is, as you highlighted, "should", which is not equivalent to "must" or "will". Even if properly briefed, in such an elite unit as the commandos, trainees might refrain from sounding out as they might be afraid of being seen as "weak" or "gu niang". Hence there's greater onus on the instructors to spot the dangers before they occur.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think his death has to do with the siong commando training. Soldiers from non-commando units also die wat. The thing that's consistent is soldiers die and listening closely at what Mindef is saying it's because of the untuned safety standards and SOP.<br><br>Every trainer is now saying that they followed the SOP and training standards wat. But what? Soldiers still mati. It's as if they put the blame on the safety standards and SOP!<br><br>There are people who put the soldier's life on the line and when the soldier dies, these people shrug and TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY.<br><br>That's the problem. NO ONE's JOB IS ON THE LINE WHEN THEY PUT THE SOLDIER'S LIFE ON THE LINE.<br><br>1,2,3,4,5,6,etc soldiers die, they still keep their jobs.<br><br>So why be so ON in NS for wat? Keep yourself alive and well is far more crucial than to worship and meet their silly safety standards and SOP!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
