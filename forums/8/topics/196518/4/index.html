When LTA Lin encountered difficulties, the instructor assigned to him immediately passed him a float. LTA Lin was then instructed to swim to the pool edge.</span><br><br>While swimming towards the edge of the pool, LTA Lin went below the surface of the water. The instructor, who was next to him in the water, lifted him up and brought him to the pool edge where immediate medical attention was rendered. LTA Lin began vomiting and passed out. He was then rushed to the Hendon Medical Centre at 4.05pm where two doctors attempted to resuscitate him. LTA Lin was evacuated to Changi General Hospital at 4.10pm and arrived at 4.25pm. He was pronounced dead at 4.59pm.<br><br>MINDEF and the SAF extend their deepest condolences to the family of the late LTA Lin, and will be assisting the family in their time of grief. MINDEF will be conducting an inquiry to ascertain the circumstances and the cause of death.<br></strong><br><br>If a person is showing signs of difficulty swimming, why make him swim back? I thought it was basic lifeguard pratice to get the person to hold the float then tow him to safety? He's carrying gear, long 4 and wearing boots, how fast can he get back to the pool edge in his condition? No jettison drill? Or is he not allowed to (commando pride?)?</div>
