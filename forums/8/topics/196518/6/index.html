Have I claimed that I'm not angry?  Hell no.  Stupidity infuriates me.<br><br>You want to get ugly?  Go ahead - ugly and stupid go together.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by olala:</div><div class="quote_body">i dun think ur in this discusion for fun as i can see that ur pretty mature in ur train of thoughs<br>however,u have to know that,in this kind of scenario,we cant really define whats right and wrong except sympathise with the family,<br>Ns aint gonna stop for all males anytime soon so what i believe we can do now,is at least discuse as to how the govt can buck up the system?</div></blockquote>Again and again and again, this case is NOT about NS.  Get it out of your head.  NS has become play school these days, but somebody has to do some serious work, and that's the regulars, and that's what LTA Lin was.<br><br>If you want to sympathise with the family, go ahead and I'll give you my full support.  Saying that you know how they feel, however, is patronising and certainly not helpful at all.<br><br>As for the governnment bucking up the system, we need to be very circumspect about this.  When Yong Pung How told Captain Pandiaraj that his past achievements, including heading up the Timor Leste contingent, were "sudah habis", he sent a clear message out to every military officer - if we need a fall guy, we don't care what good work you've done.  Do you think that kind of message encourages the people who work to defend this country?<br><br>There's a more serious issue here.  Training is a complex issue - take it easy on one part and chances are that you'll increase the risk somewhere else.  Say we take this case and make the swimming training less tough.  What happens when our guys have to storm a ship?  Half the CT force drowns because of inadequate training and the ship blows up Pulau Bukom, leaving hundreds dead.<br><br>Mind you, I've spent my time at Hendon and I still maintain close contacts within CDO and SOF.  Even so, I wouldn't presume to go trying to mess with training programs, because as a member of the public, I don't have anywhere close to enough information to work out the knock-on effects of any corrective course of action.  The point here is, leave it to the pros.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by olala:</div><div class="quote_body">i feel that ur offened by me requesting that the govt shld give a public autopsy report<br>thats juz my view<br>u see,altho the incident has been made public,theres bound to be some covering of arse in some areas<br>as to why i suggested that an autopsy be given to the family and at elast to the public is bcuz,families are sent to camps and mindef shld and by right be responsible for the death of the ns men or full time soldier,unless the accident are casued by some foul play<br>if thats the case,we'll leave out the officer and direct the blame to those involved in foul play</div></blockquote>Yes, the family should and most likely will receive the autopsy report.  YOU, on the other hand, will not and have no right to do so.<br><br>Are you aware of the investigative process when an incident like this occurs?  Are you aware of the training that takes place?
