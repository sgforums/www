            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know what is MINDEF dong. There had been so many deaths in the army and all of us know it mainly comes from the Commandos. Their training is too tough and they keep thinking that when the trainnees claimed that they cannot tah han anymore, they think they cao geng. Then people keep dying. This is the dunno number what person that die le. Then everytime someone died, they say they will "improve" the safety measures, but apparently not at the problematic part. LT Commandos die, they change some safety measure for the recruits at Tekong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> . And Fatem is right!! They force you to drink so much water. Everytime during water parades, people will be vomitting!! They are so inflexible. They force people to drink so much water even if there is not much vigourous training. After personally going through the army, all singaporean men will know how shitty The Army is. When I read the army magazine, they make it as if its some glorified act to be in the army. I think the person feature in the picture is not even in the army, just some male model~<br><br>RIP my dead comrade. We all grieve for you and know the injustice you suffered.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: orange;">The water parade thing is actually not totally unreasonable.. They have a reason for it which is to prevent dehydration and because of the rigorous training that's why drink so much.. But the rule is not flawed, it is the instructors that are flawed. They enjoy see people suffer so drink so much lor but then again that is somehow, the irony, part of army training. To suffer. Army is Army. Whenever a serviceman dies, we cannot always blame the Army. They also don't want us to die mah.. Of course must practise control here ah cannot so extreme but so far the training can say not considered very extreme because if not the whole Commando battalion all die already. Just that accidents happen and it can happen to anyone and anywhere. Every year got so many car crash and motorbike crash. Didn't hear anyone blaming the car and motorbike manufacturer leh..<br>Just my few pieces of crap..</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's hard to tell whether there was any negligence involved in this case. One interesting point to note is that he collapsed so fast after sounding out to the instructor. This might imply that he was trying very hard to tahan but in the end left it too late to declare that he couldn't take it anymore. Hence pride might have played a factor in this. Instructors should be more alert in these cases to spot the danger signs before they make themselves obvious, so as to prevent any cases of soldiers who refused to sound out when feeling unwell due to personal pride issue.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm well actually from what i think , all soldier are after all normal pple mar . Have you ever look into how army chose pple to go into which vocation ? How do you define a person to be tough ? No matter how you " tekan " a soldier he is supposed to remain ok even if you make him do inhuman feats ? Anyway as a matter of fact , both my brothers palms was burnt badly when their pti ask them to do bumping on the hot tarmac one hot afternoon untill many his campmates also kana burnt on the palms .   And luckily justice was met when their mo complain to their officers and later the pti was charged . So do you pple think that a tough soldier shouldn't get injured ? Comeon lor no matter what soldeirs are still human ok . Same as being a comando doesn't mean he got super fit body no matter what happen he wun get injured or die . They are just the same as anyone of us suay suay or heng heng anyway you want to call it got chosen for the comando vocation lor . There always is some injury or death here n there in the army , only thing is few was reported in the media . My brother also saw a so called " scholar " unable to take the physical training went mad when he was ask to do chin up .  Even my own ns camp , during an exercise in crscendo , one fo the alpha fella rammed off his own finger due to fatique . And there was 2 soldier whom tore their ankle ligament due to the training and one of them was from my own platoon . Whose fault i don't want to say , up to you all to think . I just want to say that don't expect pple to be so tough just bcos of their vocation . Our body after all is still flesh and blood , even jackie chan always do so many stunts everyone thought he is an iron man . But he actually has alot of injuries here n there in his body which few pple know .</div>
