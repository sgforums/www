              <p>Well, I believe that we are creatures of this earth, nothing more. We simply reproduce to ensure the survival of our species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If that is not enough for you, you can always create your individual purpose. You can have ambitions, dreams, missions; all words that means the same thing. Some people want their dream job, a sportscar, great wealth and so on. To each his own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Religion is nothing more than one of billions of attempts to create a purpose in life, except that it is a collective purpose. In other words, it is a purpose that all humans should follow. Evidently, this has caused quite a number of problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think that freethinkers just live their lives aimlessly, you cannot be more wrong. It is just that our dreams have nothing to do with any deities. We don't see evidence, as well as a need, for a deity.</p>

              <p>Very interesting topic.</p>
              <p>For me, I believe it is just a matter of time before life-extension methods are developed and humans can live forever, then we might be able to travel to far away stars and learn about other races.</p>
              <p>Of course other people who dun want to live forever can opt to leave the world and turn to dust. It will probably still be democracy during then.</p>

              <p>I am atheist. My purpose is to live 1000 yr old. What about religious people. Queuing up to enter heaven? Free thinkers live a more purposeful life then non religious people.</p>
              <p>Does not mean that you believe in a heaven and god and ur soul floating somewhere , then therefore you life is filled with hopes and purpose. A faked hope is not real hope. Its called delusion. Being happy over a falsehood may seem a blessing, but it is one in disguise. Because in religious people, they will always have a naggy feeling trailing them that tells them that something is not right, and they always have to confront the truth and reality that they their sense of self is an imaginery one and temporary one.</p>
              <p>Being atheist is better. It means to be free from prison and to standing on the side of truth . less contradiction in life and will not go around in circles .</p>

              <p>all religious people are in a sense, selfish. why?</p>
              <p>When an atheist does a good deed, it is purely for altruistic reasons.</p>
              <p>But when a religious person does a good deed, regardless of his justification, it will still eventually boils down to his desire to progress to a better life after death. e.g. going to heaven instead of hell.</p>
              <p>Their primary aim is to attain entry to heaven, and helping people comes secondary.</p>
              <p>I personally believe that free thinker come to this world, to form part of the interactions which make up our known world. Without free thinkers, the world would be a less colourful place. Think LKY, MaoZedong etc</p>
              <p>Also, one does not need to be religious to live a fulfilling life. Maybe from the religious point of view, from the big picture, free thinkers do not lead a purposeful life, since they don't exist beyond death.</p>
              <p>But consider this, in the course of life, we can have a meaningful, purposeful life too.</p>
              <p>While the values and the morals are taught/imposed on the religious, e.g. the Commandments of the Christians. You must not do this and that etc...</p>
              <p>free thinkers derive their morals through logical thoughts, where the guiding principle is the Golden Rule: "Do not do upon other people what you do not wish to happen to you."</p>
              <p>For the religious, you do not steal because you are wary of the punishment you will receive in your afterlife. for the free thinker, you do not steal simply because you do not like it if people stole from you either.</p>
              <p>Thus, from the result of all that pondering and reflection, the free thinker will arrive at his own conclusion of what morals he should abide by. And with this moral, he can then choose to pursue whatever agendas which may arise.</p>

                  reasons.</p>
              <p>But when a religious person does a good deed, regardless of his
                  justification, it will still eventually boils down to his desire to
                  progress to a better life after death. e.g. going to heaven instead
                  of hell.</p>
              <p>Their primary aim is to attain entry to heaven, and helping
                  people comes secondary.</p>
              <p>I personally believe that free thinker come to this world, to
                  form part of the interactions which make up our known world.
                  Without free thinkers, the world would be a less colourful place.
                  Think LKY, MaoZedong etc</p>
              <p>Also, one does not need to be religious to live a fulfilling
                  life. Maybe from the religious point of view, from the big picture,
                  free thinkers do not lead a purposeful life, since they don't exist
                  beyond death.</p>
              <p>But consider this, in the course of life, we can have a
                  meaningful, purposeful life too.</p>
              <p>While the values and the morals are taught/imposed on the
                  religious, e.g. the Commandments of the Christians. You must not do
                  this and that etc...</p>
              <p>free thinkers derive their morals through logical thoughts,
                  where the guiding principle is the Golden Rule: "Do not do upon
                  other people what you do not wish to happen to you."</p>
              <p>For the religious, you do not steal because you are wary of the
                  punishment you will receive in your afterlife. for the free
                  thinker, you do not steal simply because you do not like it if
                  people stole from you either.</p>
              <p>Thus, from the result of all that pondering and reflection, the
                  free thinker will arrive at his own conclusion of what morals he
                  should abide by. And with this moral, he can then choose to pursue
                  whatever agendas which may arise.</p>
              </blockquote></div>
              <p>Not all religious people are "selfish". Your
                   statement of "all religious people are selfish" is a generalization 
                  without taking into account of the understanding of religious practice. 
                  Buddhist practises selflessness (i.e. there is no 'self', which is the 
                  opposite of selfishness), an essential teaching of the Buddha. 
                  Christian's primary goal is to serve god, following god's will, which is
                   to practise altruism and spread the gospel (god's message). Taoist aims to maintain self-harmony 
                  with "Dao" (or the way of life i.e. the nature of the universe) and 
                  practises a balance of Yin (negative evil forces) and Yang (positive 
                  good forces) for the benefits of mankind.</p>
              <p>Your moral principle of "Do not do upon
                  other people what you do not wish to happen to you." is basically based 
                  on Confucian ethics (å·±æ‰€ä¸�æ¬²ï¼Œå‹¿æ–½äºŽäººï¼‰, which is a great philosophy on 
                  humanism. Although Confucius does not mention much about religious 
                  thoughts, he did mention that one should also respect the deities/ghosts
                   and if possible, stay away from them (æ•¬é¬¼ç¥žè€Œè¿œä¹‹ï¼‰.</p>
              <p>IMO, there is 
                  nothing wrong with being a free-thinker, but one must have a moral 
                  practice in your life. With moral practice, your life will not go on the
                   "wrong path", but instead will progress towards the "right path".</p>
              <p>Mao
                   Zedong should not be taken as an example of freethinker. In fact, he's 
                  bad example of one who blindly believes in Marxism, a form of 
                  materialism which rejects any form of idealism and spiritualism, or in 
                  fact any other philosophical thoughts such as Confucianism. He blindly 
                  crushed Confucianism. He has strong faith in Marxism and communism, and 
                  his ignorance has caused him to commit crime against humanity such as 
                  launching Great Leap Forward (causing hundreds of millions of Chinese to
                   die of hunger), Cultural revolution (which causes the destruction of 
                  Chinese culture). He branded all religious practice as 'feudal' and 
                  'superstitious' without realizing that most religions can act as ethical
                   practice for people and preventing people from committing evil. Most 
                  Chinese who practised a combination of Chinese religious practice at 
                  least uphold the Taoist beliefs of "ä¸¾å¤´ä¸‰å°ºæœ‰ç¥žæ˜Žï¼Œ äººåœ¨å�šï¼Œå¤©åœ¨çœ‹" (just raise up 
                  your head by 3 feets and there will be deities. A person is doing it, 
                  the heaven is watching). This "heaven scrutinising human behaviour" at 
                  the very least prevents people from committing evils for fear of 
                  retribution in the present life.  </p>
              <p>When a person is stealing, he 
                  thinks he's right and nothing wrong with it, because he has no sense of 
                  right or wrong (moral beliefs), has no fear and does not believe in 
                  retribution. He thinks he will not be caught and can get away with it. 
                  Unless a country has a strong legal system, he will most likely get away
                   with it and will not be caught. But in most religion, there is retribution. 
                  Buddhism talks about karma. Stealing leads to poverty or bad karma. In 
                  strict Islamic law, stealing resulted in your hand being cut off. Taoism believes in retribution because the heaven is watching your action.</p>
              <p>When a person is committing adultery (having sex with another 
                  person other than your own marriage partner) or visiting prostitute, 
                  he/she also thinks he/she's right and nothing wrong with it. He has no 
                  fear and does not believe in retribution and thus will continue to 
                  commit evil. He thinks he will not be caught and can get away with it. 
                  But in most religions, adultery is evil. Buddhism talks about karma. 
                  Adultery or sexual misconduct usually end up in broken marriage 
                  (divorce) or even sickness such as AIDS, sexual diseases or others. Look at how many people who watch porn escalated into porn or sex addictions and had to seek medical help. They lead to social problems that is bad for the society.</p>
              <p>Retribution will not occur just in this life, but also in the next life after that.
                   If one is a free thinker and does not believe in any form of religion, 
                  at the very least, he should always believe in doing good and avoid all 
                  forms of evil. This is the basis for humanism.</p>

              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Depends on what you mean by "purpose" of life. Are you talking about "goals" or having a "meaningful life" ?</p>
              <p>I
                           cannot answer for Christians to my fullest understanding, as I'm a 
                          buddhist. But from what I understand, Christians faith rested on the 
                          teaching of Jesus and faith (belief) in god. According to Christian 
                          teaching, if you believe and have faith in god, you will have eternal 
                          life and ascend to heaven. Humans have sins and thus god send his son 
                          Jesus to savage humans, to save them from the sins. Christians faith, if
                           I'm not wrong, rested on purifying one's soul, practising Jesus's 
                          teaching based on bibles (altruism) with the final goal of ascending to 
                          heaven after death (thus resulting in eternal living). The purpose of a 
                          Christian is to serve god.</p>
              <p>For buddhist, I believe I can answer your question to my best 
                          understanding, as I'm a practising buddhist. The purpose of a buddhist 
                          is to practise the dharma (i.e. the teaching of the buddha) for the 
                          benefits of all sentient beings with the ultimate goal of attaining 
                          enlightenment (i.e. becoming Buddha). Only human being (not even gods) 
                          can attain enlightenment. Buddha is not a god, but a human who through 
                          his spiritual practice have  achieved enlightenment. Buddhist teaching 
                          rested on the belief that one has to undergo a life-cycle of rebirth. 
                          Once a person is dead, he will be reborn again. But in Buddhism, a human
                           being might not necessarily be reborn as a human. If he commits evil, 
                          he will be reborn as an animal, a hungry ghost or a hell-being and might
                           undergo extreme torture and sufferings. If he practise good, he will be
                           reborn a human again, a deva or a heavenly-being (gods/deva). The goal 
                          of a buddhist is not to be reborn (or ascend) into heaven, as a god 
                          (heavenly being) might fail his spiritual practice and be reborn into as
                           a human again. In buddhism, life is a suffering as one keeps on 
                          undergoing rebirth in the 6 realms of existence: Heaven, ashura, human, 
                          animals, hungry ghost, hell. And to end the suffering, one can practise 
                          buddhism so as to achieve enlightenment, where one will not need to 
                          undergo rebirth in this life cyle. In Buddhism, only a human can achieve
                           enlightenment. A god needs to be reborn into the realm of human beings 
                          in order to achieve enlightenment. Thus, the ultimate goal of buddhist is to become Buddha.</p>
              <p>Practising the Dharma (buddhist teaching) has the benefits of relieving one's own sufferings and achieving true happiness in life. When one feels angry, a buddhist will not feel that the anger is permanent forever (which in buddhism is known as impermanence). He will not see that the anger is "real", but a manifestation of the 'unreal'. It is empty of its inherent existence. A buddhist will not feel that his 'self' is more important than others as one practises "selflessness" (no 'self', i.e. no "I"). With the notion of no "I", one is capable of sacrificing oneself for the benefit of other sentient beings, to practise compassion and loving kindness. A buddhist will not feel 'hatred', as he sees that "hatred" is impermanent and causes of root of evil and will let go of it, which is realizing internal peace and happiness.</p>
