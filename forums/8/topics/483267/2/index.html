              <p>Says must pay them $60 to make the change.</p>
              <p>But a waste of $$$ if U keep on changing your faith/ other particulars. Hope it isn't so simple to change one's name though, will make ones friends/ acquaintances very confused...</p>

              <p>No worries dor now. If u do not believe in Islam, you are no more a Muslim. Faith is determined by whatnyou believe, not what is written in your ID or if your families are Muslim.</p>

              Currently you are using a Muslim name. If you really wish to erase
              your muslim identity then change your muslim name to a non-muslim
              name officially. Then apply a new ic with your new name. Singapore
              is a secular state, MUIS cannot do anything to stop you. Yes, they
              might send a letter to your home to advise you to contact them to
              seek counselling but you can also reject their offer.</p>
