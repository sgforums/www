            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the number of years I've been living, I can classify Chio Bus into these categories:<br><br>Bimbotic Idiots (75%): These are the ones whom hang around or are going steady wif Cao Ah Bengz cos of their 'cool' lifestyles (yuckz) and their 'cool' languages. Thru research, it is found that those who fall into this 75% are usually bimbotic idiots. Breast Big, No Brains. First look usually very chio (beacause of their breasts) but, 2nd look slowly look like kena sai. Usually like to hang around pubz, discos, dress like sai, sit like shit and talk like as if they own the world. Hello Kitty belongs to this category  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Guai-guai Kena Sai (10%): These are the ones who are seemingly quiet yet hang around wif Cao Ah Bengz. They hang around wif em cos they are too desperate for a stead and chin-chai grab one. Research has shown that these galz are usually ding-dongz who have matured physically but not mentally. They hang around pubz and discos occasionally, but dun dress like shit and sit like shit.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Money Honey(10%): These are the ones who go for the 'magic' paper - $$$. Gals who fall into this category are materialistic and would not look for Cao Ah Bengz but rather Rick Ah Bengz who drives a Mercedes SLK or a Mitsubishi Evo VI (the Real One, not the chiong one), lives in a Condo and has at least 3 credit cards (NOT Sup Cards) in his name. Lookwise okay but ONLY wif makeup. Hang around in high-class pubz and discos.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>The Real McCoy (5%): These are the galz tat have average looks, but are really chio when u look at time for a period of time. They dun go for materialistic pursuits or Cao Ah Bengz, but for true love. Quite often, these galz are rejected cos of their 'first-look-average' looks. They've got wat it takes in the brain dept and some have wonderful figures. But cos of their lookz, they dun attract much attention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>NON FICTION<br><br>Witness this myself. When I was young, my school was the only school in Singapore to have boxing as an ECA. The sport recruits only the toughest guys and it was usually cornered by those guys in Normal Stream and the occasional athletes from Express Stream. There were a few legends in my school, a few of them made it big internationally and there was one Thai student who was very impressive. Collect all the trophies under his weight for 4 years straight.<br><br>Anyway, my story revolves around this ah-beng that joined the boxing club when i was still around in school. He was from the express stream and being rich and obnoxious, he thought he was the king of the school. He came on the first day of the training and the rest of the day's event became another legend in school.<br><br>I was there on that fateful day for I happened to pass through the hall and stayed there to enjoy the masculine sweat and upper cut. That ah-beng storm into the main ring not properly attired and demands a bout with anybody who dares to take him on. Naturally, most kept quiet and continued to carry on their practice. The beng, his chest even more puffed, swored that all this is shit and that he had, no joke he really sad that, "combat" experience outside because he took part in "pia shui". All heads turned to him and before anyone could say a thing...<br><br>the vice captain of the team strolled into the ring with him. I know him personally and he was usually a much amiable guy and nothing frazzles him much. He asks the beng to put on his proper attire before stepping into the hallowed ring. The beng snorts and say fighting skill is the main thing, not dressing. My friend kept quiet, threw him a pair of boxing gloves and asks him for a bout to demonstrate his "combat" skills.<br><br>The beng put it on, the bell sound and within a few seconds, he was punched out of the ring. My friend gave him no mercy at all and taught him a lesson he will never forget. He was given some rudimentary first aid and from that day onwards, he never stepped in to the club again. And yes, from what i heard, he never participates in anymore "bengish" activities and transferred school within a month.<br><br>tsk tsk...<br><br>------------------<br>The Far East Pilgrim</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do admire abt the pple in the past, they tok abt brotherhood, and they really protect one another. They are really there for each other. But now, we dun have this kind of thing anymore. Correction, we dun see this kind of thing in S'pore anymore, though we still have them in places like Italy. It they really have the brotherhood spirit, I think I will still have some kind of respect for them. But now they become, they only wander ard in a grp, and flee as individuals. I mean wat's the point? Pple join gang to search for an identity, but run as individuals, no longer haf the gang image there liaoz. A bit disappointed there manz...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Those I do not call them Chao Ah bengs. They are call paikia. Ah Bengs are people who think they really are paikia when they dress like some "sum seng" kias. Many like to act like Ekin Cheng as they are super fighters but the fact is they are just "street fighters". If they think they are really paikia then there's no need for them to join gang and observe those stupid gang rules. Paikia are people who got the balls to do things against other's wishes without having to observe any rules from any organisation( Government, Gang etc etc).<br><br>I too have an extreme dislike for ah bengs especially those with no manners.

They don't have to dress like chao ah beng to be one. Used to have a Malaysian friend who did got into a fight with a CNB officer but of course he got into the lock up but thanks to his rich dad he got out of the trouble with just a fine. Chao ah bengs will naturally bow down to all police officer when they seem em.</div>
