            <div class='col-md body'>Zhaoyun<br>U seems quite preoccupied with the word "Love"..dun evolve around it...it is sometimes rather hazardous.<br><br>True and everlasting love --- a man's search for eternity for soemthing so mystical yet magical. No one can really tell u if their love is true and everlasting until the day one of them dies and the other can say I love u at your very last breathe..Anything can change...Dun say u really love someone until u meet different trials to prove your love...<br><br>Take for example...:U are in love with this gal and she likes u too but on the day before you ask her to be your gf...U tell her that u only have 10 more years to live and u dunno how serious your condition is and may die anytime...and if she says yes....to ur request..I should say she really loves you.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So get the defination of real love?<br><br>------------------<br>Writing is a weapon that is more powerful than a man's fist.</div>

All these are yours for life if you put in the efforts.. you can control your life but not the mind of the other person, she can change her heart in a moment and you lost her forever.<br><br>Love.. is an emotion, emotion and feeling is not static, it's kinda dynamic.. just like RAM, they can forget everything just you reboot the PC.  :p</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Zhaoyun,<br><br>I believe in everlasting love, and I still believe in searching for true love in my life. It is strange that when I read your thread, I was having this day, where I bumped into all my couple friends in town. Surprisingly, some of my friends are already hitched now, and suddenly I realized that I am alone again... Sometimes, I think about someone entering into my life and it can only be expressed with these words of Bertrand Russell in his letter to Lady Ottoline:<br><br>"Now there is no prison for me. I can reach out to the stars and through the ages and everywhere the radiance of your love lights the world for me."<br><br>If love was just meant to change all the time, then would it be still love or is it just lust?<br><br>Such are 2 pennies worth of opinions.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True love ?<br>I believe when i was very young. Pple tell me how prince and princess can live happily ever after.<br><br>When I broke up with XXX, I dun believe in true love anymore.<br><br>When I fell in love with YYY, I believe in true love again.<br><br>When YYY rejects me, I dun believe in true love anymore.<br><br>Well, do I believe in true love ? Yes, but only WHEN I AM IN LOVE. Hahaha<br><br>Ok seriously,<br><br>Yes I do believe in true love. And I do believe that love conquers all. Just that true love is so difficult to find, or rather, so difficult to NURTURE.<br><br>Whether I will find that right one I dunno, maybe my right one has already died in the SilkAir crash <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But I do have someone who had shown so much sincere care and concern for me for the past 7 years.
