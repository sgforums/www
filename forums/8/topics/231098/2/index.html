It is very surprising because my grades are not good and i am definitely not a top student.<br><br>The PHD will be tentatively 3 years, depending on research output.<br><br>I have a few questions on this matter.<br><br>Basically, is PHD only about research? Will there be subjects to study or exams to take?<br><br>Will I be able to graduate this july and continue on as a postgrad or is graduation delayed?<br><br>What happens if there is no satisfactory discovery or output after 3 years?<br><br>And lastly, I plan to work outside and not permanently be a researcher in academic circles. Will a PHD be useful?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Advice for you :<br><br>Are you interested in the topic at all? If not, don't bother because for the next 3 years , you will be eating and breathing it in your head.<br><br>Do you know of anyone who worked with the prof before? I know that there are some profs who use students to do their dirty work aka writting papers , then they snatch the papers and claim credit as first author . Tenures for professors always come with a condition that they continually publish , hence they do this.  And some just leave you to swim in the deep blue ocean. If his rep is clean with his previous students, then you should be ok.<br><br>As a PhD , you do not just publish 2-3 papers. You need more than that. You have to publish alot of papers relating to the topic you are interested in.<br><br>Don't think a PhD will get you a good job. It depends on <strong> where you got your PhD from </strong>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dunno about your discipline, but PHD usually involves very very in-depth and intense research on a particular subject of interest, and would involve a lot of background studies, maybe field studies and at the end of the day produce lengthy accounts, which should involve new information from your part. People who do PHD usually want to be academics at higher institutions which would require that expertise in the area of knowledge he or she has researched on.<br><br>And if you become an academic at higher institutions, basically your life would be spent mainly on teaching and research, and writing papers.<br><br>Yeah and you really need to have the interest to pursue it. I am already dying halfway through my masters thesis.</div>

My prof also encouraged me to go for further study.<br><br>But the problem is, I have no idea what to do for my MSc or PhD... In the previous posts, some of you mentioned that in order to do MSc or PhD, you need a direction and an interest in the area of research. But right now I have no direction at all.

(I took this project because the projects that I'm interested in were highly competitive and they were already taken in advance.)<br><br>If I continue onto MSc or PhD, my research area will definitely not be related to my FYP. I have interest in other areas, but unfortunately I have no exposure in my interested areas. (I only learn the hard facts &amp; theories, but I never have any hands-on experience.) Also, after spending 4 years of NUS, I no longer want to stay in Singapore. I want to pursue my MSc or PhD elsewhere. But, so far I have no idea where to go and what to do.

(Some of my engin friends have already received job offers, with starting salaries as high as $2900!!!) In comparison, the scenario for BSc graduates is bleak. They are not as highly valued (and highly paid) as B.Eng graduates, and BSc graduates have to fight ferociously among themselves for jobs or MSc/PhD places in an already over-saturated market.<br><br>Recently, I saw an advertisment about an one-year internship program. The internship topic is something that I'm interested in, and the internship has a allowance of $2000 per month. However, my friends are not very supportive of this program.

But how can I pursue MSc of PhD if I don't have a direction and interest? I'm already suffering for my FYP and it's scary to go through all that again for MSc or PhD...
