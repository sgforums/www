One is a classicial composer another is a modern day. Besides,  Rahman will not like to give the type of music which bach  gives as   he is a businessman. He sells records......if u want to sell u need to give music which everyone likes to  listen, not only a seregated part of the audience.<br><br>Rahman is also trained in classical music like link above, it is evident but his presentation is different from that of Bach. It was presented in a style reachable to all listeners. He wants it  to be more reachable to mainstream listeners.But [b]it should not be taken to be inferior to that of bach, BTW bach and mozart are classical players.</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote>im not comparing apples and oranges. music is immortal. if its good, its good. if its not, its not. The point is that when listening to his works, i certainly dun feel any sort of wonder like i do when i listen to people like strauss, bach n chopin. that doesn't make it a bad piece of music, but if u keep insisting that its as good or even better than bach, then that sort of over-accolade will kill his music, because b4 i even hear it, im already expecting very high standards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Big names targeted in Indian tax raids </strong><br><br>Officials show they mean business by raiding homes of celebrities<br><br>NEW DELHI - A RECENT series of raids targeting several celebrities, including famous music composer A.R. Rahman, in the southern Indian city of Chennai is intended to send a strong message to tax evaders, the Indian tax authorities said.<br><br>Last week, officials of the federal Income Tax Department (ITD) descended on Rahman's house in Chennai - not to hear his music but to unearth allegedly 'unaccounted' money.<br><br>Besides Rahman, who performed to a packed audience in Singapore in August, the houses of other leading music composers like Yuvan Sankar Raja, son of another leading musician Ilaya Raja, Harris Jeyaraj and film stars Vikram, Vijay, Surya, Silambarassan, Trisha and Sneha were also raided.<br><br>In all, tax officials swooped down simultaneously on 19 houses of film personalities in the southern Indian metropolis. The raids that started at dawn continued late into the night.<br><br>Mr Santosh Datta, director general of ITD, said the raids were based on intelligence gathered over a period of two months about the unaccounted wealth of celebrities.<br><br>He said the operation yielded cash and long-term bank deposit receipts to the tune of 10 million rupees (S$376,000) and documents of monetary transactions of over 50 million rupees.<br><br>'We expect more cash and jewellery to be recovered from lockers besides documents relating to property transactions,' Mr Datta told reporters.<br><br>The raids were meant to send a strong signal to tax evaders, particularly in the film fraternity, he said.<br><br>Rahman and his colleagues in the Tamil film industry were not the only ones to court infamy last week.<br><br>Bollywood hunk Sunil Shetty was facing another kind of problem after his Hummer H2 vehicle was seized by revenue intelligence officials.<br><br>According to officials, the SUV, the military version of which is used by US troops in Iraq, had been imported by a Delhi tour operator under concessionary duty of 8 per cent against the normal duty of 108 per cent.<br><br>Under the rules, the importer cannot sell the vehicle for a period of five years. Shetty had allegedly bought the vehicle for four million rupees against the market price of 10 million rupees when it arrived in Mumbai port a few months ago.<br><br>But after the Department of Revenue Intelligence exposed the huge racket in expensive imported cars, Mr Shetty quietly sent the vehicle to the travel company in Delhi and denied that he had ever bought the car.<br><br>Revenue intelligence officials said investigations are under way and that either Mr Shetty or the travel company would have to cough up the duty with penalty for the release of the car.<br><br>They said about 50 expensive vehicles had been seized in cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai while many more are being investigated.<br><br></div>
