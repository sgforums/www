There are many which can help you and you can learn alot and mature in it. Both sides (genders) have contributed alot and its a good way for us to know and understand more of how a guy or gal "works".  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>And uh... don't blame yourself or horoscope or parents for bringing you into this world or your friends or the enviornment or the govenrment or humanity in general. Everyone has obstacles to overcome. Each obstacle crossed is experience gained, with that you mature more or level up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
