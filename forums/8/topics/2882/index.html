            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I might just be opening up a can of worms by saying this, but I don't see anything really wrong with having feelings for someone of the same sex. Just because I doubt that would ever happen to me doesn't mean that I would shun anyone whom that has ever happened to. If that person were my boyfriend, of course, that would be slightly different. I don't know if I would be able to accept it...the strange thing is, I've always found lesbians more acceptable than gays... can't understand why, but most of my friends seem to agree with me...<br><br>Anyway, bottom line, I have friends who are not straight. Boyfriend, 100% straight.<br><br>------------------<br>Love &amp; poison,<br>Suede</div>

Not the butch sort.. but you know, just a bit of that tomboyishness.. can't stand overly girly girls =) If that lesbian I like turn out to be bi.. LAGI BEST!!!... It's like c'mon imagine she likes girls too, so when you go around looking at other girls she can be your fellow connoisseur! Now that's really cool!!! Oh but of course while I can tolerate her looking and lusting at other girls I can't tolerate her bedding someone of the same sex.. It'll make me feel so left out. haah.. unless, unless maybe I'm in the centre? Bwhahaahah.... =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought it would be alright to accept my other half as a bi-sexual. Maybe I grew more tolerant of such things after living in the western world for a few years.<br><br>Since I have some ang-moh friends who told me about their experiences of having bisexual gfs and why they did not mind. For a guy, it is  beneficial and could be turn into a pleasure, since if you know your gf's lesbian partner, you can always have 2 together on the bed if you want to have sex (provided the partner agrees to having sex with you as well). I don't know for a gal how it would be like. I suppose if the gal has a bisexual bf, she would not mind being screwed by 2 guys.<br><br>I don't think there is nothing wrong being a bisexual. It is found in recent studies from genetics and evolutionary biology that<br>1)A person's sexual tendencies are influenced by genes.<br>2)No one is perfectly heterosexual (as they cover a range of spectrum from strongly heterosexual to bisexual to strongly homosexual).<br><br></div>

Of course i can !<br><br>Bisexuality is not good definately.<br>In the mind of most normal people. Opposite sex is okay.<br>But for gays and lesbians, If they are interested of the same sex. Then they are pyschocially not well. ANd That can impact things big time.<br><br>&lt; Your Wimps and screams will not long to see day light when i m through being nice with you. Since you are a big liar, you are as good as gone from my mind . &gt;</div>
