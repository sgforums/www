              <p>I don't know whether I should get a ps3 or not anymore</p>
              <div id="post_message_21280413">Sian, I was looking forward to it.. But yesterday my results released and my GPA dropped from 3.19 to 3.17, it may seem like a little, but considering the amount I could have improved, its like alot. It felt like a 3.29 drop to 3.17 for me.<br><br>I talked to some friends and most encouraged me to get it while a few said that I should think carefully whether or not, my mom is fine with it as long as I know when and where not to play.<br><br>I keep telling myself I can do it, but truth is, during the one week study week, 4 days were spent not doing anything. My core subjects were all B+ on average while 2 electives were C+ and B.<br><br>My friend said that my core subjects improved and told me to retake my electives to improve.<br><br>Now I'm a in dilemma, anyone here at poly/jc/uni level had gotten a ps3 and still had improved grades?</div>

              <p><br>actually 3 of my core subjects, i scored what I had expected. Except I expected 3 As while I only got 1 and the two others became B+. for my maths, i made a careless mistake during the paper and only expected a B but I only got C+. i have a total of 5 core subjects which i got eventually, A, B+, B+, B, C+ as for my electives, I got B, C+</p>
              <p>my core subjects were an improvement from last sem where I got A, B+, B+,B, C+, C. out of which the common subjects were programming, maths and interpersonal comms. I got B+ last sem for java, A and B+ for this sem. maths remained at C, interpersonal comms went up to B from C+. funny thing is, i take 2 java this sem, normal java and higher java. I scored A for higher java and B+ for the normal one. the only thing is, higher java no exam.. only assignment and labtest</p>
