            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys and gals...<br>After being in this forum for about 2-3 weeks...I have realised that most forumites have a problem or two in thier mind. I dun know how much I can help u. But this is time for me to share all my experiences for guys who have problems with girls and girls problem with guys. Even family problems, BGR problems, work problems, anything u can think of under the sun. For all my ardent fans, you all should know if i am qualified or my advices are worth listening. Well, at least a listening ear or a extra advice than trying to solve the problem yourself.The outlooker sees the best of the game. Have a tough nut to crack?Can't fathom what the guys or the girls you like are thinking?For those who have personal questions, just e-mail me.(Click the second small icon beside my name) And your identity is strictly confidential.<br><br>Hope u all like this thread, cos I believe no matter how strong a person appear to be, there are some vulnerability in it.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 27-11-1999).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rinoa Heartilly (edited 27-11-1999).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rinoa - i was watching 60 minutes last nite and this psychiatrist revealed that even tho she was suffering from manic depression for over a decade, she couldn't diagnose herself as having that condition. so shrinks are human too. dun be too hard on yourself! however, if u don't wanna be too addicted to these kinda things, then you shouldn't even begin on irc. i'm kinda tired of irc now, but when u first start, it's pretty addictive.<br><br>but what i've found is that all you need is to move abt and immerse yourself in other things and you'll be fine....the addiction really does subside. what i try to do is to limit myself to abt 2-3 posts a day tops. and only 1-2 will be of any considerable length. but of course, if you did that, you'd prob be disappointing all your fans!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>some more now you are volunteering your services for free! really hope you don't get sooo many emails and requests that you have trouble handling them! just as long as it doesn't affect your studies too much, i think you'll be fine. thanks for the offer and for always being there. it's much appreciated! and you know dat if u ever have any problems yourself, there's help to be found here as well. i'm sure you'll soon be getting your first virtual customer....if you don't already have one!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
