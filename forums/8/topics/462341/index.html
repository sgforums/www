              <p>Dear all, </p>
              <p>recently my mum was brought to energic singapore's office in pennisular plaza to buy their water treatment device which costs quite an amount of $$ ($5000) %@#$%@#%</p>
              <p>She brought it back and tore it out from its plastic casing (unboxing); interestingly her friend helped her with the installation - extremely suspicious of this friend.Upon consultation with the rest of the family, myself who's a life science graduate and a PhD candidate now, it was obviously a scam in my opinion.</p>
              <p>Alkaline water will be neutralised by the acidic stomach contents and will have no whatsoever effect save for the placebo effect. </p>
              <p>Called CASE up (http://www.case.org.sg/contact.html) but all they promised was a letter to the company. We paid through using credit cards and have since blocked the transaction. </p>
              <p>Additionally what she thought and signed was in fact a distributor's agreement, is this some tactic used by companies to avoid laws governing and protecting consumers? </p>
              <p>Could we argue that she did not know what she was signing. </p>

              <p>Near impossible to argue that. The company will argue that they gave her all the relevant literature required for the average consumer to make an informed decision.</p>
              <p>The company will also argue that your mother had every right to ask other people for their opinions prior to purchase. The very fact that your mother could have talked to you first will count against her.</p>
              <p>By all means try to block the transaction, but if it has to go through, then just too bad. Your mother only has herself to blame.</p>

              <p><strong>Bama</strong>, recognized worldwide as the land of longevity, is located in the Bama Yao Autonomous County in <strong>Guangxi, China</strong>. As of January 2010, there were 90 centenarians living in Bama, making 36 centenarians for every 100,000 people—five times the international average.<br><br>In the past decade, Chinese and foreign researchers have studied the Bama residents to try to find out what is responsible for their longevity. Aspects such as genetics, geography, climate, environment, and food were studied. Researchers found the sun, air, water, magnetic field, and food to be the main contributors to their longevity.</p>

              <p><img class="full" src="http://s4.hubimg.com/u/7280379_f520.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="147"><br>Research scientists have identified the water from the Panyang River as 
              natural alkaline ion water which is rich in minerals. No wonder this 
              river is also called the "river of life".</p>
              <p><br><strong><br>Sun. </strong>The Bama sunlight index is special. The intensity of its infrared and ultraviolet lights is just right. The reason the elderly in Bama suffer no cardiovascular diseases has much to do with the sunlight index in that area.<br><br>Studies found that Bama has different sunlight indexes in different seasons. In order to get the best effect, one must engage in outdoor activities on a specific date, at a specific time, or during specific weather conditions. â€¨ â€¨<br><br><strong>Air.</strong> Bama’s air has a high concentration of negative oxygen ions. According to measurements, along the Bama Panyang River, there are up to 20,000 negative oxygen ions per cubic centimeter. In villages around the Panyang River there are up to 5,000 ions per cubic centimeter, many times higher than that of other industrial cities and rural areas.<br><br>Negative ions can effectively eliminate free radicals within a human body and <span style="color: #800080;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>maintain body fluids in a weak alkaline condition.</em></span></span> As a result, the body is protected against chronic diseases, especially cancer.<br><br><strong>Water. </strong>Bama’s water is unique. The water is naturally filtered through rivers and caves and forms in hexagonal crystals under a specific magnetic field. Hexagonal water is composed of six individual water molecules held together by common hydrogen bonds. This unique water enters the cells easily, enabling healthy metabolic activities. â€¨ â€¨<br><br><strong>Magnetic Field.</strong> Medical experts believe that the area’s geomagnetism is an important contributing factor in Bama’s longevity. The proper magnetic field can promote blood circulation, reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease, increase immunity, coordinate brain waves, and improve the quality of sleep.</p>
              <p><strong><br>Food.</strong> The food grown in Bama provides not only the right nutrients but also beneficial lactobacillus bacteria. This is why experts from all over Asia like to obtain bacteria from Bama.<br><br>The diet there is low in protein, fat, and cholesterol. People eat two meals a day. Some even eat only one meal a day. Most long-lived folks in Bama eat 1,400 to 1,500 calories per day.<br><br>In the Bama area, locally grown hemp seeds, tea, pumpkin, bamboo shoots, yellow corn, beans, potatoes, and whole grains provide organic and pollution-free green food for its residents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many scientists have visited over the years to try to find the answer 
                  but this is the local people’s discoveries and conclusions. Bama and its
                   villages are in remote a area with few factories or pollution.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><em>The 
                  river flows through a karst landscape and therefore the water is rich in
                   calcium carbonate and as a PH value of between 7.2 and 8.5. Weak 
                  alkaline ionized water can help maintain the acid-base balance of blood 
                  and bodily fluids makes the body more effective in resisting bacteria, 
                  viruses, inflammation and disease.</em></span></p>
              <p><br> Many people come here to collect the spring water. The air in the area 
                  is clean. The negative oxygen ions are per 3000 cubic centimeter along 
                  the river side which is 10 times the average value in big cities.</p>
              <p><br> The earth’s magnetism is 0.58 gauss which is twice the ordinary value. 
                  It is believed that an appropriate geomagnetic environment is will good 
                  for blood circulation and encourages a low rate of cardiovascular and 
                  cerebrovascular disease and the electromagnetic waves bring a better 
                  quality of sleep.</p>
              <p>The people of the area do mostly labor intensive work 
                  while their food is quite simple and vegetables are a large part of the 
                  diet. Their simple life is quiet and stress free.</p>

              <p>Not really a scam. It is an expensive water ionizer.You can get the same thing by adding baking soda to the water. Just like, you can use a broom to sweep the floor or you can buy a high-tech automatic AI robotic vaccum cleaner to clean the floor.</p>
