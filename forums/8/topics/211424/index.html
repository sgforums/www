I am only doing this because I have been forced to sit on my ass and write this crap up by my English HOD, and that I have also put down a forced-payment of SGD$10 just to sit for this quiz of yours.

One of my classmates lagi best, shaded his name as Fernando Torres (the Spanish football star).<br><br>I just got back my results today.<br><br>I got a distinction, narrowly missing out on a high distinction.
