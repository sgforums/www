              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">If you had bought travel insurance from
              MSIG Singapore and now you are feeling a blissful peace of mind that can go for
              your holidays covered against the medical expenses, unexpected disasters, and
              that your belongings are insured against theft or loss I’m going to have to
              spoil your good feel. You are going to be really fine as long as nothing
              happens to you – just as it would have been if you <em>didn’t</em> buy MSIG travel insurance. They will readily accept your
              application, of course, and immediately charge you the premium. But if you try to
              make a claim you are most likely going to find that the great service you had received
              from MSIG ended right at the moment you’d paid your money. Learn from my
              example.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I had bought the MSIG travel insurance
              several times; whenever I did I always chose their Premier Plan which offers
              the best coverage (read: You pay the highest premium). I never made a claim. I also
              bought the MSIG travel insurance Premier Plan before going to Austria in April
              2017. Unfortunately, a couple of very well-organised thieves stole mine and my
              wife’s hand luggage when we were on the train from Vienna to Salzburg. Vexed as
              we were, we filed a police report, went through all the necessary formalities, got
              the rest of our trip screwed up, and eventually came back home thinking naively
              that at least we had the insurance so we will be reimbursed for some of the
              loss. Nothing further from the truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I filled the claim form through the MSIG Singapore
              website within the time frame specified by them, submitted the copies of the
              required documents (proof of entry/exit to the foreign country, police report,
              and what-not) and waited for some reply from MSIG. The auto-response informed
              me that my “claim will be registered within 3 working days” and that I may be
              contacted by a MSIG Claims Officer to provide more details. To cut the long
              story short: Nine days after I submitted the claim I received an email that in
              order to enable MSIG review my claim I need to submit “more detailed circumstances
              leading to the loss”, “ownership of the stolen items”, receipts for the stolen
              items, and several more things. I replied within a few days describing in great
              detail how the theft happened and that I unfortunately didn’t have the receipts
              for the stolen items as most of them were not purchased recently (will you ever
              intend to make an insurance claim? Please make sure that you keep receipts for
              all the items you ever bought throughout your entire life – you would need
              them, apparently). I also asked them to advise how I could prove the ownership
              of the items that were stolen from me (after all it could have been me who
              stole the stuff from the shops and/or other passengers on the train, tried to pass
              them off as mine, and then file a reimbursement claim – such things must be
              happening all the time but it’s kept as a great secret by the insurance
              companies who are the only ones aware of such misdeeds).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The email I wrote was sent to MSIG
              Singapore on 15<sup>th</sup> of May – exactly six weeks ago. I thought I’d give
              them enough time to look into the case so I wasn’t pushing for any answers. But
              MSIG hasn’t bothered with replying – they simply ignored me. Not even an
              automated email that they were looking into the matter. Now, I understand that
              the insurance companies are not charities – they are there to make money. Fair
              enough. I would surely understand if my travel insurance by MSIG didn’t
              reimburse 100% of the contents listed in the police report as it could be
              argued that there was wear and tear on my stuff or that in case of cash stolen
              from me the only proof is my declaration made at the Austrian police station (mind
              you, such a declaration is made under oath so nobody in his right mind would be
              lying about it). But this is not the case with MSIG Singapore. They don’t even <em>pretend</em> that they are doing something
              about your case – they simply take your money and then they apparently feel
              that it’s not worth their precious time and resources to reply to your rightful
              claim. The arrogance of MSIG Singapore is staggering. Their lack of any
              response creates one impression: You don’t matter to them. Oh yes, you are most
              welcome to come to them and spend your money, that’s for sure. But MSIG is a
              big corporation with hundreds of employees, operating with huge amounts of
              money, while compared to them you are a little guy who is apparently perceived
              by them as no threat and hence of no importance. So they seemingly feel that
              they can be condescending and ignore you as they please.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">It’s never fun to have your stuff stolen.
              It actually feels much worse if you are travelling overseas. You are suddenly
              without the things you need to get back home – depending on how unlucky you
              were your passport, IC, driving licence, money, credit cards, phone, air
              tickets, hotel bookings, vouchers, and whatever else are gone. I’m not even
              talking about things which may cost less than a dollar but can be worth for you
              more than anything in life, like the only souvenir you had from your deceased
              parents. You think that buying travelling insurance will ease your burden and that
              in case of emergency you will be assisted to get home safely and then be reimbursed,
              at least in part, for your losses. Yes, that should certainly be the case. After
              all, the moment you pay and are issued with an insurance certificate, you and
              the insurance company enter a legally binding contract – as long as you don’t
              breach any rules you are supposed to be covered. But my case shows that MSIG Singapore
              apparently doesn’t feel this way and instead ignores a little guy.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">I hope that there are some better insurance
              companies out there who look into your valid case and do what they are supposed
              to do. But basing it on my experience I would strongly suggest that you look into
              other travel insurances instead of wasting your money on a company as arrogant
              as MSIG Singapore. Please help me spread this long post to warn the others
              about the way MSIG handled my case so nobody else gets conned by some worthless
              assurances.</span></p>
