            <div class='col-md body'>Leo Burnett Worldwide has unveiled the results of a proprietary global study of men's attitudes and values at the Cannes International Advertising Festival in its seminar, "Metros Versus Retros: Are Marketers Missing Real Men?"<br><br>In preparation for the seminar, the agency interviewed more than 2,000 men in 13 countries to explore the evolving state of masculinity around the world and explain the opportunities and challenges for marketers. Presented by Tom Bernardin, chairman and chief executive officer, Leo Burnett Worldwide; Mark Tutssel, deputy chief creative officer, Leo Burnett Worldwide; and Linda Kovarik, global planning director - Beauty Care, Leo Burnett Worldwide and director of planning for Japan; the seminar turns the gender table around following Burnett's 2004 Cannes presentation on advertising to women, "Miss Understood - She's Not Buying Your Ads."<br><br>"There has never been a more relevant time to reassess the state of masculinity, particularly as it affects buying patterns and trends in global marketing," said Bernardin. "While the world has been focused on women, men have been undergoing some significant changes of their own. An equally comprehensive look at men is long overdue, and it was our goal in Cannes to help put things in perspective. The last thing we want is to look back in ten years and find that we have unwittingly created the same clichÃ©s that female advertising is riddled with."<br><br>Identity Crisis<br><br>Overall, findings from the Leo Burnett Man Study highlight the disruption of men's sense of identity due to profound social and structural changes taking place across the globe. The study confirmed that men in most parts of the world are unsure of what's expected of them in society, with half of those surveyed saying they felt their role in society was unclear. Additionally, a stunning 74 percent said they believe the images of men in advertising are out of touch with reality.<br><br>"As the world is drifting toward a more feminine perspective, many of the social constructs men have taken for granted are undergoing significant shifts or being outright dismantled," said Bernardin. "It's a confusing time, not just for men, but for marketers as well as they try to target and depict men meaningfully."<br><br>Metros vs. Retros<br><br>The study revealed the existence of a "New Male Spectrum," characterized on one end by enlightened, evolved, modern men" what have been popularly dubbed "metrosexuals," and on the other end, entrenched, more traditionally masculine "retrosexuals" who cling steadfastly to stereotypical male behavior. Both groups are engaged by the gender debate and see themselves in terms relative to women: either they're more like women (Metros) or they're aggressively asserting their difference from women, (Retros).<br><br>The agency cautioned marketers against becoming fixated on these men who are adapting -or not- to women's new power and influence in society. According to the Man Study, fewer than 40 percent of men define themselves this way: the majority of men surveyed (60 percent) aren't caught up in this gender debate and live by a more traditional set of standards for assessing their masculinity. This larger group is more focused on defining themselves in the eyes of other men, largely by seeking respect and admiration for being successful in their professional life on one end of the spectrum, or their personal, family life on the other. The study dubs these men on the "Traditional Male Spectrum" as Power Seekers and Patriarchs, respectively, and contends they are largely overlooked by popular culture, the media and marketers.<br><br>Surprising Findings<br><br>In assessing men's attitudes and values, the study also uncovered some surprising findings. Men may be more sensitive than we give them credit for: the greatest insult to a man, according to those surveyed, is that "he'll never amount to anything" (29 percent), followed by "everyone laughs behind your back" (24 percent) and "you're stupid" (21 percent). Men may be less interested in money than happiness: study participants overwhelmingly said that they'd rather have a job they love (73 percent) vs. a job that pays well (27 percent). And they are torn when it comes to taking care of others vs. themselves: when asked about their ultimate male fantasy, those surveyed ranked "ending world hunger" (#1) and "being a world famous sports star" (#2) above "being married to a supermodel" (#3).<br><br>Study Conclusions<br><br>In light of these findings, the seminar offered several recommendations for marketers:<br><br>EMBRACE MALE COMPLEXITY: There's more to men than many of the media clichÃ©s and stereotypes suggest.<br><br>ANTICIPATE MALE ADAPTATION: Men are adapting all around the world, even in traditional societies and developing markets. It's part of how they cope with change.<br><br>LET THE PRIMAL MAN OUT TO PLAY: It's okay to indulge a man's sense of masculinity. This encompasses everything from using sex as a marketing ploy to locker room humor.<br><br>GRAB'EM BY THE BALLS: Create smart brand positionings and provocative imagery that register with a uniquely male point of view.<br><br>STOP LOOKING IN THE MIRROR OF TODAY: We need to consider how the changes in society are affecting changes in men. Advertising stays relevant by reflecting the zeitgeist.<br><br>Bernardin summarized the presentation as a wake-up call to the industry and at the end of the seminar, reiterated that marketers will miss real men if they don't tune in to how they are adapting to society's changes. He also encouraged the men in the audience to share their attitudes by taking the Leo Burnett Man Study. Additional findings will be unveiled during Advertising Week in New York City in September 2005.

            <div class='col-md body'>Imo, this should never have happened. I been pondering why my life was easier in SAF where majority are males. . Pondering it over myself , Let me explain:<br><br>In this age, women are independent, they know it themselves , but yet need a man who earn higher or more capable than them. So why the need for that?<br><br>When gender equality is already achieved, the social structure is changed. Women are no longer dependent on men . So society is to be a better with no class, status or earning prowess in choosing a mate 4 both  since this difference had been abolished, but its not happening.<br><br><strong>BUT</strong><br>The women's biological instinct to find a mate superior than herself takes over. How can the feminists address the issue? They cant and wont because the most powerful of all is nature. The reverse occuring on the men's side, when they try to do a traditional role as provider and caregiver, the woman's expectations higher expectations (as stated earlier) in today's new society becomes a hindrance for men to fulfill their roles.<br><br><strong>I guess the "successful" feminists did more harm than good. thnks to them, they have brought about major irreversible change in the world's social structure that can spell disaster. .</strong></div>
