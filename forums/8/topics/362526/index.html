              <p>Hey all... My very 1st post after viewing sgforums all the time =D</p>
              <p>Anyway im a 22 year old that previously had an attachment in Tokyo NEC before during school days... ever since that visit, i start to compare tokyo VS singapore.</p>
              <p>Tokyo people are less selfcentered at work... japanese believe in kaizen spirit... which NEC ppl actually likes me alot coz i can work like them and play like them... Japanese has this politeness that i really love alot. All 4 seasons... many many more...</p>
              <p>Don't know how many people here actually likes being spoon feed and have your life shield by Singapore. But don't you have this idiot feeling that ur life is being shield so you can live... not for yourself, but for Singapore...</p>
              <p>What is the point of living if you are not living properly... how many of you here has visited Tokyo before too and prefer to live there or how many prefer to stay in SG still.</p>
              <p>Im gonna serve my NS soon on the 9th June, after 2 years i feel like going over to tokyo with an amount to support me jobless for a minimum of 1/2 year and over there maybe start growing my roots again.</p>
              <p>Dear viewers do let me know what i miss out..</p>
              <p>E.g. Impossible to stay in tokyo for such a long period due to 10 years NS service in SG? Something SG has tokyo don't ? and many many more... im sure my idea actually has alot of flaws. TY TY ALL</p>

              <p>It is an interesting idea you have there, but I highly doubt most singaporeans <br>can move over there and take tokyo as their home.</p>
              <p>Japan is too different from Singapore in many ways, not only in terms of language and culture, but also the attitude of the people.</p>
              <p>Let me list some of the common and basic differences:</p>
              <p>1) Japanese people teach their children to be independent from young, hence their children are very independent, to the point where they can take the train by themselves for 15km+ to buy grocery at as young as 4 years old. Ask a singaporean child to do that, and you will be considered lucky if your child somehow manage to find their way home by themselves.</p>
              <p>In short, we are too spoon-fed to be able to adapt to the much tougher society over there where the people take care of themselves more than the government led them by the noses.</p>
              <p>2) Language problem. Japanese as a language is already not really that easy to learn, somemore one will have to learn how to differentiate between the different ways to write a single word, it will take a lot of time and patience for one to be able to truly communicate in propere japanese.</p>
              <p>3) Japanese people are very polite as compared to singaporeans as you have noticed yourself, to them, it is as bad as a sin not to be polite towards those around them, no matter how much they dislike them. Of course, the younger generation is slowly growing out of this tradition, but I will say their kids are still much polite than the Singaporean ones. If a Singaporean goes over there and does not pick up their habit fast, he/she will easily offend a lot of people.</p>
              <p>4) Singaporeans are very use to complaining about everything left and right, in Japan, they don't do this. Instead, they find innovative ways to solve whatever problems that they might have. Hence, their people often come up with a lot of interesting items and solutions to problems, whereas Singaporeans just keep up their whining about this and that without doing anything to make their own lives better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you have said so yourself, such a list will be nearly non-exhaustive, so I will just list these few points here. If you truly immigrate to Japan after your NS, I will say that you are truly an admirable and brave person, for you are willing to try and change your own life.</p>

              OMG forbidden sinner, well written there! impressive... im really bad with my words i guess. I feel the same for singaporeans, too spoon feed. Some people think that im ruining my life playing god to start my life all over again. But to me this is a respect my life deserve, to respectfully go according what my character is like... imagine a yellow dot on a red picture and a yellow dot on a yellow picture... i wanna be a blend in,  im given a title of excessive gesture(E.g. being not self centered, willful, disciplined, stupidly independent) in singapore
              
              Amazingly my attachment mentor are impressed by the speed i adapt to Nihongo and the fluent... as though i was born there, too much wishful thinking LOL!

              Ok saw it with my bro's comp already...
              Hmm ok maybe my current situation comes into the problem now
              Im 22 years old, going tru NS soon 9th june
              I have a loving girlfriend, average family
              I own a company with 3 other partners called Zenearh In-line
              A inline skating school taking west areas, conducting lessons and workshops for schools
              It's not about laying my roots there, i have confidence in my strong will
              It's now about uprooting this semi-deep root i have in singapore.... which person besides me will leave Singapore in current state other than me?
