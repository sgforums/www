I had a meeting with her and my friend on some dealings and witnessed her saying rude and terrible things to my friend such as "Your idea is just bu||shit!" etc.<br><br>Other people that I know from other companies who have dealings with my friend's company, have either seen the same thing or experienced it themselves.  None of us could stand this lady.  Of course, we all sympathised with this friend.<br><br>Recently, my friend tendered his resignation.  His last day was supposed to be somewhere in June.  He said that he could not take it anymore.  He just could not get along with the lady boss.  Though this boss likes him a lot (my friend is quite capable in his work, I must admit that), she gave him tonnes and tonnes of work to do.  (The reason for her to give him so much work is in the next paragraph).<br><br>But then hor.... on his last day, the lady boss could not find anyone as good to replace him.  She was desperate cuz she has promised too many things to the Board of Directors (This is according to another friend of mine from this same company) which she is relying highly on my friend in fulfilling them.  In the end, on the supposedly last day of my friend's employment there, she offered him about 70% increment.<br><br>Now my friend has decided to stay.  I have been asking him "You sure you won't tender again?"  He is also not sure.<br><br>If you were my friend, will you consider staying in this job????</div></blockquote>no consideration to this, i will definitely stay. first, a 70 percent increment is a lot man! it is alomst like double pay. oh my god.!<br>secondly, even if i nv stay in this job and work at other places, it dosen mean that i wun encounter such boss again. demanding bossses are everywhere so rather than finding another job, i might as well stay in here and once i earn enough money then i will buzz off.</div>

If we want nice colleagues (ie want to have friends), we can make some friends outside work and after work.  If we want a good environment (ie. a stress-less environment), we can always go home or go some place to relax after work.  Just close one eye, endure those few hours a day.  Just endure.  Who knows, maybe the bad boss dies tomorrow or gets fired.  But his pay still remains so much.  So why not stay.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
