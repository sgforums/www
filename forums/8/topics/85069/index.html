            <div class='col-md body'>"Get a high pay but a boss from hell." &lt;&lt; If the situation were this straightforward, I'd probably leave.<br><br>But for your friend's situation, the boss has acknowledged his work and has rewarded accordingly.  I think it's worth another try, never know... may have better opportunities within the company, or the boss may improve on her attitude if she thinks he is worth keeping on.  After all, he hasn't found a new job yet?  So could just hang on for awhile and earn the dough... if things turn bad again, still not too late to leave.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">My friend is now working under this lady boss, very fierce and unreasonable one.  I had a meeting with her and my friend on some dealings and witnessed her saying rude and terrible things to my friend such as "Your idea is just bu||shit!" etc.<br><br>Other people that I know from other companies who have dealings with my friend's company, have either seen the same thing or experienced it themselves.  None of us could stand this lady.  Of course, we all sympathised with this friend.<br><br>Recently, my friend tendered his resignation.  His last day was supposed to be somewhere in June.  He said that he could not take it anymore.  He just could not get along with the lady boss.  Though this boss likes him a lot (my friend is quite capable in his work, I must admit that), she gave him tonnes and tonnes of work to do.  (The reason for her to give him so much work is in the next paragraph).<br><br>But then hor.... on his last day, the lady boss could not find anyone as good to replace him.  She was desperate cuz she has promised too many things to the Board of Directors (This is according to another friend of mine from this same company) which she is relying highly on my friend in fulfilling them.  In the end, on the supposedly last day of my friend's employment there, she offered him about 70% increment.<br><br>Now my friend has decided to stay.  I have been asking him "You sure you won't tender again?"  He is also not sure.<br><br>If you were my friend, will you consider staying in this job????</div></blockquote>I will stay on in the job. The reason is because the boss is paying me well to look after his/her business. Hmm...well, the boss is under no obligations to please your friend in anyway. If your friend is really capable and needed by the company, I think your friend has a great future there. Relationship/friendship ties can be built over time...the lady boss is afterall a human with emotions and not a real devil from hell.<br><br>Continue working for the boss from hell as you also cannot be sure that the next employment will be better than this. Sometimes the grass on the other side does looks greener, but grass will eventually be grass...will not grow into flowers.</div>
