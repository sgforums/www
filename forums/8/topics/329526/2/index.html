            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Comic Sans MS;">A man found a cocoon of a butterfly. One day a small opening appeared; he sat and watched the butterfly for several hours as it struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it seemed to stop making any progress. It appeared as if it had gotten as far as it could and it could go no farther.<br><br>Then the man decided to help the butterfly, so he took a pair of scissors and snipped off the remaining bit of the cocoon. The butterfly then emerged easily. But it had a swollen body and small, shriveled wings.<br><br>The man continued to watch the butterfly because he expected that, at any moment, the wings would enlarge and expand to be able to support the body, which would contract in time.<br>Neither happened! In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a swollen body and shriveled wings. It never was able to fly.<br><br>What the man in his kindness and haste did not understand was that the restricting cocoon and the struggle required for the butterfly to get through the tiny opening were natureâ€™s way of forcing fluid from the body of the butterfly into its wings so that it would be ready for flight once it achieved its freedom from the cocoon.<br><br>Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our life. If nature allowed us to go through our life without any obstacles, it would cripple us. We would not be as strong as what we could have been.<br><br>And we could never fly.</span></p></div>

                                      chose to sit with me which makes me wonder if they’re just bend on
                                      making life of others difficult!" makes me wonder if they would even in the 1st place be considerate enough to do the same as you. </span></span></p>

              <p>Many ppl will think it is inconsiderate to ask them pay more, but i not supporting pubic transport to continue upgrade their buses and ask all of us to pay more again.</p>

              <p>Plump one most due to amt food you eat, just see USA country, those food share they consume are for two or more person. That why most of them are plump.</p>

              <p>Like ceecookie say, take taxi. plump will have a lot of room. If no money to pay taxi, just save some money not to buy so much food to eat.   </p>

              <p>Tat's not very helpful.  U hav not get some facts rite, havnt u? </p>
              <p>Some big sized pple are not big sized cos of the food tat they consumed, rather it's more of their hormones.  By eating less does not help to cut fats FYI, it wll onli slow down the metabolism.  Eating rite helps, but with everything being so expensive now, wanna eat healthy oso difficult. </p>
              <p>Takin cabs decrease the amount of walking, cabs can bring u rite to your exact destination.  So u r probably encouraging pple to get plump &amp; plump pple to get plumper?</p>

              <p>i fly regularly to the states and stop over in europe. during the european- US leg, i somehow am always between 2 rather XXL people who feel the need to stick their arms into my space... i have nothing against large sized people given that my family is full of them but when it is strangers, i draw the line...</p>
              <p>I paid as much as them for my seat, how come they are entitled to 130% of the seat while I am only given 40% (300% for 3 seats if my neighbours each take 130%, i am left with 40%)... i feel that they should be fair and pay for 2 seats since they deprive other passengers of their space.</p>

                                the first time this has happened to me. Imagine, youâ€™re sitting
                                quietly by yourself on the seat, the other side is vacant and
                                youâ€™re holding your bag, not putting on empty seat. Then came a
                                stranger who sit down beside you and pressed his body against yours
                                very hard that it hurts and expecting you to squeeze in more so
                                that your body is not exceeding the â€œmiddle lineâ€� that divides the
                                two-seater. When you asked him politely to stop squeezing as there
                                is really no space, he refused to listen and continued to squeeze.
                                After you alight the bus, he gives you an angry look as if youâ€™ve
                                seriously offended him and even pushed you as you tried to exit the
                                seat (youâ€™re sitting inside, heâ€™s sitting
                                outside).</span></span></p>

                                exactly what happened to me a few times on the bus. At those times,
                                there are other vacant seats around but those rude strangers just
                                chose to sit with me which makes me wonder if theyâ€™re just bend on
                                making life of others difficult!</span></span></p>

                                to be so plump that I occupied 130% of my part of the two-seater?
                                All plump ppl should not sit at all??</span></span></p>

                                they (like me) occupied more of their share on the seat. This is so

Damn sway, all peoples put their hand on the mouth and laughed. And fat aunty still got the gut to laugh at me too.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>i feel that the people who share seat with you will be thinking things like, wa lau no space, only got this seat with this fat person, aiya whatever la sit lor.</p>
              <p>this is the general, shallow perception of people lor, cant help it, the media and everything around us causes us to perceive fat = bad. you cant really put the blame on anyone but only on everyone.</p>
              <p>i guess the only solution i can come up with for you is try to just stand near the back of the bus lor, then wont have such situations where people will have a chance to hurt you because of your weight. as being at the back of the bus, wont block much people's way and stuff. aiya, i dont know lar, but i hope it helps.</p>
              <p>that said, i have many fat friends, and i always disturb them and shit, but its all in good fun, so..good luck</p>
