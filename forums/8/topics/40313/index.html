            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>If we got caught at the custom (Chkpoint) for poccession of a (one) pack of unopened cigerette, and they didn't fine us or tax us and let us go by taking down our name (for record purposes of vehicles and pple they had checked i think), does that mean that we are fine?<br><br>I believed if they were to take action for ONE SINGLE pack of unopen cigerette, it would be on the spot rite?<br><br>By the way, we emphasised that its for personal consumtion and just that its not open. Oh, by the way, 2 of us in M'sia, and we opened one pack of cigerette to share 1st, and keep one as spare.<br><br>Who know's so unlucky, got a 100% check on car and human.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>My friend had the unopened pack, just wanna confirm he'll be fine. 1st time got caught for one pack. Lucky its not one box! haha.....<br><br>Any1 knows or experience b4? Pls advise, thank you!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok...let me answer your questions...<br><br>first of all, you can be caught even if you only have one stick of duty unpaid cigarettes...and it'll cost you $100, just for that one stick...the figure is hard to explain, but normally, you'll be told that the first packet is $100, subsequent packs are $50 each...<br><br>if, let's say you are caught, and they let you go, dun thik that you are safe...customs officers will sometime conduct ad hoc operations at popular spots, coffee shops and etc...and if you did not pay the duty for the ciggy and you are caught, you'll be fined(this has happened before, no joke...some of the officers are hard up for cases)...even though the officers at the checkpoint let you off...to play safe, always insist on paying the duty involved, uness you are sure you'll be cautious enough to not let others know you're smoking duty unpaid ciggies...<br><br>for smuggling in a carton(normally, the customs will call it "box") or more, you'll be handcuffed, interviewed, and they'll go to your house/workplace to do a raid, and subsequently, you'll be charged in court...<br><br>how do i know? well, i was once a customs officer...</div>
