            <div class='col-md body'><p>Why Men are Childish<br><br>Wednesday, October 08 2008 @ 07:49 PM PDT<br>Men are childish because of women, or Darwin, or maybe both. <br><br>Women love children. This is good, because the human species would not have survived very long if we men had to take care of them. <br><br>Women seem programmed for it. It's reasonable to think that perhaps there is a genetic component; that this behavior is hardwired. <br><br>It's deep, that's for sure. Many a husband has found, with the arrival of his first child, that he is now running a distant second. Every eye movement, facial gesture, smile and even belch or burp is greeted with enthusiasm by the woman he married. An intelligent woman, able to discuss affairs of the day, scientific and intellectual, suddenly becomes perfectly happy to goo-goo in mindless abandon with the child. <br><br>It's probably an evolutionary thing. It makes sense that the babies who survived had mothers who were fascinated by their looks and behavior and both the mothers and the babies evolved to mutually reinforce this as a matter of species survival. <br><br>As women evolved to be fascinated with childish behavior, men were evolving as well. It's also a matter of species survival that women have to be attracted to men at least long enough to produce children. What better way to attract women than to plug in to attractions they already have? <br><br>So men evolved to have childish behavior and women evolved to mother their men. <br><br>At least until the first child comes along.</p></div>

              <p>perhaps true, but for some women, their bodies sorta go to a point of no return after giving birth, so it's not their fault that they don't look so gd.</p>

              <p>Why Men are Childish<br><br>Wednesday, October 08 2008 @ 07:49 PM PDT<br>Men are childish because of women, or Darwin, or maybe both. <br><br>Women love children. This is good, because the human species would not have survived very long if we men had to take care of them. <br><br>Women seem programmed for it. It's reasonable to think that perhaps there is a genetic component; that this behavior is hardwired. <br><br>It's deep, that's for sure. Many a husband has found, with the arrival of his first child, that he is now running a distant second. Every eye movement, facial gesture, smile and even belch or burp is greeted with enthusiasm by the woman he married. An intelligent woman, able to discuss affairs of the day, scientific and intellectual, suddenly becomes perfectly happy to goo-goo in mindless abandon with the child. <br><br>It's probably an evolutionary thing. It makes sense that the babies who survived had mothers who were fascinated by their looks and behavior and both the mothers and the babies evolved to mutually reinforce this as a matter of species survival. <br><br>As women evolved to be fascinated with childish behavior, men were evolving as well. It's also a matter of species survival that women have to be attracted to men at least long enough to produce children. What better way to attract women than to plug in to attractions they already have? <br><br>So men evolved to have childish behavior and women evolved to mother their men. <br><br>At least until the first child comes along.</p>

              <p>hmmmm.... i somewhat disagree with the part "women love children".</p>
              <p>not all women love children. some don't, probably because they find children noisy, troublesome and burdensome. </p>
              <p>and usually, these are the ones who don't want children, even after marraige. they just want to continue to enjoy freedom or a world for two only.</p>
              <p>it's something which i still don't quite comprehend till now.</p>
              <p>in that case, a marraige is not even necessary. just cohabiting will do.</p>

              <p>yeah some women dun like children... i have frens who dun intend to have kids at all... :/</p>
              <p>i tink cohabiting doesn't have the same commitment as marriage... it may be monogamous, but technically, both parties are free to go when the relationship runs its course. when pple get married, however, they make a vow... tho it doesn't mean much nowadays (with the increase in divorce rates), i'd like to tink tt it is smth more special than just two pple living together. it's also a commitment tt even if times are hard and the rs is on the rocks, the couple will still stay together and try to make things work (ideally speaking).</p>
              <p>also, marriage is not necessarily related to having children. it's supposed to be a shared bond between two pple. and this can exist with or without children.</p>
              <p>from the first post:</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; Men are childish because of women, or Darwin, or maybe both. </p>
              <p>it is ok to be <em>child-like</em> once in a while... lots of women like to mother men, and some men love it. i hope tt's what the article means rather than childish, as in emotionally immature. i dun tink we can blame the immature behaviour of men (e.g. self-centred and don't care for others) on women. but <em>child-like</em> is ok. quite cute sometimes.</p>
