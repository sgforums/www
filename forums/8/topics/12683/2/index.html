Do you think you have better suggestion?? Would you the pretty girl make the move to know him and accept him as your bf??? Even when he invite pretty girl online for a chat, think that so called pretty girl might just shun him.<br><br>If he managed to keep his wealth forever, his girl will stay with him forever too. If he managed to find among the many one girl that really love him after knowing his char, then wouldn't he at least had a chance to feel loved ?. True love sometime come after knowing each other.<br><br>If a guy din work hard, being poor, ugly and fat. Would he has any chance of experiencing true love, or at least knowing a pretty girl as his gf?? I guess not, there is not a single bit of chance that the girl will be interested to know him. Singapore is a materialistic world where sg girl look at guy with higher expectation than any others. Be it look, career, char or financial status, they want the best or at least better than their own current status. Which female executive ever show her interest to an ah-beng on the street? Even the ah-lian is trying to get a rich and stable husband in the end after they had enuff fun in the short relationship with the ah-beng who is jobless.<br><br>I have a real life example of friend whose bf, an ah-beng is doing all kind of odd-job and risky business investment. For 5 years, they had par tor and one day, the bf asked the girl to help him out with some heavy debt that he incurred due to poor investment in some business. The girl refused and also damn unhappy with his pathetic state. In the end, they broke off. The girl single again and hunting around for another prospective bf. After a few years, news of her ex-bf getting rich and marrying soon came to her. And now she blames herself for letting go of that 5 years relationship.<br><br>So i like to ask, if your bf is poor and asked you for a loan to clear his debt, would you lend it to him? Would you stick with him thru all the hardship? No $$ to buy flat, no $$ for wedding etc etc. Well, I would think some idealistic girls would ans yes but in practical, they might not be able to do so but put all the blame on the bf for being so useless. No one is perfect in this world but sometime expectation still hang too high.</div>

Good in what way?? Good in look, char or sex etc?? Good in what?? For this, you must ask the individual girl you are dealing with. Different girl has different meaning for good.<br><br>Being sweet to your sugar is your inner good if i presume. To some girl, it might be a plus point but this inner good is not visible to most girl. And hence that explain why you are not given a chance to prove yourself just becos you have no looks. Hence you seek and create chance liao also no use, sure kena negative reactions one.<br><br>So my advice is work on your outer look first if you wanna be given a chance. How?? either change your look or you have to be rich and hence look rich. My advice is you need to work on being rich. Cos changing your look also need $$$.<br><br>No look and fat never mind but you have to be rich. In tv e.g. HK series "Beautiful life", you learn that being a rich fat ugly sugar daddy, you get to keep so many "daughters". Even in real life, there are so many examples.<br><br>Just like what moose had said. First, must improve your looks, get a car and more credit cards. Once you got rich, you will have (rich) looks no matter how ugly and fat you look and girls will stick to you like super glue. Trust me. </div></blockquote>Sorry lor, if the girl just wants my $, i rather don want the girl lor...<br><br>My type of girl this those can live like simpe simple, not glamourous, have a simple 4 room flat and simple means of transport can liao, have our own job... etc etc *of coz these are until marriage*<br><br>If just steady, go out can don go expensive places, watch movies and supper like any other couples out there, then go for a romantic stroll on the beach and watch sunrise.<br><br>I wan that kinda feeling which, no $$ also will happy type. If u simply wants a girl to look at your false image of being rich *act rich* just for that moment of glamour, sorry lor, i'm not like u lor.<br><br>And lastly, i don believe must have 4Cs then can find stead lor...</div>

Do you think you have better suggestion?? <strong>i rather be myself, and no stead, to keep my pride and priciples</strong> Would you the pretty girl make the move to know him and accept him as your bf??? Even when he invite pretty girl online for a chat, think that so called pretty girl might just shun him. <strong>we'll see abt that in 3 months</strong><br><br>If he managed to keep his wealth forever, his girl will stay with him forever too. If he managed to find among the many one girl that really love him after knowing his char, then wouldn't he at least had a chance to feel loved ?. True love sometime come after knowing each other. <strong>$$ love and true love is 2 different issues! think u know nuttin abt love...</strong><br><br>If a guy din work hard, being poor, ugly and fat. Would he has any chance of experiencing true love, or at least knowing a pretty girl as his gf?? I guess not, there is not a single bit of chance that the girl will be interested to know him. <strong>Hard to say</strong> Singapore is a materialistic world where sg girl look at guy with higher expectation than any others. Be it look, career, char or financial status, they want the best or at least better than their own current status. <strong>i agree this, but then if you are considering marriage, then u have to consider these points, but being just steady, i don think that these points are important, if not instantly, u can see that the girl is after your $$ during the puppy love period</strong> Which female executive ever show her interest to an ah-beng on the street? Even the ah-lian is trying to get a rich and stable husband in the end after they had enuff fun in the short relationship with the ah-beng who is jobless. <strong>hard to say lor, u can say change from poor man behind a rich man's mask liao, why can't a ah lian hide behind a rich girl's mask?</strong><br><br>I have a real life example of friend whose bf, an ah-beng is doing all kind of odd-job and risky business investment. For 5 years, they had par tor and one day, the bf asked the girl to help him out with some heavy debt that he incurred due to poor investment in some business. The girl refused and also damn unhappy with his pathetic state. In the end, they broke off. The girl single again and hunting around for another prospective bf. After a few years, news of her ex-bf getting rich and marrying soon came to her. And now she blames herself for letting go of that 5 years relationship. <strong>eh eh eh i think u giving us this example like very Kua Zhang leh.. i and abit fat and not very yandao, but i am not poor until like that ok? I have qualifications one ok? I after ORD still wanna study poly one ok???? KAOZ!</strong><br><br>So i like to ask, if your bf is poor and asked you for a loan to clear his debt, would you lend it to him? Would you stick with him thru all the hardship? No $$ to buy flat, no $$ for wedding etc etc. Well, I would think some idealistic girls would ans yes but in practical, they might not be able to do so but put all the blame on the bf for being so useless. No one is perfect in this world but sometime expectation still hang too high.<strong>i die also i won go ah long, if i have a wife, i will not let her suffer, i will have a stable career/house then i make her my wife.</strong></blockquote></div>
