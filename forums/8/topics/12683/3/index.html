            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kyo23:</div><div class="quote_body"> For the case of a guy who described himself as no look, fat and no girl interested to know his inner goodness. Do you think you have better suggestion?? Would you the pretty girl make the move to know him and accept him as your bf??? Even when he invite pretty girl online for a chat, think that so called pretty girl might just shun him.<br><br>If he managed to keep his wealth forever, his girl will stay with him forever too. If he managed to find among the many one girl that really love him after knowing his char, then wouldn't he at least had a chance to feel loved ?. True love sometime come after knowing each other.<br><br>If a guy din work hard, being poor, ugly and fat. Would he has any chance of experiencing true love, or at least knowing a pretty girl as his gf?? I guess not, there is not a single bit of chance that the girl will be interested to know him. Singapore is a materialistic world where sg girl look at guy with higher expectation than any others. Be it look, career, char or financial status, they want the best or at least better than their own current status. Which female executive ever show her interest to an ah-beng on the street? Even the ah-lian is trying to get a rich and stable husband in the end after they had enuff fun in the short relationship with the ah-beng who is jobless.<br><br>I have a real life example of friend whose bf, an ah-beng is doing all kind of odd-job and risky business investment. For 5 years, they had par tor and one day, the bf asked the girl to help him out with some heavy debt that he incurred due to poor investment in some business. The girl refused and also damn unhappy with his pathetic state. In the end, they broke off. The girl single again and hunting around for another prospective bf. After a few years, news of her ex-bf getting rich and marrying soon came to her. And now she blames herself for letting go of that 5 years relationship.<br><br>So i like to ask, if your bf is poor and asked you for a loan to clear his debt, would you lend it to him? Would you stick with him thru all the hardship? No $$ to buy flat, no $$ for wedding etc etc. Well, I would think some idealistic girls would ans yes but in practical, they might not be able to do so but put all the blame on the bf for being so useless. No one is perfect in this world but sometime expectation still hang too high.</div></blockquote>LiL^Jap^Doll says "Tis is my new nick."<br>&amp; she says "Honestly,i dun remember u mentioning in ur earlier post tat the guy was ugly &amp; fat....NE WAY,who said FAT &amp; UGLY guys got no1 2 love??? I've seen FaT &amp; UgLY guys who dun look rich(but mayb rich) but got stead (some fat &amp; ugly) also......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, let's get this straight.<br>wat's the big deal bout finding a good guy?<br><br>U gals sure u want good guys? well get ur definition of gd guys correct first.<br>what are they?<br>Like wat kyo said?<br>Good Looking? Finanically strong? Good characters(good to family,frz and u?)? Fit?<br>Loyal to u?<br>Hey hey hey, come back to planet Earth ladies!! these typical guys only exist in fairy tales! No such guy can exist with all the attributes above! Coz those characteristic that r listed above tends to be corresponding like the sine and cosine angle. u either have one n u dun have e other.<br><br>For example, good character. Some gals say that they want their stead to be one super gentleman. veri caring for them. veri loyal to them. hey hey hey, but later they might fall for another guy who is more humourous, and more notorious. Ever heard of the saying ," na ren bu huai, lu ren bu ai?" haha..guys that r so holy, innocent undoubtably sometimes get teased for being too 'straight' like a wooden block and so uninteresting. so wat do u want? a guy who is holy, innocent but sometimes not so innocent and tells u dirty jokes when u're feeling bored and down? or someone who is super rich but busy due to his work commitments (to maintain his wealth) that he finds no time to make a simple gift for u for ur BDay?<br>how can assure that a handsome, wealthy guy that treats u veri nice oways that everybody is jealous would not one day commit another relationship with another gal behind ur back?<br><br>thus, conclusion. Perfect good guys exist onli in fairy tales. but no bad guys do exist meaning they may have more of the above qualities then the above flaws.<br><br>and oh btw, those things could apply to gals too hahaah....does good gals exist? hmmmm...depends on how u classified a gd gal or guy or watever loh. u want rich? looks? character? all?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is a interesting topic but it is weird how gals will always tell u what a good guy u r when both of u cannot get together as couple and they will always say that there is a better gal out there for u.<br>the question that crosses my mind is that does that mean that i gotta keep staying single till a gal dun tell me that or till i die, depends on which is sooner.<br>it is sad cause good guys usually stay lonely and sad till someone spots them for what they r but nowadays they usually become gay before that happens so gals will start to lament abt how there r no good guys ard so i guess it will juz b a on going vicious cycle.</div>
