One day, while<br>&gt; &gt;trying to make a living for his family, he heard a cry for help coming<br>&gt; &gt;from a nearby bog. He dropped his tools and ran to the bog.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;There, mired to his waist in black muck, was a terrified boy,<br>&gt; &gt;screaming and struggling to free himself.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Farmer Fleming saved the lad from what could have been a slow and<br>&gt; &gt;terrifying death.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The next day, a fancy carriage pulled up to the Scotsman's sparse<br>&gt; &gt;surroundings. An elegantly dressed nobleman stepped out and introduced<br>&gt; &gt;himself as the father of the boy Farmer Fleming had saved.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"I want to repay you," said the nobleman. "You saved my son's life."<br>&gt; &gt;"No, I can't accept payment for what I did," the Scottish farmer<br>&gt; &gt;replied, waving off the offer.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;At that moment, the farmer's own son came to the door of the family<br>&gt; &gt;hovel.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;"Is that your son?" the nobleman asked.<br>&gt; &gt;"Yes," the farmer replied proudly.<br>&gt; &gt;"I'll make you a deal. Let me provide him with the level of education my<br>&gt; &gt;son will enjoy. If the lad is anything like his father, he'll no doubt<br>&gt; &gt;grow to be a man we both will be proud of."<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;And that he did.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Farmer Fleming's son attended the very best schools and in time, he<br>&gt; &gt;graduated from St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, and went on<br>&gt; &gt;to become known throughout the world as the noted Sir Alexander<br>&gt; &gt;Fleming, the discoverer of Penicillin.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Years afterward, the same nobleman's son who was saved from the bog was<br>&gt; &gt;stricken with pneumonia. What saved his life this time?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Penicillin.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;The name of the nobleman? Lord Randolph Churchill.<br>&gt; &gt;His son's name? Sir Winston Churchill.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Someone once said: What goes around comes around.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;*****<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;Work like you don't need the money.<br>&gt; &gt;Love like you've never been hurt.<br>&gt; &gt;Dance like nobody's watching.<br>&gt; &gt;Sing like nobody's listening.<br>&gt; &gt;Live like it's Heaven on Earth.<br></div>
