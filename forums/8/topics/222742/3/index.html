Forcing her to quit is a selfish act and mostly, this kind of r/s will not stay strong when you find other flaws with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>It depends on what's the reason for wanting the person to quit. The idea of 'forcing' is rather subjective in itself.<br><br>The person may want you to quit smoking for your own good rather than for themselves. And it's not limited to just smoking, it can be any particular habit or flaw or whatever.<br><br>To conclude that forcing a person to quit is selfish is a really wrong thing to say. A mother would say tell the child to stop smoking if she knows smoking is bad for health. So is the mom being selfish?<br><br>And you say such a relationship won't last? When it's built on care and concern? I think not, at least, the reason won't be due to lack of care. But if one party is nitpicking the other in a relationship, then the problem in the first place isn't with whether or not one of them is a smoker or not.<br><br>Quite simply, the person may want you to quit simply for your own good.</div>
