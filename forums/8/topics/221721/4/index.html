I was under the impression that racism might rear its ugly head once again.<br><br>Put put it briefly I find certain views, especially those of people like Xiaxue (when she blogs on this matter), while rather loud and vocal... betrays an immature understanding of the matter.<br><br>When we have poor workers who come here to make a living, in a country where they do not see their loved ones, have little rights, exposed to hard work for a thin salary... not to mention being tempted by all kinds of vices... I am not exactly surprised some might go down this path. People like Xiaxue should really be looking into the main issue of the thing and really thinking about what needs to be done instead of crying for a ban of certain groups of people during the holidays or for people to beat them up.<br><br>Of course, gentlemen should always defend the honour of a lady and if need be. But being a human being is so much more then that. I am not entirely content to lay all the blame on a few errant workers unless we as a soceity have treated and regarded them with the respect that they ought to have gotten.</div></blockquote>haha... dude....
