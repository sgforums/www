Its not a matter of which nationals doing it. Anyone who does it (for too long) is wrong.<br><br>And I also agree with coolgeek84 regarding the gal's dressing. I mean, if you are prepared to reveal so much of yourself to others, be prepared for more people shifting their glance at you. If you are uncomfortable with it, dun show us too much and cover up. Dress as needed and wear appropriate clothes. Easy solution would be to bring along a jacket. (Firstly, most girls would usually find it cold easily, thus its handy. Secondly, you can use it to cover up when you think people are looking at the wrong area of your body.) Its only natural when guys look at girls who are revealing themselves. And girls, com'on. you all look at other girls as well. not only guys.<br><br>But then again, I am not saying that staring is fine. Excessive staring is still wrong. Stealing a few glances IMHO, is still acceptable.</div>

I wasn't wearing short skirt k? not even skirt.. again, i was wearing jeans. with a long top (u know that kind that looks a bit like dress, only a bit shorter). The only "sexually inviting" i can think of regarding that day's outfit is that the top is sleeveless. not even spaghetti straps k?!<br><br>So, what i wanna say is, it's not always the case of the girl wearing too skimpy clothings that she kena stared k!</div></blockquote>maybe you are just too beautiful for them to take their eyes off you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>well, there are always decent men and indecent men around.
