Never see that you copy and pasted before I posted my replies.. haha..<br><br>Anyway, yeah, as others have been saying, we can't prevent some guys (who might be just plain despos) from staring at you (or other gals) even though if you are dressed with everything covered up properly. So whats the best thing gals can do in the event that ANY male is found staring at them?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If in bus, inform the bus driver if it is convenient to do so.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Try to shift location to a place where there are more gals or a place where you think the guys are more decent or use them to "shield" yourself.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Always carry a jacket with you. (I like this one)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Go and confront the guy/ah peh/bangla/whoever. From what I believe, most of the times they will be damn scared one. lol<br>Ok the ones following below are jokes (i.e. not meant to be taken seriously, duh.)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Show middle finger to the other person.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Whip out your phone and start talking in a manly voice!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Go nearer to the person, take out your phone and start saying into the phone something like "Hello, Police?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm I am surprised that the talk here has been rather sensible and moderate... I was under the impression that racism might rear its ugly head once again.<br><br>Put put it briefly I find certain views, especially those of people like Xiaxue (when she blogs on this matter), while rather loud and vocal... betrays an immature understanding of the matter.<br><br>When we have poor workers who come here to make a living, in a country where they do not see their loved ones, have little rights, exposed to hard work for a thin salary... not to mention being tempted by all kinds of vices... I am not exactly surprised some might go down this path. People like Xiaxue should really be looking into the main issue of the thing and really thinking about what needs to be done instead of crying for a ban of certain groups of people during the holidays or for people to beat them up.<br><br>Of course, gentlemen should always defend the honour of a lady and if need be. But being a human being is so much more then that. I am not entirely content to lay all the blame on a few errant workers unless we as a soceity have treated and regarded them with the respect that they ought to have gotten.</div>
