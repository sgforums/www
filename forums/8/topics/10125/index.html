I dont know, if that is the case let me point out certain things.<br><br>rem the skid marks. Few days before the crash another plane have make the some mistake on clear weather. but lucky spot the mistake in time to skip to the other runway. So why issit the runway not close yet? they waiting for accident to happen?<br><br>I dont not think that the pilot is solely at fault. the base crew can say due to foul weather unable to see the plane which so much bigger than the crane on the runway.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good Article,<br>Finally, someone spoke behalf of the pilots... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>______________________________________________________________________<br><br>Why are pilots taking all the blame?<br><br>THE Eyeball forums are still burning with posters indignant that the pilots are being made to shoulder all the blame for the crash of Flight SQ006. They turned their attention on the Taiwanese authorities and airport officials.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; NO NEED TO PUNISH THEM<br>&gt; &gt;<br>WHY is SIA taking all the blame? Why are the Taiwan aviation authorities totally freed of blame?<br><br>There seems to be great alacrity in pointing the finger at ''pilot error''. But what made an experienced pilot commit such an mistake?<br>Taiwan points to the fact that the pilot had used that particular airport 10 times - enough to familiarise himself with it.<br><br>But an expert interviewed on CNA, Andrew Brookes, has commented that 10 times isn't a lot in a pilot's flying life.<br>Brookes has also said that the fact that the runway was lit made for an accident waiting to happen.<br>If the runway had to be lit for other purposes (it was used as a<br>taxiway), a sign saying ''Runway Closed'' should have been displayed,<br>or the authorities could have used radio to warn pilots about<br>the closed runway to make sure they weren't using it.<br><br>The ''black box'' recordings indicated that wasn't done with the SIA flight. There's also speculation that the pilot saw a ''5'' on the sign and an ''L'', but didn't notice the other letters and numbers on<br>the sign. Thinking he was on the correct runway, he took off. The two<br>conflicting signs read 5R-23L and 5L-23R. Even if a pilot was familiar<br>with such signs, the low visibility might lead to errors in reading<br>them.<br><br>Imagine the guilt and anguish the pilots have to live with. And there's talk about charging them. I hope it doesn't happen.<br>What's done is done, and punishing someone when there is no issue of deterrence goes against the philosophy of the law.<br>Taking into account all the factors - including the raging typhoon and the arguably sub-standard airport - what good can come from punishing the three pilots?<br><br>CHASINGJACKETS<br>WHY NO GROUND RADAR?<br><br>WHEN the Taiwanese learnt that SQ006 indeed took off from the wrong runway, they immediately dismissed any possibility that the airport should shoulder any responsibility for the crash.<br>It is a shame indeed.<br>For a country that is hit regularly by typhoons and storms, it seems inexplicable that no ground radar has yet been installed at the airport.<br>Unlike the very defensive Taiwan airport authorities, SIA has said it will take full responsibility.<br>But one should not forget that a safe airline also needs a safe airport to operate with.<br>If the Taiwan airport does not improve its safety measures, sooner or later, another accident will happen.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; ULTRAMANANG<br>&gt; &gt; CHARGE THE AIRPORT<br>&gt; &gt;<br>A SUCCESSFUL take-off depended on the pilot and the control tower. The pilots weren't the only ones at fault in the SQ006 accident.<br>The control tower gave the ''clear to take-off'' signal when it couldn't see where SQ006 was, or where it was headed.<br>That signal cannot be given based on the assumption that the pilot ought to know what he's doing.<br>The fact that the air traffic controller was allowed emergency leave last Thursday, when investigations were under way, only raises<br>suspicion.<br>How can a key person in this accident be ''unavailable'' for interview? Let the victims claim for all they are or were worth.<br>But make sure the airport pays half of every dollar SIA gives in compensation to the victims.For every negligence and/or manslaughter charge brought against SIA, let there be an equivalent brought against<br>Chiang Kai Shek International airport.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>surfer i agree with you. but the lamest excuse they can give was they cant see due to foul weather but the pilot should be able to see the sign in such condition.....<br><br>think again</div>
