            <div class='col-md body'>Well, just to bring up an accident that happened in Taiwan.<br><br>There was an article written in ZaoBao not long ago. The person was not from Singapore but had stayed in Taiwan years ago.<br><br>When he was there, there was this interesting accident. There was some roadwork on this highway and it went on for quite some time. Unlike Singapore, where there are always signs metres ahead of the roadwork to indicate that construction was going on, THERE WASN"T ANY SIGN.<br><br>Somehow, drivers along that road knew about the roadwork, except for on taxi driver. That taxi crashed into that big hole in the middle of the road and was badly damaged. Of cos, the driver tried to sue the relevant governmental department for this accident, but guess what the officials said?<br><br>"There are so many vehicles driving along that road and none fell into that hole. Who asked you to?"<br><br>Well, is the Taiwanese trying to imply this for SIA? Every airplane knew that the 5R runway was close and although that nite was stormy, why must it be an SIA plane that went into the wrong runway?</div>
