              <p>If you use internet extensively and you enjoy it really, then its alright.</p>
              <p>But you have to know that you still have to go out there in the real world to socialise real time simply because it is useful.</p>

              <p>LOL... funny that people of this age still have this thinking. In the past it may be true because technology wasn't that advanced then.</p>
              <p>Now? Not really so, unless you are a computer addict. What defines your life is you. If you choose to do nothing except staying in front of your PC, then that's your problem. You need to do something to improve it. Staying in front of it isn't good for health. Your eyes, your back, your hands particularly.</p>

              A lot of you don't realise something, online doing what?
              
              If do nothing but ban people for fun then I'd say there are better things to do, whether online or offline.
              
              There are many reasons for being online for long periods, some times it's required for part of your life offline. It's not just about quantity, it's also about quality.
              
              Also, whether a person has life or not differs between people. It's a matter of what is considered life to you. To some, having a life means screwing around or in the case of some, finding trouble for others. Ultimately it's about what being infront of a comp or being online does for you.

              <p>What's having a life to you?</p>
              <p>1. Going out, movies, dinner at fancy restaurants, shopping as an when u like?</p>
              <p>2. Making alot of money, monitoring business, stockmarkets?</p>
              <p>3. Living in a penthouse, overlooking the sea?</p>
              <p>4. Playing golf, surfing, wakeboarding?</p>
              <p>5. Climbing the mountains, treking in 3rd world countries?</p>
              <p>6. Helping the poor and sick?</p>
              <p>7. Making money by soccer betting?</p>
              <p>8. etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of our defination of life is not defined by ourselves, but rather from what we see, hear and got influenced from advertisments. Citibank's version might be golfing, being rich, staying in a great condo, driving a fast car. M1's version will be going out, being happy in the sun. Some documentaries may show youths skateboarding throughout the night without a care in the world, other shows may present being a inventor, inventing creative technologies from secondary times, spending their life in reseach. Other shows may be "having life" being some1 with an outlaw attitude, acting cool, smoking, drugs, lots of gals, easily provoked, etc.</p>
              <p>What is your defination of "having a life"?</p>
              <p>Some enjoy their work as a social worker with mininum pay. Some enjoy golfing, yet some play golf for the sake of it. Some may enjoy surf net the whole day, others may be spending time with friends the whole day. Yet there are others who enjoy "getting gals" at a club,  and there are people who love treking to the himalayans.</p>
              <p>What is life to you may not be life to other people. As defined by a business associate of mine sometime ago, "having life" is doing what u truely enjoy. It's not about what your friends say, or what the advertisements advertised.</p>
              <p>In this new age world of ours where we are bombarded every minute with information on others'impression of what is a quality life, do we still have the capability to choose, to listen to ourselves what is life to us</p>

              <p>Anyhoooo it depends. If you make a conscious decision to be online (for instance I'm online because I'm really bored at work), and you segregate your life into virtual and real-life sections, whatever the focus it's still a lifestyle choice.</p>

              <p>I m bout the same here but already working for quite a few years already, I just find that going out is a chore ,squeezing into mrts, waiting for the damn buses, get caught in the rain. Really dun like crowded places and I have almost no interest in buying stuffs or shopping so other than looking at pretty girls there isn't much incentive to go out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>movies?</p>
              <p>can watch online for free wat <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
