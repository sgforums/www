Also where the monk get the money?<br>Donation?</blockquote>Obviously. Monks only live on donation what..<br><br><blockquote>For broadcasting of chanting sutras in the temple?</blockquote>Much more than that, of course. Anyone who has been to a dharma center or a monastery should know what activities are going on there -- like dharma talks, meditation classes, youth classes, and lots and lots of various activities.<br><br>Electronics may be used for<br><br>1) Video recording of dharma talks or events (very common)<br>2) Audio recording of dharma talks (also very common)<br>3) Making Buddhist music (also very common)<br>4) Administrating Buddhist websites and forums and etc (also very common)<br>5) Communication, e-mail, etc (obviously very common)<br>6) Typing documents and articles -- bulletins, buddhist magazines and books, etc etc<br><br>And much, much more.<br><br><blockquote>But was it really necessary to spend that kind of wasteful money assuming that money was from the donation?</blockquote>Obviously they have their own reasons and purposes -- just that you never ask them and assume too much.<br><br><blockquote>And <strong>IF</strong> really a necessity for the temple why not get those donors to get it for the temple instead of the monk going to get it himself?</blockquote>It is difficult to communicate with everyone what they want. Anyway the money is all donated by the donars also mah. Also, maybe the lay follower was there also - but just got the monk to come along.<br><br><blockquote>Weren't monks supposedly to be 'si da jie kong'? IPOD is a branded electronic item. The monk should not be buying branded stuffs when their teaching was to live as simply and hassle free as possible.</blockquote>I would agree not to rely too much on branded, but from my experience the iPod is worth every single cent for the quality and features... I didn't buy it just because of brand. The local brand Creative is even more expensive.<br><br><blockquote>And that brought us to the question of buying it as presents for families or even the orphanage. Why the need for such indulgence?</blockquote>These are only a few examples. Maybe buy for Buddhist schools leh? Anyway within Buddhist organisations they already need such things for various purposes.<br><br><blockquote>Sure, the families , friends or the orhphange live in a modern world but wouldn't it be more worthy of the monk by imparting/impounding his teaching/the sutras to his families or friends? That would be more beneficial to them and also to himself since he was helping others to recognize their true self and also helping them to accumulate good karma not to mention for himself as well?</blockquote>These equipments may precisely be used for spreading the teachings.</div>

Anyway it is quite rude to reject a lay person's offering unless it is really against Buddhist rules... I think a car used for convenience should be ok.. the reason why a Buddhist monk won't anyhow reject people's offerings is because according to Buddhist teachings we shouldn't just anyhow deny someone's good-will and merit making opportunity.. and especially he his intent and willingness is strong.. it's also just not so nice.</div>

A fake monk would just use his convenience to buy 4D when he passes the shop... he wouldn't bother travelling miles away back to his place to change. He doesn't have the pressure of 'being disrobed' -- he isn't a monk to begin with, he is just on a commercial trip to beg as much money as possible from ignorant people. He can let all the people see him in his monks robes and no one would give a damn... which would be a very different case for a real monk, who will get into serious trouble.<br><br>A real monk, however, would simply not be so stupid.. I doubt there is any way a real monk can ever buy 4D. Even if, presumably, there is really such an 'impossible-case' monk that wishes to do it, he would not be wearing robes to avoid suspicion, or simply get someone else to do it for him.</div>
