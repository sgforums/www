From my experience when vast majority of the christians talk about monks or others from other religions their motives of doing so are questionable, and this Aloof is no exception.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

So this explains why you are bias against monks!!!!  I don't think Christianity teach one to be bias against one another.  love your enemy says Jesus, ha ha ha!!!!   And christianity also teaches christians, pastors not to judge, so ????   how sure are you that no pastors lust for such materialism?  how you explain that pastor who buys branded goods to pamper his wife?   If christianity teaches christians not to be materialistic all the more the pastor should not buy branded stuff just to pamper the wife.    Do not judge or you will be judged that is what the bible says, so practise it christian!  if you christians want to win souls then practise what your bible teaches you lah!<br><br>Eg - if a monk (in general) has the money as a gift from someone and he goes spend and buy something that a dying girl wants so much, so cannot meh!!!!  </div></blockquote>Yes i am a christian but that doesnt mean im bias.

Your motive of starting this thread is very questionable, you are obviously faultfinding!!!!   Go pray to your god lah, ask your god to stop you from finding fault in others.  in the bible it talks about finding prank in the eye of the other but not your own, and you are just doing this!  Go practise all that is taught in the bible before you question the monk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No need to ban anyone lah. When different views were being shared sometimes the temperature unexpectedly raised too.

Monks obviously do not do such things -- beware of such fake monks.<br><br>Regarding donation, monks very very rarely do it outside. <strong>And those monks that beg for alms (Theravada monks) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cannot receive any money. They can only beg for food</span></strong>.And they cannot do it after 12 p.m, so if you see them in afternoon or night asking for anything except medicine, they're fake. Also the monks require permits to beg for alms, you can ask them to show their permit.<br><br>edit: p.s fake monks are like damn common nowadays (see: <a href="http://buddhism.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=219659" rel="nofollow">Fake monks</a>/<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=219537" rel="nofollow">Conman monk kena pwned</a>)</div>
