Pastors are not restricted to celibracy unlike monks. They tend to have children and are paid reasonably hence having the purchasing power to buy items such as ipods and a car.<br><br>Monks on the other hand, live in the temple and has his whole life dedicate to their religion.

I don't think Christianity teach one to be bias against one another.  love your enemy says Jesus, ha ha ha!!!!   And christianity also teaches christians, pastors not to judge, so ????   how sure are you that no pastors lust for such materialism?  how you explain that pastor who buys branded goods to pamper his wife?   If christianity teaches christians not to be materialistic all the more the pastor should not buy branded stuff just to pamper the wife.    Do not judge or you will be judged that is what the bible says, so practise it christian!  if you christians want to win souls then practise what your bible teaches you lah!<br><br>Eg - if a monk (in general) has the money as a gift from someone and he goes spend and buy something that a dying girl wants so much, so cannot meh!!!!</div>
