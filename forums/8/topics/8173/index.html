            <div class='col-md body'>As I was walking my way home at night, I went pass a multistorey carpark...as usual, I have to plan my journey, should I go forward into the multistorey carpark and descend from there or down a slope to the vehicle lane?<br><br>I went down a slope, maybe I was afraid of the dark, but whatever, as I walk past the carpark, infront of me a motorcycle shone its lights. as it zips past me into the carpark, I notice that the rider did not wear a helmut. He had a normal chinese face, his build is slightly above average but slender profile. He gave me the conclusion: If a person of his profile hits somebody, he doesn't care about his own safety as well.<br><br>As the motorcycle went into the carpark, this time a car went past ahead me from my back, It was a large car, those big boxy types, I looked at the driver, she is a woman with a slender profile as well, her height slightly more than mine(1.6?m), a build not stronger. I draw this conclusion from this driver: If she hits a person, she will pack a big punch because of the POWER of her car. If I got hit by her car, I would be flung very far...<br><br>As I crossed the minor road to reach my block where I live, I have to cross a vehicle lane as well. Just before crossing, my right view was blocked by a container, a car suddenly went past. I look at the driver and I saw a woman, her cheeks are rosy and I guess her build is of above average(plum). She did not even horn when she went past the blocked view(she could have knocked me down!). The conclusion I draw is this: For a person of her build, she doesnt care if she hits anyone.<br><br>Readers, would you like to comment?<br><br>My hope is I do not know a friend such as case 1 or even marry a woman close to case 2 and case 3.<br><br>Margaret Thatcher: "If civil servants are any good at all, they wont be civil servants"<br><br>Nothing matters!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
