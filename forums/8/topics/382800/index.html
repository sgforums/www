              <p><a href="http://naveensmadramblings.blogspot.com/2007/03/indians.html"></a>Indian expats: How separate are they?<br>Basically the article is about the rift between local indians and expat indians. The writer wrote that these indians cant integrate into Singapore because singaporean indians cant accept them due to the fact that they tend to live more wealthy. They dine at Rang Mahal live in districts 9,10 and 15. Shop at Mumbai se and what not. They say quote " i feel that the community doesn't actually like to interact or mingle with us in spite of my friendly gestures. There's a bit of warmth lacking"- Dr. Suchitr Kataria.<br><br>Now i personally found this hilarious. I'm a third generation Singaporean. My grandparents were born here, my parents were born here and i was born here. Its really very rare to find a third generation Singaporean cause most Singaporeans have grandparents who emigrated here.<br>But thats beside the point.I buy my clothes from BritishIndia. I dine at Rang Mahal or other restaurants like Vaanch or at Hai Tien Lo every fortnight. I live in district 15 and i know and i see many of these Indian expats. Yet most of my friends are chinese or indians who were born here. Now heres the interesting question- Why is that so?<br><br>I'll tell you why. Its not that we Singaporeans dont welcome u guys here. Its that u guys dont want to make yourselves welcomed here. I can tell you of the countless occasions when someone from india has told me i pronounce a word wrongly.They with their indain accents tell us we say stuff wrongly. No doubt our english may be peppered with singlish - but then again its all part of being singaporean. Then there are the times i hear an indian lady tell her friend that Singaporean Ladies dress indecently by wearing shorts out of the house and they'll heave a sigh of disgust. Now!- Its abt 30 Celsius out there and to be honest i think wearing shorts is far more sensible than wearing a sari with track shoes while walking around. Moreover Some Indian expats ought to learn that they cant always have things their own way .They piss off taxi drivers and even the cashiers at the supermarkets. I mean these people are human too. A smile and a friendly chat will do a world of good. Being stuck in your egoistic self-centered world where the caste system still prevails aint going to help anyone.<br><br>Now i'm not saying all Indian expats are that way. There exists a small minority of Indian expats who are almost Singaporean that u wouldnt know it until u see their passports. These Indian expats are hard to come by. They are however and rather unfortunately the minority. The first Indians that came to Singapore came as coolies and merchants. These Indians made an effort to integrate into Singapore- they fought for Singapore and they made a home in Singapore along side their Chinese and Malay neighbours. The new expats of today are no different . They are intellectual coolies here to work for the great multi-nationals that set base in Singapore. For those who make an effort to fit in.-We welcome you to our country but for those who think they are tooo good for Singapore. Honestly Please leave .. i mean it. Please do leave. Cause the next time i hear an Indian expat complaining that they could get something or that something is better in India or anywhere else, i'll be happy to direct you right to the airport and right onto the next air-india flight out of our inferior country where you can be intellectual coolies that you guys really are some where else. Now after reading this. Stop whining u guys. Cause if u wanna go caste system on me. I'm a Brahman so i beat u guys there as well. Cheers from a Singaporean.</p>
