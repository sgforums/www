I know Americans who believe but it's not a widespread belief and more than likely it's false.</div>

Only some Asia and Arab countries does the women-like arguing. Which is not a government or manly act.<br><br>We are talking about jet fuel on a big airplane not on small forker flagship!!!<br>Even car petrol can burn fast and on high temp let alon jet fuel.<br><br>Unless the jet is powered by diesel where it burns slowly and slowly.<br><br>Also those steel structure are linked together by nuts &amp; bolts and concrete. And not a super 100 over metres piece of steel.<br><br>If the same size plane ram into and of the building in raffles place, the building will be smash immediately.<br><br>Frankly speaking, 4 thousand ppl are dying and they are well educated and professional like you and me. And ppl can still be joking that it was a inside hand done!!<br><br>Terrorist are mad as they already extreme. But some people study too much and the brain too much bookworms in it also become stupid which led them to believe the crap story.<br><br>One day if spore got hit by terrorist and ppl will start thnking it was done by PAP.</div>

The government recruited terrorist to orchestrate an attack on its people. Bush used FEAR as a tool to convince the american population to vote him into power. He convinced them that such an attack will happen again if he does not become president.<br><br>And 9/11 was exactly whay Bush wanted.

I'm pretty sure they did not know how to program the autopilot to fly towards NYC. So they shut off the AP. Now they are flying IFR (instrument flight rules) which can only bring them roughly in the direction of NYC. Apparantly they flew into Manhattan by following the Hudson river, so they must descent below cloud level, FL 80 - 100 to follow the river. At this altitude cell phones do work. Don't believe you leave your phone on as you take off and see when u lose all reception.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, gentlemen.<br><br>Before anyone says that the US would not do such things. Remember the Cuban invasion planning in the begining of the Loosechange 2nd edition video. It pretty much confirm what the extent the US might go.<br><br>Do you know that the US lied about the Gulf of Tokin attack that started the Vietnam war ?<br><br>Do you know that the US embarked on a 8 page plan to force the Japanese to attack US in WWII. (Pearl Harbour) In fact, their intelligence has been tracking the Japanese Fleet.<br><br>Do you know the the US covertly directed a korean airliner, with innocent and unknowing passenger, on a spy mission, and was shoot down by the Russian.<br><br><strong>On the WTC twin towers.</strong><br><br>There were actually altogether 3 towers. While tower 1 &amp; 2 has the limelight. How about WTC 7, it also came down minutes after the two towers. It was not hit by any plane, It was not burning before the first tower collapse. It was not the nearest nor the most direct. It came down like a solid rock. Above all, it was a long cross section not square. Why did it come down on it footstep at all ? Anyone ?<br><br><strong>On the pentagon.</strong><br><br>1) There is the sign left on the wall right next to the hole. It's in good condition and still at it's place. The hole is too small to fit the aircraft body, therefore if that's hit the impact would be too great.<br><br>2) The outer wall, the four huge engines and wings damage is not evident. Even a car travelling at that speed would have fell the wall. Not even a mark. Not even a scratch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Sorry I tried linking pics but failed.</div>

Now they are flying IFR (instrument flight rules) which can only bring them roughly in the direction of NYC. Apparantly they flew into Manhattan by following the Hudson river, so they must descent below cloud level, FL 80 - 100 to follow the river. At this altitude cell phones do work.

Furthermore, for goodness sake don't use flight level for low altitudes.<br><br>also, auto pilots are simpler than u think (assuming that there WAS a hijack with hijackers on board).<br><br>regarding their flight path, i'm not too sure but the government did "reveal" a flight path i think so u could go check that</div>

After all, you are in Singapore, which though only run by 1 party, still is a clean country. If u have a slightest understanding on how the political systems runs in America, you will see that it is much more complicated than Singapore's.<br><br>In USA, theres 3 branches of government: legislative, executive, judicial.<br>Thats is to say, the President, Congress and Supreme Court each has almost an equal share of power, and can over-rule each other and at the same time be over-ruled by each other.<br><br>The presidentÂ—can veto bills passed by Congress, thus preventing them from becoming law. In turn, by a two-thirds vote, Congress can override the presidentÂ’s veto. The Supreme Court may invalidate acts of Congress by declaring them contrary to the Constitution of the United States, but Congress can change the Constitution through the amendment process.<br><br>And with this, you throw in Intelligence Agencies. There are laws stating that for national security, FBI or CIA can be given a lot of freedom. And finding a lophole in this system is very easy. They can even look at everything in your computer, check your email, listen to your phone conversation.<br><br>In such a complicated political situation, what isn't possible?<br><br><strong></strong></div>
