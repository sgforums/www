Secondly surveys are very vague. For one you never know who took the survey, another is you don't know the demographics of the people who took it, and lastly you don't know if it was made up. For all you know they could have asked a bunch of people who are at an anti government rally, so I don't believe you the survey. Also a survey is of only a select few, maybe 500 people, it's not reflective of anything. IMO surveys are a waste of time, not just that one but all surveys in general.</div></blockquote>Put yourself in the American's shoes.<br><br>Thousands of people got killed when the FBI and CIA that tax payers spent billions of dollars a year to support did not even make an attempt to prevent the attack.<br><br>Year later, the government publish a report, but alls in it are what the people already know. Why the towers collapes was not included in the report.<br><br>Tapes of CCTV cameras which had captured the event were not shown to the public.<br><br>US started war on Iraq, reason being the leader is a terrorist and might has connection to Osama. Bush insisted on war even when most of the nation did not really support it (no need survey for this, theres riots to prove)<br><br>Then this guy come and make a video of lots of evidence, that even the official 911 report could not match.<br><br>How will the people of America feel?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Shotgun:</div><div class="quote_body">Honestly, I figured it was quite a feat that all 3 planes found and hit their targets in the first place.<br><br>Firstly, the supposed terrorists were not americans, and weren't living in the states they attacked, NY, and washington DC.  Yet, for some reason, they were able to navigate effectively , identify their target buildings, and fly a large plane right into it.<br><br>There were explanations where they took control of the jet a precise point of the flight, so that they could use visual references (at 32000ft,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) fly a certain heading, descend , look for landmark features and navigate an aircraft they've never flown before, and crash them into a building with cruise missile precisions.<br><br>Even combat pilots have difficulty identifying targets to bomb with precision guided munitions.  And thats WITH experience in their Jet, WITH experience with handling sophisticated equipment such as air to ground radars and targetting pods, and WITH aerial reconnaisance of their targets so that they can identify their targets effectively.  With that, they still DO make mistakes, and can hit the wrong target.  These are combat pilots with perhaps hundreds and hundreds of flight hours under their belt.<br><br>Yet, terrorists, whom the US government claims to have limited piloting knowledge, had such navigation expertise, expert control of a totally unfamiliar jet, ( you really don't go to flight schools and requests to learn how to fly in a Boeing 757 ),  and guides their BUS of a jet into high value targets with such precision.<br><br>These terrorists should probably join the Air Force.</div></blockquote>Actually, I really agree with that point. Its amazing how those planes managed to hit the targets.<br><br>I mean have you guys ever played MS Flight Simulator 2004 before? Trying to find the runway and land is definately no easy task. (The 1st time you played that is.) Likewise trying to find a bulding in a landscape they are unfamiliar of. The WTC towers may look big from the ground, but in the air, they are as tiny as an ant. Furether more, they had to take control of the plane, get it down from crusing altitude, navigate using the GPS to New York, getting down to about 1500 feet and slamming right into the towers. Imagine the terrorists with little piloting skills, going into the cockpit, wresting with the pilot &amp; co-pilot terminator style, straping themselves into the cockpit, take 3 seconds to analyse the controls, again terminator style. Then taking full control of it. Then what the hell happened to the passengers? All 100+ passengers can't subdue just 1 hijacker? Bloody ridiculars.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Then talk about the pentagon wreck. I mean you call that a wreck? Just a hole on the structure with no aircraft remains lying around. Clearly doesn't look like a plane had crash into it. No engine sections, no fuselage, no horizontal stabilizers, nothing at all, just a mysterious looking tiny turbine that resembles a missile. But strange thing it that an aircraft was spotted flying around right after the crash. What the hell could it be? A spotter aircraft? Didn't know cruse missiles need spotters?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Funniest it the passport lying around the rubble of the WTC wreck. They claimed the black boxes were melted and yet the passport remains!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  They expect us to believe that kind of crap?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
