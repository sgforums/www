            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone..<br><br>Li Ka Shing, you are right on your point but take note on one thing though. What may seems far-fetched to most and to you may not be the same for others and what seems close-fetched to others may not be as such for you. Just as much as how some evidence are pointing towards the Arabs and other terrorists, now surfaces some evidence that are pointing towards the US government. What actually happened? Who is the real mastermind? We might never know the answer.<br>Do not underestimate the americans especially the government. What they can do under the tables is beyond our ordinary imagination.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br><br>Hi everyone, I'm an American but I did not see the video, I'm not keen on downloading things. Anyways what I wanted to say was this. I have heard in America about this such theory and I don't believe it to be true because Al Qaeda has claimed responsibility for it and no one would say they did something so horrible that they didn't do. As for us being in Iraq for oil I disagree with that also. That theory however is very very widespread here in America. The real reason we are in Iraq is because in the late 1970s Israel attacked Lebanon and destroyed two of their buildings with aircrafts given to them by America; we give Israel 5 billion United States dollars a year. Israel is our largest recipentant of foreign aid. Also Saddam Hussein launched missles at Israel in 1991 and when the infatada began he was paying the families of suicide bombers large sums of money for these attacks against Israel. Saddam had weapons of mass destruction because America gave them to him to attack the Iranians in the early 1980s and it was believed he would use them against Israel not the USA. They said the USA was in danger because we would have gotten even less support for the war in Iraq had the truth been told to the people. The weapons of mass destruction were definitely moved, most likely by the Russians, as they had spies on the ground up to 2003 in Iraq aiding Saddam.<br><br>This war is really unpopular here in America and yes our president is dumb and I wish we would stop relying on oil and use environment friendly cars. I just thought that I should explain the real reason why we are there and not other reasons which sound conspiratorial or are from the American liberal media. My side of the story is not liberal or conservative it is the truth. And one last thing I'm not saying anyone is crazy for believing that our government did the attacks or that we are there for oil. The latter is a very popular notion and the other is something that has been floating around for a while now but I am not sure if anyone here is aware of the Israeli side of the story.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The simplest arguement is usually the one which is correct.<br><br>Ask yourself which is more likely, terrorist hijacking planes or a government with using a immense secret arm orchestrating an attack on its on people?<br><br>Anyway, 9/11 can be said as a blessing in disguise. Think of all the contracts that resulted with all the military operations that followed. Who gets rich in the end?

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually in spook world such things are not wholly impossible.<br><br>Remember story of the chambermaid and the bomb?<br><br>In the book Gideon Spies, the british were cosy with the libyans so mossad hatch a plot by getting one of it's paid palestinian moles or double agent with ties to libyan extremist groups to trick his own pregnant english girlfriend who worked as a chambermaid to carry a bag full of  explosives on to an EL Air commercial airliner.<br><br>She was made pregnant by her boyfriend and thought she was really going back to visit her boyfriend's parents to discuss marriage, her mind was conjured up with images of the holy land where baby jesus was born. He had told her to go ahead first and that he would join her later in palestine after he finished up some business.<br><br>The palestinian mole(boyfriend) didn't know that his handler was jewish and thought he was really getting his girlfriend to bomb a jewish target.<br><br>EL Air officials were tipped off and that english girl was apprehended before the check-in when her bag was searched. It made headlines around the world, and the british government kicked the libyans out for good.<br><br>In chinese saying we call it jie4 tao1 sha1 ren2 aka using somebody's hand/knife to kill another. I really won't be surprised if they found out later that 9/11 was instigated by a foreign power allied to the USA. Or maybe for some reason the CIA bombed it's own people to rally behind bush. Don't forget Bush Snr was head of CIA once before he ever became president, and junior won his presidency by the merest margin so there could be some link there. The idea would be perverse but not wholly impossible.</div>

It's not the personal owners of the site I don't trust it's my government, they force the owners to turn that stuff over.<br><br>Tayysj:"<blockquote>anyway even if that is the real reason, the bush administration did not reveal that.</blockquote>Ofcourse not because if they did then we would have had even less support for the war. It's not that Americans are anti semitic it's the fact that you need a more plausible reason than Israel being threatened to get support for thousands of our troops to be killed. Jews are less than 5% of the American population yet they are in control of our country. Osama bin Ladin know's this very well and so do many other Arabs, that is another reason he ordered attacks against us. I did mention this in my last post about this not being acceptable to our people.<br><br>Taysj:"<blockquote>2 it seem like revenge for 9/11 (which seems to not have been Iraq's fault).</blockquote>Right it's not Iraq's fault. The bombers were Egyptian and Saudi Arabian but I explained why we went to Iraq in my last post.<br><br>Tayysj:"point 3 the bush administration was SOOO confident it WILL DEFINITELY get the WMD. but oh let's see they couldn't find any? the russians removed it? etc.? Why so %$$$y in the first place? etc. etc.<blockquote><br><br>There was a report out that the Russians helped move the weapons but regardless of who did help him the fact of the matter is that he succeeded. Our president gave Saddam to many chances to surrender and Saddam played Bush for the fool that he is. You don't tell someone I'm coming to invade your country for WMD and I'm coming on this day and time. Ofcourse the guy is going to do everything to get the weapons out of his country. Do people really think he is going to use them or just let them sit around? That would prove Bush right for invading and the whole war would be justified in American and most of the world's eyes.</blockquote></div>

If they weren't from that organization then there would have been reports out saying that the USA was lying. I have not heard of any country, and believe me there are many, claiming that those men were not from Al Qaeda.</div>
