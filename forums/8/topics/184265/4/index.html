            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, I figured it was quite a feat that all 3 planes found and hit their targets in the first place.<br><br>Firstly, the supposed terrorists were not americans, and weren't living in the states they attacked, NY, and washington DC.  Yet, for some reason, they were able to navigate effectively , identify their target buildings, and fly a large plane right into it.<br><br>There were explanations where they took control of the jet a precise point of the flight, so that they could use visual references (at 32000ft,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ) fly a certain heading, descend , look for landmark features and navigate an aircraft they've never flown before, and crash them into a building with cruise missile precisions.<br><br>Even combat pilots have difficulty identifying targets to bomb with precision guided munitions.  And thats WITH experience in their Jet, WITH experience with handling sophisticated equipment such as air to ground radars and targetting pods, and WITH aerial reconnaisance of their targets so that they can identify their targets effectively.  With that, they still DO make mistakes, and can hit the wrong target.  These are combat pilots with perhaps hundreds and hundreds of flight hours under their belt.<br><br>Yet, terrorists, whom the US government claims to have limited piloting knowledge, had such navigation expertise, expert control of a totally unfamiliar jet, ( you really don't go to flight schools and requests to learn how to fly in a Boeing 757 ),  and guides their BUS of a jet into high value targets with such precision.<br><br>These terrorists should probably join the Air Force.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everything will just remain as 'speculation', right?<br><br>No matter what facts are presented - there is no absolute proof to the claims. There is no way that we can determine for sure and without reasonable doubt who is right / wrong and for what purposes... and perhaps the people who do know will take the secret to their graves (if they haven't already).<br><br>Imagine what WILL happen if we were to be informed of what / who are actually responsible for certain events in the world! There will never be answers that will not be marred by controversy.<br><br>I watched the videos sometime back - and till today... reading all that has been posted here, I am still mulling over it. It may be a 'documentary', it may also be a cleverly guised propaganda, but still - it did get most of us thinking, and wondering.<br><br>Apart from the cover-ups, missing black boxes, debris and an (almost) questionable way the buildings collapsed... It does occur to my logical mind that many things simply do not add up.<br><br>The buildings were made with reinforced steel - designed to withstand the most horrific natural disasters. After fires which have occured in buildings... immortalised in the film "The Towering Inferno" and such; I'm sure that in the construction of such a massive structure, they would have taken into account all these. Even before this film, the first thing that came into my mind as I watched footage on the evening of Sept 11, 2001 - was precisely that.<br><br>I thought in disbelief: "The planes flattened the towers and leveled it to the ground? - You gotta be kidding me!" Watching the incident as it happened did nothing to appease my mind... for it looked to me that simultaneous explosions happening near (and around) the point of impact erupted <strong>after</strong> the planes smashed into the building.<br><br>As for the Pentagon crash - it's funny how there aren't any remnants of the crashed plane. Weird, even. Then again, I found this video: <a href="http://www.alexisparkinn.com/photogallery/Videos/2005_jet-vs-concrete-wall.wmv" rel="nofollow">test crash</a> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Of course - some may argue that whoever's responsible, planted bombs IN the buildings itself to ensure complete destruction... but why aren't there reports of that at all? It would've been so much simpler for them to note that there have been remnants of bombs in the aftermath, and we would be none the wiser. Or would that have carried more risks than we would care to know?<br><br>Money and / or Power IS a powerful motivation. As for the truth - the whole truth and nothing but... I highly doubt we will ever find closure. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Secondly surveys are very vague. For one you never know who took the survey, another is you don't know the demographics of the people who took it, and lastly you don't know if it was made up. For all you know they could have asked a bunch of people who are at an anti government rally, so I don't believe you the survey. Also a survey is of only a select few, maybe 500 people, it's not reflective of anything. IMO surveys are a waste of time, not just that one but all surveys in general.</div>

Can you explain WTC7's collapse ?<br><br>No one could ... 9/11 commssion avoided it.. the mass media makes no mention of it (as best as they could) ...<br><br>So dude.. answer the Question.<br><br>Just a little snippet, the air controller supervisor was said to have destroyed the transmission tapes with jest, and deposited in bins across different section if the aircontrol building, before it can be transcripted or replayed, defying FAA instructions to retain all articles.

They conduct it by asking people to leave their personal informations so they can check it out later. They always conduct survey for US elections and is mostly quite accurate. Forgot the link though. How many people remember every link of every webpage they viewed. But you can always check it out and correct me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
