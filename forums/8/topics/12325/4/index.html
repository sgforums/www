            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by LexZEUS:</div><div class="quote_body">But when *MIRACLE THING* happened such as blind man can see, that is not as simple as how someone can break a chair.<br></div></blockquote>If your church can make blind man see, heal a dying man, wouldn't these headline appear in the newspaper and media, and wouldn't all sick and blind people will go to your church for treatment instead of the hospital. Why need a hospital if your church can do such miracle?? Use your common sense or did you hear it from someone who hear it from somewhere, in short it's a rumour?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I agree with your statement "using FORCE terminology instead of GOD", well that is right. But many people associate the FORCE with God, that is proven where more people in this world with *religion* rather than people with no *religion* (people who doesn't believe if God is exist). By clear and normal sense, most people will associate this *FORCE* with *GOD*. That's why, different religion may have different perspective about GOD, but they acknowledge that GOD is exist.<br></strong></blockquote>In the past, many people associate the FORCE with God, because during that olden time, religious like christian had a strong and deep influence on man since man has not really developed fully their intelligence. Well, LUCKILY, THIS IS THE MODERN ERA not like the olden time when the christianity crusade which is notorious even now is allowed to happen because of majority of people during that time is the christ believers. In this modern time when more and more pple are more educated and having a right and logical mind, we are at least safe from all those merciless crusaders who were empowered by the LORD aka god to do all those killing cos god himself also kill like nobody setting an example in the bible.<br><br>Now is the Era of Islamic Unity, and hence more and more trouble surfaces. The tragedy of the US NYC twin tower and WDC pentagon could partly be blamed on the religious influence. The terrorist are acting in their view with the approval of God based on deep religious belief that a better life awaits them in paradise or heaven in christianity terms. Most of their own kind see them as martyrs, warriors committing not self-destruction, but heroic acts and hence cheer for them when thousands of family are weeping for their dead family members in the tragedy. The battle between christianity and muslim are not unheard of but are become the norm.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Well... that is really happened... The term is "FALL IN SPIRIT", that means God bound your physical body so you become so weak until you cannot stand. Then it will be more easier for God to speak to your heart when you are weak. This makes sense to my mind, 'cos by default, human are stubborn when they are *awake* or *feel strong*...<br>God works more tremendously for people who can humble their heart... In "FALL IN SPIRIT" state, people usually feel how weak there are, thus humble their heart...</strong></blockquote>You mean you have to be weak so that your heart can be easily controlled?? Why do you need to be controlled anyway. And by what?? For what? Shouldn't you be in control of yourself? Shouldn't you depend on your own moral self and not on others? You mean whatever good deed you do, you do it in the name of god and not because of your own thinking since you are controlled? Shouldn't you be wideawake most of the time to be clear headed?<br><br><blockquote><br><strong><br>From YOUR POINT OF VIEW, LOTS OF FAITH is NOT ABSOLUTE. But I remember you telling me that *Faith* is a NECESSARY TOOL to reach GOD?<br></strong><br><br>I mean the word "LOTS" ... not necessary "LOTS", it can be small or even null .. I believed in God when even I was forced by my friend to go to church. Is my faith big? no...<br><br>But the handshaking between MAN and GOD is not one way. True, human way to reach God is by Faith, but the way for God to reach human is by *GRACE* ...<br><br>So, just like I said, even though I have null faith, but yet God so mercyfull to me... That will become my living testimony: "I am saved because of God's mercy, not because of what I did"...<br></blockquote>You are contradicting to yourself. You have null faith which mean you are non-believer of god, but yet god is so mercyful to you. Hence you are saved because of god's mercy, not because of what you did. <strong>So why do god still condemn non-christian to hell </strong>since he's so merciful. Please think carefully before you retort to this cos i can quote precisely from your own bible where the god condemn those who do not believe in him or those who believe in god other than him to hell.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Kyo23 (edited 14 September 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by LexZEUS:<br><strong><br>Sorry I mistyped it ... replace my word with :<br>[b]<br>But, a normal man will associate this *SOMETHING OTHER THAN COINCIDENCE* with *ENVIRONMENT*...<br></strong><br>that is what I meant ... the *SOMETHING* itself instead of the *COINCIDENCE* ..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">[/B]<br>Understood. But it still doesn't explain my original question?<br><br><strong><br>Well if charis broken at once... people will associate it *maybe* with earthquake, or maybe the chairs are quite old and used. Just like when I walk, suddenly I fall because the road is slippery, I won't say: "A Force push me then I fall"...</strong><br>AGREE. In this, you're referring to LOGIC SENSE. In LOGIC SENSE, there mainly 2 ways:<br><br>1. Witness(es) PHYSICALLY seeing what happened. And seeing that the INCIDENT is PHYSICALLY ASSOCIATED with the CAUSE.<br><br>2. People DEDUCING the POSSIBILITY of the EVENT OUTCOME by PERCENTAGE CHANCE or ALTERNATIVE SELECTION methods.<br><br>You won't say a force pushed you because by LOGICAL SENSE, you KNEW that the floor is wet. Or perhaps you got to know it later?<br><br>But what was referring to is that what is the chairs just SNAPPED? NO CONNECTIONs? NO CLUES? Is GOD gonna be ASSOCIATED with the INCIDENT just like that?<br>If NOT, then why is *GOD* SELECTED for the BLIND man cured incident BUT NOT the chairs SNAPPED? Because of the fact that human holds this BELIEF that *GOD* is SUPPOSED to be GOOD?<br>WHAT IF we replace the term *GOD* with *FORCE* now? Would it seems more 'appropriate' TO ACCEPT that the *FORCE* could be accountable for BOTH the incidents or just the chair snapping incident (considering the fact that a DIFFERENT *FORCE* may be involved in the two incidents?)<br><br><strong><br>But many people associate the FORCE with God, that is proven where more people in this world with *religion* rather than people with no *religion* (people who doesn't believe if God is exist). By clear and normal sense, most people will associate this *FORCE* with *GOD*.</strong><br>A point or FACT can NEVER be PROVEN with more people in this world have religion (choose to believe that GOD exist). Just like when an accident had occurred. Jack fell into the river and Jean is the ONLY PERSON around with him at the moment. With INSUFFICIENT or NO evidence at all (No SCIENTIFIC supporting FACTs or PROOFs), a jury of 6 people was set up. 4 people decided to put Jean GUILTY to MURDER. 2 people AGAINST the idea. QUESTION is Does it sounds LOGICAL to put Jean to DEATH ROW? WAS there ANY PROOF at all?<br>Another REAL story I can tell you, back in the school days we've always had this habit of discussing answers after test. On a particular question, 41 out of 42 people in class AGREED on an ANSWER. 1 don't. DOES that MEANS he's WRONG? The *ANSWER* GIVEN by the teacher later shows that the 41 students were WRONG. You can call the student STUBBORN or 'NOT UNITED', but there is NO WAY you can PROVE him WRONG just by that?<br>This CLEAR NORMAL SENSE you're referring to is the 'blind spot' of humans. You can say NATURALLY, by HUMAN INSTINCT, people would CHOOSE to associate *FORCE* with *GOD* IF they're a religion-believer. But just like the 41 students, they CANNOT PROVE they're RIGHT simply by that?<br><strong><br>That's why, different religion may have different perspective about GOD, but they acknowledge that GOD is exist.</strong><br>And IF just because that MORE people BELIEVE that GOD exist =&gt; GOD exist. Then this questin whether GOD really DO EXIST would not be DEBATABLE. And IMAGINE asking all the people to start BELIEVING that they WON'T DIE NO MATTER WHAT. Does it IMPLY the 'fact' that they really WON'T DIE NO MATTER WHAT?<br><strong><br>Well... that is really happened... The term is "FALL IN SPIRIT", that means God bound your physical body so you become so weak until you cannot stand. Then it will be more easier for God to speak to your heart when you are weak. This makes sense to my mind, 'cos by default, human are stubborn when they are *awake* or *feel strong*...<br>God works more tremendously for people who can humble their heart... In "FALL IN SPIRIT" state, people usually feel how weak there are, thus humble their heart...</strong><br>I HOLD BACK this INCIDENT for above discussion then since it coincidentally falls into a 'LOGICAL SENSE' category which render itself UNFIT for involvement in the above matters.<br>But I would also like to add some facts to the term "FALL IN SPIRIT" OR WHATEVER other terms might to be used to describe this state. NO OFFENCE (Not referring to ANY particular religion BUT in GENERAL FACT), when a person is WEAK in MIND (just like for people with sucidal intentions in some cases), their mind could be EASILY LED to CONFUSIONs which would in turn render their minds UNFIT for proper ACCESSMENT THINKING and make themselves PROMPT to MENTAL DISEASES like HALLUCINATION. BRAINWASHING can EASILY be done to people in this state. FRANKLY speaking, it would not really need a *GOD* to talk someone into something, but simply a HUMAN with PROPER FUNCTIONING SOBER MIND would be good enough.<br><strong><br>So, just like I said, even though I have null faith, but yet God so mercyfull to me... That will become my living testimony: "I am saved because of God's mercy, not because of what I did"...<br></strong><br>'GOD so mercyfull to me' is JUST a PRESUMPTION or AN IDEA or A THOUGHT. Just like people with HALLUCINATION would think that though I have not done much for the doctors 'the doctors LOVE me but they just don't show it'. They often also CONCLUDED that 'the doctors LOVE me THOUGH I have not done much on my part'. &lt;- Are they CORRECT to say that and come up with such CONCLUSION?<br><strong><br>About [b]AMBIGUIOUSCITY </strong>, well just like I said, need Need a courage to accept that *SOMETHING OTHER THAN COINCIDENCE* is happened. And need *FAITH* to believe the *SOMETHING* is the GOD Himself or the action of GOD. Yet, just like I said, more than 80% people in this world have *religion*, they have *courage* and *faith* to acknowledge that *AMBIGUIOUSCITY* is GOD... [/B]<br>Just like the 'more people' who CHOSE to ACCEPT that *GOD* exist, it should BY RIGHT require an EVEN LARGER COURAGE for the 'lesser people' to stand on their belief that *GOD* don't exist? Anyway, COURAGE is NOT really our TOPIC?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>For MY VIEW on 'more people', please refer to ABOVE?<br><strong><br>But, at least you *ACKNOWLEDGE* that the *FORCE* which is supranatural is exist.</strong><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I have to admit it because there're still ALOT of SCOPEs BEYOND the explanation of METAPHYSICs in this world. Meanwhile, I guess they can ONLY be LISTED under SUPERNATURAL? Things that CANNOT be EXPLAINED PHYSICALLY?<br><strong><br>Then, either you say the *FORCE* is GOD or NATURAL COINCIDENCE, it is depend on your decision. Yet to decide to accept that the FORCE is GOD/NATURAL/SOMETHING is the action of FAITH itself.</strong><br>NEITHER. I would rather classified the *FORCE* under SUPERNATURAL for now? Just like when you throw a dice, random numbers come out. But what IF the the '1' on the dice is REPLACED by another '6'. Throw on the long run and collect the data. '6' would appear MORE. Is this the work of 'luck' (something which cannot really be explained UNLESS by SUPERNATURAL or their SPECIFIC SCOPEs)? Or is it a HIGHER CHANCE by SIMPLE PROBABILITY? This is NO NATURAL COINCIDENCE as we RECOGNISE a PATTERN.<br>Ok... Let's NOT be SELFISH again and SHARE my OWN ACCOUNT of 'LAW OF PRIMARY DECISION' here. It STATES that UNLESS AFFECTED by PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL or BIOLOGICAL means. With NO REFERENCE to ANY INFORMATION RELATED to the SUBJECT of DECISION. The CHANCES of making a CERTAIN DECISION should follow the LAW of SIMPLE PROBABLITY.<br>And IF you really ahve to CHOOSE for the term *FORCE* to be represented by GOD/NATURAL/SOMETHING by FAITH ALONE which is a NEUTRAL term (Faith or Belief ALONE would NOT give you a 'weight' on directions you should take, HENCE, so MANY DIFFERENT religions fork out). The DECISION making by FAITH really would be like below IF NOT for the FACT that we're BIASED by the 'terms' used. The picture SHOULD then be:<br><br>A/B/C &lt;- Which one you choose?<br><br><strong><br>I think, before you can believe there is God or not, you have to define the *FORCE* itself: Change the topic into "WHAT IS SUPRANATURAL FORCE", once you can define it, it is more likely you can know whether God is exist or not.</strong><br>Hmm... MOST LIKELY. But NOTE that SUPERNATURAL forces are usually FURTHER subdivided into branches and can be referring to DIFFERENT things. However, it also SEEMS UNLIKELY that we would be able to FULLY EXPLAIN and BREAKDOWN the term SUPERNATURAL. Otherwise we won't be having this DISCUSSION here and I also won't say that MOST PROBABLY we won't be able to get an answer here?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></blockquote>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT.

THIS IS the kinda IMAGE people PROJECT on ME, A DEVIL... If you BOTHER to CAREFULLY READ the passage AGAIN, it is a PIECE of ADVICE I have for SILVERWING... A GUY whom I RESPECT, just like I RESPECT FIREICE... I KNOW on HIS MIND I'm a DEVIL... He won't take ADVICE from a 'DEVIL'...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> To him, DEVIL is NOT FIT to give ADVICES....<br><strong><br>You regard silverwing's post as a personal attack and overlook fireice's provoking and not telling her off, you were already siding her. Although you said you're not bias, deep in your heart you know it best yourself.</strong><br>I have SPOKEN to FIREICE before in OTHER POSTs... THOUGH I RESPECT her, I KNOW she won't take my words SERIOUSLY... AT LEAST not through the POSTs... If she would bother, she's SMART enough to think over it on her own... If she couldn't be bother, no amount of words I add in would pretty much change the state....<br>As for SILVERWING, I FIND that he's got his STRONG POINTs but he's TOO STUBBORN-HEADED... He ACTs in the name of RIGHTEOUS BUT not knowing which DIRECTION he's HEADING FOR.... I find that he's WORTH a 'TAP on the SHOULDER'.... And I HOPE he could REALISE 'some things'.... I'm NOT saying ANYTHING on his religion... I'm in NO POSITION to COMMENT on CHRISTIANITY... And EVEN if I do, people probably shouldn't be SO DUMB as to take my words TOO SERIOUSLY... WHO do you think I am for now? I'm just a <span style="font-style: italic;">nobody..</span> THIS is my 1st TAP on his shoulder.... And I'm talking to him in the NAME of a 'DEVIL'.... NOT a GOD... NOT HIS GOD....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I can see he turned away....<br>It DOESN'T MATTER....
