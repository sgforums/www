In fact, if I can, I won't ask for it... Living in this earth is misserable, I would prefer Heaven than Earth.<br><br>See marthyr as an example, people who choose to risk their live for GOSPEL. Do they expect money and prosperous in this world?<br>NO ...<br><br>Why does God let some of them died, in fact 11 out of 12 of Lord's desciples died because of Gospel... Why?<br><br>A history in bible tell about king named Hizkia.<br>This king is so rightous in the sight of the Lord, he never turned right nor left, his eyes look straight to God, he is simply *blameless* ...<br>When this king reached certain years in his age (around 30-40), God struck him with sickness and God told Isaiah the prophet to tell : "Hizkia, you will never heal, gather your family since your time is over".<br>Then Hizkia pleaded and cried unto the Lord: "I have done so many rightous thing, I am blameless, I am your servant, yet why God punish me like this".<br>Then the Lord told Isaiah the prophet to Hizkia to say: "Since you are crying, then I will extend your age 15 years more".<br><br>EDITED BY ALEX ON 13-SEPT-2001:<br><br>What happened in the next Hizkia's 15 years? He did sin and forsake the Lord by his pride and selfishness so lead the whole Israel to exile to Babylon.<br>During that 15 years old, he gave birth a king which eventually become the most wicked king in Judah King history, wicked than other king who doesn't know God ... God knows everything, He may purposely made Hizkia ill so the son (Manasseh) won't be born.<br><br>So if God let them die in faith, does it sounds nice? Which one you prefer, die because of old age but go to hell, or die suddenly but go to heaven?<br><br>Ok, this sounds so christianity, as Devil's request, I won't continue to discuss deeper about it, but feel free if you realy want to ask something...<br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 13 September 2001).]</div>
