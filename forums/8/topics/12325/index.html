You can feel His presence ... not so religius ... but this is my own live testimony: God speak to me many times ...<br><br>Some of God words that came for me :<br><br>1. "Alex, God love you"<br>This I heard before I accept Christianity...<br><br>2. "You are my wonderly choosen."<br>This I heard from a priest at the very moment when I felt rejected by saying "God, You are not fair to me, You are choosy."  Noone knew this, I didn't tell anybody. Yet, God reveal it to the priest, and told him to tell this to me...<br><br>3. "Forgive her, I have reserved someone which is the best for you."<br>This word of God came to my sister when I was broken hearted by someone until I hated her. My sister was at another city, and she didn't know about my feeling. Yet, God said to my sister in dream. When she woke up, she called me by phone to deliver the words of God.<br><br>4. "What eye had not seen, neither ear heard, neither have entered into heart of man, the things God had prepared for them that love Him"<br>Beautifull passage from God ...<br><br>I cannot *proove* it with logic, physics or mathematics, since the genius men in this earth cannot *create* even an ant which is tiny poor little thing, yet it is still complicated for those genius.

Now, man try to go beyond that level, but they cannot get the answer... Some of them who are disappointed, turned back and say "God doesn't exist" just because their mind cannot reach that *knowledge* ?<br><br>Existance of God cannot be prooved by *logic*, but by *faith* ... but, when you started to believe it with your *faith*, your logic will also awake and *know* that God is exist ...</div>

Basically, this is NOT a RELIGIOUS topic. I'm NOT INTERESTED in WHICH GOD is more true than the others. I'm only INTERESTED in some general discussions for the 'open minded' here. I know it MIGHT lead to ENDLESS FLAMING here. But the REASONS for me to put up this topic would be:<br><br>1) Though we understand that this might cause FLAMING and try to avoid this topic in FORUM. MANY are DYING to lay their hands on this kinda topic. (Not EXCLUSIVE of me)<br><br>2) Like to hear from some GENUINE COMMENTs from SOME of the peopl in this FORUM. I can feel its RICHNESS. This topic has something to do with my own 'theory'.<br><br>3) I'm a DEVIL. Like I CARE if FLAMING goes on? Ok. Basically you CAN'T BLAME a DEVIL for EVERYTHING? If people wanna FLAME, we can't really stop them. Just like if they're NOT INTERESTED in FLAMING but more on the TOPIC (If they're INTELLECTUAL enough that is), they won't even be bother with the PROVOKING that might go on here. And IF they DO. I'm NOT INTERESTED in THEM. 'ODD one OUT', you get what I mean?<br><br>PLEASE DO NOT 'shoot your bullets or throw your stones' at OTHER PEOPLE's GOD(s) or BELIEF. BASICALLY, I'm NOT INTERESTED in the 'TRUTH' here in this TOPIC. And VERY LIKELY we WON'T find one YET from our 'novince discussion'. So WHY NOT we just have a 'light-hearted' discussion, and SPARE ourselves from the HUMILIATION of OUR OWN IGNORANCE and STUPIDITY?<br><br>THANKS for READING THIS....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>THANKS.. You SAVED my breath... I was about to go one by one REJECTING each of your points above...<br></strong><br><br>Feel free to reject it ... cos God choose to reveal something to someone yet hide it from others. Experience of my live is enough for me to prove myself that God is exist. More than I beleive there is brain in my head, I beleive there's God in Heaven. That is called *faith* ... Faith: A prove from what cannot be seen.<br><br><strong><br>When people learnt about LIGHT and ENERGY. They probably haven't LEARN to 'CREATE' them YET. But before the stage of CREATION and UTILISATION, there usually come a PHASE of KNOWLEDGE and UNDERSTANDING 1st.<br></strong><br><br>That's right, but everything is limited... One thing which is not limited : The God himself. Even your years are count, your size is measured, your existance is limited.<br><br>There are secret of Heaven which will never be revealed to human until the time come, such as the existing of Heaven, who is God, why God create human and angels (which eventually some human and angels go to hell)... Those kind of existing which is supranatural can only be understood by *faith* ...<br><br><strong><br>But IF you have this BELIEF that MAN's knowledge is forever BELOW GOD, THEN you're setting the LIMITS yourself. NOT GOD. And when you mentioned that we're NOT knowledgable enough to UNDERSTAND, then may I ASK how can we be KNOWLEDGABLE enough to know ITS EXISTENCE?<br></strong><br><br>See my comment above ... everything under heaven is measured. Everything except God is limited.<br>Why God create limit? if there is no limit, then why should human lean on God anymore? They can be their own god...<br><br>If you want to prove with Physics, then u should now Newton law about Law of Action and Reaction. Whenever there is Action, there should be Reaction. Reaction cannot exist without Action.<br>So, is this world created just like that without reason? Everything has the root. You know your father, your father knew his ancestor, but who is the first ancestor? It is exist just like it is? If it exists just like it is, then Newton Law is wrong...<br><br>Again, the existance of God can only be accepted by faith.<br><br><strong><br>But IF FAITH ALONE is enough, then NO OFFENCE but the SAME saying also HOLDs for the PEOPLE who have commited CRIMEs and TERRORISM so STRONG to their BELIEFS?<br></strong><br><br>Yes, everyone can have their own beliefs. But from their beliefs they will be judged accordingly... You also can belief that your ancestors are from apes (Darwin theory), that is also FAITH... It is not proven yet that human ancestors are apes, that's why Darwin theory remain as "THEORY" not like Newton Law which is "LAW"...<br><br>From your first question:<br>I would like to hear some comments? Like to remind you people that this is NOT a debate of the RELIGIONS though? More like a <strong> DEBATE on the EXISTENCE of GOD? </strong><br><br>That sounds weird to me. God is supranatural, beyond human undertanding and knowledge. Yet, you want to prove something  supranatural with logical prove? To prove something which is supranatural, you have to use something which is also supranatural: FAITH.<br>Noone can measure someone's faith, because FAITH is supranatural. Faith is given by God to human, faith is undescribale, many people ready to die for their FAITH (even though some of their FAITH are not true)...<br><br>Some people are not religius ... they just play religius ...<br>Some people doesn't have faith ... but they play with faith ...<br><br>That answer your question why terorist with their *BELIEF* sabotage NYC and WDC... They just play with religion, but not religius, cos God never tell people to kill, especially killing innocent people ...<br><br>Nice to share with you!<br><br>Alex</div>
