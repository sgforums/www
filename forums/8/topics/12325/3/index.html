            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by LexZEUS:<br><strong><br><br>Nice intro, but I only browse internet on office ... My family use the telephone line at home     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></strong><br>UNDERSTOOD... The SAME goes for me... And my lunch hour's GONNA be OVER SOON...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><strong><br>But, like I said ... I found already ...<br>I see a teenager who addicted to drugs &amp; smoking &amp; drinking, came from a broken family, doesn't have destiny in his life... When he accepted God, God convert him totally ... who can do such thing dramatically like that?<br>I see blind people can see, lame can walk, mute can talk, people with cancer healed, how I can say that God doesn't exist?<br>Before you can see the prove of God existance, you need faith as an *exchange tool*. Without faith, human cannot see God... yet, it doesn't mean God cannot be seen...</strong><br>I see your point... But 2 POINTs I'll like to mention here. If you see MIRACLEs, it's NOT necessarily the work of GOD. Since till this point it've NOT been PROVED to exist YET. You CANNOT explain situations by a PRESUMPTION that SOMETHING IS ALREADY TRUE. Like you CANNOT explain something by saying because 'ABC' caused it to happen. But the term 'ABC' is AMBIGIOUS itself. Just like Plato's FAMOUS PRESUMPTION of 'I THINK THEREFORE I AM' has been PROVEN to be a FAULTY. Just like Enstein has once said something like that, "Everything in this world IS A MIRACLE if you OBSERVE CLOSE ENOUGH... And don't take things for granted" Until today NATURE OBSERVATIONs have MAINLY been explained by SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION. NOT how GOD plant the trees, design the atmsophere and so on and so forth. The ONLY MAIN 'EXPLANATION' provided in terms of GOD would be a VERY VAGUE explanation of 'GOD CREATED the WORLD' supported by 'FAITH'. (Like you've proposed)<br>I AGREE with you on the POSSIBILITY of seeing GOD ONLY upon willingness to use 'faith' as a tool to reach him. Just like trying out a product before you should judge it? BUT there's ANOTHER DEFECT. You have to have LOTS of FAITH to reach that 'LEVEL'. The SIDE EFFECT would be HALLUCINATION. NO JOKE. This could be observed from 'self-hypnotising' practices. When a person cast a certain level of 'belief' to REDIRECT his/her own thinking line and belief of his/her world.<br><strong><br>He he ... you are right and also wrong ...     <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I agree with you that Newton Law lack of something: The Root itself ... the beginning of everything, Newton Law cannot describe it ...<br><br>But, Newton LAW is acceptable by world: we should come back to highschool's physics, bro ... people can create space craft, car, train, even MRT or anything ... because Newton Law is *working* and *correct* ... if there is failure in Newton Law ... then when you see MRT, you will scream: "What a magical being!"</strong><br>Newton Law when APPLIED CORRECTLY have this effect. But it MISSED OUT something BUT I'm NOT referring to what you've suggested. Anyway, OUT OF TOPIC.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><strong><br>So how people describe the lack of Newton Law? Some scientist create theory about Big Bang, but that is *theory* (not law) ... and scientist have *faith* on it.</strong><br>'Big Bang theory' is just a PROPOSED theory. And people would use it UNTIL a BETTER PICTURE or more APPROPRIATE picture comes in. This has ALWAYS been the way it is since ancient times TILL TODAY. They have 'faith' in it, but when the TIME come and there's a NEED to CHANGE IT. They DO.<br>Agree... at least you can see Sun and Moon, but you cannot see God.<br><br><strong><br>By saying that, you can measure my faith? Even I cannot measure my own faith. A priest who served God for very long time may fall into drug, money, woman or pride. But, a killer who repent because he saw God in *faith*, he risked his live for gospel (Paul in bible)? So, how we measure someone's faith? Only God know it ...</strong><br>Yes, PERSONALLY I BELIEVE it's POSSIBLE. But the technology has to be VERY ADVANCE. But MOST PROBABLY NOBODY would come up with something like that because it would be MEANINGLESS. As if it READs a SCALE, it'll probably FLUCTUATEs ALOT. BESIDEs, HUMANs DON'T LIKE to have DEVICEs that would 'judge' them and probably lead to ENDLESS TROUBLEs.....<br></blockquote>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

But I remember you telling me that *Faith* is a NECESSARY TOOL to reach GOD?<br><br>So let's PRESUME you're saying YOU CAN REACH GOD BY EITHER (1)LOTS of FAITH (2)He CHOOSE you?<br><br>Normal THEORY-HYPOTHESIS BUILD UP SYSTEM:<br><br>(1)      SUBSTANTIAL FACTs (Through SCIENCE)<br>+<br>BELIEF =&gt; SUBSTANTIAL FACT BASED on<br>a BELIEF/IDEA/THEORY<br><br>(2) INSUBSTANTIAL FACTs (Through SCIENCE)<br>+<br>BELIEF =&gt; PROPOSED HYPOTHESIS<br><br>(3) BELIEF =&gt; ???<br><br>For people with LOTs of FAITH, they EASILY falls to the PROPOSED HALLUCINATION trend IF WITHOUT SUPPORTING FACTs.<br>For people without FAITH, IF they're the CHOSEN ones which GOD would REVEAL to, then they'll gain SUFFICIENT FAITH but NOT OVERDOSE of it. But it would be BASED on FAITH ALONE. (They 'see' or 'feel' GOD but NO SCIENTIFIC evidence?) It reminds me of a 'game' my siblings used to play with me when I was LITTLE. They point out that there's a BIG MOUSE behind me, and when I turn around they'll say it've DISAPPEARED. When I turned aback in their direction they'll say it've APPEARED again. IF I've FAITH in them and what they said, I would CHOOSE to BELIEVE them. However, this has NO DIRECT linkage with the FACT of which the BIG MOUSE was really there. Only with SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE (Not AMBIGUIOUS one) can I put the MATTER as a FACT.<br>And of AMBIGUIOUSCITY &lt;- If there is such a word? You CANNOT SUPPORT an AMBIGUIOUS subject in terms by ANOTHER AMBIGUIOUS one and EXPECT it to make SENSE. Just like when a VASE has BROKE. You say that it has broken because of the cat jumping over it. You are then SUPPORTED by a friend 'Jack' who is NOT around at the moment, but then mention 'Joe' have heard 'Jack' mentioned the incident BUT he TOO is NOT around. And 'Jen' has heard 'Joe''s account of 'Jack''s version of the incident. If JEN is NOT around. The WHOLE INCIDENT is AMBIGUIOUS.<br><br>[/B]</blockquote>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>Ah... Guess this is the 'misleading' part of the PRESUMPTION? WHY should you ALIGN *COINCIDENCE* with *ENVIRONMENT*? DEFINING the *COINCIDENCE* as the MIRACLE INCIDENT that had happened. We're discussing here a CAUSE and EFFECT thing. The EFFECT being the INCIDENT. The CAUSE? WHY the ENVIRONMENT? WHY NOT an OBJECT? A FORCE? And SIMPLY subsituting the ENVIRONMENT with CHURCH makes it a somehow seemingly straightforward and convenient way to see things? NO OFFENCE?<br></strong><br><br>Sorry I mistyped it ... replace my word with :<br><strong><br>But, a normal man will associate this *SOMETHING OTHER THAN COINCIDENCE* with *ENVIRONMENT*...<br></strong><br>that is what I meant ... the *SOMETHING* itself instead of the *COINCIDENCE* .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong><br>1. In church, chairs broke.<br>2. Church worship GOD.<br>3. GOD in church broke chairs?<br></strong><br>Well if charis broken at once... people will associate it *maybe* with earthquake, or maybe the chairs are quite old and used. Just like when I walk, suddenly I fall because the road is slippery, I won't say: "A Force push me then I fall"...<br>But when *MIRACLE THING* happened such as blind man can see, that is not as simple as how someone can break a chair.<br><br>I agree with your statement "using FORCE terminology instead of GOD", well that is right. But many people associate the FORCE with God, that is proven where more people in this world with *religion* rather than people with no *religion* (people who doesn't believe if God is exist). By clear and normal sense, most people will associate this *FORCE* with *GOD*. That's why, different religion may have different perspective about GOD, but they acknowledge that GOD is exist.<br><br><strong><br>1. In church, people fall down.<br>2. Church worship GOD.<br>3. GOD in church makes people fall down?<br></strong><br><br>Well... that is really happened... The term is "FALL IN SPIRIT", that means God bound your physical body so you become so weak until you cannot stand. Then it will be more easier for God to speak to your heart when you are weak. This makes sense to my mind, 'cos by default, human are stubborn when they are *awake* or *feel strong*...<br>God works more tremendously for people who can humble their heart... In "FALL IN SPIRIT" state, people usually feel how weak there are, thus humble their heart...<br><br><strong><br>From YOUR POINT OF VIEW, LOTS OF FAITH is NOT ABSOLUTE. But I remember you telling me that *Faith* is a NECESSARY TOOL to reach GOD?<br></strong><br><br>I mean the word "LOTS" ... not necessary "LOTS", it can be small or even null .. I believed in God when even I was forced by my friend to go to church. Is my faith big? no...<br><br><strong><br>you telling me that *Faith* is a NECESSARY TOOL to reach GOD<br></strong><br>Yes, FAITH is human's tool to reach GOD (I use word tool, but it is not very accurate, maybe I may say "FUEL", but yet it is not accurate too)...<br>But the handshaking between MAN and GOD is not one way. True, human way to reach God is by Faith, but the way for God to reach human is by *GRACE* ...<br><br>So, just like I said, even though I have null faith, but yet God so mercyfull to me... That will become my living testimony: "I am saved because of God's mercy, not because of what I did"...<br><br>About <strong>AMBIGUIOUSCITY </strong>, well just like I said, need Need a courage to accept that *SOMETHING OTHER THAN COINCIDENCE* is happened. And need *FAITH* to believe the *SOMETHING* is the GOD Himself or the action of GOD. Yet, just like I said, more than 80% people in this world have *religion*, they have *courage* and *faith* to acknowledge that *AMBIGUIOUSCITY* is GOD...<br><br>But, at least you *ACKNOWLEDGE* that the *FORCE* which is supranatural is exist. Then, either you say the *FORCE* is GOD or NATURAL COINCIDENCE, it is depend on your decision. Yet to decide to accept that the FORCE is GOD/NATURAL/SOMETHING is the action of FAITH itself.<br><br>I think, before you can believe there is God or not, you have to define the *FORCE* itself: Change the topic into "WHAT IS SUPRANATURAL FORCE", once you can define it, it is more likely you can know whether God is exist or not.<br><br>So far, my definition of church's *FORCE* is my *GOD* ...<br><br><strong><br>From Belle:<br><br>That's a rather selective god....only chosen ones are saved. What about the thousands killed?<br></strong><br><br>FROM MY PREVIOUS POST:<br><br>Many who are called, but little who are choosen...<br><br>That doesn't mean God is not fair, but God knows until the deepest of human heart. He knows if a very wicked criminal will response to his calling, and He knows the other who plays "religius" but condemn God in their heart...<br><br>Even at baby state, God knows what a baby will do when it becomes adult, or what will happen when this baby is called to gospel; whether the baby will reject or not...<br><br>Actually the word chosen doesn't mean : GOD choose someone, but the meaning is : GOD know who will reply to His calling... People who (sooner or later) reply to His calling, they are choosen people .. a wonderful people of God ...<br><br>How can we know? Maybe the passanger of the Airplane turn into believing in God so even though they died, they are now in His presence?<br><br>But even to those who died in sudden (no time to repent), God knew that even though He gives chance to this man, he won't reply...<br>God is fair, it is just God knows *in advance* what human will do, yet He still give human *freedom* to choose...<br><br>rgds,<br><br>Alex<br><br>[This message has been edited by LexZEUS (edited 14 September 2001).]</div>
