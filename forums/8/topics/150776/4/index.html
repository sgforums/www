            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, if the government dun be so greedy or  corrupt with their overpaid bank accounts, we might have enuff money to setup a milltary force as a organsation like the police. Dun say not enuff money 4 million ppl pay 10 dollars each yearly enuff for the "securitry budget"? But their living in mansions and high society lives means we all are slave to the army. Thanks for wasting 2 years of our lives. Not blaming the lee or anyone in particular,  but some governement ppl are just 2 scare or braindead by all those studies  to try anything new even if it works better.</div>
