And look for your rights. And in this case, since the thread starter did not mention how many times his friend has committed the offence, it is not wise to assume. But if his friend indeed commit the offence repeatably, disregarding military law, then he deserve it.<br><br></div>

Don't worry friend, as long as you still do your reservist, you will notice the difference between how NSF &amp; NSmen are treated differently. The former being a youngster and the latter a mature adult warrant different use of method of instruction, system and discipline.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
