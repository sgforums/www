            <div class='col-md body'>Hi... What are you going to sign on as? Let's not talk abt vocation for now...  You wanna sign on as officer or specialist?<br><br>For officer, are u holding onto a degree? If just a diploma or A levels. Let me tell U.. forget it... you will probably only be able to work till the age of 45 as MAJORs will retire at that age.<br><br>If Specialists, first of all... Are you fit enough to pass IPPT every single year? Without passing IPPT every year, you can forget about promotions. And now with a new ruling, all combat specialists must have at least one confidence badge.. Which is either Airborne or Jungle confidence. The selection test is already not easy to pass for once. If you do not have the badge, you will be stuck at the rank of SSG.<br><br>Please reconsider.... Honestly speaking, I am a signed on regular holding the rank of SSG. And I think I will be leaving in 2 years time as at the age of 27, I doubt that I can survive the jump as I have been working in a service environment though having a combat vocation.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Moose, i thank you for taking my comments in stride and pray you do not take offence. The last two sentences were meant to be jibes. However, it was my folly for not particularly directing my thoughts at the "bad" regulars. It isn't fair to look upon them under the same light but I guess my biasness stems from my bad experiences with some. Perhaps then, the deep-rooted perception. Regards.</div>

The last two sentences were meant to be jibes. However, it was my folly for not particularly directing my thoughts at the "bad" regulars. It isn't fair to look upon them under the same light but I guess my biasness stems from my bad experiences with some. Perhaps then, the deep-rooted perception.
