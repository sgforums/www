            <div class='col-md body'>-snort- conditional chivalry?<br><br>I agree that people can be more pleasant to each other, when all it takes is a smile and a nod and a single word, it is kind of sad when its not given. I think people SHOULD show appreciation when someone is nice to them.<br><br>However, I still think it is sadder when people give themselves reasons/excuses for not doing simple SMALL things like holding the door open (you neither need to be chivalrous nor MALE to do it), giving up your seat, and all these tiny little things.<br><br>Why the hell do you need CONDITIONS to do things like this?? What do you get out of it?? Must be so calculative until one ounce of nice things you do for people MUST be equal to one ounce of appreciation? It's pathetic for people to expect thanks and get so aggrieved and upset when all they've done is really something very very small and inconsequential - unless of course they have an artificially enhanced importance of every small act they do.<br><br>Holding door open, giving up your seat - stuff like this - isnt about chivalry! It's about basic human decency! Just because someone ELSE doesnt have the decency to say thanks, simply isn't a good enough excuse.</div>
