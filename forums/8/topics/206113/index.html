            <div class='col-md body'>ST, Aug 19, 2006<br>Why he has stopped being chivalrous<br><br>IT IS no secret that much has been said about Singapore men lacking in chivalry. It is also no secret as to which gender the accusers belong.<br><br>I agree that some men are indeed lacking in chivalry. To a certain extent, this would include yours truly.<br><br>I am 37 years of age and was, in my earlier years, full of this so-called 'chivalry'. I had believed very strongly in this quality and had no bias regarding the age, race, nationality and gender of those shown this 'chivalry'.<br><br>Sadly, that was in the past.<br><br>This quality in me has 'died'. After years of giving up my seats to those in need (mostly the old and pregnant women); holding doors open for folks passing through after me (mostly women); helping to retrieve articles for people who had dropped them (again, mostly women), I regret to say that only a handful of these people whom I had shown such basic courtesy had smiled and said 'Thank you!' (mostly men).<br><br>Most of the women simply walked away either as if nothing had happened or with a facial expression that seemed to imply I had done or said something rude to them.<br><br>All I had done was something most would describe as either chivalrous or courteous.<br><br>Well, I certainly know why I hesitate to be chivalrous to the 'fairer sex' these days.<br><br>Alex Tan Li Er <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

But if you are the first, you are just wasting people's time and your own, cos you will ALWAYS be constantly disappointed that your kindness is rarely reciprocated. I rather people like this dont try... cos if they dont try.. they are just NOT nice... than end up bitter and being NOT NICE and saying it's everyone else's fault for their own inadequacy.</div>

I'm sure he must have held on to that door for some time but the people walking through must have taken him for granted and never bothered to 'relieve' him of that action by holding on to the door for the next person walking through.<br><br>I had the experience of holding on to the door for the opposite direction of people to go past me but no one bothered to hold on to it. I certainly did not expect myself to be holding on to the door the indefinitely so just let it go.</div>
