              <p>i dunno about your schools lar. but so far for
                  mine....yeah....they're just...rather useless 'punishments'. just
                  stuff the teachers made you do so that they'll feel like they are

              <p>yah. mi and my sis grew close because...somewhat because of my mom oso larh. my GUESS is that it's cos my mom forced my sis to follow her to halifax cos my mom couldnt deal with the fact that i just left so suddenly. and my sis didnt really want to leave singapore yet. and when she first came over, there wasnt really anyone my sis could talk to or something. so then we just started talking.....? i don't realli know...&gt;.&lt;<br>but yesh. that's the one thing that's good about siblings (if they get along). if no get along, then.......it's hell.</p>
