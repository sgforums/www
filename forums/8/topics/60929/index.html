Are there any competitors at all?<br><br>Yahoo? That's much more like a grocery store to me. They're targeting everyone.<br><br>What I'm looking into here is selling books only, maybe at the start (think amazon.com). And comparing with Yahoo, the books would have to be carefully categorized so that people can find them (think amazon.com again).<br><br>Regards to earnings......As long as the benefit cover the cost can already. &lt;---that's short term thinking. Of course there has to be substantial income. That's just in case there's a surge in traffic on the site (most probably would not).
