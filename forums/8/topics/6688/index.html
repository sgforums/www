After their BMT, they mostly go to their vocations and are paid around $350.<br>dont you think that the Singapore government should increase this amount of allowances???<br><br>Take an example, the poly students going on industrial attachment receive allowances of minimun $400.<br><br>So, we do relaxed thing can get $400, but we do tough thing only get $240. What is the government treating us as???<br><br>And some more, the government doesnt spent a single cent on NS, all those NS allowances come from our taxes!!!<br><br>I'm not talking all about money here, it's just that the treatment is unfair.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ever took into account the meals served at SAF cookhouses? Cost-wise?<br><br>This cook I knew back in NS gave me the breakdown of the meal costs... it cost the SAF $20 per person per DAY to feed them 4 meals (stay-in personnel, like me, gets 4 meals in-camp). We've always wondered why can't they go cheapo on the meals a little and give us the $20 x 20 days as allowance instead...<br><br>Poly or Uni students on IA get average $500 cost they hafta pay for their meals and transport, while NSmen have all these taken care of...<br><br>They can don't even pay you and you still have to cheong sua <span style="font-style: italic;">by law</span>...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...think you still dun get it. Like I said, National Service is compulsory. Well, if you are not happy, you can always AWOL. National Service is a period deemed for guys to train up ourselves physically and mentally. Treat it as a 2 or 2.5 year of leadership training and experience gaining.Either way, when you grow old you will start to understand the merits of NS.<br><br>Ok. Allowances. There is a huge difference between regulars and NSFs. Regulars are paid to do the job. They will continue to work cos they are paid to do it. And obviously they will get a relatively high pay to survive in the outside world. NSFs on the other hand are OBLIGED to do it. I repeat OBLIGED.

            <div class='col-md body'>yah even the pathetic allowance is not enuff to spend during a weekend, especially if you are those stay in and only "released" like ghosts during hungry ghost festivals.<br><br>those who went to schools will not even have the chance to spend it. During my NS, when I am having the 4 mths trade course at SOA, every tests you failed will result in confinements not forgetting those small small "tokens of appreciations" from those bastard instructors. Let's say if there are around 10++ tests (eg. 40, 50, cupola, GPMG, etc....), and you failed most of them, you can smell your weekends goodbye.<br><br>Oh please, regulars doing all the work? Please open your eyes and observe, where you find jobs in Singapore that pay you to tok tok and sing song eat smoke eat fat fat and then get 2000++???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oakley, that makes no sense. Even a paltry $240/mth is $60 per weekend. Quite enough for any average guy. For guys enlisting straight after school especially, how much allowance did you get from your parents prior to enlistment? Usually less. Is that insufficient too? And you had to pay for the food in school canteens. For stay-in fellows food is FREE. And if you're confined for the weekend, all the better. More money to spend on your day off.<br><br>Not enough???</div>
