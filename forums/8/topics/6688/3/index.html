            <div class='col-md body'>adrian xtc, some of your friends' complaints are invalid. Do they seriously think the NS allowance is meant to cover their internet/pager/handphone bills and sponsor their girlfriends? I won't elaborate on the rest; it's a similar waste of time. You gave examples of those who don't think it's enough; others have given counter-examples of it being more than enough. Your case so far is inconclusive at best. Your most logical argument so far lies in the plight of some stay-out personnel.<br><br>I'd like some constructive answers from you, please.<br><br>1. How much is enough? How much do the average REC, 3SG and 2LT receive currently, and how much SHOULD they receive? Please justify.<br><br>2. Roughly how much money is required to pay our NSFs the figure you give, for a year?<br><br>3. Since you said the money comes from taxpayers, would you support a corresponding increase in taxes as well? If not, where will the money come from?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>adrian's concept of NS allowance is really funny. quite amusing in fact.<br><br>firstly, u stay a recruit for only 10 weeks. in reality, you leave camp 8 times in yr entire BMT (exclude nights-out...dunno whether now Tekong got or not) as u have to stay-in for the first 2 weeks. let's say that u spend $4 per 2-way trip (2 buses or bus + MRT). that is only $32. with another $32 for weekend recreational transport<br><br>$70 for internet bill. c'mon, how many hrs do u spend at home to use yr comp in the first place? it's either stay at home with yr comp or go out. and i really dun believe a REC won't go out on a weekend. thus yr internet bill should only be about $25. (going by Singnet)<br><br>HP bill. HP is a want. Not a need. if u dun have enough $$$, do without it.<br><br>Food. Let's say that u eat 3 meals out a weekend at $4 per meal (more than the $4 a day adrian used). that works out to be $12x8=$96<br><br>A movie a weekend and $10 for misc. that's $144.<br><br>total - $32+$32+$96+$144=$304<br><br>and how much do u get in BMT? $240x2=$480<br><br>enough $$$ to handle HP bill too, or save a bit.<br><br>after that, yr allowance goes up, so what is Adrian complaining about???<br><br>the highest allowance given to an NSF (excluding commandoes, naval divers, overseas personnel and the special cases) is that of a LTA at $780.<br><br>any LTAs out there who complain they have no $$$?<br><br>c'mon if u're just a lousy spendthrift, more money won't make a diff. my batch-boy used to take home $1400 (b4 we disrupted) and he couldn't save nuts either. while another of my batch-boy who took home $200 more (poly guy) could finance a car. why? think a bit.<br><br>to guitar. ha....performance bonus. this system exists for regulars and there are so many complaints abt it already. the first thing that comes to mind is fairness. what is fairness? when u get the max from the performance bonus?<br><br>asking yr PC and OC to rank u? don't they do that in training sch now and still the system is imperfect? and yr PC is a NSF too. if he ranks u poorly, how would u react? even if he's a regular, would it make a diff?<br><br>and btw, increasing NSF allowance from budget surplus is unequal distribution of wealth. what would the girls say? and do u know how much $$$ is needed to support the Sing $ when times are bad? where does the $$$ come from? basic macroeconomics.<br><br>as for why shouldn't regulars get 2.5 yrs of NSF pay and regular pay after that, let me ask a counter-question. why should anyone on industrial attachment no matter in poly or uni get paid then? u're doing it for yr diploma or yr degree. u can get paid when u join the company AFTER u grad rite?<br><br>finally, as other have said b4, NS is an OBLIGATION. allowances are NOT the same as salary.<br><br></div>

Even if 50% don't think like you we got problem liao.<br><br>Let me think why people don't think like u.  NS is compulsory by law.  Agreed.  Issit fair? Let me think of some points to argue you. Let me train my argumentative skills.<br><br>1) Girls: they don't serve NS leh.  So what's wrong if NSF get more money?  Girls also win from the protection we provide what.. our tanks and planes and ships protect SINGAPORE.. of which they are so many GIRLs.<br>So why cannot we, GUYS, get more?<br><br>1.1)Some more don't forget hor.. RESERVIST.  Fun har?  40 days a year.. go chiong sua.. some even go Australia or Taiwan.. no need to feed family and bring wife for movie har?<br><br>1.2)GUYS don't do NS.. start working.. 2 years can get promoted liao.. life is short leh.. some more bloody unfair those foreign talent or malaysian or dunno what nation people start work.. same batch as me.. 2 years earn so much money liao.<br><br>1.3)GIRLS again - wah lao.. my friend tell me har.. he ORD.. finish University.. start working.. his BOSS is his classmate har.. GIRL!. got fair?  You tell me leh...<br><br>2) FOREIGNERS.  They also don't serve NS leh. Foreign talent, come in take our jobs, and then don't have to serve NS, and then they win liao lah.... you call this fair? Some more my economics friend say foreign talent pay the same taxes.  Why don't govt tax them more and give us the money? Is Singapore for Singaporeans or for Foreign Talent?<br><br>3) Macroeconomics - FWAH! you use macroeconomics to come and cheem me out.. never mind.. i go ask my friend.. next time discuss with you.<br><br>Ok Ok.. teacher always say argue with points.. must have conclusion.  So my conclusion is:  We need ARMY or else neighbour will BULLY us.  But since GUYS make<br>so many sacifices.. my friend taught me 'OPPORTUNITY COST'... cheem word but i think can use here. Sweat for nation.. nation give GUYS more money.. what's wrong?<br><br>(Govt so much money what.. i said b4, 9 BILLION dollar leh...if they got no money then we sacrifice a bit no problem lah.. )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guitar,<br>It may be fine to say that guys who serve NS should get more allowance as everyone gets protected including girls. Your rationale comes from the fact that our govt has budget surplus every year. However if in times of crisis, the govt still wants to increase taxes and such to fund the expenses as there is a lack of reserves, will you pay without a grumble? The surpluses are accumulated to tide us over any bad times.<br><br>I do agree that the pay is not really enough if you want to spend on HPs, branded goods, taxi everywhere instead of MRT etc. But NS is a phase whereby it can actually initiate one into the working world where things are not as simple as just being a student or Daddy's boy. We undergo shit in NS but it makes us more prepared to face the working environment as well. The govt also attempts to make up for the "lost" 2.5 yrs but giving higher pay to guys when they apply for jobs. Not sufficient as most may say as it is only a $200 - $300 difference, but it shows that the companies are not blind to the sacrifices.<br>Not everything can be justified in monetary terms. The security we enjoy as a result of NS is something that we cannot put a $$ figure on. If we can earn more $$$ and the end result is that we get attacked and go to war losing, is our money still impt when lives are lost and family is broken up?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That is why all govt sector jobs gives guys a 2.5 yr increment straightaway if they have completed their NS. They appreciate ur contributions to the nation and that is why they take ur NS service as service for them. As for the reservist thing, don't forget that when u go for reservist trainings, u get a lot of tax rebates. That's why I always hear of gers complaining about income tax but not guys.<br><br>As for ur last point, I think the government IS doing things to share in the surpluses. Just that they are not doing enuff in ur opinion. However we must not forget the good teachings of saving for a rainy day. If the government spends like what u suggest, Singapore may not have any surpluses anymore. Without a strong reserve, do you thing Singapore could have gone thru the currency crisis relatively unharmed?<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guitar, do quote in which sentence of my post did I say the govt has NO surplus? I said the govt has surplus but if they are going to use it all up to give more allowances to NSF and other schemes, they will end up with almost zero. Do read carefully before u reply.<br><br>CPF cuts during crisis? Have you ever wondered about the rationale for it? It is to cut business costs so that all the MNCs and other co. have a lower operating cost and need not wind up. Please get your facts right before commenting. It is painful but it helps as a whole. Would you rather lose jobs that do suffer a cut? with the cuts in CPF, there are also rebates given in other areas. I'm not saying that the govt is always right, but so far, its moves have on a whole been beneficial. It is good to hear alternative views but not to the extent of picking on every single thing in a micro sense.</div>

The allowance is just to cover ur transport costs and for whatever barang barang u may need to buy in camp.<br>The allowance is NOT for you to pay for ur handphone bills, pay for ur pager bills, pay for ur internet bills, go for meals at posh restaurants, support ur girlfriends etc. If you need to do all the above, the $$$ of coz has to come from ur parents. Such activities do not come with the NS package, so naturally u cannot expect the NS allowance to cover that. You CAN do without all these during NS. But if u CHOOSE not to, u have to come up with ur own dough. Isn't that logic enuff.<br><br>I didn't have the need to do all these when I was in NS...and yes, I survived on $200 a month during BMT without once having to ask for $$$ from my parents.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

Issit not Prime Minister say need more what.. entrepreneurship... more what take chances.. start business.. ALL PRIVATE SECTOR leh.. who pay me?<br><br>Also becoz of NS I start later by 2.5 years... some people say in USA 1 year become millionaire liao.. what dot.com ah.. powerful!!  So 2.5 year i can start business.. go bust can start again.. still young can chiong.. maybe i make friends with Sim Wong Hoo... but now how?  2.5 year chiong sua!<br><br>Govt sector pay more at start? SO WHAT? GOT BIG FAT USE?  my colleague.. GIRL.. can become my BOSS in 2 years.. so last time same class..  now call her BOSS.  got fair?<br><br>2)Reservist training<br>POOI!  Tax rebate?  You never check your figures come and want to use big words like tax rebate to argue me.  I check up ar.  Thank you buddy! I copy what my buddy write:<br><br>From my buddy:<br>Tax reliefs for NS-man:<br>The tax reliefs granted by the Singapore government are in supposedly in recognition of our NS-man.  The tax reliefs are, contrary to opinion in this forum, insubstantial.  If you have served ICT in your last year, you get a $2,000 tax relief.  If you have not, you get $1,000. Furthermore, your wife or your parents get $500 tax relief.<br><br>The point you must note is that this is a tax relief and not rebate.  Giving you a $2000 tax relief is like adding another $2000 to your tax free allowance.  To give you an example, let's say you earn 40,000 a year.  So with the NS tax relief, 38,000 will be up for tax.  The point here is the relief isn't worth very much.  If you are paying at the highest income rate bracket, which is 28%, the relief is worth just $560.  Furthermore, 60% to 65% of Singaporeans don't pay tax.  This relief is then worth almost nothing to them.<br><br>You fail to consider the opportunity cost of NS service and reservist training.  For NS service, it is 2 to 2.5 years off civilian life.  You could advanced in your career or gotten a higher qualification in that time.  For reservist training, it is not a secret that many employers hate the idea of their employees disappearing for 40 days a year.  The govt sector has no choice but to support the govt policy and you will probably not be penalised too heavily for it.  However the private sector individuals will bear much of this burden.  What is stopping the private sector employer to favour, when it comes to employment AND/OR promotion, a foreign talent or lady?  It is easy to bring them in. And they work for you the whole year round without having to go for reservist training.<br><br>Yes in defense we all have a part to play.  But it is arguably unfair that our defense umbrella covers people who do not contribute to defense, eg women.  It is BLATANTLY unfair that our defense covers people who aren't even Singaporeans.<br><br>regards,<br>Violin<br>-------------------<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I got some more to say.<br><br>3)light: I never say u say govt got no surplus.  I also never say that govt give ALL surplus away!  You read my last posting, I only say, goodies share, no goodies we tahan.<br><br>So... govt give some surplus away and not all. Of course we need to save.. but save so much for what?  You never read papers all my champion MPs ask govt why so much money never give out?  Hooray !! I vote for my MP coz he knows how i feel.<br><br>9 billion!  Singapore so small got 9 billion surplus!!! USA and other angmoh country.. every year in debt.. how come they so zai?  We pay our ministers so much.. why cannot ask them to make us happy a bit?<br><br>You want to save can lah... now our kitty bank got so many many billion.. more than angmoh country... why we need so much?  Also this kitty bank savings now.. sit and idle?  All the interest earn go to whose pocket?<br><br>Already Singapore people not enough savings for retire.. now some more cut CPF.  Some more flat so expensive.. so more i wanna get married.. flat cost $200,000!! FWAH.  Take loan 20 years.. like forever in debt.. is govt loan-shark?  Maybe not but... since we all got debt... they got so much money.. why don't help pay debt?  Come on lah.. money belongs to the people.. not the govt.. money not for them to count.<br><br>So i tell you.. don't whole-day-whole-night say save save save never look at figures. I give you example.. you earn $1000 a month... i ask u save $700 you want or not?<br><br>Don't get me wrong. Don't think I mad. Saving is good. Saving is impt.  But keeping people happy also important.<br><br>All i say is: we set saving target lah.  Every year, got surplus we save a bit and give a bit.  this year surplus so huge, give so little.. see also buah tahan.. Just now i give u example.. earn $1000 save $700, spend $300... you want?  I think u say u don't want.  I check up figures oredi.. look at govt.. surplus 9bil, they give CPF $250 per working singaporean, only spend about 500 mil... so that is what per cent??<br><br>U earn $1000 save 70% damn xiong.. now they got 9bil.. save 94per cent!!<br><br>4) CPF cuts.. crisis sure cut... but crisis over got give back?  why onli now 12%?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guitar, thank you for the patriotic praise. still, i have to make a few pts here.<br><br>1) firstly, true, the NSmen income tax relief is not much. Indeed, tax reliefs merely reduce the amount of taxable income rather than reduce the income tax itself. Now, what tax rebates are there? GST rebate and rebate for 2nd, 3rd and 4th child. Most S'poreans don't pay income tax due to the child tax rebate.<br><br>2) opportunity cost. yes, the opportunity cost of NS is the time u get spend doing other things. but then again, i can also argue that the utility gained by the country as a whole increases due to yr time spent in NS. yr personal utility goes down, the utility on the macro level goes up. ceteris paribus, there is a net gain in utility. i.e society benefits.<br><br>3) it may interest you to know that most private sector companies now given males who have served NS higher starting pay. this is no longer restricted to the public sector. this is thanks to the National Wage Council.<br><br>4) most guys get at least $10000 over the 2.5 yrs in NS. Officers get the most, $16650. and how much does the average girl get over this period of time?<br><br>5) the govt takes so much $$$ and does not return them to S'poreans. Hmm.....guitar, been through primary and secondary sch? how much sch fees did u pay? been to hospital? how much is the govt grant?<br><br>6) what is there to prevent private sector companies from employing foreign skilled labour? corporate tax on foreign labour and work permit charges.<br><br>7) S'poreans not enough savings for retirement. it's called lack of knowledge about financial planning. read the Straits Times in Feb and Mar for more details.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> upgrading. which nation in the world besides S'pore carries out upgrading? and how many countries in the world have a public housing system that is highly subsidised by the govt? and i suppose that the $$$ dropped down from the sky.....<br><br>9) why does S'pore need so much foreign reserves. ever wondered why the Sing $ fluctuated so little (relatively compared to other ASEAN currencies) during the currency crisis? Cos the Sing $ is traded within a band set by the MAS and linked to a basket of int'l currencies. and where does the money come from to support the Sing $? how come Malaysia needed capital controls to prevent outflow of hot money?<br><br>10) finally, if u think it's so easy to become a dot.com millionaire, go ahead and try. it's very easy to read success stories and i admit that there are tons of them. i question yr ability to pull it off. with all due respect, if everyone can do it, why would we be doing other things? we'll all be millionaires.<br><br>be more practical, that's my advice<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very good! Altrex attack me in points!  I answer u back in points!  Sorry if i sound little rude but this is friendly argument so no hard feelings har!<br><br>1)Tax rebates: GST rebate give to ALL taxpayers.  You serve NS, don't serve NS, PR, foreign talent, John Olds.. ALL got GST rebate.  2nd,3rd,4th child rebate.. you joking lah most singaporeans not pay tax becoz of 2,3,4 child?  Hullo!  NOT ENOUGH CHILDREN!!  govt say only 1.4 child per woman.. u tell me how many people get this rebate lah.<br><br>2)Society benefits. but why should cost of such benefit be only on GUYS?  That is my question to you.  I never say society don't benefit.  In fact i say b4, defense impt or else neighbour bully us.  All i asking is fair recognition.<br><br>3)Good to hear! But the last i heard many big MNCs and other companies still give same starting pay.You can give me evidence i believe u or else i believe what my kaki tell me.<br><br>4)Girls get ahead in education...go out to work b4 guys and earn a whole lot more money.. especially those poly and uni ones.  They start 2 years early.. say earn $1500 a month, times 30 months is 45000, hell of a lot more than ur officer.<br><br>Some more they gain work experience.. get promoted.. NS gain what? Chiong sua experience. Can use in civilian life? Maybe can lah har.. u be PC or Sargaent after go civilian life use all ur swear words to get things done?@#$@#$!@#!@#@!!<br><br>5)Don't talk to me about hospitals.. damn expensive.. stay one week never operation can reach $1500.. C-class ward some more..<br>How much sch fees i pay?? Little! BUT, I also pay taxes!<br><br>6)tell me more about corporate tax on foreign labour.. this one i never hear b4..give me some evidence,  if so much corporate tax on foreign labour.. tell me why now DBS run by ang moh and foreign talent? I tell u foreign labour also pay same income tax as local labour.. Singapore for foreign talent or Singapore for Singaporeans?<br><br>7)Public housing - i tell u.. this is govt strategy.. u want to be trick u can be trick.. all our money spent on HDB.. all our savings in property.. end of the day run also cannot run.. don't u see the trick? Public upgrading.. hahaha.. another way of gaining  votes lah... what vote for u i upgrade u first.. that means what.. vote not secret lah.. i vote for my MP but if I one day don't vote for him, then issit i will get arrested?<br><br>9) I never say Singapore don't need money to fight currency.. i just want to ask u.. HOW MUCH WE NEED? 9bil? 90bil? 900bil?  When is enough? All i saying is we already got a lot of money in kitty-bank.. if govt say we need more.. tell us how much more..  if kitty bank need more and don't top-up we tomorrow will all die, then say so we give, we fight to save Singapore.. don't suga-suga take take take and we see no end to the story.<br><br>10)i never say easy to be dot.com champion.. all i say is if people like u so pour a lot of cold water tell all the people in singapore don't even try, then you'll NEVER EVER EVER EVER get another Sim Wong Hoo...  all i saying is when u young.. you more on, you can chiong.. u more time to take falls, and recover.. i think u right.. i try 99% will fail.. but if 100 people try, maybe 1 will win.<br><br>you ask me be practical.. i ask u be fair.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>guitar,<br>Here's my reply for yr different points.<br><br>1) Do note that no one owes you a job. You can choose to work wherever you want, be it ina public or private sector. Yes, entrepreneurship is the buzzword nowadays and it involves a certain amt of risk taking. However there are funds available and venture capitalists around to support any budding entrepreneurs as long as you have a good idea. No doubt not everybody can get access to such funds but think back, is it that the idea is not so good which was why it was rejected in the first place? Dot com companies? Yes some really made it big, but ever taken a look at the number of failures?<br>Come on.... If you can make it, 2.5 yrs NS is not going to make it that much worse. Mr Sim Wong Hoo? Did he undergo NS? I cannot be sure but I think he did. Anyone who has an understanding of Creative and Mr Sim will know that today's success is not easy to come by. Mr Sim underwent a number of failures bofore making his mark today. Cheers to him. Looks like NS did not harm him right?<br><br>Female classmate become superior? what is the problem? If you have the ability you can easily surpass her. In private sector jobs, to my understanding, it is the performance that is more important than just a 2 year experience and headstart. Do you think that just by plain having a 2 year work experience can allow you to sit safely in the job of a superior or manegerial role?<br><br>2)Do not insult our female population by saying that they do not contribute to our defense. They do contribute just that not in the same way as by serving national service. So you are against the idea of your mum or sisters or grandparents being protected cos "they never contribute"? What kind of logic is this?<br>60-65% does not pay tax? So how come they no need to pay tax? One reason is due to a cumulative effect of such reliefs. Opportunity cost? Like what some of the other forumites have said, the money is an ALLOWANCE. It is what you get for your service in exchange for a stable environment to study and work in. Just 2.5 yrs and a few weeks of reservist every year in exchange for the stability is not worth it? Not just your own but yr family members and dear ones as well. Or maybe they "NEVER" contribute so they don't deserve to get protected? Where does the "BLATANTLY unfair" comes in? When you travel out of Singapore, you can die and get shot or rob or raped and it is not the foreign countries' business? Or even when one work overseas, they die their own busniess? where is the logic again?<br><br>3) Easy to say goddies share and all. does goodies have to come in monetary terms before you can appreciate it? Who or what gave you the chance to learn to write and read without excessive worries of invasions? What is it that allowed yr parents have a stable job to support you? Singapore is a small country with the only resource being its people and even then the pool of people to draw talents from is small. Don't compare with other much bigger countries. There is a host lot of difference which I shall not go into here. Anyway what is your defination of "zai"? If they are so good, my advice to you is to migrate overseas. Why stay here? In our country there are pros and cons. Singapore in no exception. Not everything is good here but then we do have merits that other countries may not have.<br><br>4) Crisis over? How are you so sure? There is such a thing can prudent and conservative. I do support a raise back to the original 20% or even more but try thinking on the perspective of the employer and you may understand why the increases are in minor steps. It is to prevent too large a disruption at one time to the normal operating activities. The drastic cut was a painful one for workers but then if the cut never happen much more will lose their jobs.<br><br>NS is just one problem on the govt's mind. there are tons of other things to balance the expenses and income. The nation can give more allowance, but how much is enough? They are increasing the ameneties in NS and better bunks and beds. All these are not improvements? Maybe it is because 2.5 yrs is not long enough for us to see the change. Try asking those around 10 years your senior and you may learn to appreciate the improvements.<br><br>Just to let you know, I did not take a single cent from my parents as allowance since JC and I survived well and fine today. I even managed to save a small portion of my NS pay. It is just a matter of control and planning your expenses.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
