            <div class='col-md body'>It is always easy to critisize a system but how many think that they can for sure do a better job if the task is entrusted to them? It is easy to consider one's personal interest in issues like allowances but the govt is not supporting like 10 NS personnel. They are supporting much much more. Even a $10 increase adds up to a hugh amt. So if they increase yr NS allowance and maybe increase yr sch fees or taxes, so are u going to be happy? Stop whining abt small allowances when everything is so much better now. Got catered food lar, OO at BMT, loads of welfare programs etc etc etc.<br><br>Man is never satisfied.</div>

They are normally of 2nd class compare to regulars though not in all cases.<br></div></blockquote>This is something that I felt compelled to clarify. NS officers do not have lesser responsibilities. Unless u compare a 2LT with a CPT, of coz the 2LT has lesser responsibilities. But if u compare against the same rank, I am very sure that the NSF 2LT will have almost the same responsibilities as a regular LTA, maybe even more. A lot of you seem to have this mistaken concept that more work equate to more responsibilities. Well that's not true. In the army, responsibilty usually means the amount of blame you must shoulder when anything happens. That is why a man must work like siao but he is only responsible for himself. A PC, on the other hand, may look very idle, but he has to overlook the platoon and should anything happen to just one man, his ass will get buttered. That's the cold hard truth in any organisations, not just the SAF.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Seifer (edited 25 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Somehow I feel that kids nowadays are becoming too affluent and too pampered. This question just about reaffirmed my suspicions. If previous batches can survive on $200 a month, why can't ppl now with $240? The answer, of coz is simple. Previously, we dun have things like starbucks, coffee beans etc. We dun crave for designer jeans, clothes that much. Heck, we dun even carry pagers, much lest handphones. $240 in my opinion is more than enough, considering the fact that all ur food and lodgings are paid for. Of coz the army can pay u $1000 a month. But if u then have to pay 4 ur own food and lodgings, will u be better off? A very good testimony that army allowance is more than the enuff is the fact that a lot of ppl managed to come up with the $$$$ to get a driving license only during NS period.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
