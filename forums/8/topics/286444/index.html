You cannot pretend to have real empathy or deny empathy without feeling guilty. It's inborn within us and we're borned with it...like a part of our character.<br><br>If you just want them to stop stepping on you, then it's up to you to prevent yourself from being stepped upon by others. You see, if you've always placed and believed that you yourself are somewhat lower/unworthy than other people around you, then it's your own fault that you allowed yourself to be humiliated/insulted/bullied.<br><br>I would encourage you to always look up on yourself and always place yourself in the highest/higher position than the people who have always tried to see-you-no-up.  We all have our own parents, so there is absolutely no reason why he or his heritage is somehow more noble than yours and his parents owned your parents.<br><br>Avoid contact with that friend of yours if his existence to your social circle is a repeating grieve in your heart and mind.<br><br>If you really want that guy friend of yours to stop his mouth, why don't you just give him a quick but light slap/punch to his chee.bye mouth whenever he intentionally insult/humiliate/bullies you? If he fights back, then you don't need to worry about empathy anymore cos it won't be about empathy if you don't return slap/punch, you have successfully escalated the situation into a survival match. And it's much easier to convince him with your actions than your mouth isn't it? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Always place peace before war and it's not considered as a loser if you run away from a confrontation. Real winners are not bothered by other people's judgementation on himself, cos real winners in life feels like they are always winning in everything that they do in their lives.<br><br>Be a winner, and ditch the losers and resign from living in other people's world which you have considered it to be your own life and start living your own life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
