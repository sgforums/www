            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dakkon_blackblade:</div><div class="quote_body">I think a lot of girls would like that in a guy, but sometimes when I make jokes that are too cheem they don't understand, and yet if I make less intellectual ones they find them lame. Rather hard to please, it seems.<br><br>Also, I find it rather disappointing that a lot of Singaporean girls, even the supposedly well-educated ones, can't appreciate things like bathos, irony, sarcasm, parody and satire, which are rather common forms of humour.</div></blockquote>First, I think you got to understand that having a sense of humour, doesn't necessarily mean you are funny. So it is ok, if people don't understand it <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Second, even if people think you are funny, they might not appreciate your sense of humour. Lots of people laugh at my jokes - without truly understanding WHY I am saying it sometimes. They just think I am eccentric. -shrug-<br><br>It isn't always easy to find someone who have the same sense of humour as you. When you do, its almost like singing a jazz duet, the improvisations on both parts driving the melody to create something so original that the laughter is secondary - and you always depart from that person feeling a sense of gratification. Contrary to what you said, some of my most memorable moments of laughter have been with the wittiest funniest girl friends. And yeah, they are Singaporeans.<br><br>And yet.. while some may enjoy the oscar wilde type of sarcarstic witticism, cutting irony - I don't think I can live with someone who is constantly working on the quality of humour - but rather, someone who has the sense of humour to find the funny, cherished little things in the mundane life both have to lead together - I guess that's what is important about it all.<br><br></div>
