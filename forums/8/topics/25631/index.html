Neither do I a very close friend of her. She don't even give me face to have lunch together at work. Is it very anormal to have lunch with a guy colleague? Again, I can't blame her much of her innocence and young age, still green to relationship stuff. But how do you make her more wake up in situation when a guy asking you go out/lunch as friends? As for their relationship, I don't think they started very long. Maybe becos of that she is still under honeymoon period.<br><br>But thank 4 ur advice &amp; others too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
