              <p>TAIPEI - WEARING colourful masks and black T-shirts with women-hating slogans, dozens of young men paraded through an upscale Taipei shopping centre one night last December yelling at startled couples: 'Lovers, go to hell.'</p>
              <p>It was a rare moment of public exposure for Taiwan's so-called 'home boys' - a generation of single young men who spend their evenings cloistered at home playing online computer games, reading fantasy comic books and complaining in Internet chatrooms about women.</p>
              <p>'You don't have to be sad if you don't have a date,' said 24-year-old college student Lu Yung-ping. 'We can huddle together and have fun.'</p>
              <p>Taiwan is not alone in having such 'home boys'. Japan, Hong Kong and the fast-growing areas of coastal China also have their own versions of them.</p>
              <p>They use the Internet to construct an alternative reality, where fantasy characters and digital games trump domestic responsibilities and the formation of relationships.</p>
              <p>Parents find the trend worrisome, and it has become a hot topic in Taiwan's media.</p>
              <p>Talk shows and popular magazines attribute the phenomenon to a desire to remain in the comfort of mum and dad's home rather than head out into the uncertain world of raising families and paying off mortgages.</p>
              <p>There are no reliable estimates of their numbers, although 'home boys' far outnumber 'home girls' because they tend to spend far more time playing online games.</p>
              <p>Sociologists say their obsession with computers inhibits their ability to have normal personal relationships and to date women - a concern at a time when young Taiwanese are delaying marriage and the fertility rate has fallen to 1.2 children per woman, down from 3.2 in 1971.</p>
              <p>The 'home boys' tend to be self-centred, less caring for others and incapable of problem-solving, said sociology professor Hsueh Cheng-tai of Taipei's National Taiwan University.</p>
              <p>'Many 30-year-olds still have the mentality of children, who want to rely on their parents' care and financial support,' he said. 'They are not ready to get married and fulfil family duties.'</p>
              <p>It is not so much that they hate women, the young men say; it is just that women ignore, reject or betray them.</p>
              <p>And rather than pining away in private, they prefer to gather electronically with fellow sufferers and nurse their wounds by talking about anything except the hurtful side of love.</p>
              <p>But many of the chatroom denizens reject the idea that they are socially awkward, blaming their lack of domestic compatibility on women.</p>
              <p>Said one who identified himself only as Klowa: 'More so than politicians, women are swindlers among swindlers. They will cheat you of your money and time, or worse, steal from several men at the same time.'</p>
              <p>The more rabid 'home boys' go public with their complaints on popular dating days such as Valentine's Day and Christmas Eve.</p>
              <p>Mr Hsu Wen-hsiung, a bespectacled 26-year-old office worker who took part in the anti-couple demonstration last December, complained that women never had the patience to get to know him or allow him to show his good nature and sense of humour in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
              <p>Waving a fox-shaped mask that he had made for the parade, Mr Hsu said he felt like his own computer obsession had put him into a no-win situation with the opposite sex.</p>
              <p>'You spend so much time on the Internet that you don't get to know women, and then failing to find a girlfriend, you go back to the Internet,' he said. 'It is a vicious cycle.'</p>
              <p>ASSOCIATED PRESS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suppose theres a similar situation building up here? Judging from the</p>
              <p>'sg girls dont appreciate the guys' '</p>
              <p>'sg guys r mummy's boys'</p>
              <p>'who's parents allow u to stay over/ go overseas?'</p>
              <p>'who above 21 and still take money from parents?'</p>
              <p>'who can bring me to geylang? i only 15'</p>
              <p>'geylang hookers work on cny anot?'</p>
              <p>'why our local gals hanging out with white dudes everywhere?'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>C'mon, in the western countries, 18 is adulthood. not 21. At 18, they r expected to b independent and take care of themselves. Its the norm.</p>
              <p>So, when is the first gathering for the SG 'home boys'?</p>

              <p>Come on, some of the threads mentioned by TS are from bar forum. You can find all type of weird threads there and shouldn't take them seriously.</p>
              <p>Although 18 is independent age for western countries, 21 is legal age for adulthood in Singapore. Can you go watch R21 movie before reaching 21 claiming you are mature enough cause "in the western countries, 18 is adulthood"?</p>
