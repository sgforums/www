            <div class='col-md body'>Has anyone of you ever wonder whats your role in this life? Studying for good grades while you are young and go to a good school so that you will not let your parents down. After which, you get yourself a good decent job while saving up for marriage. Soon, you find yourself in your parent's shoes providing the best for your kids, slogging out days and nights at works which you probably hated.<br><br>Sounds monotonous but isn't that what everyone of us is doing? Are we losing focus and the true meaning of life? I am sure that isn't what most of us dream of as a kid but that pure, innocent mindset that we carried wasn't suited for the civilization that we lived in. Its a cruel world. we all know that and I am sure nobody needs any mentioning. So if its that bad, why are we still doing it? Feel free to pursue something that you'd always wanted badly, break the vicious cycle and learn to love life, enjoy life which most probably most of us don't have a second shot at life again.<br><br>I've always try to be happy around friends since life is short and I don't mind being ridicule upon if its needed to bring a smile on someone's face. No, don't get me wrong, I am not that noble but that certain small gesture is something that I don't mind sacrificing. I might sound sacastic at times in my other posts but its all in the name of fun, however I take pride in not degenerating other people in order to achieve my motives. Live life to the fullest and enjoy every minutes of it is what I always strives. I live for myself and not for anyone except my parents.<br><br>At times I do feel sad for those aunties and uncles who works as cleaners in kopitiam. Remember life is not all about work and I am sure most of you agreed that those old folks are not lazy by nature. In fact, it takes a lot of determination and strength to work past your retirement age. And I don't mean a few.. Go around any kopitiam in your vicinity and you will probably be surprised by the numbers.<br><br>Maybe they are happy with their lifes. Maybe thats their meaning to life. However, its difficult for me to absorb and accept their predicament when I still gets to enjoy the finer things in life. The stark contrast in living is melancholy. Imagine how they feel if they donated to some charity and found out that certain CEO is living the high life, enjoying peaks that they probably could only dream of. For me, as long as my conscience is clear everything else is secondary..</div>

Ok.. but seriously yeah that is the meaning of life.. to procreate.. all others such as cars, golf and money are created by us.. we make them the meaning and reason for living... which is quite opposite.. but then again some can say thats what makes us different from animals.. but hey.. we are animals too just smarter... perhaps a lil too smart for our own good.</div>
