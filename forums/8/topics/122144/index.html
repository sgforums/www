            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that in the 80's, people were much more conservative....which can be nice in a way.  It made dating more exciting and secure (in the sense that you are not so suspicious that the person you're dating has ulterior motives - be it male/female, for sex, for money, etc.).<br><br>There was really a feeling of attraction back then....like waking up with butterflies in the stomach, feeling that the morning air was so fresh, etc.<br><br>Nowadays, I feel that many people date just for the sake of dating (peer pressure, trend, or something to this effect)....or even some ulterior motive (eg. to get money, sex, etc.).<br><br>Am I the only one who feels that way?  Or is my impression wrong?<br><br>Anyway hor, we must change with the times lah...nowadays, when I go dating, I also follow the current trend.

U go on a date, the guy will send u to your doorstep &amp; your parents will put him through an interrogation. Once they approve, both are expected to  date  till marriage. No breaking up cos everyone will gossip.<br>U are expected to work it out.<br></div>

I haven't heard from him since 1993 or so.He told me he was married which i already knew. Turned out to be a kind, intelligent, hardworking man. I hope he is doing well. It was good to know that he has found himself a nice relationship and a decent job. I don't think any good could come from my barging into his life again.He was a perfect gentleman, and a good friend to me.</div>
