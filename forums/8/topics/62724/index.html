The whole issue is about making choices, he choose to be depress in order to get away for reality or want others to share his agony. The only person can him is himself...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If he is still in NS and his PC or PS spots it or you can call up his company line to tell them about his condition. They will recommend him to the counseller in BMT the Orientation Officer (OO).<br><br>From there, if he is able to "get over it" then should be no problem for the rest of his NS term. If he continues to show this type of symptoms (you can continue to call up his company line and update them or better contact his OO). They will recommend to the camp's Medical Officer (MO).<br><br>He will be screen by the the MO. Sometimes the MO and the OO uses the "charge" tactic to "beef up" the guy sometimes people who is trying to "Keng" siao will back off immediately, otherwise it will have a reverse effect as in your friend case.<br><br>Depending on the MO, he can recommend him to be review by the SAF psychiatric core. Due to Camp MOs have to face with the whole soldiers in the camp, they have a tendency to assume that the soldier is "chow keng" and sometimes make poor or bad diagnosis. I am not sure but you can try to call up the camp and try to speak to the MO on his condition so that the MO will have a good picture what to work with.<br><br>Ok. Once he is recommend to the SAF psychiatric core. He will be review by a group of specialist MOs. Usually chair by 1 COL and a few CPTs. Rest assure this people know what they are doing, if your friend is really sick, I think most likely:-<br>1.) Downgraded to Temp PES E<br>2.) Out-of-course from this current course. Assuming he is in BMT.<br>3.) Post to unit to a less stress post such as clerk, storemen,etc,etc.<br>4.) Sometimes put on medication.<br>If he is not sick, as in trying to "keng" his way out, be prepared to face disciplinary action against him.<br><br>Jialat mental problem case will need to be put into hospital, to be review by the specailist MOs. Real jialat case, under the descretion of the specialist MOs. He may be send to IMH. So this is the last line. Please do not let the SAF send your friend to IMH. Once send to IMH, you will have a record. This may not be good in the future when he recovers and tries to look for a job.<br><br>As in your friend case, he most likely, he will be put under observation with the SAF psychiatric core. They will take it from there.<br><br>Try your best to counsel your friend. I think right now he needs it. I will also be frank here, be a man and grow up. The road ahead is not always going to be smooth sailing. If he can't get over this hurdle in NS, he will face many problems in the future when he comes out to the real world.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.</div>
