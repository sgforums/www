            <div class='col-md body'>I've had several encounters of people coming up to me before, asking for money. They ask from as low as $1 to as high as $10.<br><br>I just walk away from them. I don't mind giving a genuinely poor man some spare change, but I absolutely refuse to give a conman even a one cent coin. Why should I? The conman's worth is much less than S$0.01. If you have a well-functioning body with an honest heart, then you should be working for your money, not begging for it.<br><br>I only feel sad that by turning all those people who ask me for money, I may have inadvertently turned down a few genuine cases as well. It's not because I'm heartless enough to refuse to help them, but the presence of conmen only undermines the worth of charity.<br><br>Damn you, conmen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Singapore, I try to only give to those beggars (eg. at hawker centres) who are handicapped or aged.  Actually, these are not really beggars....they sell stuff (most common of which is tissue paper).  My car is full of tissue now because I keep buying them even when I don't need them.  OK, but tissues in the car are useful sometimes on Friday and Saturday nights <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I, too, may have unknowingly turned away a few cases of healthy beggars, who may be in genuine financial help because they can't find jobs, etc.<br><br>There have also been cases I've seen where the people asking for money are not only healthy (not handicapped), but have even bigger waistlines than mine!!!

It was at the car park, not bus-stop.  She was Chinese, in her early 20's, quite shabbily dressed.  I can't remember if she had facial pigmentation.<br><br>She claimed that she was from JB, here on work permit....with a mother and bother living with her...and that she's lost her job.  I knew she was lying because she spoke with a typical Singaporean Mandarin accent....and work permit holders aren't allowed to bring their families here.  Besides, once you lose your job, you have to leave the country.<br><br>Anyway, she asked for S$8 to buy dinner for her family.  out of pity (and since I took up so much of her time listening)....I offer her some coins from my pocket, which she took.  I told her that I wasn't willing to give anymore than that.  Then she said "wah, so little, how to buy dinner?".  I snapped back "not enough then give me back lor".  She quickly said "thank you" and walked away.<br><br>Throughout the whole incident, she was very friendly and polite.  Or maybe that was in her beginning stages of this 'job' when she was still a little frightened.<br><br></div>

Told him i've got no money, he just walked away. i walked away too and later when i turned ard to observe them, the woman is stopping a man on motorcycle to speak to him. ?!?<br><br>i seldom give money to beggers. old ppl who ask i will consider, and i definately help those old ah ma who are selling tissues. but all the rest i dont give. for all i know, they might be earning $30/hr. just by asking for money leh. i'm earning less than $8/hr leh. how to justify giving them money when they are richer?<br></div>
