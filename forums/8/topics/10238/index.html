No we are not all that dumb or free, Please dun take it the wrong way, but the world dun revolve ard you.<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Before I say anything, I just want to tell you that I am not targetting you or wanna say anything bad. What I gonna say is going to be what I think, so don't be offended. We never got to clear up what happen the last time so hopefully, this will make you understand my mentality more. Alrite here goes....<br><br>Yes, I do have an attitude prob and it's NOT some time only, it's MOST of the time but it's PURELY in the virtual world and it's up to you to believe or not. Besides, I already told you right from the beginning we talk that I usually prefer talking to people I already know in IRC and we actually got to talking because I mistook you for my friend, remember? We had a good laugh over it and yes, after that, I stop being hostile and we start talking.<br><br>Nevertheless, I never have the habit of sending my picture all over IRC and all I want is that you respect that privacy. Instead, you misunderstood me and thought that I am being insincere. I tried explaining but to no vail. Well well, what can I say man? I am totally lost and I don't really see why that I should send you any pic or you sending me yours. If you want to come out for a coffee or whatever, I am all game but pic-sending is sorta like a no-no. If I want to, I will send, why keep asking me and making me feel bad just because I refuse to?<br><br>If you want to know the truth, when you start ignoring me just because of the picture incident, I was really annoyed and disturbed and I find that the arguement that we had was pretty silly. After that, you disappeared from IRC and told me that it's MY fault that you are quitting IRC...... and I wondered "Come on..... this is just IRC.... why is this guy trying to make me feel guilty just over a picture?"<br><br>Subsequently, you post a lot on the forums and I guess you blend in quickly. I am glad for that but I truly don't understand what went wrong between us. And recently, you have been posting a lot on the forums about not taking the cyber space seriously and having a life outside on your own. Well, I find it pretty ironic. Personally, I do feel that I have a life outside this forum and IRC though my personal friends do come IRC to chat with me most of the time. However, the fact that you once told me it's because of me that you wanted to quit IRC makes me think that maybe the virtual world is NOT as virtual to you afterall. Maybe you can think about it? If you feel offended by my lack of sincerity, I shall apologise now.<br><br>You mentioned something about you all being not all that dumb or free and that the world does not revolve around me. Well, I never once take any of you to be a fool and certainly, the world does NOT just revolve around me. HOWEVER, to me, IRC jsut revolves around me and my own friends because I am happy to stay that way, chatting and joking with them online. I hardly let any virtual figure intrude into this and for the few who do, they understand my character and that IRC is just VIRTUAL but when I begin to accept them as true friends already, I will not be hostile anymore. That's just me but I guess it's an eye sore to you and you feel that I am being too self-centred.<br><br>I don't intend to change your opinion but once again, I must emphasize this, IRC/Forum is the virtual world and though I do make A FEW friends from here, that does NOT mean that I will go and talk to any new person that msg me. Yes call me stubborn if you want, but I still think I prefer talking to my own group of friends online than new people. Well, I certainly hope that there's no misunderstanding between us and I don't want this whole incident to be left unclear.<br><br>All I want to tell you is that our mentality and character is just different and that does not mean that we can't be friends. You just have to accept me for who I am and I just got to accept the fact that you are pretty sensitive and can get upset over a small incident. But I can also see that you have changed. You have began to take things more lightly now or who knows, maybe you are like this all the time, just that I don't know you well enough.<br><br>Anyway, I certainly hope that there's no hard feelings. It HAD been fun talking to you and hopefully, it will stay the way we are when we first started chatting. Nice knowing you and here's wishing you well in whatever you do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Friends still?  :p<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a cosy place?<br>With sunshine and laughter?<br>The Pixies must enjoy a good chat;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Come on in, come on in,<br>WELCOME to #sgclub at Galaxynet!<br>=================================</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>bigpimp,<br><br>Well, since you are wondering..... no, my fingers are not tired. I was just trying to clear things up since Madman is gonna quit IRC and forum. And hmm, I don't think Madman is angry (Madman, you angry?)  so why should you be?<br><br>Anyway, it's ok that you think that I am arrogant. Afterall, I don't even know you.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Oh yeah, a question for you, so your idea of coming online is to make new friends yeah? Well, like I say, I do have a few friends that I made online and we still are good friends. However, the cyberspace is so vast, not everyone that talks to you can be a good friend so I guess I just choose who I want to be friends with. Is there anything wrong? Everyone does that all the time. Afterall, different people has different interests and definitely different character.<br><br>I only make friends with those whom I think can accept me the way I am and NOT some people who don't care about anything and just log on to make friends and meet new people. That's not the kind of friendship I am seeking. Just too bad that we have difference in opinion on how we treat cyberspace. Nevertheless, I respect your opinion. *SHRUGS* I guess people like you are just really FRIENDLY and wanna make new friends yeah? Whatever it is, just remember that I am ME and you are YOU and we are DIFFERENT so why be angry?   :p<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a cosy place?<br>With sunshine and laughter?<br>The Pixies must enjoy a good chat;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Come on in, come on in,<br>WELCOME to #sgclub at Galaxynet!<br>=================================<br><br>[This message has been edited by pixie_gal (edited 14 November 2000).]</div>
