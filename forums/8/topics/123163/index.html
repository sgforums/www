Sometime, it can be snowing quite hard and difficult to see the road ahead and the road is slippery due to "black ice" and also fog that affect the visibility.<br><br>I personally feel that driving here in US is less stressful and the people here do show some road courtesy. They are quite nice on the road.<br><br>Note:  For those who don't have a Singapore License but wish to obtained one in overseas and convert to the Singapore License when they go back, a word of caution, it will be better if you can take a refresh course when you are back.... the practical test here in US is quite basic and simple hence, it does not really test your driving skills at all ... It is important to do the circuit training, the S course and reverse parking and so on ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In Queensland/OZ it goes something like this:<br><br>1) 15 bucks to take a 30qn basic theory test to obtain your learner's licence.  If you fail, come back again tomorrow, spend another 15, and so for and so for.<br><br>2) 20 bucks to get your learner's licence made if you passed the theory.<br><br>3) Start off with driving lessons, an average of 35 bucks by the hour.  You can drive on the roads with a learner's but you need a qualified driver on the passenger side.<br><br>4) A minimum of 6 months before you can take your first practical driving test.  100 or so bucks to make arrangements.  If you fail on monday, come back on tuesday, foot another 100bucks and take again.  You can do the above for as many times till you pass(or run out of cash).  No time limit or gazetted periods.<br><br>5) Get your provisional licence after you pass the practical.  1-2 years later apply for an open licence for free.</div>
