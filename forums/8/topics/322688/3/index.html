              <p>Fwah, nice concept you have. I certainly hope you don't have
              kids in the future; if this is the kind of thing that you'll teach
              them, then I feel sorry for them. Dollars to donuts say that they
              will grow up to be bullies in school and gangsters after they drop
              out.</p>
              <p>Heck, you definitely don't have the guts to say everything you
              just said directly in the faces of the dead kid's parents. Assuming
              your conscience is clear, of course.</p>

              <p>I think the teachers are too protective of their cars.</p>
              <p>Mischievious students are known to have scratched the teachers' cars or punctured the tyres.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Cases of suicide by students should be publicised to educate the people so that parents can find ways to prevent it. It's a puzzle why the Singapore media and MOE always hushed up instead of taking action to reduce the risk .</p>
              <p>In some countries, there are caregivers to help the emotionally fragile become emotionally stable. If there is no similar program to help such youngsters who are easily victimised, it's time the MOE take the lead and start a program to help them,</p>

              <p>and open your mouth and ask for help (like in skool look for

              <p>Funny why people always say this - that sucide is an easy way out  ...  not targeting anybody but in general, many people said that .  I think to try to take your own life requires tremendous effort and guts ... . .   pity the guy ...  and hate those bullies ... I always keep a look up for bullies near any schools and will approach when I see bullying take place..  even when I am driving I would stop and questions what they doing in the hope to help some poor little kid...  I wish there are better way to stop this . . . .</p>

              <p>U simply dun understand that some teenagers are very quiet type, so it is difficult to ask them to open their mouth, sometime they cannot express out their inferior feelings. And at time, even if they speak it out, teachers ignored them and classmates laugh at them, he/she will feel so lonely. The problem with principals and teachers are they dun like to listen to students, their mentality is that you all are young young, what the hell you know and what pressure you have than we? And worst still, some teachers instill fear into the students mentality by using threatening and harsh words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pyschologically speaking, a person will speak out his/her trouble if the environment/condition is right, that is, someone willing to listen and advice them sincerely, someone willing to help and care for them, and finally someone who are willing to take the effort to understand them. Therefore as some poster here indicated correctly, MOE must create an environment / placement in all schools/insitutes, a channel for students to express out without fear, without barriers, without a teacher and student relationship condition. All teachers must be trained to identify the weak and help them. But in most cases, teachers alway care for the brighter and good results student, that make the brigher students brighter, and the lower student...lowered. The objective of teachers must be change to help the weak and encourge the brighter one to help the weak at equal footing. </p>
