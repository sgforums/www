              <p>Fwah, nice concept you have. I certainly hope you don't have kids in the future; if this is the kind of thing that you'll teach them, then I feel sorry for them. Dollars to donuts say that they will grow up to be bullies in school and gangsters after they drop out.</p>
              <p>Heck, you definitely don't have the guts to say everything you just said directly in the faces of the dead kid's parents. Assuming your conscience is clear, of course.</p>

              <p>I really hate bullies... The problem is, the bullies think what they're doing is all fun and game and have nothing to do with it, i.e. bullies have no ampathy... and ampathy is suppose to be installed in a child when they small...

              <p>The second is the school itself... From what I've seen back in secondary school, most school takes bullying as a trival matter... Most have no strict policies against "psylogical bullies"... They only take into account physical bulling cause its clear cut against the law... But psycological bullying is a bit of a new concept of schools in Singapore...</p>
              <p>Schools should take note the seriousness of psylogical bullying coz most of the bullies now use their mouths and computers instead of their fists...Also, their punishment nowadays are a joke... stay behind after class, write lines, pick up trash... They need punishment that will sink in... That's why I still support canning...</p>
              <p>In the end, bulling is serious even small time bullying like stealing a pencil will become a big issue if repeated for 6 months...</p>

              <p>Bullying is here to stay. The victims are out there. And they would most likely stay silent and they would suffer in silent.</p>
              <p>For those of you who witness bullying in schools, help the victims by reporting the bullies. That is if you have the guts to stand up for what is right. You do not need to confront. There is no harm to "pau toh" bullies. Who knows. You might save a life.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, I feel that we take this political correctness bullshit
              way too far. The end result is that we totally miss the essence of
              punishment. Punishment is not just about disciplining those who stray
              too far, but also to deter others from following their path.</p>
              <p>And
              you need not punish someone out of hate. Far from it; when you punish a
              wayward student, you do it out of love. Tough love, if you will. A slap
              on the wrist when they're young is better than a few strokes of the
              rotan when they become adults.</p>
              <p>If you punish bullies too
              lightly, the message they get is simple: it doesn't pay to be nice, and
              even if you get caught, the penalties for it are light anyway. Stupid logic, but hey, bullies are never really that intelligent to begin with.</p>
              <p>In
              my first two years in secondary school my principal was a stickler for
              discipline who did not hesitate to order the public caning of hooligans
              and other delinquents. Two of my classmates were caned in class for
              poor behaviour. The end result was a school population which was
              generally well-behaved and did reasonably well academically.</p>
              <p>Then
              my principal was replaced. The new principal was extremely lax with
              discipline. I certainly never saw any canings, nor did I ever see him
              even raise his voice against students who misbehaved.</p>
              <p>End
              result? My school's discipline went down the drain. And I think it's
              hardly a  coincidence that my school's academic rankings reached
              downwards terminal velocity at the same time.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel
              that we fear to 'mentally scar' the bully with punitive action so much
              that we end up forgetting the mental scars of the victims.</p>

              <p>I have recently read an interesting article which seems to apply in this case regarding school bullying and I would like share it here.</p>
                  <p>Excerpts from <a href="http://paulgraham.com/nerds.html">Why Nerds Are Unpopular</a>:</p>
                  <div style="font-size: 12px">
                  <p>"Nerds would find their unpopularity more bearable if it merely caused them to be ignored. Unfortunately, to be unpopular in school is to be actively persecuted.<br><br>Why? Once again, anyone currently in school might think this a strange question to ask. How could things be any other way? But they could be. Adults don't normally persecute nerds. Why do teenage kids do it?<br><br>Partly because teenagers are still half children, and many children are just intrinsically cruel. Some torture nerds for the same reason they pull the legs off spiders. Before you develop a conscience, torture is amusing.<br><br>Another reason kids persecute nerds is to make themselves feel better. When you tread water, you lift yourself up by pushing water down. Likewise, in any social hierarchy, people unsure of their own position will try to emphasize it by maltreating those they think rank below. I've read that this is why poor whites in the United States are the group most hostile to blacks.<br><br>But I think the main reason other kids persecute nerds is that it's part of the mechanism of popularity. Popularity is only partially about individual attractiveness. It's much more about alliances. <strong>To become more popular, you need to be constantly doing things that bring you close to other popular people, and nothing brings people closer than a common enemy.</strong><br><br>Like a politician who wants to distract voters from bad times at home, you can create an enemy if there isn't a real one. By singling out and persecuting a nerd, a group of kids from higher in the hierarchy create bonds between themselves. Attacking an outsider makes them all insiders. This is why the worst cases of bullying happen with groups. Ask any nerd: you get much worse treatment from a group of kids than from any individual bully, however sadistic.<br><br>If it's any consolation to the nerds, it's nothing personal. The group of kids who band together to pick on you are doing the same thing, and for the same reason, as a bunch of guys who get together to go hunting. <strong>They don't actually hate you. They just need something to chase.</strong>"</p>
                  <p>----------</p>
                  <p>"Bullying was only part of the problem. Another problem, and possibly an even worse one, <strong>was that we never had anything real to work on.</strong> Humans like to work; in most of the world, <strong>your work is your identity.</strong> And all the work we did was pointless, or seemed so at the time.</p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p><strong>Teenage kids used to have a more active role in society.</strong> In pre-industrial times, they were all apprentices of one sort or another, whether in shops or on farms or even on warships. <strong>They weren't left to create their own societies. They were junior members of adult societies.</strong></p>
                  <p>...</p>
                  <p>What happened? We're up against a hard one here. The cause of this problem is the same as the cause of so many present ills: <strong>specialization</strong>. As jobs become more specialized, we have to train longer for them. <strong>Kids in pre-industrial times started working at about 14 at the latest;</strong> kids on farms, where most people lived, began far earlier. Now kids who go to college don't start working full-time till 21 or 22. With some degrees, like MDs and PhDs, you may not finish your training till 30."</p>

              <p>Cause some teachers just dont give a damn about students even though they know that the students are being bullied .</p>
              <p>And teacher should care more about their students and see if they are being bullied in anyway .</p>

              <p>Fwah, nice concept you have. I certainly hope you don't have
              kids in the future; if this is the kind of thing that you'll teach
              them, then I feel sorry for them. Dollars to donuts say that they
              will grow up to be bullies in school and gangsters after they drop
              out.</p>
              <p>Heck, you definitely don't have the guts to say everything you
              just said directly in the faces of the dead kid's parents. Assuming
              your conscience is clear, of course.</p>
