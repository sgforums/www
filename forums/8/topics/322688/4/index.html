              <p>U simply dun understand that some teenagers are very quiet type, so it is difficult to ask them to open their mouth, sometime they cannot express out their inferior feelings. And at time, even if they speak it out, teachers ignored them and classmates laugh at them, he/she will feel so lonely. The problem with principals and teachers are they dun like to listen to students, their mentality is that you all are young young, what the hell you know and what pressure you have than we? And worst still, some teachers instill fear into the students mentality by using threatening and harsh words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pyschologically speaking, a person will speak out his/her trouble if the environment/condition is right, that is, someone willing to listen and advice them sincerely, someone willing to help and care for them, and finally someone who are willing to take the effort to understand them. Therefore as some poster here indicated correctly, MOE must create an environment / placement in all schools/insitutes, a channel for students to express out without fear, without barriers, without a teacher and student relationship condition. All teachers must be trained to identify the weak and help them. But in most cases, teachers alway care for the brighter and good results student, that make the brigher students brighter, and the lower student...lowered. The objective of teachers must be change to help the weak and encourge the brighter one to help the weak at equal footing. </p>

              <p>you've to learn how to speak out no matter wat. you never speak out how you know e principal or teacher would laugh at you? I'd rather think they would immediately help you cos it's their responsibility if unhappiness occures in school</p>

              <p><br>U must always remember that there are always introvert students in all school, and you should know how introvert behave, they simply keep everything to themselves, therefore, as adults and nuturing skilled trained teacher from NIE, they must have the initiative to identify these people, bring them out and give them space and time to express themselves, from there, they can sincerely help and counsel them. Counselling is a 2 way communication, but teachers here are alway the one talking and fail to truly understand the indept of the student concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the student can face it, but faces what??? if the framework is nothing but just a show that the school is doing it jobs as per MOE requirement, meet the students, meet the parents and meet the teachers may become as norm as just a passing a motion.

              <p><br>U must always remember that there are always introvert students in all school, and you should know how introvert behave, they simply keep everything to themselves, therefore, as adults and nuturing skilled trained teacher from NIE, they must have the initiative to identify these people, bring them out and give them space and time to express themselves, from there, they can sincerely help and counsel them. Counselling is a 2 way communication, but teachers here are alway the one talking and fail to truly understand the indept of the student concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, the student can face it, but faces what??? if the framework is nothing but just a show that the school is doing it jobs as per MOE requirement, meet the students, meet the parents and meet the teachers may become as norm as just a passing a motion. It become a platform for general information exchange rather than in depth concern and study into an individual problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometime, in school, the student faced it and reported it, and the teacher tell him off by saying how can u get bullied, guess your classmate only play play, you want me to punish them is it?? that ward off the student approach, then if the teacher announce it infront of the whole class, Class, please stop bullying so n so, if he report again, the whole class will hv to stay back. This make the whole class fed up with him, taking him as a sabotagers, and later, if given a chance like sports in PE, they sure to bully him again. So how??</p>

              <p>when one is of a stable mind, decision making is harder because one is able to analyse and think. more than often, some people in this world, loves to go for the easier way out, which is to run away from the problem then face it. but they failed to realise the consequences and aftermath of such decisions of running away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when drove to the limits, the mind is in such a frenzy state that flipping urself over the parapet is not such a hard thing to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>domonkassyu, ur definitely right that everyone can be in control of their minds. all decisions are made by you so its a choice. But your saying this from the 3rd person point of view, and your mind is not in the boy's state of mind. when the mind is unstable, incapable of making rationale decisions, it often requires time, and depends on one's character and will power, to stabilise their thoughts. "counselling" or "channeling" speeds up the process.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>everyone has a part to play in the case per say. teachers should not take full blame.. their life is as hellish as it can possibly be already..</p>

              <p>The truth about this is that sometimes human emotions are good as they purge the system of weak ppl and wimps. Look at brazilian soccer players and England soccer players. The poorer the country the more hardstanding the citizens.</p>

              <p><br>Trained doesn't mean you imply it, and training structure may lies certain fault too. And u clearly state that to help tat student to stand on his own feet, the word "help" is the key word, how do teachers and MOE help?? by saying that he did mention anything or he is very quiet going to help??  Even if it is a joke of sort, a teachers must lend a listening ears and find out, if really is a joke, she/he can punish the students, I believe in schools, there are special teachers trained in counselling and identifying the weaks, now where are they?? sleeping?? Did they counsel and keep record of pupil excel thru their counselling and if not or get worst, did they make improvement and study into it??</p>

              <p><br>It's not that easy. Much of the time students are afraid to fight back for fear of getting into trouble with teachers. It's totally contradictory and confusing for students: teachers and police tell students not to fight back when they are attacked because they'll be punished too, but their parents tell them to stand up and fight for themselves... Anyone would be confused.</p>
              <p>Teachers need to show that they will support you if you are caught by school authorities fighting back and that they will vouch for you.</p>

              <p>It can get to the point where the student is totally helpless and every counter he or she tries fails. Again, counters can backfire, you can get into trouble with the school if you're found to be fighting back, this is something that really holds back many people who want to stay out of trouble.</p>
              <p>I was placed in like the worst class last year (even though my results from the previous year were reasonably good). I had a tradeoff with the class bullies: I supplied them with a free flow of homework to copy, freshly done every day, in exchange for leaving me alone. =P So they couldn't afford to attack me because I was their sole channel to free homework. It's a symbiotic relationship forced by circumstances. I also ran crash-courses before tests over msn for them so they wouldn't fail. Many of them told me I was better at teaching than the teachers. =D</p>
