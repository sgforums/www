Never enter a place where you are not certain of how to escape. Don't walk blindly around without noticing who might be targeting you and don't look like the ignorant Singaporean moving around in JB but just blend in to be like one of the locals. Always make sure you have a plan on what to do if you encounter criminals and if you can travel in groups. And don't silly silly follow strangers after they tell you some funny story. And don't dress so nicely if you can, something simple will do.<br><br>It is likely the cases of Singaporeans who were robbed in JB, very often they failed at one of these crucial things and ended up being a nice target.

Precisely! That was what I said!<br><br><span style="color: red;">If you go to major tourist attractions, then you are less likely to get robbed. Or if you want, you go to those supermarkets or malls that are inside which are frequent by locals and not tourists.</span><br><br>You are just merely repeating every single shit I have said.<br><br>"If you are a robber in Singapore, and you want to rob tourists, where will you lurk? Orchard Road or Tampines Mall?"<br><br>Who cares how many cases are there? I'm just asking IF. Its a matter of which has a lower possibility. You dont wait till things happened, and then you decide on which is safer.<br><br>And because I caught you repeating something I have said, you get all insulting and irritating.<br><br>I have my opinions and you have yours, it just piss me off when people dont read posts properly and repeat what people have alreadu included in their post.<br><br>Majority of people go to places in Jb like City Sq. Which is very well-known as a tourist place, thats why I said its much safer to go inland into those malls which are frequent mostly by locals and very little tourists will go there.<br><br>When I said MAJOR TOURIST ATTRACTIONs, I'm referring to places like zoos, shopping malls are not MAJOR tourist attractions. You probably failed geography in secondary.<br><br>Orchard road are visited by many tourists every year, but is it a MAJOR tourist attraction? No.<br><br>Major tourist attractions are like Sentosa. And the crime rate at Sentosa is pretty low cos I doubt anybody will take the trouble to go in there and look out for targets to rob.<br><br>I might not express myself clearly. But you are just shallow and dont use your common sense.<br><br>You probably think seawater is blue in colour literally if you have never been to the beach.<br><br>I wasn't even being insulting and you got all arrogant.<br><br>Think before you decide that you want to start a quarrel.</div></blockquote>hallo, pls get this straight, 5 km inland is still part of JB, not another state!!<br>u saying that the whole JB is exp., don't know is whether u really cannot understand geography or simply can't listen to reason  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>if someone can rob u in JB, they can oso rob u in Singapore, i am oso using IF like what u r saying, happy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> or still trying to find fault with yr own lousy theory!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>more like u r saying dumb things hence i need to correct u n u just find that insulting to yr intelligence  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  which i find somehow lacking  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>i accept that u have yr opinion, but what u r posting is wrong and u just said that ppl didn't read yr post carefully, what a lousy excuse that make  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>who in the first place will go to tourist attraction i.e. zoo in JB, what can u find there that u can't find in our own zoo  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>hallo, differentiating tourist attraction is a matter of english language not geography  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>furthermore, what does tourist attraction meant???<br>do u know? it meant what appeal to tourist, a shopping centre can oso be a tourist attraction, just like orchard road, just becos u said it isn't doesn't make it not a tourist attraction!! u r so a dumb block  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>i think u have a serious common sense problem n think ppl r shallow cos u r not up to the mark, please learn more b4 taking on ppl here with more intellectual properties than u do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>only u will think that seawater is blue in colour literally cos u r practically living in a bookshelf with a limited amount of books for reading   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>no u r not being insulting just ignorant  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>i wasn't even picking a quarrel just picking out pieces of yr shattered brain cos i thinking of going green by recycling them<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
