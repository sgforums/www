The TS was asking if its worth the risk to go there. So some people said since things are cheaper inside, its quite worth it if you are careful.<br><br><span style="color: red;">more like u r the one who came up with the theories, hence i put up my theories to correct yr theories which u simply can't accept becos u still so blur that u think that i am talking about the same things as u, just becos we r talking about cheap doesn't meant we talking on the same line <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span><br><br>So I said cos the things are not as cheaper as we think because basically thats what my geography teacher taught us due to the effect of tourism.

Never enter a place where you are not certain of how to escape. Don't walk blindly around without noticing who might be targeting you and don't look like the ignorant Singaporean moving around in JB but just blend in to be like one of the locals. Always make sure you have a plan on what to do if you encounter criminals and if you can travel in groups. And don't silly silly follow strangers after they tell you some funny story. And don't dress so nicely if you can, something simple will do.<br><br>It is likely the cases of Singaporeans who were robbed in JB, very often they failed at one of these crucial things and ended up being a nice target.

            <div class='col-md body'>It may not be fair to say that JB is a crime zone infested with robbers and other bad guys and so should be avoided. Crimes can happen to anyone anywhere mah.<br>Between Indonesia, say, Batam, and JB, I think I would say I feel safer in JB!<br><br>When it comes to touring, I think the prudent thing to do is to stay low profile and not attract attention as by showing jewellery and other branded stuff or behaving in a sia lan manner by talking loudly and proudly.<br><br>If you kena in JB, there's nothing to say you also won't kena in a supposed safe place like Singapore, is there?<br><br>New York is notorious for its gangs and high crime rate but I was there for 3 months and travelled freely. It was actually a very charming city which I enjoyed tremendously. Yet, nothing untoward happened to me. Mebbe I heng-heng lah but I never even heard a single gunshot or encountered any bad incidents.<br><br>If we so easily stereotype JB as a crime- nest, then we only erect artificial barriers to cage ourselves within and then we kpkb Singapore no freedom! we should try to see things in a wider perspective and liberate ourselves........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
