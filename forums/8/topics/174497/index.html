Like the verses int he song " Ajaa sanjuhi mujhe teri fizal, Meri nazal"<br><br><img src="http://taal46.tripod.com/moviegal/taal_all1.jpg"><br><br>My fav are:<br>TAAL - nahin Samne fantatstic! ( hit soundtrack of '99)<br>Thakshak<br>Love Birds<br>Jeans<br>Ro'ja<br><br><img src="http://www.dreamindia.com/taal/images/ashhmim.jpg"><br><br>"Taal" is mega musical by SUBHASH GHAI with A.R.RAHMAN working together for the first time. Anyone who has heard the music is raving about it to the skies. A lethal combination of two great talents brings out one of the most melodious, rich and superhit music for the music lovers."Taal" is a great love story revolving around three dynamic characters (never presented so effectively ever before on the screen) being portrayed by Aishwarya Rai, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Khanna.<br><br>Why "Taal" is being talked about all over?<br>"Taal" is one of the most sought after films in Hindi Film Market by Distributors &amp; Exhibitors in 1999 all over the World.<br>"Taal" is a film written, produced and directed by SUBHASH GHAI and going to be released in August 1999 all over the World through Eros International, U.K for overseas territories. "Taal" is mega musical by SUBHASH GHAI with A.R.RAHMAN working together for the first time. Anyone who has heard the music is raving about it to the skies.<br>A lethal combination of two great talents brings out one of the most melodious, rich and superhit music for the music lovers. See below the comments of stars and others who have heard the music.<br><br>"The Beat of Passion" Multi layering of harmony has fascinated me since birth. The first time I reacted was when my aunt clapped and it was music to my ears. Ever since then, I've grown with music. Music bearing any notes - Hindustani, Karnataki, Western, Chinese elevates me, even from my darkest moments. The added dimension to the music is the voice. The voice of the singer who sings 'the joys and sorrows of the human soul.' Had these words been in prose of drama, there would be no thrill. But, the moment it is embodied with music and Taal, it becomes a song that reaches the heart, head and body. My moments with A.R.Rahman at his music studio are embedded in my memory. The voices of Ashaji, Kavita, Alka and Sukhwinder echoing the poetry of Anand Bakshi, had me visualising my charachters Mansi, Manav and Vikrant going through the emotional highs and lows of life even before the actual picturisation. That's the charisma of 'Taal' music.<br><br>'Taal' will alwaays be dear to my heart, and to me it is definitely my most favourite work too date. The credit goes to A.R.Rahman and Anand Bakshi without whom 'Taal' would not have happened. I am sure you will share my sentiments whilst listening to the music of 'Taal' as the music delights your senses. A Beat of Passion I have lived for years.<br><br>"Taal" is a great love story revolving around three dynamic characters (never presented so effectively ever before on the screen) being portrayed by Aishwarya Rai, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Khanna who change the opinion of those critics who have seen them in dim lights. It is going to be film of great performances by all three stars. "Taal" is a breezy, musical entertainer and is best piece of work done by our Director SUBHASH GHAI who gave you "Pardes" and surprised everybody with his cinematic excellence. This is first time when you find great combination of Anand Bakshi<br>and A.R. Rahman where they have proved what wonders great lyrics can do to the tunes of A. R. Rahman .Let us not talk about the picturisation by SUBHASH GHAI. We have seen his work and expect a lot in "Taal".There are three choreographers in "Taal" since there is variety of Dances in the film and ace choregraphers like Saroj Khan, Shiamak Davar and Ahmed Khan have been given this task and they have done wonders in composing the dances on Aishwarya, Anil Kapoor and Akshaye Khanna. "Taal" has a great feel with a greater look which has excellent photography by Kabirlal ("Pardes" fame) and mind blowing Art Direction by Sharmistha Roy ("Dil to Pagal Hai", "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" fame).<br><br>Aishwarya has never been so sensual and performer as an actress par excellence.<br>Akshaye Khanna has proved that he is the best actor to look forward to - just watch him in "Taal".<br>Anil Kapoor has never been so good before on screen - an entertainer - a great actor indeed.<br><br>What to say more<br><br></div>
