            <div class='col-md body'>Antisocial Personality Disorder is also known as psychopathy or sociopathy. <span style="color: red;">Individuals with this disorder have little regard for the feeling and welfare of others</span>. As a clinical diagnosis it is usually limited to those over age 18. It can be <span style="color: red;">diagnosed in younger people if they commit isolated antisocial acts and do not show signs of another mental disorder</span>.<br><br>Antisocial Personality Disorder is chronic, beginning in adolescence and continuing throughout adulthood. There are ten general symptoms:<br><br>not learning from experience<br><span style="color: red;">no sense of responsibility</span><br>inability to form meaningful relationships<br>inability to control impulses<br><span style="color: red;">lack of moral sense </span><br>chronically antisocial behavior<br>no change in behavior after punishment<br><span style="color: red;">emotional immaturity<br>lack of guilt<br>self-centeredness</span><br><br>People with this disorder may exhibit criminal behavior. They may not work. If they do work, they are frequently absent or may quit suddenly. <span style="color: red;">They do not consider other people's wishes, welfare or rights. They can be manipulative and may lie to gain personal pleasure or profit.</span> They may default on loans, fail to provide child support, or fail to care for their dependents adequately. High risk sexual behavior and substance abuse are common. <span style="color: red;">Impulsiveness, failure to plan ahead, aggressiveness, irritability, irresponsibility, and a reckless disregard for their own safety and the safety of others are traits of the antisocial personality</span>.<br><br>Socioeconomic status, gender, and genetic factors play a role. Males are more likely to be antisocial than females. Those from lower socioeconomic groups are more susceptible. A family history of the disorder puts one at higher risk.<br><br>There are many theories about the cause of Antisocial Personality Disorder including experiencing neglectful parenting as a child, low levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain, and belief that antisocial behavior is justified because of difficult circumstances. Psychotherapy, group therapy, and family therapy are common treatments. The effects of medical treatment are inconclusive. Unfortunately, most people with Antisocial Personality Disorder reject treatment. Therefore, recovery rates are low.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly discourage cheating not because of conscious issue.<br><br><strong>First, how far can cheating take you? </strong>First or second upper? perhaps in your dreams. There are tons of information that you need for a subject, how much can you put inside that piece of paper? And even if you got a lot of small pieces, how do you know where to find that information you need urgently? Also, where are you going to find the time needed to search through your slips of paper to get the information? For me, I really had no time to get information by cheating. I rely mainly on my memory and the practice questions that I did before the exams.<br><br>Secondly, if you are cheating, it simply means that you do not have sufficient knowledge on that particular subject. Example, for engineering course, cheating means you probably had little knowledge about the equations that you had wrote down. <strong>So how can you be sure that you are able to apply this equation during exams? </strong>Do you even know when you can apply that equation? I seriously doubt so. To add on, certain subjects form the foundation of the knowledge for future subjects. So if you do not have the knowledge in this subject, how are you able to understand the next subject?<br><br>Thus, conclusion is that cheating will not take you far nor help to increase your knowledge. Instead of cheating, you should learn about studying smart. For studying smart,<br><br>Understand what the equations mean and how to apply them. Practising with some problems helped you identify the problems which you apply these equations. After you did a few problems, these equations will roughly be register into your head.<br><br>then you try questions which use similar equations but with a twist. Like perhaps you need to find out more information before applying such equations. After this, you probably will understand how this equation works and able to apply them with ease liao.<br><br>By then, you should be able to understand much about this equation and you need only a bit more memory work to remember them. Of course, the more practice you do, the easier for you to remember these equations and use them without hesitation or mistake.</div>
