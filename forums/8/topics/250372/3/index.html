Oh well.<br><br>Lets say you got all these 40 equations on a paper in the exams. Are you sure you will know how to apply without understanding what these equations mean? You got 40 equations, and you had only slight knowledge about them, so how are you going to tell which one to use? I have never been able to apply difficult equations in the first few tries. It is only after working and using them through a number of equations before i can use them with ease.<br><br>Therefore, i would still try to learn to use and apply these equations. Use them on questions. Understand them. In this way, you can use them for any sort of questions. And the important thing is, <strong>it works for me</strong>! why not you?</div>

They need to clear a module rather than aim for high score. I got a friend who was so tramatise by exams that he dreamt that he failed his exams. This shows how desperate they are. But anyway, I just want to point out that cheating is not useful. Your grades improve only marginally.<br><br>(For death) I think I had a module with lots of equations as well. No idea how many equations but a lot. I had to list out all these equations on a paper because they are all over the place in the notes. Then i use that paper to<strong> hit very hard </strong>on the questions.<br><br>Logic is still the same. Apply the equations and understand them. Slowly then you will remember these equations. And don't try to simply memorize these equations from the paper. It don't work. At least for me.</div>

You saw the question, just dump any equations and perhaps only get some smypathy points.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... cheating....interesting.<br><br>In my secondary school, people write on the bottoms of their shoes. Just have to be careful when u walk into exam hall. Easy to destroy evidence too.<br><br>In my uni, no one cheat, cos open book exam. You can bring anything you can carry into the exam hall.<br><br>What's the point of cheating? I get 100 marks. You get 90 marks. So?<br><br>It's just a false sense of greatness, false sense of success, false sense of security and much wanted attention.<br><br>If I see someone cheating, I won't report him/her. Because I'm a coward. I'm afraid he will get his guys to hit me afterwards, hide my books, burn my pencils. Life's too short for us, much less if we have to deal with things like this. Unless I send an anonymous letter, but then the exams will be over, and there will be no evidence to proof it.<br><br></div>

Oh well.<br><br>Lets say you got all these 40 equations on a paper in the exams. Are you sure you will know how to apply without understanding what these equations mean? You got 40 equations, and you had only slight knowledge about them, so how are you going to tell which one to use? I have never been able to apply difficult equations in the first few tries. It is only after working and using them through a number of equations before i can use them with ease.<br><br>Therefore, i would still try to learn to use and apply these equations. Use them on questions. Understand them. In this way, you can use them for any sort of questions.

I am saying that cheating don't get you high grades as people here thought. there is no point in trying to cheat nor envy those who does.

So you are spending more time to get so much more results. This is way better than spending time in memorising equations that you will just forget in a day or two.</div>

Yes, indeed it is impt, but in order to understand formulas, we need to know where the formulas are derived from. &amp; from "original" formulas, by understanding the theories etc... &amp; work the way thru to derive it into another formula &amp; so on. These ways make us understand the concept &amp; backgnd of formulas... But it takes a super long time to do so, especially if we are under time constaint. I tried it b4... its really time consuming... &amp; during the exam, I have no time to derive the "original" formula to the formula I need in order to do the those questions for a 2 to 2.5 hr papers.<br><br>To conclude, yes, practising is impt, else is really hard to remember it to use them, but that doesnt mean we truly understand the formulas.</div>
