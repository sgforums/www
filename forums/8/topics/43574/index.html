            <div class='col-md body'>Been thinking of upgrading my skills or getting more qualifications to ensure my continued employability.<br><br>Currently, I have a Business Degree (majoring in Banking and Finance) which I have forgotten everything about.  Am now working somewhere totally not using these things I learnt in the university.  This is not good as my qualifications are obsolete and frankly, lost.<br><br>In order to prevent myself for starving to death in the event of my retrenchment or getting my ass fired, I have been thinking of upgrading my skills.<br><br>I was wondering if there are any organisations out there who offer degree courses and stuff...<br><br>I read up on the SMU site.. they do not offer part-time courses.  I have not looked up SIM, NTU nor NUS yet.<br><br>I wonder what I should do?  Should I go for a MBA or MSc, or should I look to another Bachelor's degree.  So far, I'm more inclined to the degree but will my actually having a degree already hamper me?<br><br>Any advice?<br><br>Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">If you are looking into doing another course for upgrading, it would be better or more logical to go for a Master. Since you have a Bachelor in Banking and Finance, no point doing another Bachelor again. If you want to upgrade, do something that is one step higher, don't stay put at where you are.<br><br>It would be better for you to choose course for Masters, if you know what specialization you are interested in, else, do a general one.<br><br>I can only help you till this step, as to which is a good institution for you to pursue your Master Degree, I'm not very sure, because I don't come from Biz background. I'm from Science. In fact, I'm intending to do a MBA once my career stabilise. I am forever looking into self improvement. I want myself not only know the technical stuffs like engineering, I want to hold a management position in future.  </span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">lavender_scent</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My take on this...<br><br>About not declaring your degree, I'll have to disagree on that.  Put aside skill-rleated jobs like dentistry and engineering.  Employers don't just consider your degree or the level of your studies or even the content of your studies.  They also consider the tools that you may have attained in getting the degree.  I'm working in the airline industry, but I'm a graduate in history and politics.  We've got grads in zoology, science and geography.  And I specialise in IT, research and innovations.  All they did was ask me if I'm able to tackle them.  I give ita try and voila! I get it done the best I can.  (Phew...  I think I've just exposed a whole heap about meself 'ere.)<br><br>If you're thinking of specialising, go for it.  I've heard that MBAs may be losing their value 'ause so many people are getting it.  So you might want to be careful there.  I was actually advised that maybe a second degree will serve me a better stead than specialising but  do have intentions of becoming in the academia some time.<br><br>Remember, degrees are not merely papers, they're proof of tools that you've attained.  Most people don't realise that 'cause it quikly becomes a habit the way you analyse and solve things.  Look at engineers.  You can somehow see them as they are simply 'casue of the way they solve everyday problems.  Same way with historians and politicians, mate.<br><br>Good luck!!<br><br>Bring it on!!</div>
