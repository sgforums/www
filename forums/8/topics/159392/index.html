            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway if any of you people like FF series,here is something on why it is called Final Fantasy.It was the final fantasy of the creator for what he dream would be the new era of rpg<br><br>Final Fantasy was made in 1987 by Hironubu Sakaguchi and was actually made as a farewell "present" to Square Co., Ltd. He felt that the gaming world was going in circles and that no-one wanted to take any chances with a new type of game. So he decided to quit the buisness and start a new career doing something completely different, maybe become a fisherman. But before he could do this he needed to prove to both himself and the rest of the world that the age of groundbreaking games were not over. He sat down and worked over a long period in secret on his last project ever. His last dream. His Final Fantasy. And so the name was created. Final Fantasy was a single man's last wish for proving that new things could still be made. And so far every single FF game has improved the gaming world in ways no-one could imagine. Every game has introduced something new, either in terms of graphic, gameplay, voices &amp; music, engine... You name it, Final Fantasy has always been the first to go new ways. And that is how it should be. The moment Hironubu Sakaguchi feels the games are copying themselves he is going to quit and become a fisherman.</div>
