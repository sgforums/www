You deserve all the negative things not just based on one post alone. You apparently don't realise that and think that every one of your posts is good and valid.<br><br><strong>[quote]The forumers in that forum did not react so sensitive as the forumers here and the posting until now still there for all to read.  This is what I call "tolerance", which some the forumers in this thread is seriously lacking.</strong>I've said this a few times, it's not individual postings in general, it's your attitude and the few posts you've made. You're not getting negative response based on one single post that was irrelavant and out of context.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong>Hahaha........ such a small test and so many show their immature, ultra sensitive, intolerance behaviour.<br><br>What a shame ?</strong>  [/b]</blockquote>You have thoroughly embarrassed yourself here man. Seriously, get a reality check or something.</div>

Also, consider the fact that it wasn't your first post in the topic and that you were already drawing negative responses from people before that.

Seems like u started this topic to insult our religion rather than focusing on the main point "offerings should be burned responsibly".<br><br>And if you really thinks that burning offerings is not practical, can u put across your words in a more proper manner? Instead of "stupid old people burn donno for wat,waste money,pay respect to who?" U used strong languages  in your post therefore we are flaming u as u really insulted our religion and beliefs. U even curse the old generation to die or should i say ,pray for them to die so that no one will be burning all this offerings ever again.<br><br>But i have to say, i agree with the problems created by burning offerings...The smells, the ashes and burning grass patches. But how often do u only came across problems with burning offerings in a year? 4 times or less? And u are making a big fuss about it... Even u dont like it, learn to understand other people,most importantly, respect. The same will goes to u one day. Remember, things goes round. Addressing this sort of sensitive issue requires proper languages and tones, it's not causal chit chatting.[/b]</div>
