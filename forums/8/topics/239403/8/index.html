Because for some people here, it is part of their culture to burn joss paper as offerings. And especially during Qin Ming and 7th month, we always burn a lot of joss papers to our ancestors, because we believe in remembering and respecting the dead. You say that it is stupid to burn all these paper, of course people fed up mah.<br><br>And if u don't wanna get flamed, then don't post it in the 1st place.

            <div class='col-md body'>Calling the cops to solve a domestic irritation is tantamount to taking a bazooka to shoot an ant.<br><br>On the other hand, a person burning 'kim zhuar' is perfectly within his right to do what he wants in his house. But when the smoke permeates the local area to such an extent that neighbours are affected, then the person should find means to contain the spread.<br><br>Unfortunately, many of our people live in HDB flats, and the only place to burn the 'kim zhuar' is at the location identified near the void deck, where a simple wire gauze is used to filter the ashes burning in the barrel and prevent them from flying.<br><br>Despite the effort made to ensure that burning is done in the right place, it seems that some lazy residents continue to burn outside their own apartment, with little or no regard to their neighbours. Some even ignore friendly complaints from their neighbours, giving that 'it's my owner's right' to do what they please in the confines of their flat or thereof.<br><br>Sadly, this is the main cause of heartland unrest, where people refuse to accept the eccentricities of others and cannot live together. The Everitt Road incident is surely not isolated in this respect.<br><br>Perhaps these inconsiderate people should be evicted to a kampung, where the older generation learnt to stay in longhouses with large families, and learn to tolerate each other and their habits, so as to develop a better understanding of neighbourly relations.</div>

'morons', 'sh*t' and others as phrases that i do not use.<br><br>i think respecting for other people beliefs does not mean that you cannot change them. it is just that you have to be more tactful and try not to use abusive and insultive and flaming remarks.<br><br>if you look closely, the world is trying to change each other beliefs all the time. Education changes beliefs and knowledge, advertising changing beliefs, environment group are always adovcating and voicing their opinions to change beliefs, some christian adovcates do try to convince people about the beliefs, other religions print pamphlets and books to spread their beliefs.<br><br>in conclusion, i think we can all say that what is wrong who is wrong in internet forum and try to place our respective reasoning and argument as long as we omit the flaming phrases.</div>
