By doing so, is it bad for health and bad for the enviroment?<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>like al gore film. this is an inconvienient truth that religious activities does not really help to solve problems. i guess we have to keep on educating people.</blockquote></div>I think you still have not learnt after all this while, intentionally provoking people does not help AT ALL to solve problems. At least religion can cultivat good character and help a person to reform. Religion is also about cultivation of self, respect of elder. Just hope you can stop being so myopic about religion.<br><br>If anything, I think YOU are more destructive and more harmful than any of the supposed evils you are speaking out against.<br><br>Blind provokation of other people is no way, good for anybody (except for forum activity and post count).<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>what do you think singapore education system of science, maths and english lesson on fact, opinion and argument is trying to achieve other than getting certificate. they are also trying to teach people to be more sensible, more logical and be wiser human beings..</strong></div></blockquote>Apparently, you failed to learn human relations in school.

About respect and perhaps sensitivity too. Something I see lacking in you. You probably slept through your moral ed class or something.<br><br><strong>[quote]it talks about evolution of animal and plants through many evidence and study and research.</strong>Evoled to the point where a person is devoid of human respect and sensitivity? Don't mind me but that sounds more like an animal than a person to me.</div>
