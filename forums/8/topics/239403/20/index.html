Dont flame beggar already, his intention was to defend his religious practices. Let's just put it down and tolerate one another</div></blockquote>I am willing to agree with you on the point about social cohesion. That is based on the TS's posts, on how a particular atheist mod keeps going around intentionally offending people of different religions, and on how a particular NUS undergraduate had been posting hurtful things on any religion that wasn't his. There are many examples within sgforums itself.<br><br>But definitely, not based on beggar's little 'test' when he was already offending people to begin with. To take that post from somewhere else and suddenly put it here when things were already heated up is definitely inappropriate and insensitive on his part.</div>

Especially the Stinks mouth Mad dog, which only has the women's organ coming out from his mouth.<br><br>One possible reason could be that this Stinks mouth Mad dog smells and licks his mom's too often, therefore its mouth stinks whenever it opens it mouth.<br><br>BeGGar is not going to entertain these Mad dogs or other immature and uncivilised forumers' postings.<br><br>Begar thinks the best thing to treat a mad dog is let it barks until it drop dead.

The person in the other forum started the thread with that post. Which is totally different from how you used the post here. When you quoted the post here, it was already not your first post in this topic let alone the opening post in this topic.<br><br>You were offending people not based on the fact that you used that post but whereby the manner in which you used that post. If you had used it as a starting post like the original person, you would definitely not draw the negative response you have gotten for yourself here.<br><br>You however, posted it when you were already pissing people off.

Anyway, not important if you cant figure out</div></blockquote>To be fair, I've gone through all the postings to re-read everything you've posted in this thread. Went all the way back to page 5 to make sure I didn't miss anything.<br><br>It's not that I don't understand your reason, I just find your reason and logic flawed. Basically your two reasons for putting up the post were<br>1)to test the religious/social tolerance of people here<br>2)to highlight that Stoopid had not quoted when copying the post of others, hence you should be absolved of blame<br><br>I think I've already address these two points in earlier posts but anyway....<br>1)If you really wantd to test people, you should do so by making that post you copied a first post in a new topic. Not in a thread where there's already conflict and you're already drawing negative response to yourself.<br><br>2)Stoopid did not quote correctly and he has since admitted the mistake. But at least his post was relavant. What he copied was from this thread. And even after it was pointed out to you that you were mistaken about Stoopid, you persisted in your view that those were what Stoopid wanted to say when actually he was just copying the TS's post from this thread.<br><br>It wasn't just the fact that you were mistaken about Stoopid, it was your response after being told that ticked people off. I honestly feel if you had copied somebody elses post from within this topic/thread, it would have helped your defence better.<br><br>I did not quote the rest of what you said but personally, I think you should stop antagonising them.</div>
