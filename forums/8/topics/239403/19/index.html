The person in the other forum started the thread with that post. Which is totally different from how you used the post here. When you quoted the post here, it was already not your first post in this topic let alone the opening post in this topic.<br><br>You were offending people not based on the fact that you used that post but whereby the manner in which you used that post. If you had used it as a starting post like the original person, you would definitely not draw the negative response you have gotten for yourself here.<br><br>You however, posted it when you were already pissing people off. Do you realise that?</div>

Also, I don't understand in what way copying that post from elsewhere would help in defending. If anything, it makes him look even more stupid.<br><br>p.s; if you were level-headed, you wouldn't be accussing people wrongly nor making irrelavant posts that further offend people.</div>
