            <div class='col-md body'>I am not a taoism expert, the terms I use &amp; information may not be accurate. But I hope pple can better understand this practise &amp; be more tolerance. To me the practice in Singapore today is related more to religion/ spiritual beliefs rather then culture, custom or tradition as compare to the past &amp; other countries like taiwan, hong kong or China.<br><br>Many religion in the world uses incense joss sticks to worship, some pple find the smell irritating too. But I wld like to focus on the topic of burning paper money &amp; other things like paper dolls, houses, cars etc.<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Bank_Notes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_Bank_Notes</a><br><br>I believe some pple like TS are frustated by recently smoke cause by the chinese taoism ritual praying to the Heaven. (But TS is really EXTREME!) I think the offering was to the chinese deity jade emperor... some one mentioned tian gong dan? sorry I am not too sure on this.<br><br>According to taoism beliefs the burning of kim zhuar is also an act of respect &amp; offering to the deities in heaven, it's a taoist form of thanks giving to the deities for the blessing &amp; having a peaceful year etc. It's NOT like some pple mentioned the taoist deities have no money or need money to spend, this is a very sarcastic &amp; insulting remark!<br><br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Festival" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_Festival</a><br><br>The ghost festival consider the most &amp; longest time for burning of kim zhuar or hell bank note, it last for weeks I suppose. In this ritual, taoists burn many types of paper 'money' &amp; other paper items like clothing etc. This is an offering for a few types of ghosts, hungry ghosts from the 18 levels of hell, earth-bounded or wandering ghosts, those that died a terrible death like from accidents, suicide or murder. NOTE: Taoists believe that these souls cannot<br>enter hell or heaven for a period of time &amp; these are the ones that can cause misfortune among the living.<br><br>Just like other religion, there are also different form of taoism beliefs &amp; practices, example the hokkien rituals maybe different from the teochew.<br>That's why we see some pple prefer burning on grass patch instead of bins provided for them. Some believe they have to draw or mark a circle or write their name where they burn the hell bank notes. The offering burnt are for the ghosts/spirits. So pple do it on the streets or places near to their home &amp; in some cases in 'weird' places. But I believe there are good reasons behind. Also this offering cannot be done in temples which is for worshipping deities from heaven.<br><br>The burning of paper dolls, houses, cars etc is usually for taoist funeral. This practice I dun think will have much impact on our environment, how many taoism funeral do we see in HDB area... it's not like EVERY day! Just like Qing Ming, worshipping of ancestors &amp; decease in the family, it's only once a year &amp; the burning usually done in chinese cemetery &amp; temples.<br><br>TS &amp; frenz, if u dun believe or understand other's religion practice &amp; have NO INTEREST in finding out, COMPLAIN if u want. BUT dun simply insult &amp; condemn as u please! calling chinese taoists stupid &amp; try to CHANGE or TELL them what to do. ***Taoism practice have a very long history... if u are interested to know more wikipedia is ur fren.<br><br>It may be MEANINGLESS &amp; WRONG to u, but to them, this is an important religion ritual &amp; pls check the meaning of arson &amp; vandalism! I hope pple can be more tolerance &amp; dun try to push the blame on chinese taoism for causing environmental problems, this practise exist thousands of years ago... much longer then the HDB flats were built. Lastly those pple who so call very 'concern' about health or causes of global warming &amp; air pollution, pls do<br>a research 1st.<br><br>Please STOP this religion flaming now, there are 'people' here very happy to see us turning against one another!!!  please dun fall into their plot!!!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
