The Holy Bible says, Â“God commended His love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for usÂ”. {Romans 5:8}<br><br>The Holy Bible describes Heaven as a beautiful place with no death, sorrow, sickness and pain. {Revelation 21:4}<br><br>God tells us in the Holy Bible exactly what it takes for us to go to Heaven when we die.<br><br>First, my friend, you must realize that we were born with a sinful nature. The Holy Bible says, Â“For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of GodÂ”. {Romans 3:23}<br><br>This is why we need to be saved so we can go to Heaven and not Hell.<br><br>The Holy Bible describes Hell as a place of suffering and pain forever for all those who reject the salvation that only God can give. {Matthew 13:42}<br><br>To be saved the Word of God or the Holy Bible says, "That if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord(God in human form), and believe in your heart that God(The Father) raised Jesus Christ from the dead, you will be saved." {Romans 10:9}<br><br>Simply believe on Him(Jesus Christ God in human form who was born to a virgin Jewish woman in Bethlehem, Israel) as the one who shed His sinless blood and took your punishment for your sins, died in your place on the Cross, was buried, and whom God(The Father) raised from the dead after 3 days.<br><br>You shouldn't wait until later to be saved because you may die before you get another chance. Let God save you this very moment.<br><br>If you want to be saved right now just pray a meaningful prayer from your heart to God like the one below and you will be saved.<br><br>Dear God I want to be saved. Dear Jesus Christ Son of God I want to make you my personal Lord and Savior. Please forgive me of my sins or things I have done wrong in my life. Thanks Jesus Christ for taking my punishment for my sins by shedding your sinless blood on the cross and dying for my sins. Jesus Christ(God the Son) I now confess you as my Lord and believe in my heart that God(The Father) raised you from the dead. Amen.<br><br>If you just allowed God to save you then welcome to the family of God because you are now a Christian on your way to Heaven.<br><br>Now that you are saved you should strive to live a Godly life.<br><br>The following website http://www.JesusChrist.com will help you learn more about our wonderful Lord and Savior.<br><br>Have a good day!<br>RonaldLGrossi@yahoo.com &lt; my home email address<br>http://www.ViaDolorosa.tk &lt; video<br><br>Please show this message to your friends and family so they can have a chance to be saved.<br><br>Thank you</span></span></strong>[/b]</blockquote>Stop preaching here!
