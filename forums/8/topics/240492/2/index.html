I know I'm one of them. Happened when I was very young and when over to the swimming pool with my elder brother(8 years older than me). At that point of them I was still very young, yet ventured into the medium pool for the sake of looking cool. Then it happened. I sort of slipped and lied on the water. I tried so hard but just couldn't stand up. I actually feel my life slipping away and I could have sworn I saw my life flashed through me even though I'm young. When I felt that it's the end and I can't hold on anymore, my brother actually pulled me out. I took a deep breath and just couldn't believed I'm still alive.<br><br>Anyone actually experienced something like that? That was one moment of my life that I just won't forget...a second life(or maybe third) is not easy to come by.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, I came close to death twice before, but both incidents were too sudden for me to actually have time to see my life flashing before me.<br><br>The first incident was when in 1999, while I was crossing the junction near my home. Since the turning system there is slightly different, I became a little confused and just started walking across the road without even caring about all the cars that were zooming pass me. Fortunately most of the cars were quite a distance away from me as I walked in front of them, but I did wreck quite a bit of havoc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Second time was back in 2001 when my sister and I were helping my dad carry some stuff down to his car for the church, and just as me and my sister were about to walk out from our flat, I suddenly did some random actions in front of my sister which caused both of us to stop, and the next thing you know a window comes crashing down from the 8th floor, barely missing both of us by less than 20cm.</div>
