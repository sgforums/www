            <div class='col-md body'><strong>1st incident</strong>, morbidly funny but not really counted as having cheated death - many yrs ago I downed 45 panadol mini pills with half a cup of dettol (not full cup, because the taste was too vile) in my 1st and only suicide attempt.  Lay there for about an hour and I suddenly wondered how high the chances of me surviving were (horrors).  Looked up the net and realised it's not a given.. ppl who die from panadol usually choke on their vomit or suffer liver failure.. if they survive, their liver might fail and they could die a long painful death.  Laughing through tears of incredulity, I called the ambulance.. when I briefed the medic and asked him if I was gonna die, he quipped "Not if we can help it.  As for the dettol, you'll just have a very clean stomach."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Lesson I learned : Always do your homework<br><br><strong>2nd incident</strong>.. nearly got knocked down by a car when I was 10.  While walking down the pavement from ulu pandan into Ridgewood townhouse, I wandered ahead of my domestic maid &amp; siblings.  Abt 15m from my house, my ears suddenly started ringing loudly even tho it was silent.  I then heard a distant screeching of tyres, metal crashing sounds and looked back.  A white mercedes came barrelling down the curved slope, completely out of control.. there were 2 young men in the front seat.  I started walking faster coz I was scared, but the car came crashing into the pavement beside me.  It was a close shave.. Just how close? Well, the tyres <strong>rolled over</strong> the back of my sneakers, my back felt hot from the friction, right thru my shirt, and I got a bruise on my back thanks to the sideview mirror... Those 2 guys didn't even make eye contact with me, they just talked to each other and quickly sped off while a passerby berated them harshly.  I guess we were all too shocked, coz we didn't take down the car plate number.  In fact I was so shocked that I remained silent  after it happened and started crying about it after 2 hours.<br><br>Lesson I learned : Don't <span style="font-style: italic;">ge kiang</span> wander off and do your own thing</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I was 21..

My speed then was about 80-90 km/hr.. and that Malaysian car was just about 10-12 metres ahead. Plus there was a car on my left, travelling faster than me. Can't make it between the saga and that car to cut to the left lane. KNN Siao liao.<br><br>I let go my trottle and hit the brakes, since Bo Bian, and that part of the bend in relatively straight.

I didn't move.. and was wondering 'WHY NOT PAIN'... what's missing.. which part of my body is gone.<br><br>Anyway, by that time the Proton Sage driver and family was already around me, and the driver of the merc.. got out. I can still remember that the merc driver was saying "Not my fault" repeatedly.. KNN Bastard.<br><br>But I compose, and wriggle out of my bike. To my surprise, and those around me... except for some scratches and bruises.. I WAS INTACT. I looked around and saw the truck driver running over.. 'OK or not'.<br><br>The next surprise, was when I checked my bike, and lifted it, and KNN.. only scratches on the faring and slight wheel mis-alignment. I started the engine.. OK leh..<br><br>But... the proton sage was heavily damaged... the boot had sunken and door was busted open and bumber was ... no longer a bumber and the fuel tank is slightly leaking...<br><br>Imagine.. standing there in the middle of PIE.. looking at the saga damage, then turned around to see the MERC's bumper dented... then looking at myself... safe and nothing missing, and a relatively undamaged Bike.<br><br>Later, on reflection, I seemed to realise, how the whole event was somehow in slow motion.. and I was very conscious of what's happening around me, and it seemed that during this period, I had more time to think and make decisions.... like in matrix.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MobyDog:</div><div class="quote_body">When I was 21.. I was riding a bike along PIE towards Changi (kolam Ayer), That was an Upgrading/widening construction then, and the center divide was boarded high up and there was a sort of a gentle S-course, just before the exit of bendemeer.<br><br>I was travelling at the extreme right lane at about 100 km/hr. As I reached the start of the bend (it was sort of a blind spot), a truck came out of the Contruction site, on the right..<br><br>WTF.. Braking in the midst negotiating a bend..( it's suicidal !!).  In a split second, I decided not to (too dangerous)..because every god damn vehicle was travelling at least 100+ km/h...( since the bend was gentle).<br><br>In any case, I engine brake and accelerated slightly and managed to turn to the second lane. Only to have a Malasian Proton saga jam brake to a complete stop infront of me !! (Because that truck had eaten into his path)<br><br>Liao, Liao laaah... was the first thought that came into my head. My speed then was about 80-90 km/hr.. and that Malaysian car was just about 10-12 metres ahead. Plus there was a car on my left, travelling faster than me. Can't make it between the saga and that car to cut to the left lane. KNN Siao liao.<br><br>I let go my trottle and hit the brakes, since Bo Bian, and that part of the bend in relatively straight. But really is Bo Bian and I smashed right into the left of the rear bumber of the saga.. at about 50-60 km/h (at the most optimal est).<br><br>My entire bike ate deep into the boot of the saga... some more, my bike's fibre-glass faring, which was compressed and then depressed, catapulting  and ejected my bike towards the rear direction in mid-air. The cramp to the fuel tank on my bike, smack onto the road and dragged me along for another 8-12 metres towards an on-coming Merc E200, travelling at a high speed.<br><br>The Merc jammed brake, (can see smoke coming out of the tyres some more), the Merc bang into the front of my bike... which locked my bike between it's front bumber and the road... and bragged me for "god knows how far'... KNN my helmet was just inches away from the bumber. When the Merc came to a complete stop. My bike came loose, when dragging me foward until.. again banging into the rear of the proton saga again.<br><br>I remained clutched to my bike for a while.. but vehicles continue to travel at high speed on my right. I didn't move.. and was wondering 'WHY NOT PAIN'... what's missing.. which part of my body is gone.<br><br>Anyway, by that time the Proton Sage driver and family was already around me, and the driver of the merc.. got out. I can still remember that the merc driver was saying "Not my fault" repeatedly.. KNN Bastard.<br><br>But I compose, and wriggle out of my bike. To my surprise, and those around me... except for some scratches and bruises.. I WAS INTACT. I looked around and saw the truck driver running over.. 'OK or not'.<br><br>The next surprise, was when I checked my bike, and lifted it, and KNN.. only scratches on the faring and slight wheel mis-alignment. I started the engine..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by spinsugar:<br><strong>[b]1st incident</strong>, morbidly funny but not really counted as having cheated death - many yrs ago I downed 45 panadol mini pills with half a cup of dettol (not full cup, because the taste was too vile) in my 1st and only suicide attempt.  Lay there for about an hour and I suddenly wondered how high the chances of me surviving were (horrors).  Looked up the net and realised it's not a given.. ppl who die from panadol usually choke on their vomit or suffer liver failure.. if they survive, their liver might fail and they could die a long painful death.  Laughing through tears of incredulity, I called the ambulance.. when I briefed the medic and asked him if I was gonna die, he quipped "Not if we can help it.  As for the dettol, you'll just have a very clean stomach."   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Lesson I learned : Always do your homework<br><br><strong>2nd incident</strong>.. nearly got knocked down by a car when I was 10.  While walking down the pavement from ulu pandan into Ridgewood townhouse, I wandered ahead of my domestic maid &amp; siblings.  Abt 15m from my house, my ears suddenly started ringing loudly even tho it was silent.  I then heard a distant screeching of tyres, metal crashing sounds and looked back.  A white mercedes came barrelling down the curved slope, completely out of control.. there were 2 young men in the front seat.  I started walking faster coz I was scared, but the car came crashing into the pavement beside me.  It was a close shave.. Just how close? Well, the tyres <strong>rolled over</strong> the back of my sneakers, my back felt hot from the friction, right thru my shirt, and I got a bruise on my back thanks to the sideview mirror... Those 2 guys didn't even make eye contact with me, they just talked to each other and quickly sped off while a passerby berated them harshly.  I guess we were all too shocked, coz we didn't take down the car plate number.  In fact I was so shocked that I remained silent  after it happened and started crying about it after 2 hours.<br><br>Lesson I learned : Don't <span style="font-style: italic;">ge kiang</span> wander off and do your own thing[/b]</blockquote>the first incident made me thought of something..popping panadol is a very common thing too, why is that so? Maybe it has become a trend..what if the person who started this trend actually change to laxatives? He/she might have shitted his/her guts out <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
