I had to pay $800 when I join but you get it back when you meet the sales in 6 months (Well, I got mine back after 6 months!)<br><br>As with any job, there' good and bad side. The above post said is very true. It's a matter of how you manage and adapt to the requirements of the job.<br><br>I see flyers, advertisements and all the expenses as investments. No capital outlay, no gain (since when you know of anything in this world where you don't have to invest and you get money in return). Definitely there will be returns, it's a matter of how much.<br><br>Currently, I can't recruit as yet as I'm not a manager yet but then I've friends who join ERA because of me.<br><br>However, if you are lookiing to join real estate industry because of the money, I sugg you go look elsewhere. Passion for the job is the key thing. Money will come along with it. But if you place money before passion, be prepared to leave the industry in 6 months and be one of the casualty statistics that many have succumbed to!<br><br>My 2 cents worth!<br></div>

All sales job requires an important quality to succeed, and that is possessing a positive attitude. The fact that u managed to stay 5 years in the industry says a lot about you. Stay positive. and success will come in due time...  Industries like real estate and insurance are never easy yet never difficult.. With hardwork, honesty and professionalism, success is not impossible. Bro, you have already take the all important step by joining this career, and now all it takes is some effort, patience and most important, ETHICS !!!! and u will be rewarded !!</div>

I'm keen to challenge myself and pit my negotiation skills with the whoever I meet. Money is not a top priority as I don't really need it. However, if money comes along, it's good as that's a confirmation of my negotiation skills.<br><br>Of coz Professionalism is expected in real estate as with all other jobs. But where else can one get the opportunity to seek fun in communication with different kinds of people on a daily basis? I'm having so much fun and I grow each day, learning to improve my negotiation skills as I go.<br><br>I'm surviving ok in this line but the fun of meeting diff people beats everything else I would want in a job.<br><br>Thanks for encouragement! If you need properties, I'm got a bunch lot on hand. Just PM me!<br><br>Cheers!<br></div>

How much is the average net income (minus expense) for a properties agent?</div></blockquote>In all commision based jobs, it depends on the individual's performances... Jobs like these never require paper qualifications, cos its all about 1) Drive 2) Positive attitude 3) Diligence.. I've know of people who have only Olevels, and yet they regularly bring in 6 figures incomes, and likewise people with masters, and dropping out after a couple of months... (btw, i dun mean property, but commission based jobs on the whole). Thing is, when we go to school, and push ourselves to attain the socially accepted paper qualifications, we are actually training ourselves to be EMPLOYEES.... Its like your parents telling u to go to a good university, so that u get a proper job.. Never would they say "Go get good grades, so that you can start up your own business".. All of us are born to live within the socially accepted norms and restrictions.... People like Bill Gates and some famous successful entreprenuers managed to make it big, cos for them, its a DO or Die situation.. They have no education to fall back on, and this driving factor in return pushed them to great heights.... So unless you are willing to stake everything you got and join this genre of careers, don't bother wasting your time.... My experience tells me that out of 100 singaporeans, only less than 5 are willing to sacrifice their social life, their pride and ego and do whatever its necessary to succeed.. THe rest just want the easy way out... SOME PEOPLE ALWAYS DREAM OF WAKING UP TO BEING A MILLIONAIRE....... THEY ARE RIGHT !!! THEY EVENTUALLY WAKE UP !!</div>
