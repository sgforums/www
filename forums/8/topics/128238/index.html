            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;"></span> Old Changi Hospital<br><br>Have you visited this place yet? Heard of it many times right?<br><br>This is my own encounter to the OCH.<br><br>Brief background of OCH. Its said that WW2, Jap used that place as their barrack as it is facing the sea. Then it was turn into a hospital but was abandon about 12yrs ago as the New Changi General Hospital was built.<br><br>My Personal encounter.<br><br>I was told by my friends that OCH is a fav nite spot for ghost hunter. It is located near Changi Village and the is located on top of the commando camp.<br><br>I went there 3 times but only the 3rd time i really went into the spooky building. The day was the realeased of Harry Potter Prisoner Of Askaban. Me and my friends catch the late nite show which ended at 3am. We took a cab from Tampines Mall where we caught our show and the 6 of us took 2 cab to the commando camp. From there, we walk up the hill with only a torch like a size of a Pen.<br><br>100m ahead of us is total darkness. The moon that nite is extremely bright.<br>6 guys walking together as if we r being glued by Super Glue. Imagine this,<br>walking up a hill in a total darkness with old buildings where commandos used to stay and train and now is abandon. Smell of burn incense and noises of crickets. Finally we reach OCH. When we reach there, the building is in a 'L' shape form. With lots of Graffiti on the wall (looks cool) and a poster size note saying No Entry.Trepasser will be Prosecuted. Everyone of us switch off our hp and we r nt allowed to call each other by names but our class index no.<br><br>This time we really wanna explore OCH and we went INTO the building. We check out the first floor. We walk the hallway and it look like a neverending road for us. With many rooms ahead and nothing inside. No beds....<br>After nt long, we decided to go to 2nd storey. Cos further up theres a guard with his dogs so we cant explore further.<br><br>The stairs leading to the 2nd level is so torn down. The wooden plank have many holes. So we carefully walk up and same thing we r at the corridor. At the 2nd level have 2 lifts. Those typical hospital lifts. Inside the lifts i saw a hospital bed ( u know those type that have wheels where u push patients to Operation Rm ) . Scary man. Our heart beats faster each step we took. The room in the level have nothing but darkness in it. I felt cold in there and i started to have cold sweat. Then we walk till the end of the 2nd level we haf no way to go we exit the whole building. So its like we didnt see anything.<br><br>BUT~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!! [ not for faint hearted to read ]<br><br>My friends went in there b4 with his group of typical ah beng frens. They off their hp and went in. But when they came out, his hp light starts to fickle when he ALREADY OFF HIS HP! yah..funni huh.. wait till u experience that u might consider leaving ur hp behind.<br><br>Another of my fren from poly told mi his account when i share my story with him. This is wat he told mi.<br>His group of frens went into OCH and they walk in a row. The last person cant hear when the first person call him by no. Suprising rite? ONLY the last person cant hear. When they exit from OCH, the Guy in front ask him why he didnt reply him when he call for him, he say he cant hear. Strange enough, the rest heard it. Could smt haf block him from hearing?<br><br>As i have mention earlier about the abandon commando barrack. When the 2nd time i went up to the OCH n i didnt went in with my frens. We walk back to our chalet walking past the building. I saw with my own eyes the one of the room in the barrack got light turn on and in an blink of an eye. theres no more lights. Could be my illusion or im tired. But im sure its nt .<br><br></div>
