            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking about grades, I honestly don't understand why grades are so highly valued in this society. Studying so much to get the elusive A, losing your friends, wasting your life away, losing opportunities to explore the world around you, becoming a square, becoming a boring person. Question yourself on this. Is it really worth it to work so hard just for that paper qualification? Does that paper qualification honestly guarantee you a life of comfort and wealth and a supposed good job? Working hard in your job is one thing, success is not just determined by what you buy or own. I don't see why people should judge others by what they wear or own, does it really matter as long as that person is content and happy in life? Why must we judge a person's accomplishments by his material goods? We are all individuals. One person may be dripping with wealth but his heart is severely rotten and he or she may feel insecure and unhappy. Similarly, a poor person may not own much, but his or her heart may be shining as brightly as the brightest and most polished diamonds you can find on earth and he or she may be content and happy in life.<br>does paper qualification shapes/determines our success in life?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paper qualifications are important because, when you recruit some guy, the certs are the only things that tell you how capable that guy is.<br>No one would go "oh this guy looks like he has potential way beyond his qualifications, i'm gonna let him take a shot", and then reject all other applicants who hold the required paper qualifications.<br><br>There is no other way to judge one's capabilities. This is not like soccer where scouts actually spend time observing players. Nobody is gonna spend months with you just to see if you have more than what your qualifications say you have.<br><br>On the other hand, paper qualifications shapes our lives, yes, but it doesnt determine how successful we're gonna finally be. they're just like passports. once you get in that door, paper qualifications are no longer needed.<br><br>hope that helps<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont deny the fact that some ppl are born super smart and can ace exam without studying.<br><br>However, i feel that for most ordinary people, doing well academically do indicate how much u can achieve in the later part of ur life.<br><br>To do well, ordinary people must haf good time management, staying focused, must be hardworking, pay attention in class, do ur work and hand up ur work on time, set goals, achieve ur goals, fail and learn to climb up again and do better in the nxt exam. therefore,  i believe an ordinary person who can do well in studies most likely can do well in his career, coz he knows how to better manage his life to achieve his goals.<br><br>But u notice i include "ordinary" ppl, coz life is unfair, some smart ppl who are lazy, poor attitude , yet can still do well academically and also in their careers!<br></div>
