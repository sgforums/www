              <p><br>One. You assumed too much.</p>
              <p>Two.  Your assumtion is wrong.  I was not angry about you NOT giving me personal information.  I deal with personal informations more often then you think.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Three.  You seriously lack psychological and understanding skills to know that I am pissed off with how impolite you are.  I have how many communication with you already, and finally I ask you three question.  And what is your answer?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Four.  Asking for your age is relevant to legalities of the pm, but you didnt answer me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Five.  Asking you for a name, but you used the Salutation 'Ms', which is impolite unless you are trying to tell me something.  You are either a: trying to diguise your fact that you are socially inept or b: trying to tell me to seduce you.</p>
