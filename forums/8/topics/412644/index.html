              <p><strong>Theodore Robert "Ted" Bundy</strong>, born <strong>Theodore Robert Cowell</strong> (November 24, 1946 – January 24, 1989), was an <a title="United States" href="/wiki/United_States"><span style="color: #0645ad;">American</span></a> <a title="Serial killer" href="/wiki/Serial_killer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">serial killer</span></a> active between 1974 and 1978. He escaped twice from county jails before his final apprehension in February 1978. Bundy was executed by <a title="Electric chair" href="/wiki/Electric_chair"><span style="color: #0645ad;">electric chair</span></a> for his last murder by the state of <a title="Florida" href="/wiki/Florida"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Florida</span></a> in 1989.</p>
              <p>After more than a decade of vigorous denials, he eventually confessed to over 30 murders, although the actual total of victims remains unknown. Estimates range from 26 to over 100, the general estimate being 35. Typically, Bundy would <a title="Club (weapon)" href="/wiki/Club_(weapon)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">bludgeon</span></a> his victims, then <a title="Strangling" href="/wiki/Strangling"><span style="color: #0645ad;">strangle</span></a> them to death.

              <p>Ted Bundy was born Theodore Robert Cowell at the Elizabeth Lund Home For Unwed Mothers in <a title="Burlington, Vermont" href="/wiki/Burlington,_Vermont"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Burlington, Vermont</span></a>, to Eleanor Louise Cowell. While the identity of his father is unknown, Bundy's <a title="Birth certificate" href="/wiki/Birth_certificate"><span style="color: #0645ad;">birth certificate</span></a> lists a "Lloyd Marshall" (b. 1916),<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule20008.2C_17_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule20008.2C_17-1"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></span></a></sup> although Bundy's mother would later tell of being seduced by a war veteran named "Jack Worthington". However, Bundy's family did not believe this story, and expressed suspicion about Louise's violent, <a title="Child abuse" href="/wiki/Child_abuse"><span style="color: #0645ad;">abusive</span></a> father, Samuel Cowell.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199956_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199956-2"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Whatever the truth of Bundy's parentage, to avoid <a title="Social stigma" href="/wiki/Social_stigma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">social stigma</span></a>, Bundy's maternal grandparents, Samuel and Eleanor Cowell, claimed him as their son. He grew up believing that his mother was his older sister. Bundy biographers Stephen Michaud and <a title="Hugh Aynesworth" href="/wiki/Hugh_Aynesworth"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Hugh Aynesworth</span></a> wrote that he learned Louise was actually his mother while he was in high school.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199963_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199963-3"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></span></a></sup> <a title="True crime" href="/wiki/True_crime"><span style="color: #0645ad;">True crime</span></a> writer <a title="Ann Rule" href="/wiki/Ann_Rule"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ann Rule</span></a>, who knew Bundy personally, believes it was around 1969, shortly after a <a title="Psychological trauma" href="/wiki/Psychological_trauma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">traumatic</span></a> breakup with his college girlfriend.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule200016.E2.80.9317_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule200016.E2.80.9317-4"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>For the first few years of his life, Bundy and his mother lived in <a title="Philadelphia" href="/wiki/Philadelphia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Philadelphia</span></a>, <a title="Pennsylvania" href="/wiki/Pennsylvania"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pennsylvania</span></a>. In 1950, they moved to live with relatives in <a title="Tacoma, Washington" href="/wiki/Tacoma,_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Tacoma, Washington</span></a>. Here, Louise had her son's surname changed from Cowell to Nelson.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule20008_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule20008-5"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In 1951, one year after their move, Louise Cowell met Johnny Culpepper Bundy at an adult singles night held at Tacoma's <a title="First Methodist Church" href="/wiki/First_Methodist_Church"><span style="color: #0645ad;">First Methodist Church</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199957_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199957-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In May that year, the couple were married, and soon after Johnny Bundy <a title="Adoption" href="/wiki/Adoption"><span style="color: #0645ad;">adopted</span></a> Ted, legally changing his last name to "Bundy".<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199957_6-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199957-6"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Johnny and Louise Bundy had more children, whom the young Bundy spent much of his time babysitting. Johnny Bundy tried to include his high school aged stepson in <a title="Camping" href="/wiki/Camping"><span style="color: #0645ad;">camping</span></a> trips and other father-son activities, but the boy remained distant from his stepfather.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule200010_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule200010-7"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Bundy remained shy and introverted throughout his high school and early college years. He would say later that he "hit a wall" in high school and that he was unable to understand social behavior, stunting his social development.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199964_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199964-8"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He maintained a facade of social activity, but he had no natural sense of how to get along with other people, saying: "I didn't know what made things tick. I didn't know what made people want to be friends. I didn't know what made people attractive to one another. I didn't know what underlay social interactions."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199966_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199966-9"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>As a teen, Bundy would look through libraries for detective magazines and books on crime, focusing on sources that described sexual violence and featured pictures of dead bodies and violent sexuality.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENelson1994277.E2.80.93278_10-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTENelson1994277.E2.80.93278-10"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Before he left high school, Bundy was a <a title="Kleptomania" href="/wiki/Kleptomania"><span style="color: #0645ad;">compulsive thief</span></a> and a <a title="Shoplifting" href="/wiki/Shoplifting"><span style="color: #0645ad;">shoplifter</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule200012_11-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule200012-11"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></span></a></sup> To support his love of <a title="Skiing" href="/wiki/Skiing"><span style="color: #0645ad;">skiing</span></a>, Bundy stole skis and equipment and <a title="Forgery" href="/wiki/Forgery"><span style="color: #0645ad;">forged</span></a> ski-lift tickets.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199962_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199962-12"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

              <p>In 1965, Bundy graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School. Awarded a scholarship by the <a title="University of Puget Sound" href="/wiki/University_of_Puget_Sound"><span style="color: #0645ad;">University of Puget Sound</span></a> (UPS), he began that fall taking courses in <a title="Psychology" href="/wiki/Psychology"><span style="color: #0645ad;">psychology</span></a> and <a title="Oriental studies" href="/wiki/Oriental_studies"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Oriental studies</span></a>. After two semesters at UPS, he decided to transfer to Seattle's <a title="University of Washington" href="/wiki/University_of_Washington"><span style="color: #0645ad;">University of Washington</span></a> (UW). While he was a university student, Bundy worked as a grocery bagger and shelf-stocker at a Seattle <a title="Safeway Inc." href="/wiki/Safeway_Inc."><span style="color: #0645ad;">Safeway</span></a> store on <a class="mw-redirect" title="Queen Anne Hill" href="/wiki/Queen_Anne_Hill"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Queen Anne Hill</span></a>, as well as other odd jobs. At this time Bundy did not hold any one job for longer than a few months, and though he was never caught stealing while at work he had been regarded with some suspicion by employers. As part of his course of studies in psychology, he later worked as a night-shift volunteer at Seattle's <a title="Suicide" href="/wiki/Suicide"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Suicide</span></a> Hot Line, a suicide crisis center that served the greater Seattle metropolitan and suburban areas. He met and worked alongside former Seattle <a title="Police officer" href="/wiki/Police_officer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">police officer</span></a> and then-fledgling <a title="Crime writer" href="/wiki/Crime_writer"><span style="color: #0645ad;">crime writer</span></a> <a title="Ann Rule" href="/wiki/Ann_Rule"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Ann Rule</span></a>, who would later write one of the definitive biographies of Bundy and his crimes, <em><a title="The Stranger Beside Me" href="/wiki/The_Stranger_Beside_Me"><span style="color: #0645ad;">The Stranger Beside Me</span></a></em>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule200022.E2.80.9333_13-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule200022.E2.80.9333-13"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>He began a relationship with fellow university student "Stephanie Brooks" (a <a title="Pseudonym" href="/wiki/Pseudonym"><span style="color: #0645ad;">pseudonym</span></a>), whom he met while enrolled at UW in 1967. She ended the relationship after her 1968 graduation and returned to her family home in <a title="California" href="/wiki/California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">California</span></a>, fed up with what she described as Bundy's immaturity and lack of ambition. Bundy reacted to this rejection by becoming <a class="mw-redirect" title="Clinical depression" href="/wiki/Clinical_depression"><span style="color: #0645ad;">depressed</span></a>, he dropped out of college and travelled east. Rule states that, around this time, Bundy decided to visit his birthplace of Burlington, Vermont. There he visited the local records clerk and finally uncovered the truth about his parentage.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199953_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199953-14"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After his discovery, Bundy became a more focused and dominant person. Back home in Washington by 1968, he managed the Seattle office of <a title="Nelson Rockefeller" href="/wiki/Nelson_Rockefeller"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Nelson Rockefeller</span></a>'s Presidential campaign and attended the <a title="1968 Republican National Convention" href="/wiki/1968_Republican_National_Convention"><span style="color: #0645ad;">1968 Republican National Convention</span></a> in <a title="Miami" href="/wiki/Miami"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Miami</span></a>, Florida as a Rockefeller supporter.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELarsen19805.2C_7_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTELarsen19805.2C_7-15"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He re-enrolled at UW, this time as a psychology major.

              <p>Bundy graduated from UW with a degree in psychology in 1972.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199976_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199976-18"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Soon afterward, he again went to work for the <a title="Washington State Republican Party" href="/wiki/Washington_State_Republican_Party"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Washington State Republican Party</span></a>, and developed a close relationship with Governor <a title="Daniel J.

Later, a minor scandal developed when the Democrats found out about Bundy, who had been posing as a college student.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTELarsen19807.E2.80.9310_20-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTELarsen19807.E2.80.9310-20"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In the fall of 1973, Bundy enrolled in the <a title="Law school" href="/wiki/Law_school"><span style="color: #0645ad;">law school</span></a> at the <a title="University of Puget Sound" href="/wiki/University_of_Puget_Sound"><span style="color: #0645ad;">University of Puget Sound</span></a>, but he did poorly. He began skipping classes, and finally dropped out in spring 1974; at the same time young women began to disappear in the <a title="Pacific Northwest" href="/wiki/Pacific_Northwest"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pacific Northwest</span></a>.</p>
              <p>While on a business trip to <a title="California" href="/wiki/California"><span style="color: #0645ad;">California</span></a> in the summer of 1973, Bundy came back into the life of his ex-girlfriend "Stephanie Brooks" with a new look and attitude; this time as a serious, dedicated professional who had been accepted to law school. Bundy continued to date Kloepfer as well, and neither woman was aware the other existed. Bundy courted Brooks throughout the rest of the year, and she accepted his marriage proposal. Two weeks later, however, shortly after New Year's 1974, he unceremoniously dumped her, refusing to return her phone calls. A few weeks after this breakup, Bundy began a murderous rampage in Washington state</p>
              <p>There is no definitive agreement on when and where Bundy began killing people.

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>Bundy had a fairly consistent <em><a title="Modus operandi" href="/wiki/Modus_operandi"><span style="color: #0645ad;">modus operandi</span></a></em>. He would approach a potential victim in a public place, even in daylight or in a crowd, as when he abducted Ott and Naslund at Lake Sammamish or when he kidnapped Leach from her school. Bundy had various ways of gaining a victim's trust. Sometimes, he would feign injury, wearing his arm in a sling or wearing a fake cast, as in the murders of Hawkins, Rancourt, Ott, Naslund, and Cunningham. At other times Bundy would impersonate an authority figure. He pretended to be a policeman when approaching Carol DaRonch, and a fireman to Leslie Parmenter.</p>
              <p>Bundy had a remarkable advantage in that his facial features were attractive, yet not especially memorable. In later years, he would often be described as <a title="Chameleon" href="/wiki/Chameleon"><span style="color: #0645ad;">chameleon</span></a>-like,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel200580_101-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel200580-101"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999176_102-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999176-102"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>103<span>]</span></span></a></sup> able to look totally different by making only minor adjustments to his appearance, e.g., growing a beard or changing his hairstyle.</p>
              <p>All of Bundy's victims were <a title="White American" href="/wiki/White_American"><span style="color: #0645ad;">white</span></a> females and most were of <a title="Middle class" href="/wiki/Middle_class"><span style="color: #0645ad;">middle class</span></a> background. Almost all were between the ages of 15 and 25. Many were college students. In her book, Rule notes that most of Bundy's victims had long straight hair parted in the middle—just like Stephanie Brooks, the woman to whom Bundy was engaged in 1973. Rule speculates that Bundy's resentment towards his first girlfriend was a motivating factor in his string of murders.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule2000431.E2.80.93432_103-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule2000431.E2.80.93432-103"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></span></a></sup> However, in a 1980 interview, Bundy dismissed this <a title="Hypothesis" href="/wiki/Hypothesis"><span style="color: #0645ad;">hypothesis</span></a>: "[t]hey... just fit the general criteria of being young and attractive... Too many people have bought this crap that all the girls were similar — hair about the same color, parted in the middle... but if you look at it, almost everything was dissimilar...physically, they were almost all different."<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1989156_104-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1989156-104"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>After luring a victim to his car, Bundy would hit her in the head with a crowbar he had placed underneath his Volkswagen or hidden inside it. Every recovered skull, except for that of Kimberly Leach, showed signs of <a title="Blunt trauma" href="/wiki/Blunt_trauma"><span style="color: #0645ad;">blunt force trauma</span></a>. Every recovered body, except for that of Leach, showed signs of strangulation. Many of Bundy's victims were transported a considerable distance from where they disappeared, as in the case of Kathy Parks, whom he drove more than 260 miles from Oregon to Washington. Bundy often would drink alcohol prior to finding a victim;<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005379_105-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005379-105"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Carol DaRonch testified to smelling alcohol on his breath.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199994_106-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth199994-106"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Hagmaier stated that Bundy considered himself to be an amateur and impulsive killer in his early years, and then moved into what he considered to be his "prime" or "predator" phase. Bundy stated that this phase began around the time of the Lynda Healy murder, when he began seeking victims he considered to be equal to his skill as a murderer.</p>
              <p>On death row, Bundy admitted to decapitating at least a dozen of his victims with a hacksaw.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999339_107-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999339-107"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>108<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He kept the severed heads later found on Taylor Mountain (Rancourt, Parks, Ball, Healy) in his room or apartment for some time before finally disposing of them.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005378.2C_393_108-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005378.2C_393-108"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He confessed to <a title="Cremation" href="/wiki/Cremation"><span style="color: #0645ad;">cremating</span></a> Donna Manson's head in his girlfriend's fireplace.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005395_109-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel2005395-109"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>110<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Some of the skulls of Bundy's victims were found with the front teeth broken out.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel200530_110-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel200530-110"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>111<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Bundy also confessed to visiting his victims' bodies over and over again at the Taylor Mountain body dump site. He stated that he would lie with them for hours, applying makeup to their corpses and having sex with their decomposing bodies until <a title="Putrefaction" href="/wiki/Putrefaction"><span style="color: #0645ad;">putrefaction</span></a> forced him to abandon the remains. Not long before his death, Bundy admitted to returning to the corpse of Georgeann Hawkins for purposes of <a title="Necrophilia" href="/wiki/Necrophilia"><span style="color: #0645ad;">necrophilia</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEKeppel200522.E2.80.9323_111-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKeppel200522.E2.80.9323-111"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>112<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Bundy confessed to keeping other souvenirs of his crimes. The Utah police who searched Bundy's apartment in 1975 missed a collection of photographs that Bundy had hidden in the utility room, photos that Bundy destroyed when he returned home after being released on bail.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENelson1994258_112-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTENelson1994258-112"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>113<span>]</span></span></a></sup> His girlfriend Elizabeth once found a bag in his room filled with women's clothing.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule2000167_113-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule2000167-113"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>When Bundy was confronted by officers who stated that they believed the number of individuals he had murdered was 36, Bundy told them that they should "add one digit to that, and you'll have it." Rule speculated that this meant Bundy might have killed over 100 women.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule2000335_114-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule2000335-114"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>115<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Speaking to his lawyer Polly Nelson in 1988, however, Bundy dismissed the 100+ victims speculation and said that the more common estimate of approximately 35 victims was accurate.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTENelson1994257_115-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTENelson1994257-115"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>116</span></a></sup></p>

They identified him as "Officer Roseland" and as the man lurking about the night Debby Kent disappeared. Following a week-long trial, Bundy was convicted of DaRonch's kidnapping on March 1, 1976, and was sentenced to 15 years in <a title="Utah State Prison" href="/wiki/Utah_State_Prison"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Utah State Prison</span></a>.

              </div>
              </div>
              <p>On June 7, 1977, in preparation for a hearing in the Caryn Campbell murder trial, Bundy was taken to the <a title="Pitkin County, Colorado" href="/wiki/Pitkin_County,_Colorado"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Pitkin County</span></a> courthouse in <a title="Aspen, Colorado" href="/wiki/Aspen,_Colorado"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Aspen</span></a>. During a court recess, he was allowed to visit the courthouse's law library, where he jumped out of the building from a second-story window and escaped, spraining his right ankle during the jump. In the minutes following his escape, Bundy at first ran and then strolled casually through the small town toward <a title="Aspen Mountain (Colorado)" href="/wiki/Aspen_Mountain_(Colorado)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Aspen Mountain</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999197_68-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999197-68"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>69<span>]</span></span></a></sup> He made it all the way to the top of Aspen Mountain without being detected, where he rested for two days in an abandoned hunting cabin. But afterwards, he lost his sense of direction and wandered aimlessly in circles around the mountain for the next two days, missing two trails that led down off the mountain to his intended destination, the town of <a title="Crested Butte, Colorado" href="/wiki/Crested_Butte,_Colorado"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Crested Butte</span></a>. At one point he talked his way out of danger after coming face-to-face with a gun-toting citizen who was one of the searchers scouring Aspen Mountain for Ted Bundy. On June 13, 1977, Bundy stole a car he found on the mountain near another cabin. Despite being stricken with fatigue, sleep-deprivation, and in constant and intense pain from his sprained ankle, he drove back into Aspen and could have gotten away, but two police deputies noticed the Cadillac with dimmed headlights weaving in and out of its lane and pulled Bundy over. They recognized him and took him back to jail. Bundy had been <a class="mw-redirect" title="On the lam" href="/wiki/On_the_lam"><span style="color: #0645ad;">on the lam</span></a> for six days.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999203.E2.80.93205_69-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999203.E2.80.93205-69"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>70<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Back in custody, Bundy worked on a new escape plan. He was being held in the <a title="Glenwood Springs, Colorado" href="/wiki/Glenwood_Springs,_Colorado"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Glenwood Springs, Colorado</span></a> jail while he awaited trial. Bundy acquired a hacksaw blade and $500 in cash; he later claimed the blade came from another prison inmate and the money was smuggled in by visiting friends. Over two weeks, he sawed through the welds fixing a small metal plate in the ceiling and, after dieting to lose weight, was able to fit through the hole and access the crawl space above. An informant in the prison told officers that he had heard Bundy moving around the ceiling during the nights before his escape, but the matter was not investigated.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999209_70-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999209-70"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>71<span>]</span></span></a></sup> When Bundy's Aspen trial judge ruled on December 23, 1977, that the Caryn Campbell murder trial would start on January 9, 1978,<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTERule20006_71-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTERule20006-71"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>72<span>]</span></span></a></sup> and changed the venue to Colorado Springs, Bundy realized that he had to make his escape before he was transferred out of the Glenwood Springs jail. On the night of December 30, 1977, Bundy dressed warmly and packed books and files under his blanket to make it appear as though he was sleeping. He wriggled through the hole and up into the crawlspace. Bundy crawled over to a spot directly above the jailer's linen closet—the jailer and his wife were out for the evening—dropped down into the jailer's apartment, and walked out the door.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999209.E2.80.93211_72-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999209.E2.80.93211-72"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Bundy was free, but he was on foot in the middle of a bitterly cold, snowy Colorado night. He stole a broken-down <a class="mw-redirect" title="MG (car)" href="/wiki/MG_(car)"><span style="color: #0645ad;">MG</span></a>, but it stalled in the mountains. Bundy was stuck on the side of <a title="Interstate 70" href="/wiki/Interstate_70"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Interstate 70</span></a> in the middle of the night in a blizzard until another driver gave him a ride into the town of Vail. From there he caught a bus to <a title="Denver" href="/wiki/Denver"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Denver</span></a> and boarded the <a class="mw-redirect" title="TWA" href="/wiki/TWA"><span style="color: #0645ad;">TWA</span></a> 8:55 a.m. flight to <a title="Chicago" href="/wiki/Chicago"><span style="color: #0645ad;">Chicago</span></a>. The Glenwood Springs jail officers did not notice Bundy was gone until noon on December 31, 1977, 17 hours after his escape, by which time Bundy was already in Chicago.<sup id="cite_ref-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999212.E2.80.93213_73-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMichaudAynesworth1999212.E2.80.93213-73"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>

Bundy tried to find work at a construction site, but when the personnel officer asked Bundy for his driver's license for identification, Bundy walked away. This was his only attempt at job hunting.</p>
