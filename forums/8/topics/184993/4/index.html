A good case study would be that which appears in Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6. In it, a pharmaceutical company uses the Sydney Olympics to spread a newly engineered strain of the ebola virus. However, this is not meant to be the killing blow. Rather, its used to spread panic. The company then announces it happens to have been developing a live-virus vaccine against this new strain. It "kindly" offers to vaccinate millions of people around the world. Unfortunately for the world, this live-virus vaccine is actually not a vaccine, but the very virus itself. With this method, their plan would wipe almost 90% of the people on earth out, not thru a virus spreading by itself, but rather thru people allowing themselves to be injected with the virus, thinking that its the vaccine. This certainly overcomes the problems of ebola killing too fast. The virus's fast killing time factor becomes an advantage, because by the time people realise what's happened, they're all too weak to do anything about it.</div>

Who knows what is going on in the bioweapon labs of countries all over the world?<br><br>2ndly, I don't think making people sterile will guarentee mankind's elimination. With the current breakthroughs in cloning and non-sexual human reproduction, there is no guarentee that mankind will die out before they successfully reproduce humans using nothing more than DNA from donor parents. Someone looking to wipe out 90% of the human race, might want something with a better guarentee.</div>

It doesn't have to be DNA from the ovaries or the sperms. If u want to produce a virus to wipe humankind out this way, it has to target the DNA of the individual itself. Unfortunately, there is a reason why nature has diversified itself in replicating so many diverse sets of DNAs, and that is to survive such an attack. To effectively attack DNA, perhaps we have to look to nanotech where the nanobots can attack the DNA strands itself without any regard for what DNA is written, unlike viruses which might encounter unexpected defenses.</div>

No logical or even sane person would think of killing 5 billion people just to conserve the environment which would eventually be destroyed by the survivors instead.<br><br>Rather, one should talk about sending those 5 billion people, thousands at a time, on monthly trips to a base built on the Moon, where overpopulation would be drastically reduced on Earth because the human species would be spread out on 2 bodies, Earth and Luna. Now, if NASA hasn't been so slow in its actions, we would already have a lunar base by now. Instead, I predict that a base on the moon would be built by the year 2022, with construction beginning in 2015-2018. Since resources on Earth are running out, it is only logical to assume that the next body we should mine for minerals and resources would be the moon. Instead of killing 5 billion people, we could send a few, maybe 2/5s of that number, 2 billion, to the Lunar Colony. From Luna, we would terraform Mars, and after a few centuries, or even decades, Mars would be made suitable for the rest of the 5 billion (which would have multiplayed by 3 times), to live on the desert planet. From Mars, we would be able to gather a large pool of resources to advance next to a suitable body in the Sol System to live in, for example, Iapetus, Ganymede, Europa, or Enceladus (of course, after terraforming). If this plan is taken into consideration soon, we would no longer fear overpopulation of Terra, or even the over-use of resources on this planet.</div></blockquote>LOL <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> YOU ARE THE ONE WHO IS STUPID!!! If it cost NASA billions of US dollars to send 5 astronauts to the moon, the cost of sending 2 billion people will collapse the world economic!!! And building base which can provide a suitable living condition on Mars cost millions of billions of dollars. Now you paying for it?</div>
