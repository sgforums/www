Now, if NASA hasn't been so slow in its actions, we would already have a lunar base by now. Instead, I predict that a base on the moon would be built by the year 2022, with construction beginning in 2015-2018. Since resources on Earth are running out, it is only logical to assume that the next body we should mine for minerals and resources would be the moon. Instead of killing 5 billion people, we could send a few, maybe 2/5s of that number, 2 billion, to the Lunar Colony. From Luna, we would terraform Mars, and after a few centuries, or even decades, Mars would be made suitable for the rest of the 5 billion (which would have multiplayed by 3 times), to live on the desert planet. From Mars, we would be able to gather a large pool of resources to advance next to a suitable body in the Sol System to live in, for example, Iapetus, Ganymede, Europa, or Enceladus (of course, after terraforming). If this plan is taken into consideration soon, we would no longer fear overpopulation of Terra, or even the over-use of resources on this planet.</div></blockquote>venus holds a noon temperature of 400++ celcius, roasted human bak-kua. nearest possible will be mars (+20 to -100++ celcius), but definitely not our moon. in order to terraform, it is a process of manufacturing a viable environment where millions of tons of chemicals are produced or transformed to resemble earth conditions. it is quite possible that this technology can be invented. however, we will probably burnt our own atmosphere ... after we send billions of ppl to mars using current technology of rockets ...<br><br>imagine we "greenhouse" our earth to save a few billion ppl by rocketing them to mars ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> ... imagine the amount of "power" required to break free of our gravity, to send shuttles/rockets away to the moon/mars ... millions of tons of hydrogen burnt ... energy released as heat ... global warming ...<br><br>so unless some one invents the warp drive ... otherwise ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a new threat to our survival which would arise by 2030. It is the integration of nanobots into our bloodstream. By 2030, the common people would be able to buy nanabots to be injected into their bodies to heal wounds, scan the brain for research, search and eliminate disease. If a terrorist were to gain control of the nanobots, he would be able to reprogram them and make them go into 'kill-mode', where, instead of protecting human life, the nanbots in about a billion people would turn hostile and destroy the victim's nervous system, and heart, and wiping out a large number of the human species.</div>
