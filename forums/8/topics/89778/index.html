            <div class='col-md body'><strong> i hope everyone can try to post as many as possible to avoid future hassle and anger in purchasing and deals with any shop or dealers.<br><br>let me kick off with mine experience :<br><br>[b]Seng Choon Electronics<br>Mobile and accessories providers </strong><br><br>i bot a geo gv 880 2 weeks ago. After purchasing, i realised i was shortchanged with the below :<br><br>one more extra batt<br>data cable<br>cd-rom<br>warranty card<br>manual<br><br>they also provided us with :<br>incompatible cable<br>incompatible charger ( my bf bot a panasonic phone too )<br>incompatible cd-rom<br><br>i tried to search for the distributor itself and found it.. its under Generation Mobile. Have confirmed that the standard package was two batt, cd rom, cable and the manual.<br><br>the salesman from Seng Choon Electronics ( 63544764 ) con us into a package :<br><br>the phone was $688 and we have to pay an extra : $80 for earpiece and the above i mentioned.. it was ridiculous as the standard package was with it...<br>we paid for it.. and we were awarded with all this craps from him.. he tol me he doesnt have the manual.. it doesnt come with it... check with Generation Mobile and they said each phone comes with all the above.. he did not gave me my warranty card too.. he also conned my bf by telling him his free mountain bike ( free gift from panasonic ) can be trade in for full value @200 but when  we checked with them... it was for $50 only.<br><br>we went down for 3 times to exchanged and got the bits and pieces called them 7-8 times ( and they will never call you back even they say they will and they take down your no. and write it so big on their bOARD ) .. and i am still awaiting for my 2nd batt... this is A CON SHOP! please so not purchase anything from them.. and after we have bot our phone we realised we are being overcharged !<br><br>the shop is @ Toa Payoh Central, Named : Seng Choon Generation Mobile, Sales man named: Michael ( the big hole guy ).<br><br>cheers.

            <div class='col-md body'>OH MY GOD!<br><br>I freaking bought a V200 from that b****** man! I sold it away though..... but here is what happened...<br><br>I went in ask for V200 he tell me $638 i tot...so cheap..so i want to buy lar, then hor he tell me ar only got phone, one batt, instruction manual and the box. The second batt and earpiece all go and take the next day. I stupidly believe him and bought the phone. He told me that the second batt and earpiece got to pay extra $80, idiot! Then when i left the shop i realise he still owe me a phone cable and software, which he NEVER MENTIONED. I think he think i will forget it so he dun need give me. I turn back to ask for it. He act stupid say orhhhhh then give me the cable and CD. The CD look SO PIRATED LOR! Its like pasar malam one! then the next day go and get the rest. Then, i realise the warranty card the chop is not his shop name, not Seng Choon Electronics, but dunno what shit company, then i suspect its second hand liaoz, but din say a thing. After that nth happen,he lucky. But when i selling the V200 that tie, the second hand dealer tell me hor, the V200 is dunno what country model, not singapore one. That Seng Choon Guy actually got a new looking second hand phone from other country and sell to me sia! I almost burst, but still manage to sell for $270. After that i buy a E100A from suntec samsung shop. I tell u all, i will never trust these neighbourhood shops again, especially SENG CHOON ELECTRONICS.<br><br><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">SENG CHOON ELECTRONICS IS A FREAKING CHEAT AND CONMAN AND FRAUD STORE!

            <div class='col-md body'>Wrote this before in another thread. No harm doing it again to warn people out there. YES, its yet another handphone shop in Toa Payoh. CITYHUB and the lao beng shopkeeper called STEVEN. BOYCOTT IT!<br><br>I second that. I was there when a friend of mine bought a new handphone at ah beng HP shop in Toa Payoh, shop name is CITYHUB. After my friend decided to buy the phone, the ah beng keep pestering, psychoing my friend to buy those accessories(desktop, batteries etc) in his bengish fwen fwen manner until my friend buay tahan so he pay for it also.<br><br>After paying, the ah beng's true colour shows. He say tomorrow then come collect the spare battery that my friend bought cause now no stock. My friend kpkb but the ah beng insisted he reminded my friend there's no stock even before payment was made. Stupid excuse. Who would pay for something when there isn't any stock.<br><br>So it turned into a heated argument. We demanded they refund or we'll lodge a complain to relevant body. Magically, he somehow manage to produce the spare battery out of nowhere, after insisting there's no stock for some 5 minutes. We questioned the integrity of the spare battery, why he say there's no stock but now he can produce it, whether is it 2nd hand etc. He insisted its new and somehow "prove" it to us by talking lots of cock and showing us many batteries.<br><br>At the moment we're already damn fedup and just left. Before we left, we told him we won't hesistate to lodge a complain if the items prove to be defective. He replied in bengishly like want to fight tone "I don't cheat one, don't you anyhow say. If got problem go ahead come find me lah. My name is Steven."<br><br>A bad day really. Luckily the handphone turns out fine. If want to buy handphone, safer to pay more at established dealers like Singtel, Nokia etc then risk at those neighbourhood ah beng shop. In any case, avoid Cityhub Toa Payoh, and the lao beng who calls himself Steven.</div>
