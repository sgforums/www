              That means you often get many flirt :D In the flight, I didn't sit next to her. I sit next to a couple that was noisy and disturbing.
              I only talked with her when we was at KLIA. Just a normal conservation, but I know she is a girl I have been looking for 25 years (I'm 26 years old :D).

              <p>Lots of us are regular travellers. If you're really interested, you'll have to sit at Mac or Hans and keep your eye on the transit area door for a month (budget terminal has only 1).</p>
              <p>Set your alarm for 1 hour before flights to KL take off &amp; 10 mins after landing. When flights land, move and watch the exit. Don't blink. At other times use wifi and we will keep you company here.</p>
