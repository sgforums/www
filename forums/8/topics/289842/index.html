            <div class='col-md body'>Posted in another forum.<br><br><blockquote>This is an account what a friend of mine encountered. They are also many other version.<br>I know it is a repeated thread but i think it is good to serve as a reminder.<br><br>Please share if you have other version of conning....<br><br><span style="color: Blue;">Hi,<br>I would like to tell you what happen to me yesterday - 24/10/2007.<br>About noon time, there is an incoming call to my office direct line. When I<br>pick up the call, it was a voice recorded message that said, "You have a<br>message from the Supreme Court. Press 9 to listen to the message." I pressed<br>9 and it was transferred to an operator that answered by saying, "Supreme<br>Court reception, can I help you?" I told her I received a voice message from<br>Supreme Court telling me to press 9 to listen to that message. She proceeds<br>to ask me for my name and I/C number. So I told her and it sounded like as<br>it she is keying in and paused awhile and told me I had a notice from<br>Supreme Court with a charge of working with "Ah long" (Illegal Loan sharks)<br>to open 2 bank accounts for them and the Supreme Court had already sent me<br>Court summon letter to me.<br><br>I was so shocked and told her I did not know any loan sharks and I will<br>never do that and I did not receive any letter from Court at all. She told<br>me for that I'm one of the person who is involved in this illegal act and if<br>I want to verify my case, she would get the CID police in charge of this<br>case to call me.<br><br>In less than a few minutes, I received a call from someone who claimed to be<br>a CID officer looking for me. I answered him I am the person he's looking<br>for. He told me that on such a date, the police had cracked down and napped<br>a "ah long" (Illegal Loan Sharks) and in his house, they found a name list<br>containing several bank accounts open by a group of people and I happen to<br>be one of them. I was so socked and told him that I never would do such a<br>thing and I do not know any ah long or loan sharks at all. He then challenge<br>me and told me, "do you want to see the evident we got?" I told him, "Yes I<br>would like to come down to your police office to see it because I did not do<br>that." I then asked him to give me the address, which department he is from<br>and his name so that I can go down to see him. He gave me his name is<br>Officer Khoo Boon Hui at Police HQ. CID Tower. Blk C, level 5. His office<br>number is 6435 0000. However he quickly change the subject and ask me a few<br>questions to pretend to be investigating me. He asked me have I lost my I/C,<br>Bank account book? I answered No. He then asked me did I let anyone<br>photocopied my I/C or Bank account book? I thought for a while and answered<br>him I did a few months back at DBS Bank when I thought of opening a<br>Investment Account.<br></span></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><blockquote>He then told me that it could be due to corruption, the bank officer may<br>have sold my data to the Ah long (loan shark) in return for some cash. He<br>told me since from his investigation he assume I'm innocent and one of those<br>whose I/C and bank data the ah long (loan shark) obtained from corrupt bank<br>officers to make false ID and bank document to open bank account, he would<br>fax my case to a Supreme Court office to further investigate and present my<br>case before the Judge. As such there is no need to go down to see him at the<br>police HQ he said. He told me he will get the Supreme Court officer in<br>charge to call me and further arrange how she can help me to plead with the<br>Judge together with those innocent parties that had been framed. From the<br>voice of that man officer who talked to me, I can tell his speaking accents<br>sound like from China. My mind was so confused and troubled after hearing<br>him talked to me all these things I did not question that at the moment.<br><br>In a while time, a lady called me on my mobile phone saying the "CID" who<br>had earlier on investigated me had called her and told her about my case.<br>She would need me to cooperate with her in further investigation. She told<br>me that she would need to begin to do a series of questions she need me to<br>answer honestly. All my conversation with her will be recorded as Court<br>evident. It's so professionally done that you think you're really going<br>through a investigation answering those questions like did you disclose any<br>of your bank information, documents, ID to anyone? Did you loss your<br>passport, ID, bank book, credit card?.<br><br>At the end of the series of questions, she told me that they are working<br>together with international police to crack down these illegal ah long loan<br>sharks organization that go around corrupt bank officers to sell their<br>customer's bank information, photo copied ID document to do fake IDs,<br>passports, and open bank accounts for them. She told me that right now just<br>because I said I'm innocent it doesn't prove anything. She need me to do one<br>last thing. She asked me how many bank account do I have and how much money<br>I have in my bank account. She said she need me to cooperate with them to<br>check my bank account to see if there's any activities transactions that are<br>unusual. She need me to go to Bankok Bank at Cecil street to TT my bank<br>account money to this "International Police" account to monitor and protect<br>my money for me as my bank account is no longer saved as anytime it could be<br>frozen. If I am really innocent and has nothing to do with any ah long<br>organization, I would cooperate with them to help them catch any party that<br>is using my account to wash black money for them. If I don't cooperate with<br>them to TT my money then it is clear to them that I have something to do<br>with ah long organization and she shall turn me over to the Judge straight<br>away to pled me guilty and sentence me. It was under so much confusion and<br>fear that they succeed to con people to TT money to this unknown<br>"International police officer" said to be someone who will monitor any<br>suspicious transactions, dealing and to save guard and protect the victim's<br>money. She assured me that if after the investigation is over about 2 hours<br>later, after they checked my account and found nothing unusual and no black<br>money, that international police officer will contact me and will TT the<br>money back into my bank account.<br><br>I was really confused and when I kept asking her for any black and white to<br>verify her identity to really make sure she is a real officer from Supreme<br>Court that she told me her name is officer Hong Mui Ying and I can reach her<br>at this Supreme Court telephone number: 63381034. She told me not to hang up<br>and not to tell anybody about what I'm about to do so that it will not mess<br>up their investigation process. She instructs me to go to 108 Cecil Street,<br>BangKok Bank to TT the money.<br>She told me to talk to her when I arrived at BangKok Bank then she would<br>disclose to me the details of the International Police to whom I am to TT my<br>money to. The following is the details she gave me to TT my bank money to<br>when I arrived at Bangkok Bank:<br>Name of person receiving the money: MOORDOO JAESH<br>Account No: 398-073768-2<br>Address: MAESAI<br><br>I almost TT one thousand dollars to this account she gave me to TT my money<br>to. But while I was at the counter, something on the inside of me tells me,<br>"how could you simply believe these things she talked to you about? How do<br>you know if she really is a Supreme Court officer? You don't even know who<br>this person she told you to TT your money to. What if this is a cheat and<br>once you TT your money over to this unknown person, you get cheated of your<br>money?"<br>So I withhold what I was about to do at that moment and started to talk to<br>this "Supreme Court officer" again on the phone. I asked her if I can go<br>down to Supreme Court and look for her to verify her identity also with<br>Supreme Court too. She told me she would be very busy as she is handling a<br>lot of such cases and may not have time to see me. She kept telling me to<br>cooperate with her if I'm really innocent and should let them check my money<br>which makes no sense to me. Finally I said to her, "I really want to go down<br>to Supreme Court to verify your identity and I don't mind waiting for you at<br>the Supreme Court. Should you be busy, I'll wait for you at Supreme Court<br>and also want to check with the officer at Supreme Court too if you really<br>are an Officer who work there." She then said, "ok, you may come down to<br>Supreme Court and look for me."<br><br>After I put down the phone, I went straight to Supreme Court to look for<br>her. To my surprise, when I was there at Supreme Court reception counter to<br>ask for this lady officer, the receptionist told me that there isn't any<br>such lady officer in Supreme Court and I'm not the only person who had came<br>down to look for or called to look for these lady officer. Then the<br>receptionist took out a recent newspaper and showed me that recently a man<br>was cheated of $10,000 also received such call claiming to be officer from<br>Supreme Court.<br><br>The Supreme Court receptionist then asked me for my name and IC number when<br>I was there at Supreme Court reception counter to check if there are any<br>real court case or charges I have. So I gave him my IC number and Name.<br>After searching through the system, he told me that he cannot find any<br>charges or court case with me. It was then I realized that I have been<br>conned by those 3 people who had impersonated to be Supreme Court staff and<br>CID.<br><br>Then the receptionist told me that it is better for me to go down to a<br>police station to do a police report on this and I went down to Kreta Ayer<br>NPP to made a police report on the same day 24/10/2007.<br>I hope the police would quickly catch these evil cheaters out there trying<br>to cheat people of their money. The police officer at Kreta Ayer NPP also<br>told me I'm not the only victim of such case. He told me I can go and read<br>about this at -<br><a href="http://www.spf.gov.sg/mic/2007/071018_supcourtphonescam.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spf.gov.sg/mic/2007/071018_supcourtphonescam.htm</a></blockquote></span></div>
