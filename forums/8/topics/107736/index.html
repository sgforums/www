            <div class='col-md body'><br>Your opinion is your opinion. Friends and people make their own life choices. You can advice, worry and care until cows go to the moon but know that they will do what pleases them at that moment.<br>But if its none of your business, why do you care. I have people who I work with who have funny backgrounds but its work. I have friends who look me up when they need help but I cannot ask them for anything if I need help. So its like this, its your choice as well to say or not to say. Put it across mildly if you want and never get involved. If you must, draw a line you do not want to know their lives too much. Other than that, as the other members suggest, if it makes you ncomfortable, then reduce or avoid contact. There are 2 folds in this. reducing contact will already indicate your message that you do not want involvement and that would help you not have to deal with your feelings about this person. The other aspect is that whenever these kind of life choices always, always, always have issues/problems at the end, and I tell you, please do not ever get caught up in them cause anyways, you have nothing to do with it. Besides, do you want to keep consoling a person or always being the person to clean up your friend's sh|t? You have enough of your own issues to go around saving other people's and people like this are not shy about loading their friends with their issues. Friendship like this is not worth your time.<br><br>Anyways, good luck. Bear in mind its just a friend. You can always make new ones and you must always remove old enegry sapping ones. You always have a choice in many things... Choose wisely.<br><br></div>
