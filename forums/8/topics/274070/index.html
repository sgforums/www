            <div class='col-md body'>From my layman point of view, there are low risk investment and high risk investment.<br><br>I think the in-thing now is the unit trust kind of stock which speculate on a few shares to equate out the money so as to minimise loss. If you are generally more conservative type, you can just earn interest rate by pouring your money into bank. Bank also offer other types of investment which you might want to take a look. Anyway, buying insurance is also a form of investment cum saving.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

Like what others have said earlier, there are low/high risk investments, depending on your risk appetite, choose those which suits you best. Generally speaking, it's wise to choose those low risk investments when you are much older. As for stocks, don't chase the prices.
