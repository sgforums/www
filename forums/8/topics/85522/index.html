            <div class='col-md body'>bluff ppl again!!!<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">from CNA/TODAY..........</span><br><br><strong>Better wages not expected in Singapore</strong><br><br>SINGAPORE : Now that the economy appears to have moved into high gear, what is in store for employees?<br><br>Is the economic well-being likely to translate into better wage packets for employees this year, either in terms of bonuses and increments or simply in the form of a restoration of wages cut when the economy was depressed?<br><br>Not really, seems to be the answer from the private sector.<br><br>Said Mr Lawrence Leow, president of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (Asme): "Not all sectors have recovered. For example, the retail and construction industry are still not performing that well. Bonuses and wage restorations would depend on how well the company performs, not on the general economy."<br><br>Since the National Tripartite Conference on Wage Restructuring in January, Asme has been helping its members revamp their wage systems.<br><br>"What most companies are doing now is taking the opportunity to introduce a flexi-wage package in their systems. So, any 'restorations' would be built in as a flexible component," said Mr Leow.<br><br>In a Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) survey in May after the National Wage Council (NWC) recommendations, 15 per cent of 300 companies said they would continue to freeze wages.<br><br>The rest responded in line with the NWC's recommendations for sustainable wage increments, indicating that they would award at least a one-per-cent wage increment this year.<br><br>The median wage adjustment was found to be three per cent.<br><br>"In this sense, we can say that wages are being gradually and moderately increased," said Mr Koh Juan Kiat, SNEF executive director.<br><br>However, Mr Koh was wary of using the term wage "restoration" in the private sector.<br><br>He explained: "The term 'restoration' may point towards bringing wages back to the same level as before. This is usually not the case in the private sector. It is more a process of restructuring now.<br><br>"When wages are cut, any increments are given from that new base and on the basis that the company can afford that amount on projected company performance," Mr Koh said.<br><br>"Any bonuses would then be calculated from real company performance."<br><br>Even within the manufacturing sector, recently described as "upbeat" after the post-Sars lull last year, raises have been neither common nor bountiful.<br><br>A Singapore Manufacturers' Federation survey of 53 companies in May found that only 27 companies, or 51 per cent, followed the NWC recommendations. Of those companies, only four gave increments of more than 4 per cent of wages. Five companies even cut wages â€” two of these by more than 4 per cent.<br><br>Nevertheless, manufacturing sector employees can look forward to bonuses, albeit small ones.<br><br>Forty-three companies, or 81 per cent, plan to pay variable bonuses. Of these, 29 companies would pay a maximum of one month's wages, 12 between one and two months, while only two expect to be able to pay a bonus of more than two months.<br><br>"Everyone's being cautious," said Dr Chua Hak Bin, senior regional economist at DBS Bank.<br><br>"But it's justifiably so because you can't be sure about the outlook. Growth has become a lot more volatile. It depends on your industry and there are external factors to consider like higher interest rates, China's slowdown and oil prices."</div>
