            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">Once the fares go up, they will never go down....the ruling party made us the promise during their last election that this will not happen, but they did not keep their word.  Yes, there was SARS and there were tsunamis and there was the war in Iraq.....but having such disasters make it even more important that the ruling party help our lower income citizens (who have been hit hardest by mass retrenchments and wage cuts....which till now have not been restored unlike our ministers' salaries) by NOT RAISING PRICES.  The correct thing to do should be LOWERING PRICES to help our heartland compatriots who slog daily to make ends meet.<br><br>But this issue is not just about money.  It is about moral principles.<br><br>It is immoral to squeeze more $ out of the people when the transport company is making obscene profits amounting to millions.<br><br>It is immoral to waste so much money building grand structures (which are ultimately WHITE ELEPHANTS) but refusing to lay aside that same amount to help families in dire straits overcome poverty....the kind of poverty that (in one instance) ended tragically in a man being burnt to death in his flat because he was using oil lamps/candles due to his inability to pay the electric bills.<br><br>And it is immoral to break promises to the citizens who supported and trusted you....    </span><br><br></div>
