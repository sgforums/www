            <div class='col-md body'>Well ,i think its quite ridiculous that they did that to her guestbook. Those racist deserved to be shot!!! Ok, i may sound a bit extreme but i'm really pissed off by those damn racists. Who the hell do they think they are!!!!!!<br><br>To Theychosenone:<br>The Asian pride thing and the alternating caps offended them? I dun think so. U must remember that they are racist. I'm an Chinese and i'm proud to be a Chinese and an Asian. Does that makes me a racist? NO!! I have lots of Malay and Indian frens and we got along very well. Sensitive? What abt us??? We get offended by those racist remarks too!!!!  On the alternating caps, i think they are quite cute. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes. But each individual has the right to express him/herself the way he/she want. No one should force him/her to do it the way they like.<br><br>Juz wanted to say those racists deserve to disappear from the surface of the world. I know this is a bit extreme and radical, but i can't stand racist!!!!! Well my christmas wish...... I wish that KKK, r33t and the other racists, esp those American racist, will be struck by lightning, knock down by cars, drowned by mudslides.......!!!!!<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mind,<br>You have shown precisely why I do not want to further elaborate on the Asian pride thing and the so-called "Afro-American" language used in the alternating caps language by the girl. Racism is a darn sensitive issue, and I do not want to pinpoint anyone that they are racist or something, for fear some of our foreign friends here(is there any??) will take offense. It's a sad part of society, I mean, I can say that the yellow smilie symbols used in this forum is racist due to it's reference to "yellow-skinned people" or anything under the sun for that matter!! I'm not implying it's correct or not, so relax pal. The sad fact is, once a person doesn't like you, he or she will take offence at ANYTHING you do. Anyway racism is as sensitive an issue as religion, thus my choice not to say much. I do really feel sorry about the girl's website being ruined.<br>Oh btw, I'm chinese. hahhahaha<br>I do feel sad about the person who said in the newspaper he wanted to be a ang-moh though...but obviously he's one of the rare few "wannabes"<br><br>------------------<br>"And when my love for life is running dry, you come and pour yourself on me"--- David Gates</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wAH LIAOW IS ALL i CAN SAY....giff ASians a bad image and she tok about asina pride yet she talks like she's black.  What bullshit is this.?<br><br>ah hell her guest book cannot accomodate everything I typed....so I type here...at least u people know how I feel about it.<br><br>To the owner of the website....I have a few complaints bout this site...one is that you talk about asina pride, yet u speak here on this page as if you were a black Ghetto Boy or Girl...What gives here?<br><br>If you are really so proud to be asian, then make an asian site that leans towards your culture and the goods things about it.  I don't know who you are because your images don't load and I can't read your text properly, but whatever your race, please don't use the words"Asian Pride"...I find it offensive...as offensive as those KKK fucks who gangbang each other everynight.  By using those words, you put yourself into their territory and pride is gone....the pride shouldn't be about getting shout outs from other asians....Pride is about having respect for your values as a group and most importantly as an individual...and remembering that there are other value systems out there. So please try and find another way of putting your Asian-ness across and get rid of the ghetto talk...It's really unbecoming of an asian.<br><br>yes, i am an Asian(what race?..does it matter)....and i am American....I love America and I love Asia...<br><br>What do I hate?....I hate fuckers who post racist shits here...i hate the KKK who have nothing better to do than fuck their own sisters and breed even more sodomizing young boys who breath the KKK credo.  I hate ignorant assess and white trash who obviously haven't gone to school and learned any history.......Basically i hate racist people!!!!<br><br>Most of you don't even know what racism is...Everyone is a target of racism...asians are racist to black, blacks are racist to whites, whites are racist to blacks....etc etc...(u get my drift)...<br><br>And asians have it damn hard too in America ok...It's just that the asian community isn't prone to complaining like the Afro/Amer or Hispanic community,to name a few....WE just do our own shit and that's it...we don't bother people and we hope people don't bother us....I have attended an all-white chool befoe and been the target of racism and been fucking beat up by whites for being asian...and I have also attended an all Black school and been a target for racism also...even attending schools in Aisa, i have been a target for racism.....so it's everywhere.<br><br>Just a little history to all u fucks who think Asians had no hand in building America....Who do you think built the goddamn railroad systems that ultimately made the mobilization and expansion of America possible?...a few blacks and minorites, yes, but it was the Asians...namely the Chinese...and wherever we go in America we are targets of racism...If we go to a black neigborhhod and do business we are targets.  If we go to a white neighborohod we are targets....so Don't ever say that we had it easy...<br><br>AS for those who say that whites are more intelligent than asians and have "scientific proof"-----U come to daddy and have him give u a good cum shot right down your gullet..!!!! Fucking White trash bitches to all you racists out there....(to those who aren't, cheers to you).<br><br>R33t...What the hell....u all suck dick anyway you choose...Racist fools...We americans fought fuckers like you during WWII...My Grandfather (yes he's white) fought fuckers like you and the KKK during WWII...<br><br>To those REAL AMERICANS who realise that America is a big melting pot fro everyone, join together and fight these Fascist fools once again....make sure that their racistcredo never touches anyone else.<br><br>America hates you KKK, AMerica hates you racist fuckers...don't ask us to leave...u leave....if you can't accept other races into society then you deny the very thing that makes America America......<br><br>And because one person is racist doesn't mean you retaliate with racism....if you call yourself non-racist, then don't reply with racism.<br><br>REad this and then go and suck some big fat dick, then enjoy the flavor afterwards...all you racist shits.....<br><br>LONG LIVE THE HUMAN RACE....IN UNITY!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well just to make my stand clearer, one of my buddies went to america to study and during his stay there, his professors asked him to design a webpage that introduce the culture of Singapore and guess what? Within days, the guestbook was filled with racists remarks! His webpage didn't contain any offending stuff. It juz introduce our lifestyle eg the food we have here and its was vandalised. They claim that they were from KKK( There are many racist groups out there, but i'm particularly against KKK, cos they destroyed my buddy's web page) My fren got so pissed that he took down the webpage.<br><br>To be fair, i posted the previous note immediately after i visited that guestbook. I was very pissed off by those remarks. You can say that i was angry and rash at that moment. The same thing happened to my buddy. So i may sound a little extreme in the previous post. On the alternating caps, what i mean is that even the owner of the website dun use alternating caps, the guestbook will still be vandalised.<br><br>Anyway, if one is against racism, it doesn't make him a racist. Fighting back against racist isn't called racism. This is not directed to anyone. If its sounds offending to anyone, i'm sorry , i dun mean it.<br><br>Mind</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wow!  Thanks worm....woopee!!...I haff another admirerer...:-) so happy...:-)<br><br>And just to clear up a point....the KKK don't symbolise America in any way...they are just a bunch of fools who'se parents toaught them to be like that....They have no reason whatsoever for hating any race....<br><br>And Bang...calm down buddy...:-) Racism didn't start in America....It's always been around...Asians are just as bad about being racist...as much as Westerners...You dun see much of it in Singapore because this country is good at hiding such things from the public.....:-)<br><br>The original Americans came from England...AS we know, the Europeans thought that they were God's gift to humankind...and hence their need to dominate and conquer different "uncivilised " countries and people....Europe has a long history of racism...but when u work your way and look at other races you'll see that they are just as bad...It's just that it always seems that the Americans are always more racist...I tell you that it's because their media is so damn good...too goodd I might add....:-)<br><br>Why don't we ever hear about these kinds of things coming from other countries...mainly because it's censored that's why...that's just the way it is...but it dsoesn't mean that they aren't as racist...<br><br>Like one of my previous posts, I found that Europeans are more racist than the Americans are....and China has been known to have anti-any race mentaslity most of their modern histroy...maybe throughout their history(solly I dun know China history...much)....We have examples like the Boxer rebellion where any foreigners were basically just mauled to death by china nationals(at that time period..the date eludes me)...but anyway, China still does have that bit of xenophobia and racism against any race that crosses it's borders...<br><br>And we know about our own Siingapore history with racial tension and violence....It's everywhere...racism is an equal opportunity employer...within your own race that is.<br><br>Every society has it...every club has it, every race has it, every country has it, every region has it, evry person has it in some form or another to a certain degree...<br><br>It is one of the most potent forms of evil in the world...It is hate and ignorance incarnate and it threatens to destroy every good thing that everyone else has done...<br><br>It doesn't originate from anyplace or anywhere but from every person on this planet....It stems from ignorance and intolerance and can be staved off by educating children about it when they are young...This will help to even the odds when the person decideds to judge another person based on race....<br><br>The KKK don't represent America, just like the Political party in Australia run by that woman(whatever the hell her name is) don't represent the whole or even the majority of the population and how they feel....I mean, you wouldn't want to have the image of Ahbengs spoiling the image of singapore to foreigners would you?....Wouldn't you stand up and say,"HEY!!!!  We aren't like them!!!!  We're nothing like them!!!  The Ahbengs don't represent Singapore in any way..."<br><br>Just a small example...heheh...(cause I know how u all "love" ahbengs...:-)<br><br>Abotuthe website that got trashed by the KKK...well, like I said, teh KKK don't just attack asians..they attack anyone that doesn't haff arian looks/blood...they don't care about anyone or anything...not even their own race....or even themselves....mention the KKK to any american and most ( I will dare to say that 99.9%) will telll you how much they hate the KKK.<br><br>Just like if u mention that Aussie woman to Aussies, they will apologise profusely for even having her as an Australian citizen...<br><br>and as the famous quote goes, "CAN'T WE ALL JUST GET ALONG!!!!????"</div>
