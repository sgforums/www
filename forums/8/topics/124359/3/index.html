(just my personnal thought)<br><br>very soon he will be stressed and tired out on why u are always angry with him without any good reason and it will affect his work or behavior. i say again he is not a robot but a human with his own will and thought. his heart pumps blood like urs and mine. he can be hurt too. put urself in his shoe and try to understand him.<br><br>if u are going to continue to behave the way u did, don be surprise when he leave u for another girl. by the time u come here and start crying how much u "sacrifice" for him also no use liao.<br><br>*your situation reminds me of me and my ex and i understand how ur bf feels cos i was in his shoe b4, being screamed and shout at for no apparent reason is not going to help in a relationship*</div></blockquote>tks.. dzy.... u r really unlike those ppl here who only know how to scand and dunno how to give advice... glad forums have ppl like u....<br><br>well, true that i have mood swings but dunno la..... maybe im really taking his kindness for granted! doesnt wan to but sometimes jus cant help it!! am i rite??<br><br>life is truly ironical!<br><br>thks again..</div>
