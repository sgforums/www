That's how we've stayed close &amp; loving, &amp; we seldom quarrel.  In fact, we don't have this kinda break up, begging, patch up drama which you had stated in your previous post.  I wouldn't subject him to this kinda humiliation just solely for my self-gratification nor my ego.<br><br>Perhaps YOU might find a girl like ME a disgrace to women, but the fact is, I'm Not as unhappy nor as angry as you, &amp; I find fulfilment in my relationship with my guy.<br><br>I suspect No matter what I say, you'll jump to defend youself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Eagles77,<br><br>*smiles*  If you think that describing what you've done for him is love, to me, you're sorely mistaken.<br><br>In my humble opinion, true love is learning to forgive, learning to protect, learning to support, learning to understand &amp; learning to accept your bf, warts &amp; all.  He ain't perfect, but it's very VERY obvious, neither are you.  He has accepted you, apologising, putting up with your rantings &amp; ravings, etc.<br><br>What you do for him are little BONUSES, which every girl is capable of.  What makes you special is your willingness to make him smilez, Not willingness without hesitation, whatsoever, to make him miserable.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by eagles77:</div><div class="quote_body">so mc, how do u define love??<br><br>i myself oso dunno?? it is due to previous failed relationships??? or am i jus finding an excuse to myself so i wont get hurt!<br><br>i only know i feel like seeing him when he's not around, i like toking to him on the phone when he's not around and when im free, and sha jiao to him so he will saiyang me.. i like to give him surprises and plan everything in advance like his coming birthday, etc... surprise him at his wk place, sometime pop out a present on no occasions, i know he'll always be there for me but anger takes over when he gives me the feeling that tis isnt true! sometimes i ask myself if im too sensitive!<br><br>im not afraid of losing him, but tis doesnt mean i wont treasure...<br><br>so is tis love?</div></blockquote></div>
