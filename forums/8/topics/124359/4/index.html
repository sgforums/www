            <div class='col-md body'>How can someone be nice to you when your post is full of vulgarities and such. Even I would be a tad pissed/turned off by the way you react to your bf for over such a minor matter. Morever, it's not very good for your well being and you might also unknowingly, turned into an emotional bully. (whoa,I pity your bf for living in 'hell') Instead, your post seemed to be attracting 'enemies' instead of friends.</div>

Mobile Phone Incident:  There may be many reasons he forgot to call, &amp; this shouldn't be counted as a stupid mistake, it's understandable.  How would you feel if your mobile phone was stolen?  Wouldn't you be more concerned about getting a new phone?  He might need it for his work, having his boss &amp; customers calling him &amp; getting a "The Singtel mobile is switched off.  Please, try again later".  Instead of being understanding, you had let rip at him, &amp; you were still fuming after he'd apologised to you.<br><br>2.  The Drinks Incident:  What he's done is "instinctive".  You shake your head, logical reaction is to empty the cup!  Do you have gold in your mouth such that you can't open it &amp; tell him, "Later, Not now", or "Save some for me"?<br><br>That's why I agreed with Bismarck.
