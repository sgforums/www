              won't be at all surprise  if the SMU comes up with a new innovative  module 606  Strategic Sex in Sales?Marketing. The three "celebrities" of the  SCDF  case  would make good guest lecturers!
              Sub topic 606 A:  Calling tenders with loving care?
              Sub topic  606B:  Let the client think you're simple and naive?

              Actually there are people who think that way, like you  and are against over development and strving too hard. Well again individuals do have a choice as  oppose  a country as a whole.  As a country,  it is logical to move forward and strive for growth, as you got to worry about survival of the next generation always . As individuals , if you really feel so strongly that  cancer is getting to you , you can always move to Batam or Bintan or Acheh or Mynamar or Vietnam....to enjoy the kampong life, if it helps you .But it would not be realistic to expect Singapore to move back to the leisurely kampong days,  right? We all have choices, it is a question of exercising our choice.

              Frankly , I see you  as one very unhappy person who narrates the so called problems you think exist only in Singapura but  you have not really offered any  alternative solutions to all these cancerous problesm you talk about. Very convoluted this is bad that is bad nthing is good kind of a description. i can't help but feel that only those who are either very old and tired or those who can't keep pace with growth  talks that way.

              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p><strong>By ALVIN FOO </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TACKLING the global economy's woes is not a simple choice between austerity and stimulus measures, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said yesterday.</p>
              <p>  The key to resuming normal, self-sustaining growth lies, rather, in creating a bridge between the two approaches.</p>
              <p>  'Either extreme - of austerity for long-term benefit or stimulus for short-term benefit - will be ineffective,' he said in his keynote address at the Economic Conference 2012. German Chancellor Angela Merkel also spoke at the Berlin event.</p>
              <p>  Mr Tharman's comments came just a day after a huge bailout of Spanish banks failed to quell market fears that Europe's debt crisis could spiral out of control.</p>
              <p>  The minister noted that the traditional ways of providing short-term stimulus worked during the early stages of the global financial crisis in 2008 to 2009, but have little credibility left.</p>
              <p>  'They are unlikely to stimulate private investment, which is essential for any return to normal growth,' he said.</p>
              <p>  On the flip side, Mr Tharman explained that concentrating on fiscal austerity and long-term structural reforms will also risk failure.</p>
              <p>  Although they offer the prospect of long-term growth, there is the risk of things going 'badly wrong' over the next two to three years.</p>
              <p>  That could mean weak demand and a loss of innovation and investment, he warned.</p>
              <p>  'People must start to see something in the short to medium term that gives them hope in what the long term will bring,' said Mr Tharman.</p>
              <p>  'We must therefore create a bridge between the need for fiscal austerity and structural reforms on the one hand, and the need to create demand and increase the likelihood of a return to normal growth and collective progress within a few years.'</p>
              <p>  This can be achieved by bringing 'the long-term agenda into the short term'.</p>
              <p>  'We have to accelerate and frontload initiatives that increase productivity and the long-term potential of our economies in a way that puts people back into work and creates demand in the short term.'</p>
              <p>  He highlighted the need to invest 'early and aggressively' in skills and infrastructure needed for industries to grow and unemployment to be brought down.</p>
              <p>  Incentives for private investment to play a part in these areas must be maximised.</p>
              <p>  In the European context, there has to be a greater urgency to open up and deregulate the market for services to spur demand and offer more opportunities for companies in the European periphery.</p>
              <p>  Mr Tharman noted that discussions are already under way in Europe and the United States on ways to get private investors involved in national projects on infrastructure and training.</p>
              <p>  He also stressed the need to retain an activist state, to 'preserve our social compacts and mitigate inequalities, and help our societies navigate and make the most of the winds of globalisation'.</p>
              <p>  Mr Tharman noted that tough choices will need to be made on the composition of fiscal adjustments, adding that investing in skills and capabilities is crucial, given the high unemployment in several societies.</p>
              <p>  Another critical task is to prepare for the consequences of 'unprecedented demographic shifts'. He noted: 'We have to avoid the prospect of generational conflict, between a growing generation of retirees and the diminishing cohorts of younger workers that will have to shoulder an increasing burden.'</p>
              <p>  Germany's Dr Merkel has long advocated a mix of austerity and structural reforms, especially for struggling European nations such as Greece and Ireland.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, she said that Europe's heavily indebted countries must push ahead with structural reforms to get their economies back on track, and must not rely on government spending to foster growth.</p>
              <p>  'It would be absolutely wrong' not to pursue the path of reforms, she stressed.</p>
