              what makes you think that's the solution? There is absolutely no guarantee you might get a new team of politicians  that promises more but gives you even less. Do you honestly believe that politicians are in politics for the SOLE altrusistic notion of bettering your life?

                  Yes no venture no gain but  venture also must be  prepared for heavy losses. And sometimes( like in business) when the loss is so great - you just can't re- coup the loss and recover again. Is that the kind of risk Singaporeans are prepared to take ? Has the present circumstances for the ordinary S'porean become so bad,  that such a venture seems  the only alternative? Is there no way to challenge established views and hope, lobby and work for change from  within a ( by all global observation)  rather  comparatively competent  and efficient government by global standards?

There are people with wealth accumulating acumen and people without. Those without are berating themselves as victims and blaming the government. They are free to choose their course of action. They are free to do what they want for themselves. But they choose to take it easy and before they know it they lag behind in accumulating wealth.

Each spend a little, and the thousands of people would have spend millions, this millions goes to thousands of enterpreneurs, and then it goes to their workers and themselves. Money is circulated. If the same money is circulated without the pool increasing, There would be a deficit. As consumables would be expended and the same money would be buying less and less. There must be growth in wealth, so that people keep on spending,  as they keep spending the shops, the enterprises, and services survive.</p>
              <p>It is a vicious cycle, and the cycle can either be ever widening (increase wealth) or shrinking ( getting poorer and poorer).</p>
              <p>It is up to the individual to be responsible for himself, or let the state take care of him. For the later, North Korea would be a good country, provided he behaves according to state dictates. </p>

                  In any country i suppose there will be the  so called"unrealistic spoilt brat " group that expect  the government to rain money on them. Or that they also must live in the Istana  and have caviar for breakfast. BUT  there will be those genuininely in need and who do deserve a helping hand.  The problem here is that those who sometimes really deserve and need help  are either  1) unaware of how to get that help  or 2) feel embarassed about  getting help. It is important also for those giving the aid not to undermine the dignity and self worth of those who need the aid. In other words :" reach out and identify them ,,,don't wait for them to gasp for help before doing anything!"

              <p>there is a growing, albeit scary trend, of corporate prostitution - so called improving the high living, and feeding materialistic vanities of our times.</p>
              <p>Worse, some feminists have been trying hard to justify the necessity of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sex and success</span></strong> that they should go hand in hand...what more could be the greatest of dangers than such thoughts? All succumbing to the high and higher materialistic culture of our society? And as if men were living life with a wink and nudge in this matter? Well, at least men are apologetic than those women who ran away from facing the problem.</p>

                      <p>there is a growing, albeit scary trend, of corporate
                      prostitution - so called improving the high living, and feeding
                      materialistic vanities of our times.</p>
                      <p>Worse, some feminists have been trying hard to justify the
                      necessity of <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">sex and success</span></strong> that
                      they should go hand in hand...what more could be the greatest of
                      dangers than such thoughts? All succumbing to the high and higher
                      materialistic culture of our society? And as if men were living
                      life with a wink and nudge in this matter? Well, at least men
                      are apologetic than those women who ran away from facing the
                      
                      
                      problem.</p>
                      <p>Besides taking my hats off for such feminists with such
                      dangerous thoughts without due consideration for society at large
                      than self serving and justification of their own materialistic
                      vanities, how would we continue with the character development of
                      our children but let them be influenced helplessly to such
                      thoughts? </p>
                      <p>Economic well being and scorecard has forgotten to include the
                      other side of the story..The Growing Concerns of Corporate
                      Prostitution of Our Times.....</p>

                      Hello why don't you start a new topic : Corporate Prostitution-is this necessary for Business Growth? The new paper wrote about  some Taiwanese  girl (politician) advising our three local SCDF case "celebrities" how to deal with their noterity /fame! Looks like some  media people as well as women groups seems to think it is  quite OK. The women involved wanted growth in their companies so that there will be growth in their income and thus growth in their live style. Ethics and morals  didn't count in the overall equation.

              <p><br>In any country i suppose there will be the so called"unrealistic spoilt brat " group that expect the government to rain money on them. Or that they also must live in the Istana and have caviar for breakfast. BUT there will be those genuininely in need and who do deserve a helping hand. The problem here is that those who sometimes really deserve and need help are either 1) unaware of how to get that help or 2) feel embarassed about getting help. It is important also for those giving the aid not to undermine the dignity and self worth of those who need the aid. In other words :" reach out and identify them ,,,don't wait for them to gasp for help before doing anything!"</p>
