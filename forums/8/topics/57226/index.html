            <div class='col-md body'>by Michael Bloombird<br><br>The Prime MinisterÂ’s Office announced today that even though they might be more expensive than US and Australian workers, Singapore workers still delivered Â‘value for moneyÂ’.<br><br>The announcement was part of an attempt to stem a tsunami of criticism over the analysis which focuses simplistically on seemingly high wages, with scant consideration of other influential factors such as the high cost of living and also bloated government overheads.<br><br>Said Prime MinisterÂ’s Office spokesman Mr. Cheng Hu Kong, Â“We intend to get companies to focus less on how expensive our workers are, and to look more at how much they can deliver compared to the workers in other countries. We will emphasise to the world that despite our seeming high labour costs, we deliver much more.Â”<br><br>Mr. Cheng likened a Singaporean worker to a McDonaldÂ’s Happy Meal.<br><br>Â“With a Singaporean worker, youÂ’re not just getting a lump of ground meat, even though thatÂ’s essentially what youÂ’re paying for,Â” he explained. Â“You get all sorts of extra things to play with too.Â”<br><br>For instance, the average Singaporean worker comes with much more than labour skills. He or she also brings to the workplace many Â‘extrasÂ’:<br><br>1. Singaporean workers can shoulder more of a burden than other countriesÂ’ workers. Why, just look at the monkeys theyÂ’ve been supporting all this while.<br><br>2. Singaporean workers can add more revenue streams to your company. For instance, start a coffeeshop in your workplace. Your Singaporean workers, who have been habitualized into taking at least two tea breaks daily, will reimburse part of your payroll expenses by buying your snacks and beverages. If you want to make more, sell bubble tea and kaya toast.<br><br>3. When you pay for a Singaporean, youÂ’re not just paying for the individual worker alone. YouÂ’re also paying for what went into crafting his abilities. Imagine: you thought you were getting just a $35 a day trained ape, and instead, youÂ’re also getting the benefit of several millionaire Ministers! Surely a bargain!<br><br>Mr. Cheng ignored a question from someone in the audience who asked, Â“So youÂ’re saying Singaporeans are like Hello Kitty, ah?Â”, referring to the famous cartoon/toy with no mouth.<br><br>The above report is from talkingcock.commmmmm~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
