            <div class='col-md body'>i just thought of a theory and wanted to test it out a little.. comments anyone??<br><br>everyone's heard of people being 'rejected', ie he/she professed his/her love but the crushee did not reciporcate. i think, a major problem is, [im gonna start referring to guys here since im a girl and this 'theory' mainly relates to guys] guys usually spring the question a little too fast. by telling us out right that you like us, you're actually forcing us to make a decision NOW! don't you think it's a little unfair? especially if you haven't given the poor girl any prior warning. which is, IMHO, the main reason why many guys are 'rejected'. if you like a girl, it's admirable if you actually have the guts to go up to her and 'confess' but don't expect too much. firstly, the poor girl will probably be too stunned and astonished to react. secondly, if she's unprepared, she probably hasn't given it much thought. thirdly, you're actually forcing her to make a decision there and then about your 'relationship', and if she doesn't even know you, what kinda choice is that? even if the girl's interested in you, she probably isn't TOO sure of how deep this interest goes, and to be on the safe side she'll probably say no...<br><br>my point is? i honestly don't know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> perhaps it's just that guys, when you like a girl, go slow. never say it outright unless you're sure the girl is ready. or else, you may have spoilt the chance of a relationship really developing by nipping it in the bud.<br><br>does anyone agree with this? disagree? i'm half asleep so do pardon me if there's lots of errors everywhere.. *yawn*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. I do agree that at times guys tend to be slightly too anxious to know how a girl feel about them. At least they know if they are wasting their time and money on her or not. Anyway, it's mission impossible to understand how a girl's heart feel.<br><br>The guy might feel that the girl had been quite nice to him and it's kinda human nature to wonder if she really likes him, and the only way to find out is of coz to confess his fondness. To try and to fail is always better to not try and regret.<br><br>Being too direct too soon might also spolit the relationship, but for guys out there who had done it and regret, do not give up. She might reject you once or twice.. but if you feel that she is just the one, go all out, even at the risk of the 3rd time strike out. If she reject you and yet willing to be friend with you, it might be that she is still not prepared. Give her more time and yourself more time also to know each other better.<br><br>It's not the number of times you fail that count, it's the only success that matters.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>err...What is IMHO?<br><br>I think the best way to confess your love is, you try to get her tel no. or something, just dun tok to her face to face, later embarassed. Then say, "I like you a lot" or something, then say, "I'll give you 2 weeks to consider me.", or something similar.<br><br>This should increase your chances of being accepted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO == In My Humble Opinion<br><br>I don't feel that it's too fast if the guy is just expressing his feelings for the girl.<br>The girl doesn't necessarily have to make a decision now and then. Should the girl like the guy in return, then revealing your attraction early is no problem at all.<br><br>Timing is a major part of the dating process, too fast and you might scare the other person off, too slow and the other person might just be snatched away by someone else. No offense to anyone but I think that taking your time in a relationship is bullshit.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone....<br><br>Well, i think that for a guy to tell a girl that they like them in the beginning is normal.<br><br>From my experience and other friend who has been in the battle of BGr, their advise is to tell the girl noe u like them and they will "TAKE NOTE" of you.  I agreed with it as i feel tht i got quite a few good gal friends who have been talking alot over the phone. Sometime they called me and we just chat like friend.For wht i knoe they treated me with respect and as a good friend, if i am to just keep thing this way nothing will happen. Instead, if i have told them tht i like them in the first place...things might be different.  But as for my case, since the gals have been treating u as good friend even if they have feelings for u in the beginning, they might not have it noe anymore.  U got to tell them when u'll first knoe them your fondness for them so tht they will not slowly treat u as friend but as one of their suitor and the chance of going after the gals are better....<br><br>If guys are to wait for a few mths b4 reacting...things will be different and the chance of going after the gals will be lesser. unless u tell me tht the gal have special chemical factor towards u...then this will be a different story.....U can be sure tht both of u can be friend for some time b4 gonig into a BGR.  But for most cases, like me lor, where guys are just normal or average looking, we got to let them knoe in the beginning......Only then do they start monitoring u.....<br><br>But i think tht maybe the ways guy expressing their likeness might be a factor where they tend to scare gals off..they might be too direct and want an answer immediately which i can is too absurb.  Maybe they can let the gal knoe their feeling towards the other party.  I think this is a better way of expressing your fondness for certain person.  Let her knoe your feelings and she will decide for herself whther both of u can be together..These may take time and i personally feel tht most important is for both of u to be together and dont' treat this as a rejection from the gal.  The gal need to knoe their suitors b4 committing into a BGR.<br><br>In conclusion, i feel tht it's alright to let the other party knoe tht u like them in the beginning stage to let them prepare themselves...But we should be careful of how we express of feelings to them...This might be an important factor in deciding the guy's "fate"....Just my 2 cents worth of idea...*wink*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>will guys actually be happy if girls send them flowers?? thought flowers are for ladies..<br><br>just a personal experience...not really related to whether guys should go slow or fast in approaching girls...but when i was in JC..i had a crush on a guy, but when the guy started paying attention to me and showed some interest in me, I lost my interest in him. I wonder why, since he didnt really do anything to make me dislike him, however, the "crush feeling" wasn't there anymore once he approached me. Anyone has a possible explanation for this?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>one from the guys:<br>if let's say I know you and we start off as frens, but I actually like you from the beginning.  after a while as frens, say 2 to 3 months, I tell you I like you.  but b'cos you never have feelings for me, you decided to reject me.  don't you think it's harder to turn down a fren than an acquaintance?<br><br>and anyway, I'm sure girls can tell when guys are interested in them, whether frens/acquaintances.  I never believe in that sincerity stuff b'cos, you mean that if I were so nice to you, and am sincere in my intentions, you would actually be my gf?  I say that's crap b'cos when I was younger, I tried that and I failed miserably.  so girls pls dun b.s. abt sincerity or being frens or whatever.  I dare say that where it comes to feelings and relationships, girls are more selfish.  being frens lah or whatsoever are merely excuses that you don't like someone.  (somewhat hypocritical, rite?!!)  but when you like someone so badly, you'll basically fly to that person at the hint of a date or whatever (literally fall on their laps).<br><br>girls are basically never totally honest about their feelings.  guys tend to be more 'gan ai gan heng'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Femmebot, I find myself quite stubborn about these things.  If I fancy a guy, if he says he likes me right at the beginning I would have been happy to say yes right away, or at least tell him truthfully that I am interested but I want to test the water further or whatever.  If I don't fancy him, however, he can wait for years and the answer will still be the same, even though we've been good friends.<br><br>Speaking of good friends, I get the impression that guys see it in a different way than girls.  Guys see it as a waiting period or a chance to prove their lasting interest while the uninterested girls see it as the alternative of getting out of each other's life forever, true???<br>If a guy has said to a girl, "It's okay you do not feel that way about me, let's be good friends instead" and at the same time thinking that he may still have a chance to show her his feelings further, isn't he the one who's being untruthful?<br><br>If i confess my crush to a guy and he rejects me, I'm prepared to leave him alone if that makes both of us more comfortable.  I won't even ask a second time around either because as far as I am concerned, he should have considered carefully (this is a very important stuff) before answering me and if he changes his mind, it should be his turn to 'fess up.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with mayajade... i guess it's not only a matter of how soon you tell her, but also how. i think for most girls, a no usually remains a no. and the thing is, we really DO want to remain friends! i never got this part about guys... there are guys who have told me they liked me, but when i told them that it's impossible (largely 'cos the FEELING isnt there. ie i don't like them) an automatic reaction is i get cut off. they totally ignore/dao/pretend i don't exist. either that, if we remain friends, they seem to think there's still a chance/im just playing coy/it's a greenlight to go ahead and tt i still like them. what gives??!! is it so hard to accept that we're only going to be frends? or is this part of the whole 'guys and girls cannot be platonic friends' phenomenon?<br><br>hobbes:<br>i don't see how girls are being hypocritical when they say they want to remain friends. if i don't LIKE the person (in the bgr way) it doesn't automatically mean i dont LIKE the guy as a person. if those go hand in hand, i don't think most girls will have guy friends will they? i think girls generally like to sweeten their words a little, but that doesn't make them hypocritical on a whole (unfair generalisation!! though there will always be girls who fit into this 'mold')</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a guy, I feel that its more characteristic of a guy to be direct, and not beat about the bush. Why waste time doing Ssssssoooooo many things, when you can just get straight to the point with one sentence ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>But as I was saying, guys are anxious. Oftimes, too anxious to <strong>GET</strong> an answer. I dunno.... its sorta like, really really horrible, when you know that the solution to THE mystery of your life (Well... not really.....) is soon to dawn upon you kinda feeling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I sympathize with Hobbes, since a similar circumstance happened to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Anyway, its wasn't a good situation overall. Our mutual friends I knew then where literally laughing behind my back, the gal I was interested in treated me like a sucker, (I mean, the <strong>LEAST</strong> she could do is <strong>TELL</strong> me, instead of leaving me floundering.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">) And that Sec 2 kiddo treats me like so kinda born loser. Sucky situation.<br><br>But enough about me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> None of you here deserve the horrible fate of hearing my life story, so I'll spare you.  :p<br><br>But think of things in that aspect, would a guy really DARE/WANT to remain friends with the gal ? Its sorta like a peer pressure thing, since literally, everywhere you go, her friends are gossiping about how things went. Its like, the whole wide world HAS to know, or apocalypse will come. Basically, a guy is pressured to cut off that section of despair. (In effect, cut himself off from the source of his pressure, the girl.)<br><br>While the girl may still want to be friends, think of it from a guy's point of view. Would you want to go on a constant "torture" sequence, knowing that the girl you're really really interested in, isn't interested in you ? Would you just remain friends, and looking on while she goes out with someone else, and you dream fruitless dreams of that someone being you ? Wouldn't it be better to just seal yourself away from that part of your life ?<br><br>That, at least, is sorta the impression that I have from the modern under 20s male.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) It might be different of those above 20, but since I haven't reached that age, and I don't have THAT many above 20 friends, I can't make a logical comment on that, so erm.... I'll end here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>
