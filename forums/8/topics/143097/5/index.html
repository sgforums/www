Aiyaiyai....<br><br>Which brings me to chinese gals. I have suddenly found this deep interest in chinese gals. No offence, but last time ppl used to stereotype chinese gals as being too skinny and not having any curves. You know, flat-chested, flat-bottomed, the sorts.

            <div class='col-md body'>hhmmm...tough tough tough topic....but really ar, if they have kids, then how ???? Follow which religion, if follow both religion, that's good !...But how about names ? I've a fren who told his malay gf that, no matter what, the unborn child must follow the guy side &amp; must have a surname....they would argue abt this and it will never come to a decisive decision....wah ha ha ha ! So I tell them, put 2 names lor.... Solve problem what....But the guy just think my idea was bad....<br><br>Anyway, abt one of the topic, you guys mentioned that usually the men side (malay) will have less problem marrying a chinese, indian, caucasian, eurasian,etc girl....Bcos, the guy side has more privileged &amp; freedom.....Not exactly true....<br><br>Malay men are usually the guidance, pillar &amp; strength in the family to guide &amp; teach Islamic teachings to the wife &amp; kids. This is common. This is just my views about typical malay men whom are totally devoted to his religion. So, it's toughter if he were to get married. The opposite sex must convert ! Even the malay gals also got problem. Bottom line is, it always goes back to the parents or families who have to approve &amp; give blessings to the marriage....so that's where problems arise if the parents are very conservative &amp; religious.<br><br>But in my own believes, as long as one love another and not too religious nor too conservative, they wouldn't mind gg thru a civil marriage instead.<br><br>What do u think ?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>an inter-racial couple have to go thru lots of odstacles. Be it whatever races.<br><br>I was watching one of "LOST" Episodes abt this black guy with his son lost in a jungle after their plane crashed. There's this episode abt him, his son &amp; his late ex-wife  before the crash. Before his ex-wife died, the ex-wife is getting married with a white guy and the white guy wanted to adopt the black guy son bcos, the black guy ex-wife wants the custody of the child.<br><br>One day, the black guy ex-wife died and the white guy came looking for the black guy &amp; wanted to return the child back to him !!! I was actually furious towards this white guy !!! How could you dump an innocent kid, just bcos his black-(after he decided to adopt him), back to his real dad ! The black guy said, you wanted to adopt him &amp; marry my ex-wife, why are you returning him back to me ??? The white guy said, he do it bcos, he wants the child's mother &amp; so, he has to adopt the child unwillingly ! What kind of a confession &amp; excuses is that ?!!<br><br>IMO, this guy is such a sadist ! Anyway, I tried to understand a person situation where he had to bring up a child of not his own, worst, the child doesn't follow his or her religion &amp; his of a different colour....Well, it's sure very sad to know......I can guess that, not many people will be sincere &amp; willing to sacrifice to be able to do that....<br><br>What do u think ? What will you do if your partner just left you like that with his or her child to care of ???<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think is ok lah, as long as the religion thing can be agredd within the couples. But I think it would required a lot of sincerity and understanding for inter-racial marriage, and stay together. My wife is a quater malay (from her grandparents), 3/4 chinese.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... what about a Malay girl with Chinese blood in her veins? All my life, I feel like I belong nowhere. I don't feel Malay enough to be appreciated by the Malays and I don't feel Chinese enough to be on par with the Chinese!<br><br>As I grow older, it annoys the hell out of me when people ask me about my race. I always tell them I'm Singaporean because I feel that race has become over-rated now.<br><br>In the past, when I said that I'm Malay, they said that I don't look or think like a Malay and I'd feel insulted. Did it mean that Malays are inferior? When I tell a Malay that I've Chinese blood, he'd give me a look that hints of racism.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic. I've not had any experience being emotionally involved with a Chinese guy although I've had some infatuations before. Sometimes, I wonder if it's because I'm Malay and the myth that if a non-Malay guy wants to get involved with a Malay girl, he has to convert to Muslim. I say it's a myth because I generally don't mix race and religion. Almost all Malays may be born a Muslim but many are non-practising Muslims. But that's another heated debate altogether.</div>
