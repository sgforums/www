              <p>She held her wedding at high class hotel is her biz, cannot say her wed is expensive and ask for understanding.. Wedding dinner is just for celebration. If she wants to make it grand, she must prepare to fork out more $$ and not pass the cost to the guests.</p>
              <p>Like that next time u tell her u will be holding ur wedding at outerspace, make sure she bao a super big ang bao to cover the expenses...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>Your friend is just being anal, a typical Singaporean kind of attitude. If you really invite people to your wedding, even they don't give any ang pow, by right you cannot do anything also what, you invite them, not asking them to come and eat what they pay. That's the difference.</p>

              <p>she also said that it's not the money part but as a significance of congratulation... i did include a photoframe which i gave her during the wedding dinner but she said she was disappointed that i gave her that only... she also mentioned that the wedding dinner was very expensive and asked for my understanding. (it was at Raffles Hotel and i did dropped in a red packet without my name labelled behind plus the photoframe)</p>
              <p>then she claimed that all her guests labelled their red packets so next time, when my friend attends their weddings, she will know how much to put inside the "ang pow".</p>
              <p>i would like to ask if it's a practice to label your red packets for weddings... cos' i was not taught so...</p>

              <p><br>Your friend does not have the sincerity to invite you. Its so meaningless when they invite you to their wedding just hoping you'll give them ang pows. I thought ang pows should be given from the heart and not upon request?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do have a similar occasion.</p>
              <p>While in NS, my platoon sergeant invited the whole company to his wedding dinner. But months before the dinner, he requested to collect part of the ang pow money from us. And he really go to each bunk to collect $40 from his men, joting down the names of those already made the "1st payment" in a small notebook!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And he said that those who had made the "1st payment", need to given another $20 on the actual day as a full payment. Which makes it $60 in total. And those already given $60 in "1st payment", can give a few more dollars on the actual day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He claimed that he needed money to pay for his wedding down payment!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wah, this kind of people ah... made his wedding truly meaningless!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for me, i just gave him $40 and did not attend his wedding cos i was clearing ORD leave.</p>

              <p>So people nowadays hold wedding dinner to earn money? They are just being anal. Holding a wedding dinner is to share the joy, not to have a free meal or earn some profits.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If i hold a house party, is it ethical of me to collect entrance fee? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"> Zzzz.</p>

              <p>Couples holding a wedding should not be expecting red packets in
              return. It should be done with sincerity. It is their own wedding
              afterall. All the invitations were to share the joy and happiness,
              making the whole occassion more memorable and grander. If you won't be
              able to afford it, don't do it in the first place. Register at ROM and
              hold 2 tables at kopitiam.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
