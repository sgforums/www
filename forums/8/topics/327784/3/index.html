              <p>i need a honest opinion and feedback... i'm 27 this year and chinese</p>
              <p>when you guys attend a chinese wedding, do you label your names on the red packets? i mean like normally when you arrive, you'll go to the reception area, sign in and drop your red packets into those collection boxes, do you actually label your names at the back of the red packets?</p>
              <p>no one actually taught me to do that... but i was questioned by my friend who got married and she accused me of not giving a red packet for her wedding banquet... she said she searched the boxes but didn't found my name and she had difficulties answering to her husband who was disappointed that one of her friends turned up without a red packet. she asked if i labelled my red packet and i was quite surprised... i said no and i told her that no one ever taught me to label my name, even my mum didn't taught me that...</p>
              <p>she also said that it's not the money part but as a significance of congratulation... i did include a photoframe which i gave her during the wedding dinner but she said she was disappointed that i gave her that only... she also mentioned that the wedding dinner was very expensive and asked for my understanding. (it was at Raffles Hotel and i did dropped in a red packet without my name labelled behind plus the photoframe)</p>
              <p>then she claimed that all her guests labelled their red packets so next time, when my friend attends their weddings, she will know how much to put inside the "ang pow".</p>
              <p>i would like to ask if it's a practice to label your red packets for weddings... cos' i was not taught so...</p>

              <p><br>Aiyoh, what a superficial and accusatory friend you have. I will be so ashame to associate with such little people if I were you.  Anyway as someone above say if everybody labled theirs then the one that has no lable has to belong to you right? Unless the husband was dishonest and pocket it without telling her. And then to tell you off that the wedding was expensive? What the f..k! No one ask her to hold at such high end establishment and expect every guests to suffer because of her spendthrift way. If I were you I will disassociate myself with such ass. Such people not worth calling friends. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>Nope. Give too much and you're too loaded. Give too little and you're too miserly. Why bother with unnecessary trivalties?</p>
              <p>Don't give red packets. Red packets are for seniors and aunties to give lor. You'e 27. buy them a really cool, tasteful gift and save the dilemma.</p>
