            <div class='col-md body'>Me...<br>I think u can decide cos just look at how many woman who are so independant and rich that they dun think they need a partner, while guys they are more casual in a sense, as long the character clicks, it is fine.I think basically gals, need a form of greater form of security in all aspects, physically, financially and mentality.<br><br>Cos in any case of divorce cases, usually the woman will have a greater emotional impact than guys I think.So they are more careful where marriage are concerned.Of cos, the memories of your childhood and upbringing of ur parents is vital to your developmental thinking.So,hmmm...I think woman are having more higher expectations now since they are mostly highly educated espacially in SG.But there are some exceptions too.<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>traditionally, girls are supposed to look good, be able to cook and clean the house while the guys are out working and bringing in the dough.  its only in the last few decades tat these sterotypes are broken.  however, do notice tat society still places a huge emphasis on the looks of girls (look at all those cosmetic advertisements!).  another example: look at the big hoo-ha made when HP appoints its first female CEO.  if it was a male CEO, would there be such a big fuss over it?  highly unlikely.<br><br>similarly, guys are expected to bring in the money and support the family.  society kinda places more expectations on them for their earning power.  a guy who is being retrenched or fired is likely to suffer more humilation.<br><br>perhaps this is why most guys look towards pretty girls while most girls look for guys with better earning power.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Although guys will usually use money for that kind of things (u don need mi to elaborate).. looks are also to hypnotise girls... but to girls.. character is the most important.. followed by looks... i think money would come last in rank (i am not tokking abt those sluts, but if that is offending, sorry!)

            <div class='col-md body'>Looks/bod for guys, $$$ for gals... isn't this related to the theory of evolution?<br><br>Guys look for healthy mothers to carry their children. They also look for beautiful mothers to beget beautiful children for them. Maybe that's why they are *more inclined* to go for looks and bod?<br><br>For the gals, as they are the physically weaker sex, they want stability and protection. When they're pregnant or looking after their offsprings, it's handy to have a man around to provide for them and their children and to drive away wild animals. To some women, $$$ may represent stability.<br><br>Note that I didn't say ALL men or women are like that, although I did suggest that they are *more inclined* to certain preferences.<br><br>To me, stability is important in a bf. He doesn't have to be rich. He just has to be faithful and reliable.<br><br>Of course, good looking guys attract me, but I wouldn't settle down with one who's not stable. Too many ugly memories of screaming matches and acrimonious break-ups to scare me away from unstable types.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about money to gals, how about money to guys?? How many of you guys would view the potential of the girl in term of ability to hold a good salary? Would you rather get a girl who is 80% or more dependent on you in financial term or one who can be totally independent on her own. These days, seems like if you wanna have a good life style both parties should contribute.. hence the more both can bring in the better. Views??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luf...<br>It really depends on the concept of two individuals.I do agree that contributions from both partners do give a greater stability of the family.But isn't this the modern of thinking which leads to most nurturing of the kids going haywire?? I think financial stability is indeed important but I think family stability is means more than anything.As a parent, giving your family comfort and finances are equally important to giving love and concern to your kids.<br><br>To me, I think a mother's role is to give absolute love and attention to ur your own flesh and blood. I know a childhood to a kid is very vital as it will affect his development growth from a toddler to an adult. Lots of married couples lack of family planning which includes the upbringing of the kids, which incidentally results in the kids becoming rebellious and unloved.<br><br>As a wife, giving support and encourage is very essential as the bread winner of the family wants comfort in a home.Of cos, a home cooked meal waiting for u at home is so much heart-warming than going to any high-class restaurant. Able to share the housework load is also a joy within a family.<br><br>What i am trying to say is...a woman can be career minded, capable and bring in finances to the family but I dun think a woman is capable to do all the above I have said simultaneously.Just imagine, if you are stressed at work, and she too is stressed at work, so who is going to comfort who??The kids will be the ones suffering.Parents busying working.When he is awake they are not there. When he is sleeping U all come home talking about work problems.Where there is time to think about your beloved gem?<br><br>SO I think the modern thinking of contributing finances from both individual in a family has to be re-evaluated.Think deep not only the surface.You can't have the best of both worlds.Happy and successful family or a pair successful parents with an kids who feels that he is not the child of his parents...<br><br>------------------<br>Rinoa...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with Rinoa that the dual income concept of modern families does result in the children feeling "unwanted". More often than not, the parents will be busy at work with no time at all for their kids. Wat is worse is that they still expect their children to behave well and get excellent results, while they themselves are not present when the kids encounter problems.<br><br>Looking on the flip side of the coin, there's a lot of helplessness on the part of parents oso. Have u seen a kid looking enviously upon their classmates who get to go on holidays abroad and enjoy the latest Pokeman game? Parents work hard to give their children what they wan, yet get repremanded as well for not spending enuff time with them.<br><br>So, wat's the best solution?<br><br>Marry a rich guy, then wife stay at home be tai tai and take care children (or the other way round oso possible = look for $$$!! :O)<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Luf: I totally agree that if a couple want a comfortable lifestyle, then both will need to contribute their fair share.<br><br>That said, I believe that both parents should be responsible for bringing up their children as well as the family. The recent Men's movement has brought the view that males exert a neccessary and positive input to kids, male or female. Just as both have to contribute to income, both will need to contribute to family making. If nothing, it makes things easier for both of them.<br><br>With the changing times I think women are getting more independent, so marrying is more for companionship than stability. Which is why I have to disagree that females are more affected in a divorce. Studies have shown that males fare much worse after divorce, both financially and emotionally. The reasons are complex and I can't remember them. Sorry.<br><br>I also believe that you can achieve both career and family. Of course you probably won't be able to live a life of luxury-- something will have to give if you want to put effort in work and home, but a balance between the 2 should be sought. Sure, it takes effort especially somewhere like Singapore, but so is anything else. It cannot be an excuse for sacrificing either aspect.<br><br>I'm sure the kids will know that the parents have other duties, but they have to understand that they are the main thing in the parents lives, and that is done through quality time. I think kids are more understanding and pragmatic than we give them credit for.<br><br></div>
