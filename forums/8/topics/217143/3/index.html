            <div class='col-md body'>For those with problems (eg family, self-esteem etc), perhaps it's best to seek counselling instead of blaming your parents or others for your problems.  It didn't help you in any way.<br><br>No one family is perfect.  In every negative situation, you have a choice to turn into a positive one.  Your own happiness lies in your own hands.  Do something about it like seeking counselling etc to resolve your personal issues.<br><br>I used to have many issues due to family problems too and I always felt miserable and bitter about the whole situation until one day I told myself I could do better than just sitting there feeling miserable and bitter all the time so I decided to seek counselling.  However, counselling will only help to pin-point the source of your problems, and provide helpful advice how you can overcome your problems.  You will have to be willing to help yourself at the end of the day.  Forgiveness is the key.<br><br>It's very easy for us (especially when we haven't got children of our own yet) to blame/accuse our parents for their parenting skills etc. Guess, we will only get to understand the difficulties of raising children when we become parents ourselves one day.<br><br>Also, you need to understand that most of our parents are probably not as highly educated like most do nowadays since they probably couldn't afford to attend school when they were young.  Which parents don't want their kids to prosper?  Parenting skill is not a skill you can master by hard since every child is different.  Unfortunately, our parents who are not highly educated only know the general parenting skills (such as feeding us, clothing us, providing for us and sending us to school) and don't expect them to understand child pyschology etc.<br><br>So if you think you have an issue, talk to someone (like counsellor) about it and work on it.  It doesn't do you anything good to blame others for your misery.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
