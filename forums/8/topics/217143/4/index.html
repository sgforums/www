            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by spinsugar:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;"><br>I can understand your resentment.  My mom raised my siblings and I single-handedly..She used to be very bent on developing my talents when we were still well-off.  She suddenly sent me overseas to study when I was 16.  A year into my studies, she started having probs wiring money over.  I couldn't even buy clothes for winter.  She wouldn't explain anything to me.<br><br>To my utter shock one day, I discovered that both my parents' mobile phone numbers were out of service.  Even the house phone had been cut.  Soon after, they stopped sending money.  I was left stranded alone in Australia with no way to contact them.  I didn't have any other relatives' numbers on me, and I didn't know how to tell my friends.<br><br>I found a decent job as a waitress, scrimped and saved, but it wouldn't cover all my expenses.   After 6 mths of this, I got a call from my mom.  She told me everything would be ok, that I couldn't give up hope.  I so very much wanted to believe her.<br><br>During the last year of my stay there, I stayed with kind friends.  But the money never came.  When I got sick of freeloading, I went to live in the backseat of an old car parked beside a field of horses for a few mths (if I needed to shower I sneaked into backpacker hotels or used public baths by the beach).  I finally admitted defeat when I received another call from my mom - she gave me her new ctc number - and then I got my school to cancel my visa.  Then, I was 19 going on 20.<br><br>I thought my nightmare was over, so I never saw this coming.  We had moved from fully-paid landed property to a small HDB flat.  My dad had sabotaged my mom's business and she had been declared bankrupt and forced to wind up.  No more cars, no domestic helpers, office furniture made our new HDB flat look like storage.  My mom had lost a shocking amt of weight.  She explained that she didn't tell me any of this to "protect me".. that upset me even more because I didn't understand at the time.  I couldn't take it, I moved out.<br><br>I only recently found it within myself to forgive her and rebuild my relationship with her.  I forgave my dad as well but kept my distance.  My mom wants to write a book about our family "adventures" soon, and I will translate it for her.  It's not good to hang onto these negative emotions because it stops you from going forward.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  That, and not your mom, is the only thing that can really stop you from realising your full potential.  (That's what I realised eventually).   I hope you can move on too, sometime in the near future.  All da best.</span></div></blockquote>Wa lau... why your dad like that one? man he is evil!!!<br><br>ought to be shot... man you are a veteran man... this shows that human being are capable to survive under the most extreme mental and physical conditions...<br><br>u can go OCS...<br><br>LOL  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
