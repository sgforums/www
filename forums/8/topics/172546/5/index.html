If u do anything wrong in life next time, let's see how others will show you that they are the wrong guys to be messed with.People with higher authority and power can put you down easily, even the law also can be bought, so dunt expect too much from this world. Or maybe we should see how you well can make of them. And no lies pls.</div>
