            <div class='col-md body'>The threads in here are kinda boring, so I'll start my own.<br><br>Okay, let's clear some things up first:<br><br>Capitalism: An ECONOMIC system<br><br>Democracy: A POLITICAL system<br>Communism: A POLITICAL system.<br><br>Socialism: An ECONOMIC system.<br><br>Communism, by the Engels and Marx's Communist Manifesto, called for the overthrow of capitalism. (I realize communism doesn't imply Marxism, but this is how I'm backing what I'm about to say.)<br><br>Karl Marx believed that the capitalist system, which produced the Industrial Revolution, would eventually destroy itself in the following way.<br><br>Factories would drive small artistans out of business, leaving a small number of manufacturers to control all the wealth. The large proleteriat would revolt, seize the factories and mills from the capitalists, and produce what society needed. Workers would control the government in a "dictatorship of the proletariat", as Marx termed it. After a period of cooperative living and education, the state or government would wither away as a classless society developed.<br><br>This final, classless phase is what Karl Marx called pure communism. It's what communist communist governments should work towards.<br><br>Marx's phase order.<br><br>1. feudalism and/or absolutism<br>2. capitalsim<br>3. socialism<br>4. communism/complete socialism<br><br>A reason some believe communism never worked is because every nation that had ever experienced communism didn't follow through Marx's phases correctly. Though Russia was a bit industrialized, it was for the most part still a feudal monarchy. There were serfs in Russia up until the beginning of the 20th century and far too many farmers for Russia to the move right on to the "step" of communism. Many believe communism would work, provided you industrialize beforehand.<br><br>Still, I can see how a communist system wouldn't work because it's contrary to human nature. The entire "people are lazy" is a rather clichÃ©d argument against communism, so I'm not even about to go into it.<br><br>One theoretical perspective in sociology is the conflict perspective, which follows in the tradition of Karl Marx. People who employ this perspective focus on those forces in society that promote competition and change.<br><br>According to Marx, it is capitalistm that is contrary to human nature, and communism, if done correctly, is in keeping with human nature. Marx believed that no human would choose to work, if they could do otherwise, and thus the capitalist is going against human nature by forcing the worker to work to survive. Since that capitalist controls the means of production, the completely dehumanize the worker by making him perform labour against his own desires and wishes to produce something to make the capitalist richer. Thus the worker is reduced to being only as valuable as what he can produce. So the worker is doing something dehumanizing to produce something that is not human to make someone who is not the worker richer. This is how it is against human nature.<br><br>I've been reading a lot of Marx recently, and it's very fascinating reading. I won't do a very good job conveying what Marx was saying, since Marx was a genius and a very good writer, and I am neither.<br><br>[This message has been edited by NewBWithACause (edited 17 March 2002).]</div>
