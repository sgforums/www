It boils down to good taste. If you have the figure to carry off an outfit, flaunt it. If not, there's just no point following what everyone else is wearing. There are so many other lovely swimwear designs that can flatter assets and hide flaws.  This isn't biased against those who have over generous proportions. Even ultra skinny gals can look quite hideously frightening in the wrong choice of bikini  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Whether it is to wear a bikini or not to wear one. If wearing the bikini is functional - then hell, one needs to subscribe to a function, one just gets used to it, bo bian.

Whether it is to wear a bikini or not to wear one. If wearing the bikini is functional - then hell, one needs to subscribe to a function, one just gets used to it, bo bian. But if the reason why one is doing something sooooo stressful to ownself is to project any external image -The little bits of spandex isn't going to help you.<br><br>I mean as the song goes - itsy bitsy teeny weeny yellow polka dot bikini - how the girl is so shy she just sorts of scuttle from one hiding place to another.<br><br>so instead of having a good relaxing time at the pool/beach, it becomes a waste of time cos too aware of how u look, how people think u look. is it a worth while price to pay?</div></blockquote>true also, so hope that limahkow wld have the confidence to do that, cheers to you..life is too short to care wat others see you or look at you</div>
