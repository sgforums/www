That also explains why you're horny when you see chairs with 5 legs.<br>A person whom most people dislikes due to your character problem, you help others realize that there is actually something called a stupid plus idiot plus moronic retard in Singapore. Look at the mirror to get the definition of the words.<br>I bet you are waiting anxiously for some positive things about you, so here it goes...
