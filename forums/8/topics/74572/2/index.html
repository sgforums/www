            <div class='col-md body'>This is a quite a long passage to read.<br>My Fren (Fren A) n I planned a "suicide case" as an April Fool joke on my another fren (Fren B).<br><br>First it was like that, Fren A prepared the "props" and we planned the dialogue properly.<br><br>At about 8.40pm, he called Fren B, "Fren B, I'm feeling very stressed about all the work, I feel like jumping down now." Fren B was like got a shock, and she say "Don't scare me leh..." Fren A then told her "You take care ar..." and then there was the sound of wind blowing(which he blows it himself to the mic of the phone), and came a PLOP sound(made by the books fallen off from the table), and the phone goes "toot~ toot~..."<br><br>Fren B was very scared and she call around asking people, I sms her ask her why Fren A was talking weirdly and sounds like having suicide thoughts. Fren B called me and ask me, then I (rub salt into the wound) and told her, "Maybe he's like Leslie Cheung, committed suicide on April Fool's day and everyone didn't believe that it was the truth." Fren B was really scared now, and she sounds like she's going to cry. After quite some time, we hung up. And I called Fren A, and we both laugh hysterically! Hahahaha!!<br><br>Fren B actually go around calling like around 4-5 people asking them about it and no one seems to know about it, and as she asked a person (Fren C), Fren C told her to ask me if I heard the sound of Police Car. I said no. I called Fren A again, and he said, "How about this, let's make things worse la, you tell them you heard the sound of police car after sometime."<br><br>Then we were like discussing about how do we carry on this APRIL FOOL's joke till the next day in school. We plan that Fren A would arrive in school later than normal, after Fren B's duties is over and drag this April Fool's day joke till Recess.<br><br>At about 10.10pm+ I sms Fren B, I told her in a very agitated tone, "OMG!!! I HEARD THE SOUND OF THE POLICE CAR!!! HOW?! LET'S PRAY THAT ALL THIS IS A COINCIDENCE!!" She replied, "O no.. stay calm.. dun make mi scared.. omg.. I very scared now.."<br><br>Fren C sms me and asked, "Did you hear the sound of the ambulance?" I replied, "Got! I heard eee yor eee yor sound donno is police car or ambulance!!" She was like "omg..."<br><br>The next day I went to school, I reached the front gate, and prepared myself for the whole act, as I walked to the assembly area, I saw Fren B crying there! I sat there ask her, "Fren A hasn't reached yet?" She didn't answer and kept sobbing. I was thinking, "this is a really serious matter..." and I went to the toilet to call Fren A and ask him to come to school now.<br><br>Fren B was still crying when she was doing her duties which was at the front gate. When the national anthem and pledge ended, Fren A reached school, and Fren B hit him hard! Hahahaha...<br><br>She was really angry at us for the whole morning because she worried for the whole night and didn't slept at all and she cried so much, but we eventually patched up after school. This was such a FUN April Fool's joke I ever played on a friend!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> It was like a 12hours drama!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
