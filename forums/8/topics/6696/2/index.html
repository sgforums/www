            <div class='col-md body'>Instead of hurrying to decry it as another hypocritical gesture by the government even before the speaker's corner is implemented, perhaps we ought to take it in a more positive light. It may have taken a long time and much hemming and hawing, but it's arriving nonetheless. How well it will go is anyone's guess, but it is a step in the right direction. Let's not lose sight of that because of some niggling doubts about restrictions and criminal prosecution.<br><br>Some of the most vocal individuals who complain about it in this forum have apparently not given it much thought. These people are the type that will abuse a totally uninhibited system. Restrictions are meant to rein in the irresponsible.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well so far everyone has been concentrating on the speakers for the Speaker's Corner. But what about the audience? If the Speaker's Corner turns out to be a flop, it may be because there is no one who is interested enough to listen to what the speakers have to say.<br><br>Are Singaporeans that eager to have a Speaker's Corner in the first place? Yes, because we can air our views, speak our mind and blah blah. Anyone interested in listening to what they have to say?<br><br>I may be wrong, but I get the feeling that we should concentrate on getting people to be interested in going to the Speaker's Corner to listen rather than just to speak. Unfortunately, I don't think we Singaporeans are all that interested in what other people have to say than what we have to say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KTE..you may never know. By guaging at the turn-out at every election rally..most of them turn up at the opposition camp to hear them out...not to listen to what they can come out with (so far...no strong alternatives to the present policies), but to see them taking pot-shot at the Ruling party. And they (the crowd) are enjoying it. So a Speaker Corner could in fact turn out to be that way..albeit some restrictions. But a Speaker Corner won't be like the Rally, where they stand on the stage to blared out their disgruntment without any rebuttal. Those in the crowd will throw questions for you to substantiate your dissatisfaction(which most likely will be the Govt policies) and the alternatives to it..and you could end up as what Littleman has said..making a fool of yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoops, I can see the self-contradictory component in my statement, ok, let me try to make it clearer......<br>The basic concept of Speaker's Corner is the same as Hyde Park, where people come out and speak their mind, but it need not be the same as Hyde Park (aka Singaporean flavour, location, physical attributes), but even with the same concept and everything, Speaker's Corner will never be like Hyde Park (as successful).
