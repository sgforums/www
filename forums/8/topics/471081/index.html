              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is
              Unlicensed Moneylending?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Moneylending in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>Under the Moneylenders Act 2010 (Revised Edition), Chapter 188,
              anyone who wishes to operate a moneylending business is required to
              apply for a Moneylender’s Licence from the Registrar of
              Moneylenders. Licensed Moneylenders are required by law to abide to
              the provisions under the Moneylenders Act and its Rules. For more
              information on Moneylending in Singapore and how one can apply for
              a Moneylender’s licence, the public can visit the Insolvency &amp;
              Public Trustee’s Office (IPTO) website at the following link.</p>
              <p><strong>Verifying whether a moneylender is legal</strong></p>
              <p>To verify whether a moneylender is licensed, the public may
              access the IPTO website at the following link to check against an
              updated list of licensed moneylenders maintained by the Registry of
              Moneylenders.</p>
              <p><strong>What are loansharks?</strong></p>
              <p>Loansharks are unlicensed moneylenders, who illegally give out
              loans when not licensed to do so by the Registry of Moneylenders.
              Loansharks often lend money at unfair terms, such as at exorbitant
              rates of interest as high as 20% and 1018% per annum, frequently to
              people who are desperate for money and unable to get loans from
              legitimate sources.</p>
              <p>Because they operate outside the law, loansharks resort to
              unscrupulous and often violent harassment acts to ensure repayment
              from their debtors. These include splashing paint on the front
              doors’ of debtors and innocent bystanders; scrawling graffiti
              detailing debtors’ personal details on walls; sending “Hell Notes”
              to frighten debtors; locking the front doors of debtors’ units;
              damaging cars belonging to debtors and innocent residents; and even
              setting fire to the front doors’ of debtors.</p>
              <p>Loansharks are also known to outsource their illegal business by
              employing the vulnerable for their operations. These may include
              forcing debtors who are unable to repay their loans to conduct acts
              of harassment on other debtors; offering youths quick cash in
              return of committing acts of harassment; and offering money to
              people who open bank accounts to facilitate in their illegal money
              transfers.</p>
              <p><strong>What constitutes loansharking activities</strong></p>
              <p>Those who may dabble in loansharking activities of any nature
              are warned, as Police take a serious view on such offences.</p>
              <p>Anyone who contributes or facilitates a loansharking operation
              will not escape the law. Persons carrying out any of the following
              acts are deemed to have participated in loansharking
              activities:</p>
              <p>    Carrying out acts of loanshark harassment (eg.
              splashing paint, scribbling on walls, setting fire; locking gates;
              sending hell notes); </p>
              <p>    debt collection; </p>
              <p>    providing funds or allowing premises to be used
              for loansharking business; </p>
              <p>    providing or selling prepaid SIM cards to
              loansharks; </p>

              of loansharking syndicates; </p>
              <p>    promoting or advertising loansharking
              activities; </p>
              <p>    giving instructions to carry out
              harassment; </p>
              <p>    provide transport for runners; or </p>
              <p>    acting as a lookout or verifying harassment on

              contemporary and forward thinking fashion. No effort has been spared to
