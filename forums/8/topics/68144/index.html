            <div class='col-md body'><strong>ARIES March 21-April 20</strong><br>Nothing seems to ruffle you more than a lack of discipline, disloyalty and<br>decorum. But Arians are also known to go into a rage very easily when<br>challenged. Those of you who have been on the receiving end of the Aries<br>temper know that if not calmed down they can even get violent. But one<br>thing is certain if the opponent remains calm and does not react to their<br>outburst, Arians cool down very fast. They are also the first to apologize,<br>which makes them easier to forgive.<br><br><strong>TAURUS April 21-May 20</strong><br>You are generally quiet and have control over your emotions. It is difficult<br>to predict what will upset you, so when you do lose your cool, people don't<br>know how to react. Your temper is like that of a raging bull, and anyone<br>trying to pacify you will be the first one to get a verbal<br>bashing. You generally get upset when you are cornered or when people accuse<br>you of doing something wrong. You also hate being reminded about mistakes<br>you've made in the past. You also have the potential to be terribly<br>vindictive if rubbed the wrong way.<br><br><strong>GEMINI May 21-June 20</strong><br>You are recognised by your cheerful disposition and your jovial nature is<br>not easily susceptible to anger. In fact, you are the best person to have<br>around when there is an ugly scene at a party you can bring the warring<br>factions together quite diplomatically. But when you lose your cool,<br>you yell and scream and will not listen to reason. You must have the last<br>word in a wordy duel. Your capacity to argue aggressively is matched only by<br>your seductive charm.<br><br><strong>CANCER June 21-July 21</strong><br>Considering how charming, caring, and kind you are, you dislike unpleasant<br>scenes, much less creating one yourself. You have great tolerance and rarely<br>get provoked into losing your temper. If someone is unreasonable or trying<br>to create trouble, you are more likely to walk away quietly.<br>But that does not mean you do not have a temper. When angry, in your effort<br>to control your emotions, you tremble, your hands get sweaty, and sometimes<br>you fumble for words. Tears roll down your eyes easily and the opponent is<br>touched by your innocence and will seek an apology immediately.<br><br><strong>LEO July 22-August 21</strong><br>If anyone has total control over their emotions, it is you. But then, you<br>can be described as stiff, cold and uncaring. You are known to lack<br>spontaneity but you really don't care about opinions. You don't like to<br>create scenes and will never accept invitations to a party where<br>you suspect the presence of an unruly lot. But your very presence seems<br>challenging to some and they take vicarious pleasure in your disquiet. When<br>angry you can use very critical language. A dressing-down can humiliate your<br>opponent, causing a strain between both of you forever.<br><br><strong>VIRGO August 22-September 21</strong><br>Most of you are gentle and have full control over your emotions, but those<br>of you given to temper tantrums can certainly get violent. When see thing<br>with rage, you yell and shout and tend to break things lying close at hand.<br>You can even harm yourself by banging your hands on a glass<br>top table or wall. You should never get into any argument, for you are a<br>sore loser. You feel that others are trying to persecute you and don't quite<br>respect your opinions. When hurt, you can also hold grudges forever.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LIBRA September 22-October 22</strong><br>Did someone say that you are the charmers of the zodiac? Well, it's true.<br>Few have ever seen you ruffled or angry. You are very conscious of your<br>image, and you believe that anger distorts your face and personality. You<br>also think you are above things like anger. But wait before you get<br>into self-congratulatory mood. Your family or those very close to you know u<br>better. You have an unmatched temper amongst all the zodiac signs, and what<br>makes it worse is your capacity to justify it.<br><br><strong>SCORPIO October 23-November 21</strong><br>Of course you don't lose your cool. But your very demeanour (manner)<br>projects haughtiness (arrogance, pride), pride and grand disdain (disregard)<br>for lesser mortals(humans). Others are often found saying that anger sits on<br>your nose, and you are raring to give your peace of mind<br>to the first person who tries to act funny with you. You are selective in<br>the choice of your friends, and have a low tolerance for the superfluous<br>(extra) types. Your tongue-lashing (attack) is generally in a soft hissing<br>tone, for when you scream your voice tends to get shrill and loud,<br>and you do hate drawing attention to yourself! When upset, you are angrier<br>with yourself for having shown weakness, for the last thing that Scorpio<br>wants to show is being out of control.<br><br><strong>SAGITTARIUS November 22-December 20</strong><br>You are insensible and generally have no complete control over your<br>emotions. You do get angry quickly and others marvel at your anger levels<br>even when provoked. Actually, you get tongue-tied when angry and you will<br>remove your anger waiting for the other person to calm down. Then you<br>will reason with your opponent and convince the other person in a very<br>gentle manner that the whole thing was just his mistake. You're also likely<br>to totally sever ties with someone when you're upset with them.<br><br><strong>CAPRICORN December 21-January 19</strong><br>Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like you<br>is capable of sensitivity and genuine emotions. You project a hard exterior<br>but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide from others.<br>u can be seething with anger but will not betray<br>your feelings. But then, there are times that even you cannot control your<br>temper. Under such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with<br>frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person. Your<br>outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br><br><strong>AQUARIUS January 20-February 18</strong> .<br>You are noble and kind and dislike losing control over your emotions. It is<br>very rare for you to get angry. You are also the pacifier in situations that<br>involve arguments. It is always your endeavour to be perfect and socially<br>correct in your behaviour and attitude, but if misunderstood<br>and slighted you can give in to an angry outburst. You will shout and scream<br>and then walk out from the scene. You cannot easily forget the situation and<br>will be bitter about it for a long time.<br><br><strong>PISCES February 19-March 20</strong><br>The only thing that can be said about you dreamers is that you appear even<br>more attractive when angry. You are very sensitive to others' feelings, so<br>you rarely hurt them. But when others tend to hurt you, then things take a<br>nasty turn. You will yell and use harsh words, and feel inclined<br>to shake everything and everyone up. Your creative imagery is at its best<br>when angry, and you tend to get pretty dramatic. When upset, you refuse to<br>listen to reason and wish to be left alone. But once you calm down, you<br>repent your tantrums and seek forgiveness. So nobody can be<br>upset with you for too long.</div>
