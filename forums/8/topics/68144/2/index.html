            <div class='col-md body'>.<br><strong>CAPRICORN December 21-January 19</strong><br>Few will believe that a hardcore practical and materialistic person like you<br>is capable of sensitivity and genuine emotions. You project a hard exterior<br>but are actually very sensitive, a trait you successfully hide from others.<br>u can be seething with anger but will not betray<br>your feelings. But then, there are times that even you cannot control your<br>temper. Under such circumstances you can shout and scream, more with<br>frustration at the situation than with anger at any particular person. Your<br>outbursts can shock others and can make them feel guilty too.<br><br>wow almost 100% true............but not sure bout the last part ,maybe I never got so angry that I would burst out.</div>

You have great tolerance and rarely get provoked into losing your temper. If someone is unreasonable or trying to create trouble, you are more likely to walk away quietly. But that does not mean you do not have a temper. When angry, in your effort to control your emotions, you tremble, your hands get sweaty, and sometimes you fumble for words.

You<br>also think you are above things like anger. But wait before you get<br>into self-congratulatory mood. <span style="color: red;">Your family or those very close to you know u<br>better.
