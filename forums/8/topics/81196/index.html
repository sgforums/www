When u r born, no matter wat u do u receive damnation.<br><br><blockquote>The temple behind my house, don't know Taoism or Buddhism or something, it's weird. I used to hear disco music coming from the third storey, and the temple is all covered up, as in, the backyard has a wall so high you can't see anything inside from the outside, and they even put up MORE covering to cover up the unwalled areas. </blockquote>Secondly, real othodox buddhist or taoist do not believe in idol like earth god or monkey god. Those who pray to idols like earth or kitchen god etc r classified as idol worshipping. Why don't u tell us the address ?<br><br><blockquote>Evangelism is not psychoing. On behalf of those ppl who have erred i apologise to you and seek your forgiveness. However, preaching the gospel is a commandment and must be done. Everyone needs to hear the good news. We are told to preach and not pester/harrass or psycho ppl. I preach the gospel, ask for response and leave the person to decide. If he/she says no....we will leave because converting a man is not human job. </blockquote>Evangelism is psychoing. They talk u into joining their religion and tat is psychoing u. Then how do u define psychoing, a singaporean term  ?<br><br>Preaching is a commandment ? Wat is the rationale for preaching to people ? Why can't the "holy spirit" or god do it himself and need man ? Who don't know about christainity now ? If u want to spread the "good word" it has been spread and people had chosen their religion. Why go around and harrass again ? Preach ? I am sure there r a lot of persistant people who "preach". BTW preach, pester, harrass, psychoing... wat is the diff ?</div>
