According to Buddhist teachings, he is the enlightened one...he worked himself towards it. He din know the way before hand...he merely achieved it in their context.

The speaker in the advertisement is Ajahn Brahmavamso, (see <a href="http://www.bodhikusuma.com/monks/monks_profiles_ajahn_brahm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodhikusuma.com/monks/monks_profiles_ajahn_brahm.htm</a> ) a Western monk who is active in Australia and a frequent visitor to Singapore. The influx of Buddhists in these Western countries have generated a new wave of dynamism in Buddhism as they adapted Buddhism into their particular lifestyles.<br><br>Without a doubt, most of these countries have Christianity as its mainstream religion, and this exerted an influence on the development of Buddhism in Western countries. (An article on growth of Buddhism in Australia: <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/whybudoz.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.buddhanet.net/whybudoz.htm</a>)<br><br>The adaptability of Buddhism is shown by its wide range of practices among Buddhists and Western Buddhism is no different.  Ajahn Brahmavamso himself was a born Christian before he was ordained as a monk, so he draws upon his own experiences for his own talks. To be sure, there is growing interaction between Buddhism groups across nations.<br><br>Unlike here, Buddhism is seen as highly advanced science / psychology / philosophy in the West. Buddha himself said that one does not need to be a Buddhist to benefit from his teachings, and being a Buddhist is of no use if one does not practice the teachings.<br><br>One can use Buddhist techniques and remain a Catholic, and indeed there are westerners who learn Buddhist meditation but remain Catholics. To say that Buddhism is imitating Christianity is hardly accurate, given that Buddhism is 500 years older than Christianity. The word Â“AmenÂ” come from the same root as Â“AumÂ” (pronounced as Â“OMÂ”) which is the Hinduism most well-known mantra. So are Christians imitating Hindus?<br><br>Guatama Buddha is not the first nor was he the last Buddha. He is recognised as the Buddha to recover the teachings lost to men for thousands of years. His gift to the world was never to save the world but to produce a continuous stream of enlightened minds through his teachings and techniques.<br><br>Christians have to say that Jesus died to save the world. Jesus died, but the world goes on suffering. His death is supposed to be the gift to the world, but his sacrifice is no sacrifice because it is in vain.<br><br>If he never died on the cross, does it mean that he will be still alive today, or will he die of old age too? If his mission is to save the world through his death, does that make those who sent him to his death good servants of God who helped him fulfil his mission?<br><br>While the above questions may seem sarcastic, it is the same questions that Buddhists in the West ask themselves. The mob has risen to question their leaders, but the leaders provide no satisfactory answers, and the power of the mob will win this battle, regardless of what the leaders say.<br><br>We are fortunate in Singapore that there is inter-religious harmony among the different religions, in a very short time, the world will come to realise that there is no such thing as an exclusive religion. Whether one takes 15 minutes to realise that or 150 years, the result is still the same.<br><br>talk_cockÂ’s crap:<br><strong>All things come to pass, given time.<br>And time is nothing in the realm of Infinity.</strong></div>

Theres a group of black sheep  keep insult my religion, saying tat we will go to hell if we dun believe their God, insult my intelligence when i pray to a carved log of useless statue. They have a low tolerance for other ppl belief n religion... But after all as a Buddhist, i forgive them for their ignorance, selfishness n insult. </div></blockquote>Why do you say it is insult? If you think the Christian concept of God, Heaven and Hell is crap, will they mean anything to you? Their concept can be crap, but their intention is good. Why can't you see the love but focus on the condemnation?<br><br>Actually, there is indeed something wrong in praying to, quote from you, a carved log of useless statue. If you have been living a righteous life, do you need to fall back on the useless statue? Karma, the always fair karma, will give you your dues. What's yours is yours. No one can take it away from you? A buddhist meditates and chants Sutras, that's ok, but praying?! Why pray when karma will give back your dues? IMHO, praying is NATO. Just say say and you get your wish. Excuse me, this is so cheapskate.<br><br>What is low tolerance to you? Do you see them razing temples to the ground? The point is, you shouldn't compromise the Truth, or what you think is true. Stand up to your conviction, even to the point of death. If the Christian concept of Heaven and Hell is crap, I don't think you should be so tolerant as to say they're real, isn't it? If there is only one way to salvation, why must the christian compromise and say there're many ways? But of course, they shouldn't run inside every temple and proclaim, "all you bloody vipers listen up, ALL of you are going to hell, if you don't believe in Christ that's where you land up ..."</div>
