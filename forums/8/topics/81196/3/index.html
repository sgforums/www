He is not the 'rubbing hands in glee', 'cheering about it' and insensitive kind of person</blockquote>I do not know him well at all.

Someone who sin thoroughly get to enjoy himself in heaven while another work as well as Mother Teresa and suffer in hell. Is tat fair ?<br><br><blockquote>You mean Evangelion? Even anime also must ride on Christianity to be popular. What a shame.<br><br>If I'm not wrong, Neon Genesis Evangelion translated in chinese is xin1 shi4 ji4 FU2 YIN1 zhan4 shi4 .... fu2 yin1 is ... GOSPEL.</blockquote>So wat ? In the story they show the end of the world where Eve is the ender while adam is a monster and the whole world bath in blood and no judgement is meted on anyone. Is tat part of the bible story ? They have a motto for the series too. "God is in his heaven so all rights with the world". How do u translate tat ?<br><br>There r a lot of movies or show tat focus on buddhism or taoist too. Do they ride on the name of buddhism or taosit to be popular ? The only reason they use christainity is because they have a lot of mumbo jumbo in it to add a mystic feeling.<br><br><blockquote>I wont defend my Christian faith in the areas of how believers behaves or should behave, concerning the issue on evangelism and why must it continue and perhaps the topic on why sufferings persist even after Jesus' sacrificial death here. I have posted some answers pertaining to those questions in other threads found in 'Eternal Hope' forum. If one refuses to accept some of the terms, more posts wont do the magic</blockquote>Why don't u start one here then ? The problem of going to eternal hope is everyone will try to shut up the opposition. Even the mod will edit off part of your posts. Why don't u do your explaining here ?<br><br><blockquote>Why do you say it is insult? If you think the Christian concept of God, Heaven and Hell is crap, will they mean anything to you? Their concept can be crap, but their intention is good. Why can't you see the love but focus on the condemnation? </blockquote>Huh ?!?! If someone go to your church, start comdemning Jesus is a fake and say all christian will be reborn as pigs, r u going to be happy about it ? Surely people who will feel nothign but anger.<br><br><blockquote>Actually, there is indeed something wrong in praying to, quote from you, a carved log of useless statue. If you have been living a righteous life, do you need to fall back on the useless statue? Karma, the always fair karma, will give you your dues. What's yours is yours. No one can take it away from you? A buddhist meditates and chants Sutras, that's ok, but praying?! Why pray when karma will give back your dues? IMHO, praying is NATO. Just say say and you get your wish. Excuse me, this is so cheapskate. </blockquote>Is the cross a useless statue ? People also pray to bible too, why do u have to pray to a useless book ? If u follow the teaching from the church, do u need to fall back on the useless cross ? Belief, the almighty belief tat look at nothign else, will give you your dues. When u believe or don;t believe u do nto need your cross too. As long as u believe in God, why do u need to pray as well ? Why pray when just your belief will guarantee all the priviledges in life and after life ? IMHO, praying is NATO. Just say say and you get your wish. Excuse me, this is so cheapskate.<br><br><blockquote>What is low tolerance to you? Do you see them razing temples to the ground? The point is, you shouldn't compromise the Truth, or what you think is true. Stand up to your conviction, even to the point of death. If the Christian concept of Heaven and Hell is crap, I don't think you should be so tolerant as to say they're real, isn't it? If there is only one way to salvation, why must the christian compromise and say there're many ways? But of course, they shouldn't run inside every temple and proclaim, "all you bloody vipers listen up, ALL of you are going to hell, if you don't believe in Christ that's where you land up ..."</blockquote>No, they do not raze temples to ground. But clearly u r agitated because someone comment about your religion too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  U probably should understand "low tolerance".<br><br>Secondly, why do u think people of the other religion will feel christainity is the truth ? IMHO I believe Christain should be the one to stand up for the truth, which they clearly don't because they have blind faith on it. BTW heaven and hell is not unique to christainity. In certain taoist &amp; hinduism they believe in heaven and hell too. Just because they r from a different religion should anyone curse them tat they will end up in hell ? There r a lot of different curses too, like the popular "When u give birth to a son u find tat it has no @sshole". Do i believe tat is really going to happen ? Should I be angry about it only if I believe tat is going to be true ?<br><br>FYI, the christain really say tat is only one way.. tat is through believing in christ.. am I wrong to say tat ?</div>

The only conclusion I can draw from his post is he is a pious christian too pious for his own good.</strong><br><br>Pious christian sounds like someone trying to score point with God, you know, a religion by works. I don't think that is the case.<br><br><strong>Is tat justice to u then ? Someone who sin thoroughly get to enjoy himself in heaven while another work as well as Mother Teresa and suffer in hell. Is tat fair ?</strong><br><br>Arrrgh ... can't you appreicate the joke and irony from the chinese saying? Don't have a sense of humor issit?<br><br><strong>So wat ? In the story they show the end of the world where Eve is the ender while adam is a monster and the whole world bath in blood and no judgement is meted on anyone.</strong><br><br>Even worse. They steal the word 'Gospel' into their title but bastardized the story .. haha<br><br><strong>There r a lot of movies or show tat focus on buddhism or taoist too. Do they ride on the name of buddhism or taosit to be popular ?</strong><br><br>Yes. Come on lah, the ying yang symbol and the ba gua are both Taoist symbols. Without these your show loses its appeal liao.<br><br><strong>The only reason they use christainity is because they have a lot of mumbo jumbo in it to add a mystic feeling.</strong><br><br>Yup. Clever huh ... steal the word but change the content.<br><br><strong>Why don't u start one here then ? The problem of going to eternal hope is everyone will try to shut up the opposition. Even the mod will edit off part of your posts. Why don't u do your explaining here ? </strong><br><br>Do it here is just dui4 niu2 tan2 qin2. And it is rather sensitive here. See, even the mod wants to close THIS topic liao.<br><br><strong>Huh ?!?! If someone go to your church, start comdemning Jesus is a fake and say all christian will be reborn as pigs, r u going to be happy about it ? Surely people who will feel nothign but anger. </strong><br><br>Shit la, you got read my reply or not? I agreed it is too extreme for someone to run inside a temple and proclaim all believers inside go to hell mah. So why your example above?<br><br><strong>Is the cross a useless statue ? </strong><br><br>A cross is not a statue.<br><br><strong>People also pray to bible too, why do u have to pray to a useless book ?</strong><br><br>I suppose they're not mainstream. How do you pray to a book? Put it on the altar and pray?<br><br><strong>If u follow the teaching from the church, do u need to fall back on the useless cross ?</strong><br><br>You mean Catholics fall back on the useless cross? Haha ...<br><br><strong>No, they do not raze temples to ground. But clearly u r agitated because someone comment about your religion too  U probably should understand "low tolerance". </strong><br><br>I'm agitated but you guessed the wrong reason. I just hope non-believers see the love behind the so-called condemnation.<br><br><strong>Secondly, why do u think people of the other religion will feel christainity is the truth ?</strong><br><br>I never imply that. Instead I wrote if you think christianity is crap, then why do you feel so insulted? Does God mean anything to you? If not, why care a damn if he sent you to hell or not?<br><br><strong>BTW heaven and hell is not unique to christainity. In certain taoist &amp; hinduism they believe in heaven and hell too. Just because they r from a different religion should anyone curse them tat they will end up in hell ?</strong><br><br>You can dream up the most imaginative philosophical landscape.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Anyway the main thing here is not about hell, but that God seems to like sending people to hell. Ok, this is not true, but is how many unbelievers perceive it. But my point is, if this God doesn't mean anything to you, then all the talk about sending people to hell is unimportant, isn't it?<br><br><strong>There r a lot of different curses too, like the popular "When u give birth to a son u find tat it has no @sshole". Do i believe tat is really going to happen ? Should I be angry about it only if I believe tat is going to be true ? </strong><br><br>This is a bit different. To you, a son and asshole is as real as it can be. So I see this as an insult. It is like cursing your mother and your fairy godmother. If you have no fairy godmother, you won't feel so insulted?</div>
