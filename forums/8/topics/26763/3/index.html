Don't tell me you are also one of those at Geylang. want to get excited also no need to stoop so low. Or someone just give you  stab on your ass? Really so desperate meh?<br>hahahahaha<br>hahahahaha<br>hahahahaha x 100<br><br>Oh the foolish bastard is trying to defend already. Look how desperate you are now. Struggling to get out of this place? Or can't put your ego down and fuck off from this place?<br>1) So what? You are the one who add oil in fire. Doesn't start by you mean you can post whatever you like? A bank got rob, you go rob that bank later, kanna caught go tell the police you not the one who started the robbery.<br>2) I made an innocent remark by asking you to fuck off from forum which is quite harmless. Not neccesary in a bad way, it could be made in the name of fun. You can always go kill a person, than tell everybody you making an innocent murder and it is not neccesary in a bad way, it could be made in the name of fun.<br>3) I find your post pretty irritating. And we are still talking about.<br><br>Oh you did nothing wrong. Oh everybody else are wrong expect you. So how? Cry lor. Go ahead cry. Go tell everybody you got bullied. Grow up ok?

People have the right to flame me just like I have the right to make my own views. If you do not agree with me just say so like a proper human being.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Millenium:<br><br>It has come to my attention that you are a fucking moron. You are still writing the same old bullshit again and again. You've said something once, and you are just repeating yourself over and over again like a stuttering moron. Is there a chance, however small it might be that you can back up your words. Who are you to say whether I'm scared or a sissy. Your only excuse would be to know me in real life, which I doubt. Whenever you try to "insult" me, all you can do is dream up fabrications that are more ludicrious as they go. I'm not surprised to see you working that imagination of yours again. But maybe, I don't care for your wild fairy tales. You're just like a fricking little whore if I've ever seen one, you should be shot on sight you're so goddamn stupid. Believe it or not, you are the dumbass that started to assume things. But you probably did not realize that in your puny little brain.<br><br>Btw, this is the first time I ever verbally lambasted you. If you thought the earlier posts was lambasting, you are no doubt showing how stupid you are.<br><br>Ok I'm offering you a last chance to cool it. My statement that I felt Xavier's joke was irritating was entirely wrong. I admit it like a man coz I agreed with Xavier reasoning. I don't see any other valid reasons you have to flame me cept that you are just a childish prick. Seriously you want to have fun? Back it up first.</div>
