            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.nus-artsclub.org/diary-of-a-drunk.gif"><br>In-scene...<br>No doubt about itÂ…clubbing is part and parcel of NUS students' life. What's better than drinking and dancing the whole night long with great music and friends? Insomniac updates you about the latest clubbing events in town and the in-scenes that you may want to be part ofÂ….<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>24th November 2001<br><br>07:30am<br><br>Ohmygawd!! It's November 24th!!! Z-O-U-K-O-U-T day!! For the uninitiated, it's an annual event into its second year organised by the best local club held on the beach with brilliant DJs from everywhere. This year's line-up looks exciting. The only live act of the night is local reggae band, The Bushmen. International DJs making an appearance for the night are Lee Burridge, Darren Emerson, Norman and Joey Jay, Gilles Paterson, Pippi, Takkyu Ishino and Dave Angel, just to name a few. Zouk residents Andrew Chow, Adam Low, Aldrin, Tony Tay, djB and Brendon P will join them.<br>Various genres of music ranging from techno to house, trance and break beats are going to be played in three different arenas. The final arena will cater to the Mambo Jambo fans.<br>Just thinking about the fun I will have makes me exhausted. Yawn. Besides, who, in the right frame of mind, would get up at such an ungodly hour? (even if it is for like, the most talked about event of the year.) Back to sleep! ZzzzÂ….<br><br>Noon 12:00PM<br><br>Oops, slept a tad too long, Time to get ready! Armed with the complimentary guide that's been given out with the tickets, I managed to squeeze in all the essentials into ahem, just ONE bag (although it did nearly break my back). First of all, there's the entrance ticket (of course (duh!) and valid photo ID, especially if you look young.<br>Then there's cash and/or credit cards. Always remember: CASH is KING. Credits cards are too. But bring your own alcohol if you're about to drink quite a bit, particularly if a room has been booked, like us. Bikinis, shorts, bermudas, beach slippers and sandalsÂ…yadayadayada. Just enough time to grab a bit of munchies before leaping into a cab already full with friends AND their bags. Amazing how the cab could actually still move, much less get us to check in at the Rasa Sentosa by 3 pm.<br><br>Evening 5:05 pm<br><br>Ahem. A few delays here and there, but nothing serious enough to dampen our moods. The room feels so cozy that we don't actually feel like leaving at all. It helps that tons of other friends had rooms there too. The fun really started when we started receiving guests and imposing ourselves on other groups of friends who had rooms there too. Of course, being girls, vanity reigns quite a bit. So before the running around and sharing of alcohol started, we spent about an hour primping ourselves and running around in bikinis trying to find the best outfit for each other. The guys just sit there and sigh, how extremely helpful.<br><br>6.45 pm<br><br>We decide to get our entries first before going back to the room to drink some more. Hopped onto a shuttle and traveled to the entrance of Sentosa before we realised that it was going in the wrong direction. Oops. Finally reached there and saw a rather measly crowd even though Yousef and Norman and Joey Jay were playing already. There were a few sporty ones prancing away, but everyone could tell that the usual crowd was going to stream in fashionably late as always.<br>A lot of freebies are given out by the sponsors, stuff that we throw away nearly right after they reach our hands simply because it's just too troublesome to carry them around. We do get some Virgin tattoos for ourselves though, all in the name of fun. Oh, and got our pictures taken by some photographer for some Samsung contest or something. Then it was back to the hotel!<br><br>8ish...<br><br>Alcohol time!! Alcohol at Zoukout itself is just too costly. I stupidly manage to down 9 shots of tequila and vodka before feeling my head spin out of control and my body hit the bed like a ton of bricks. Everything seems sooooo nice and fuzzy, right before my insides do their digestive pyrotechnics and I start spurting like the musical fountain.<br><br>11ish...<br><br>Somehow, my friends manage to pull me onto the shuttle and well towards the beach at the respectable time bracket. And I managed to keep my guts to myself on the bus even though my head felt like it couldn't keep up.<br><br>Still 11ish...<br><br>Wow!! What lovely sand! What a lovely beach! What a lacklustre crowd. The venue was too big. Way too big. Siloso Beach was much, much better for Zoukout. Walking along the beach to check things out already tired us out. The crowd just wasn't there too. People pretty much sat around and looked at the others dance. Maybe it's still early. Maybe. I hope.<br><br>1ish...<br><br>Time flies!! I've been heaving all over the corners of the beach again. It seems that when one feels like puking, one should not stop dancing because it helps the puke to stay down. I stopped. I'm sorry. To all the 'I-like-feeling-the-sand-under-my-feet' people: yes, if you stepped on some wet, grimy sand, it could have been me. Hey, at least I covered up with sand before leaving.<br>I feel quite sober. I really do. Just a bit queasy. The crowd's picking up and so is the music. I just have to force myself to stay on till 3 am for Darren Emerson.<br>There are actually quite a few fair-like stalls around. The belly slide looked like a good way to hurt yourself though. You're supposed to throw yourself onto a semi-wet 10-metre long tarmac on a body-size mat and sliiiide. The guy I saw just landed with a loud THUD and moved an inch. Like, ouch!<br>There's also this circular piece of cloth thingy which everyone can paint on; it's like a massive art project, really fun and lovely. Spent quite a bit of time there before we moved on to some dancing at Arena B, the drum and bass area.<br><br>25th November 2001.<br><br>6 a.m.<br>ZzzzzÂ…Â….<br><br>Charmine Tan<br>Arts 2 Student</div>
