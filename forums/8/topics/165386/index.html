The WHO figures did not include the latest death in <strong>China</strong>.<br><br>Experts have warned the virus may mutate into a form that is easily passed between people and<strong> trigger a global pandemic</strong>.<br><br><strong>China's </strong>outbreaks have caused alarm across the world, including in the tiny Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, which halted a shipment of Chinese feathers to be used on costumes in annual carnival celebrations.<br><br>There was no indication the feathers were contaminated, but the shipping container was being held at the country's port until another vessel could return it to <strong>China</strong>, officials said Thursday.<br><br>Meanwhile, <strong>Indonesia's </strong>Agriculture Ministry said chickens have been <strong>infected </strong>with <strong>H5N1 </strong>in at least three districts in <strong>Aceh</strong>, where tens of thousands of survivors of the Dec. 26 tsunami still live in crowded refugee camps.<br><br>Hundreds of chickens have died, said <strong>Sjamsul </strong><strong>Bahri</strong>, the ministry's director of animal health. He said bird flu has now been found in 23 of <strong>Indonesia's </strong>30 provinces. The virus has killed seven people in <strong>Indonesia</strong>.<br><br>In <strong>Vietnam</strong>, the country hardest-hit by the disease, a 15-year-old boy from the northern port city of <strong>Haiphong </strong>tested positive for <strong>H5N1</strong>. He was hospitalized and expected to recover, said <strong>Nguyen Van Binh</strong>, deputy director of the Ministry of Health's Preventive Medicine Department.<br><br>The Tourism Administration of <strong>Vietnam </strong>ordered tour operators not to take foreigners near areas where bird flu outbreaks have been reported, said <strong>Vu The Binh</strong>, director of the central Tourism Department.<br><br>Most major hotels and restaurants in <strong>Vietnam </strong>have stopped serving poultry.<br><br>But <strong>Binh </strong>said bird flu has not yet affected the country's tourism industry, with at least 3 million foreign arrivals this year.<br><br>Also Thursday, the state-run <strong>China </strong>Daily newspaper reported that <strong>China </strong>was "within days" of testing a bird flu vaccine on 100 people between the ages of 18 to 60.<br><br>If approved, the vaccine will first be given to high-risk groups, such as veterinary and laboratory workers and poultry farmers in infected areas, <strong>Lu Zhenyou</strong>, a spokesman for Sinovac Biotech, one of the developers, was quoted as saying.<br><br>There are currently no human vaccines against the virus, although the drug Tamiflu is one of the few believed effective in treating it.<br><br><strong>China </strong>had tried to be aggressive and open in dealing with bird flu after coming under criticism for being reticent during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or     <strong>SARS</strong>.<br><br><strong>Japan's</strong> <strong>Asahi </strong><strong>Shimbun </strong>newspaper, meanwhile, reported that the country's prefectures, or states, only had enough stockpiles of the anti-flu drug Tamiflu for 37,400 people Â— less than 1 percent of the Health Ministry's recommendation.<br><br>Five of <strong>Japan's </strong>47 prefectures reported having no stockpiles, while a sixth did not release information, the newspaper said.<br><br>The ministry's bird flu action plan calls for prefectures to be able to treat 10.5 million people.<br><br>Local officials cited cost as one reason for the small stockpiles, the <strong>Asahi </strong>said.<br><br>Bird flu hit <strong>Japan </strong>last year for the first time in decades.
