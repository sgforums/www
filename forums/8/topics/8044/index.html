Take this time as friends to know her better, who knows what might happen in the future??? You might grow to accept her for who she is. Yeap, as been mentioned, hope u find ur miss rite soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am afraid pixie gal is right. U shouldnt be asking other people about what u should do with your gf. It is obvious that u really mind your gf's past. The thing is no matter what other pple's advices are, u will still think about it. So my advice is : break up with her now! U dont wanna waste her time as well as yours. Do it.(btw u are not doing something terribly wrong in breaking up. It is your personal freedom and u shouldnt force yourself in accepting anything that u dont like.)</div>
