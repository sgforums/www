That you are such a SENTIMENTAL guy? Come on, if you truly MIND about her past, you are NOT fit to say that you love her or even miss her for that sense! Well, if you want a thorough break and DON'T want her to tinge you even a little with just a call, I suggest that you tell her straight "Hey girl! I MIND that you have had police cases b4 and you sleep with other guys b4! I feel INsecure and I DON'T wish to carry on anymore with you!" There! Just LET it OUT! Since you MIND and it BOTHERS you so MUCH, DON'T carry on! I feel that the gal made the WRONG decision to even choose you because I DON'T think that you truly love her!<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>You are right too that i'm afraid that one day she might dump me for another guy,U know a guy will usually remain faithful when comittee in a relationship but not a girl.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Yups, like I say, you are a LOSER! You DON'T want to be dumped by her, that's why the INSECURITY! And this goes to show how much you trust her and love her...... DUH! Btw, it's NOT true that when a guy has a gf, he will usually remain faithful to that gal but a gal will NOT! That's a generalisation! Perhaps it's because you are a guy but as a gal, I have seen many BASTARD bf of my other female friends and I'm afraid that I can't agree with what you say! A guy is a BASTARD as much as a gal is a BITCH! Maybe your gf has been a bitch (pardon me for this word) before by sleeping around, but haven't you been a BASTARD for treating her the way you are NOW? *SHRUGS* What's PAST is past, why cling on?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I do not agree with you when you said i'm gaining the people's sympathty.I'm really to my wit's end.You know,i can't tell my friends or even my family.That's why i'm seeking peoples help here.<br></strong></blockquote><br><br>Alrite, so you are NOT seeking for sympathy here but what sort of HELP are you seeking here then? REMEMBER this, we DON'T know your gf! It's NOT fair for us to judge her or advise you, you know? Oh yeah, and I think that you CAN'T tell you friends or your family because you KNOW that you are a COWARD and LOSER! We do NOT know you personally so you can tell us........ will that will make you LESS of a LOSER than what you already are even though we don't know you? Maybe and maybe NOT! After all, this is the VIRTUAL world, you can say it all but like I say, it all weighs down to YOURSELF! If you are BOTHERED, then too bad! *SHRUGS*<br><br>[quote]<strong><br>I thought i can let go of this relationship,but it was beyond my power.I really miss her .On the other hand ,i can't forget her past.Maybe i'm too selfish... ... ...<br><br>Isn't it Ironic?</strong></div></blockquote><strong>*YAWNZ* Yups, you know that answer yourself but you just want us to say otherwise but too bad I am NOT. Yes, you are a LOSER and yes, you are SELFISH so that's it man! DUMP her and STOP tormenting the POOR girl! All the best to you and hope that your NEXT gf will MEET up to your "goody girl" expectation! *HUGZ*<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</strong></div>

I'm afraid that I have to agree with you COMPLETELY! Yups, I am a gal and I CAN'T help it that I think that he is a LOSER right? You guys can go SIDE with him, I don't give a damn because to me, he is still a LOSER! One who can't listens to his heart but to his mind when it comes to love is NOT exactly a real GUY! *SHRUGS* TO each his own I guess! Nevertheless, I'll like to ask the rest of you guys out there, you all really BUY ironic's story? If you guys are in his shoes, will you all behave like a LOSER and COWARD like HIS HIGHNESS himself? *PONDERS*<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================</div>
