            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>First there was China. A force so powerful that could swallow the whole of Asia in one gigantic gulp, stretching forth its political and economic tentacles, and squeezing the life out of struggling economies. That was Singapore's main fear then, way back in 1999. But that was then. Now the scene has been brought even closer, to a monster lurking outside our doorstep, literallyÂ…<br><br>Ever since Malaysia's resounding success at restoring its shattered economy from the collapse in 1997, it has become all the more aggressive, and ready to pounce upon the islet at the tip of its peninsular. But what has Mahathir Mohamed, president of Malaysia have to do with all our troubles? Commenting once that the world was devoid of any knowledge of even the existence of Malaysia, he said that people were only able to state where Malaysia was near to, and not where Malaysia exactly was. Then came the disturbing comment. "To tell you the truth, Singapore is near Malaysia." Was it merely a proud remark or a pure statement of reality and truth for Singapore as a whole? In the Straits Times 4th May edition, we hear Mahathir saying, "There are many ways to skin a cat, to skin Singapore there are many ways."<br><br>What really can be said of this ruler of the thirteen states? A beast that has little regard for accuracy and fact, only for generating racial suspicion and fear? Or a crazed ruler after twenty-one years of failure trying to compete with his Singaporean contemporary, Lee Kuan Yew? Is he guilty of trying to earn more international fame and fortune by means of harassing Singapore? In the eyes of many Singaporeans, it apparently is so. The sudden but stinging blows the Malaysian side has inflicted upon the Singaporean way of life in recent months has shown to many as a horrible revelation of the things to come. Perhaps, if Malaysia did fail to woo away the giant Taiwanese shipping company, Evergreen, from Singapore, would they have gotten so much attention from the Singaporean government? Their "surprising" success in wooing Maersk and Evergreen lines as well as Egypt Air away from Singapore proves the sticking point that they are still economically attractive, due to lower prices.<br><br>But here, more importantly, is this wooing of airlines and shipping firms politically motivated, just to show off to the rest of the world, or to boost the "inferior" Malaysian economy? In my view, of course, it is definitely for more than just one particular factor. But the main motivation naturally comes from the particular "need" for Malaysians to rise up together to defeat Singapore in the furious battle of trade and business in the area. The description of Singapore as "the best house in a bad neighbourhood" could not have been more apt. And that is exactly what Malaysia wants its image to be and to suppress Singapore in the event that it (Singapore) proves to be somewhat indomitable. Mahathir apparently has not been too discreet about his dislike and animosity towards his island-republic neighbour, lamenting over issues long over, when Malaysia and Singapore were once united under British administration.<br><br>However, now is the time to ask, is Mahathir trying to garner for a complete revolution in Malaysia? The Malaysian Restoration, perhaps? While it can be maintained that Mahathir wants his legacy to live on in Malaysia for eternity, his ideas about the father of Singapore, his long-time counterpart Lee Kuan Yew, cannot be clearly determined. To be really down-to-earth, Mahathir must have envisioned Malaysia to be the economic powerhouse of Southeast Asia and not to be seconded to an "itsy-bitsy" island, approximately five hundred and fifty times smaller than itself, without any natural resources at all. After close analysis over the reasons which led to Mahathir "lamenting" over the water agreements in 1965, it is possible to conclude that in practice, Malaysia had plenty to lose from the sale of water to Singapore. We see the reality behind the politics, from recent months, that Malaysia is prepared, if at all, to cut off Singapore's water supply from them, if it is to go on the succeed Singapore as Southeast Asia's most prosperous nation. When he mentioned that water prices were too low and that it should have been raised, and to the news today that hinted that he would have raised the prices way back then shows, to a large extent, the growing tendency of Malaysia to abuse its advantages over Singapore.<br><br>The water issue to the KTM railway that has split Singapore into two and to the issue of Malay sovereignty, all show Mahathir's almost desperate moves to counter the powerful economic fields of Singapore. Are the waves from the island state's success to overwhelming for Mahathir to contain and boost the morale of the millions of Malaysians? But does the problem lie in the fact that Malaysia's poor organisation, delayed action, or mere indifference to outstanding issues proving to be hindrances to economic progress? Is politically motivated anger being diverted at Singapore to receive the terrible blows of hate and dislike? I believe, that Mahathir has cleverly abused the power of the Malaysian media to attack Singapore's stand in any issue, and cause the people of Malaysia to share his same old sentiments. His political manipulation of the Malaysian media was of reason to bombard the Singaporean population with plenty of doubts about the government's capabilities and, worse of all, spark unnecessary attention and unhealthy impressions.<br><br>If you are able to recall the few recent issues of land rights between Singapore and Malaysia, it is most frustratingly crazy and unsubstantiated on the Malaysian stand. Why bring up such childish issues when there is no basis for probe or even plain truth? What cannot help is of course, the hazy, and most unclear land ownership documents the British left behind, forty-five years ago! Why even talk about islands that so clearly belong to Malaysia, except for the fact that it is being maintained by Singapore? Even domestic, wholly Singaporean issues that mean nothing and have no connection or concern to Malaysia at all, which the Pulau Tekong reclamation clearly manifests, is the heavily unsubstantiated fact that reclamation works are encroaching Malaysian territory. Why the fuss in the first place? Taking a closer look at the statement, we see that the Malaysian side is only brave enough to say that reclamation works are encroaching Malaysian territory and not having passed the official border.<br><br>The recent purchases of more improved arms and weapons means more actions and competition set of the region of Southeast Asia and Malaysia tries again and again to overtake Singapore as the most "well-armed" country (?) in the region. Singapore, for decades, has built up a considerable number of war equipment and artillery, up to a point more in quantity as well as in quality. But Mahathir never stops at anything. He signs this new purchase with defiance, possibly even shaking his fist high up in the air and saying "I'll teach you to meddle with MY Malaysia!" If it really means as arms race with Singapore and Malaysia, tensions could drive the situation up the wall and war, though hopefully not, may take place and result in the sickening blasting and destruction of two nations, so close, yet so far.<br><br>So, we are left to wonder, is Malaysia the problem, or is Mahathir the one to be blamed for all the troubles between us?<br></div>

He was a poor student who never completed high school, and in October of 1907, Hitler saw his dreams of becoming an artist shattered when he failed the art exam. He soon developed anti-Jewish and antidemocratic conviction and then joined the army during World War I. He was in Munich and he volunteered for service in the Bavarian army.. Hitler was dedicated, and courageous, although he wasn't promoted early on because his superiors thought he was lacking in leadership qualities, ironic, huh?<br><br>Hilter joined the Nazi party in September of 1919. It was then called the Nationalist German Workers' party. In April of the next year he began working full time for the party. It was renamed the National Socialist German Workers' party. Hitler was soon elected the chairman of the party and was given dictatorial powers.<br><br>Hitler spread his propaganda of racial hatred and contempt for democracy. In November of 1993, he saw his opportunity to gain power. This was a time of political and economic chaos. Hitler led an uprising in Munich against the Weimar Republic. He proclaimed himself Chancellor of a new regime; however, he didn't have the support of the military so his plot to take over Germany collapsed. For his role in this nefarious scheme, Hitler was sentenced to five years imprisonment on February 26, 1924. He served only nine months, and while in jail, he wrote his autobiography, "Mein Kamph." He was released in December 1924 and realized that he must use legal means to assume power.<br><br>Hitler used the Great Depression of 1929 to his advantage by claiming that it had been caused by a Jewish Communist plot. Many Germans accepted this explanation and believed in what Hitler was telling them. He promised them a strong Germany, jobs and national glory. Millions of voters were attracted to Hitler's promises and as a result, the Nazi Party gained 95 seats in parliament, from a mere 12. Following the election of 1930, the party kept on expanding. Unemployment, fear of Communism, and Hitler's confidence all contributed to the growth of Nazi popularity and the ultimate collapse of the Republic in 1932. On January 30, 1933, Hitler was apppointed Chancellor and many believed that he would be easily manipulated by the large corporations.<br><br>However, the business' assumptions were wrong. Once Hitler gained power, he established himself as a despot. The Enabling Acts allowed Hitler's government to make laws without the Legislature, rendering the Legislature powerless. Hitler replaced all labor unions with one Nazi-controlled German Labor Front, banned all political parties (except for the Nazi party), and systematically installed Nazi ideals within the government and the courts. The Nazi power controlled the economy, the media, and cultural activities.<br><br>Hitler used his secret police, the Gestapo, to terrorize the people. However, the majority of citizens approved of Hitler's policies, especially the economic policies which drastically decreased the unemployment rate. His foreign and recreational programs were also widely applauded. Hitler knew that the support of the German people was a necessity for his plans to conquer Europe. To drum up support, he derided the concept of human equality and claimed the racial superiority of the Aryans. He espoused the idea that the Germans had the right to dominate all nations because they were the highest form of human beings; they were the master race.<br><br>Although Hitler's meteoric rise to power and plans for world rule were not realized, he left behind him a trail of misery, and hate. More importantly, he taught the world a lesson on the dangers of international apathy and hate propaganda.<br><br>World War II had a devastating effect of society. Not only were millions of innocents senselessly killed, but many lives were also lost fighting the war.<br><br>The Holocaust was a systematic, bureaucratic annihilation of six million Jews by the Nazi regime under the rule of Hitler. In 1933 about nine million Jews lived in the 21 different countries, later to be occupied by Germans during the war. By 1945 two-thirds of the European Jews had been killed.Millions of innocent lives were lost, not only Jews, but also Gypsies, the disabled, etc. Over three million Soviet POWs were killed. Slavs were targeted for slave labor. Thousands perished in captivity. Many such as Jehovah's Witnesses, religious dissidents, and homosexuals wer persecuted for their beliefs and died as a result of maltreatment. Concentration camps are most closely associated with the Holocaust adn are a symbol of the Nazis. The camps started soon after the beginning of the Nazi regime, and continued until 1945.<br><br>Hitler was aware, however, that his dream of power could not be attained unless he had strong allies. As a result, Germany entered into a nonagression pact with Soviet Union in 1939. To seal the pact, the two countries overpowered Poland and shared the spoils. In one short year, Hitler wreaked havoc in Europe. After easily conquering Poland, and using the Allied apathy to his advantage, Hitler soon captured Denmark, Norway, Netherlands, Belgium, and France. Britain was the only one that was able to narrowly defeat Germany's forces.<br><br>Heady with his numerous victories, Hitler made his first major mistake: he invaded the USSR in June fo 1941. However, he failed to provide his troops with provisions to survive the harsh Russian winters and severely underestimated the number and strength of his old ally's armies. Caught in a long struggle with USSR, and forced to divert his attention away from the Western Front, Hitler stubbornly refused to admit defeat. For the first time, there was dissension among the German troops, who were struggling to stem the waves of Allied soldiers. The Germans' discontent manifested itself in an assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944. Although the German officers failed, the end was near. On April 30, 1945, the infamous dictator committed suicide with his girlfriend, Eva Braun, in a bunker in Berlin.<br><br>When on Sept. 3, 1939, the German Reich received the English declaration of war there was repeated anew a British attempt to render impossible every beginning of a consolidation and thereby of Europe's rise, by fighting whatever power on the Continent was strongest at any given time.<br><br>That is how of yore England ruined Spain in many wars. That is how she conducted her wars against Holland. That is how later she fought France with the aid of all Europe and that is how at the turn of the century she began the encirclement of the then German Reich and in 1914 the World War. Only on account of its internal dissension was Germany defeated in 1918. The consequences were terrible.<br><br>After hypocritical declarations that the fight was solely against the Kaiser and his regime, the annihilation of the German Reich began according to plan after the German Army had laid down its arms.<br><br>While the prophecies of the French statement, that there were 20,000,000 Germans too many-in other words, that this number would have to be exterminated by hunger, disease or emigration-were apparently being fulfilled to the letter, the National Socialist movement began its work of unifying the German people and thereby initiating resurgence of the Reich. This rise of our people from distress, misery and shameful disregard bore all the signs of a purely internal renaissance. Britain especially was not in any way affected or threatened thereby.<br><br>Nevertheless, a new policy of encirclement against Germany, born as it was of hatred, recommenced immediately. Internally and externally there resulted that plot familiar to us all between Jews and democrats, Bolshevists and reactionaries, with the sole aim of inhibiting the establishment of the new German people's State, and of plunging the Reich anew into impotence and misery.<br><br>Apart from us the hatred of this international world conspiracy was directed against those people which like ourselves were neglected by fortune and were obliged to earn their daily bread in the hardest struggle for existence.<br><br>Above all the right of Italy and Japan to share in the goods of this world was contested just as much as that of Germany and in fact was formally denied.<br><br>The coalition of these nations was, therefore, only an act of self-protection in the face of the egoistic world combination of wealth and power threatening them.<br><br>As early as 1936 Prime Minister Churchill, according to statements by the American General Wood before a committee of the American House of Representatives, declared Germany was once again becoming too powerful and must therefore be destroyed.<br><br>In the Summer of 1939 the time seemed to have come for England to begin to realize its intended annihilation by repetition of a comprehensive policy of encirclement of Germany.<br><br>The plan of the campaign of lies staged for this purpose consisted in declaring that other people were threatened, in tricking them with British promises of guarantees and assistance, and of making them march against Germany just as it did preceding the great war.<br><br>Thus Britain from May to August, 1939, succeeded in broadcasting to the world that Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Finland and Bessarabia as well as the Ukraine were being directly threatened by Germany.<br><br>A number of these States allowed themselves to be misled into accepting the promise of guarantee proffered with these assertions, thus joining the new encirclement front against Germany. Under these circumstances I consider myself entitled to assume responsibility before my own conscience and before the history of the German people not only of assuring these countries or their governments of the falseness of British assertions, but also of setting the strongest power in the east, by especially solemn declarations, at rest concerning the limits of our interests.<br><br>National Socialists! At that time you probably all felt that this step was bitter and difficult for me. Never did the German people harbor hostile feeling against the peoples of Russia. However, for over ten years Jewish Bolshevist rulers had been endeavoring from Moscow to set not only Germany but all Europe aflame. At no time ever did Germany attempt to carry her National Socialist Weltanschauung into Russia, but on the contrary Jewish Bolshevist rulers in Moscow unswervingly endeavored to foist their domination upon us and other European peoples, not only by ideological means but above all with military force.<br><br>The consequences of the activity of this regime were nothing but chaos, misery and starvation in all countries. I, on the other hand, have been striving for twenty years with a minimum of intervention and without destroying our production, to arrive at a new Socialist order in Germany which not only eliminates unemployment but also permits the worker to receive an ever greater share of the fruits of his labor.<br><br>The success of this policy of economic and social reconstruction of our people, which by systematically eliminating differences of rank and class, has a true peoples' community as the final aim of the world.<br><br>It was therefore only with extreme difficulty that I brought myself in August, 1939, to send my Foreign Minister to Moscow in an endeavor there to oppose the British encirclement policy against Germany.<br><br>I did this only from a sense of all responsibility toward the German people, but above all in the hope after all of achieving permanent relief of tension and of being able to reduce sacrifices which might otherwise have been demanded of us.<br><br>While Germany solemnly affirmed in Moscow that the territories and countries enumerated-with the exception of Lithuania-lay outside all German political interests, a special agreement was concluded in case Britain were to succeed in inciting Poland actually into war with Germany.<br><br>In this case, too, German claims were subject to limitations entirely out of proportion to the achievement of German forces.<br><br>National Socialists! The consequences of this treaty which I myself desired and which was concluded in the interests of the German nation were very severe, particularly for Germans living in the countries concerned.<br><br>Far more than 500,000 German men and women, all small farmers, artisans and workmen, were forced to leave their former homeland practically overnight in order to escape from a new regime which at first threatened them with boundless misery and sooner or later with complete extermination.<br><br>Nevertheless, thousands of Germans disappeared. It was impossible ever to determine their fate, let alone their whereabouts.<br><br>Among them were no fewer than 160 men of German citizenship. To all this I remained silent because I had to. For, after all, it was my one desire to achieve final relief of tension and, if possible, a permanent settlement with this State.<br><br>However, already during our advance in Poland, Soviet rulers suddenly, contrary to the treaty, also claimed Lithuania.<br><br>The German Reich never had any intention of occupying Lithuania and not only failed to present any such demand to the Lithuanian Government, but on the contrary refused the request of the then Lithuania to send German troops to Lithuania for that purpose as inconsistent with the aims of German policy.<br><br>Despite all this I complied also with this fresh Russian demand. However, this was only the beginning of continually renewed extortions which kept on repeating ever since.<br><br>Victory in Poland which was won by German troops exclusively caused me to address yet another peace offer to the Western Powers. It was refused owing to efforts of international and Jewish warmongers.<br><br>At that time already the reason for such refusal lay in the fact that Britain still had hopes of being able to mobilize a European coalition against Germany which was to include the Balkans and Soviet Russia.<br><br>It was therefore decided in London to send Mr. Cripps [Sir Stafford Cripps] as Ambassador to Moscow. He received clear instructions under all circumstances to resume relations between the English and Soviet Russia and develop them in a pro-British direction. The British press reported on the progress of this mission as long as tactical reasons did not impose silence.<br><br>In the Autumn of 1939 and Spring of 1940 the first results actually made themselves felt. As Russia undertook to subjugate by armed force not only Finland but also the Baltic States she suddenly motivated this action by the assertion, as ridiculous as it was false, that she must protect these countries from an outside menace or forestall it.<br><br>This could only be meant to apply to Germany, for no other power could even gain entrance into the Baltic area, let alone go to war there. Still I had to be silent. However, those in power in the Kremlin immediately went further.<br><br>Whereas in the Spring of 1940 Germany, in accordance with the so-called pact of friendship, withdrew her forces from the Far Eastern frontier and, in fact, for the most part cleared these areas entirely of German troops, a concentration of Russian forces at that time was already beginning in a measure which could only be regarded as a deliberate threat to Germany.<br><br>According to a statement that Molotov [Soviet Foreign Minister and then Premier Vyachesiaff Molotov] personally made at that time, there were twenty-two Russian divisions in the Baltic States alone already in the Spring of 1940.<br><br>Since the Russian Government itself always claimed it was called in by the local population, the purpose of their presence there could only be a demonstration against Germany.<br><br>While our soldiers from May 5, 1940, on had been breaking Franco British power in the west, Russian military deployment on our eastern frontier was being continued to a more and more menacing extent.<br><br>From August, 1940, on I therefore considered it to be in the interest of the Reich no longer to permit our eastern provinces, which moreover had already been laid waste so often, to remain unprotected in the face of this tremendous concentration of Bolshevist divisions.<br><br>Thus there resulted British-Soviet Russian cooperation intended mainly at the tying up of such powerful forces in the east that radical conclusion of the war in the west, particularly as regards aircraft, could no longer be vouched for by the German High Command.<br><br>This, however, was in line with the objects not only of the British but also of the Soviet Russian policy, for both England and Soviet Russia intend to let this war go on for as long as possible in order to weaken all Europe and render it progressively more impotent.<br><br>Russia's threatened attack on Rumania was in the last analysis equally intended to gain possession of an important base, not only of Germany's but also of Europe's economic life, or at least destroy it. The Reich, especially since 1933, sought with unending patience to gain States in Southeast Europe as trading partners. We therefore also had the greatest interest in their internal constitutional consolidation and organization. Russia's advance into Rumania and Greece's tie-up with England threatened to turn these regions, too, within a short time into a general theatre of war.<br><br>Contrary to our principles and customs, and at the urgent request of the then Rumanian Government, which was itself responsible for this development, I advised acquiescence to the Soviet Russian demands for the sake of peace and the cession of Bessarabia.<br><br>The Rumanian Government believed, however, that it could answer for this before its own people only if Germany and Italy in compensation would at least guarantee the integrity of what still remained of Rumania.<br><br>I did so with heavy heart, principally because when the German Reich gives a guarantee that means it also abides by it. We are neither Englishmen nor Jews.<br><br>I still believe at this late hour to have served the cause of peace in that region, albeit by assuming serious personal obligation. In order, however, finally to solve these problems and achieve clarity concerning the Russian attitude toward Germany, as well as under pressure of continually increasing mobilization on our Eastern frontier, I invited Mr. Molotov to come to Berlin.<br><br>The Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs then demanded Germany's clarification of an agreement to the following four questions:<br><br>Point One was Molotov's question: Was the German guarantee for Rumania also directed against Soviet Russia in case of attack by Soviet Russia on Rumania?<br><br>My answer: The German guarantee is a general one and is unconditionally binding upon us. Russia, however, never declared to us that she had other interests in Rumania beyond Bessarabia. The occupation of Northern Bukovina had already been a violation of this assurance. I did not therefore think that Russia could now suddenly have more far-reaching intentions against Rumania.<br><br>Molotov's second question: That Russia again felt menaced by Finland. Russia was determined not to tolerate this. Was Germany ready not to give any aid to Finland and above all immediately to withdraw German relief troops marching through to Kirkenes?<br><br>My answer: Germany continued to have absolutely no political interests in Finland. A fresh war by Russia against the small Finnish people could not, however, be regarded any longer by the German Government as tolerable, all the more so as we could never believe Russia to be threatened by Finland. Under no circumstances did we want another theatre of war to arise in the Baltic.<br><br>Molotov's third question: Was Germany prepared to agree that Russia give a guarantee to Bulgaria and send Soviet Russian troops to Bulgaria for this purpose in connection with which he-Molotov-was prepared to state that the Soviets did not intend on that account, for example, to depose the King?<br><br>My answer: Bulgaria was a sovereign State and I had no knowledge that Bulgaria had ever asked Soviet Russia for any kind of guarantee such as Rumania had requested from Germany. Moreover, I would have to discuss the matter with my allies.<br><br>Molotov's fourth question: Soviet Russia required free passage through the Dardenelles under all circumstances and for her protection also demanded occupation of a number of important bases on the Dardenelles and Bosphorus. Was Germany in agreement with this or not?<br><br>My answer: Germany was prepared at all times to agree to alteration of the Statute of Montreux in favor of the Black Sea States. Germany was not prepared to agree to Russia's taking possession of bases on the Straits.<br><br>National Socialists! Here I adopted the only attitude that I could adopt as the responsible leader of the German Reich but also as the representative of European culture and civilization and conscious of my responsibility.<br><br>The consequence was to increase in Soviet Russia the activity directed against the Reich, above all, however, the immediate commencement of undermining the new Rumanian State from within and an attempt to remove the Bulgarian Government by propaganda.<br><br>With the help of the confused and immature leaders of the Rumanian Legion (Iron Guard) a coup d'etat was staged in Rumania whose aim was to overthrow Chief of State General Antonescu and produce chaos in the country so as to remove all legal power of the government and thus the precondition for an implement of the German guarantee.<br><br>I nevertheless still believed it best to remain silent.<br><br>Immediately after the failure of this undertaking, renewed reinforcement of concentrations of Russian troops on Germany's eastern frontier took place. Panzer detachments and parachutists were transferred in continually increasing numbers to dangerous proximity to the German frontier. German fighting forces and the German nation know that until a few weeks ago not a single tank or mechanized division was stationed on our eastern frontier.<br><br>If any final proof was required for the coalition meanwhile formed between England and Soviet Russia despite all diversion and camouflage, the Yugoslav conflict provided it.<br><br>While I made every effort to undertake a final attempt to pacify the Balkans and in sympathetic cooperation with Il Duce invited Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact, England and Soviet Russia in a joint conspiracy organized that coup d'etat which in one night removed the then government which had been ready to come to agreement.<br><br>For we can today inform the German nation that the Serb Putsch against Germany did not take place merely under the British, but primarily under Soviet Russian auspices. As we remained silent on this matter also, the Soviet leaders now went still one step further. They not only organized the Putsch, but a few days later also concluded that well-known friendship pact with the Serbs in their will to resist pacification of the Balkans and incite them against Germany.<br><br>And this was no platonic intention: Moscow demanded mobilization of the Serb Army.<br><br>Since even now I still believe it better not to speak, those in power in the Kremlin went still further: The Government of the German Reich today possesses documentary evidence which proves that Russia, in order finally to bring Serbia into the war, gave her a promise to supply her via Salonika with arms, aircraft, munitions and other war materials against Germany.<br><br>And this happened almost at the very moment when I myself advised Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka that eased tension with Russia always was in hope, thereby to serve the cause of peace.<br><br>Only the rapid advance of our incomparable divisions to Skoplie as well as the capture of Salonika itself frustrated the aims of this Soviet Russian-Anglo-Saxon plot. Officers of the Serb air force, however, fled to Russia and were there immediately received as allies.<br><br>The victory of the Axis Powers in the Balkans in the first instance thwarted the plan to involve Germany this Summer in months-long battles in Southeastern Europe while meantime steadily completing the alignment of Soviet Russian armies and increasing their readiness for war in order, finally, together with England and supported by American supplies anticipated, to crush the German Reich and Italy.<br><br>Thus Moscow not only broke but miserably betrayed the stipulations of our friendly agreement. All this was done while the rulers in the Kremlin, exactly as in the case of Finland and Rumania, up to the last moment pretended peace and friendship and drew up an ostensibly innocent dÃˆmenti.<br><br>Although until now I was forced by circumstances to keep silent again and again, the moment has now come when to continue as a mere observer would not only be a sin of omission but a crime against the German people-yes, even against the whole of Europe.<br><br>Today something like 160 Russian divisions are standing at our frontiers. For weeks constant violations of this frontier have taken place, not only affecting us but from the far north down to Rumania.<br><br>Russian airmen consider it sport nonchalantly to overlook these frontiers, presumably to prove to us that they already feel themselves masters of these territories.<br><br>During the night of June 17 to June 18 Russian patrols again penetrated into the Reich's territory and could only be driven back after prolonged firing. This has brought us to the hour when it is necessary for us to take steps against this plot devised by the Jewish Anglo-Saxon warmongers and equally the Jewish rulers of the Bolshevist center in Moscow.<br><br>German people! At this moment a march is taking place that, as regards extent, compares with the greatest the world hitherto has seen. United with their Finnish comrades, the fighters of the victory of Narvik are standing in the Northern Arctic. German divisions commanded by the conqueror of Norway, in cooperation with the heroes of Finnish freedom, under their marshal, are protecting Finnish soil.<br><br>Formations of the German Eastern Front extend from East Prussia to the Carpathians. German and Rumanian soldiers are united under Chief of State Antonescu from the banks of the Pruth along the lower reaches of the Danube to the shores of the Black Sea. The task of this front, therefore, no longer is the protection of single countries, but the safeguarding of Europe and thereby the salvation of all.<br><br>I therefore decided today again to lay the fate and future of the German Reich and our people in the hands of our soldiers.<br><br>May God help us especially in this fight!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun like ur nick too<br><br>------------------<br><img src="http://www.gorilla-haven.org/ghthumbnails/thtacagamathankyoufront.jpg"><br><br>Introduction to TCP/IP<br>Summary: TCP and IP were developed by a Department of Defense (DOD) research project to connect a number different networks designed by different vendors into a network of networks (the "Internet"). It was initially successful because it delivered a few basic services that everyone needs (file transfer, electronic mail, remote logon) across a very large number of client and server systems. Several computers in a small department can use TCP/IP (along with other protocols) on a single LAN. The IP component provides routing from the department to the enterprise network, then to regional networks, and finally to the global Internet. On the battlefield a communications network will sustain damage, so the DOD designed TCP/IP to be robust and automatically recover from any node or phone line failure. This design allows the construction of very large networks with less central management. However, because of the automatic recovery, network problems can go undiagnosed and uncorrected for long periods of time.<br><br>As with all other communications protocol, TCP/IP is composed of layers:<br><br>IP - is responsible for moving packet of data from node to node. IP forwards each packet based on a four byte destination address (the IP number). The Internet authorities assign ranges of numbers to different organizations. The organizations assign groups of their numbers to departments. IP operates on gateway machines that move data from department to organization to region and then around the world.<br>TCP - is responsible for verifying the correct delivery of data from client to server. Data can be lost in the intermediate network. TCP adds support to detect errors or lost data and to trigger retransmission until the data is correctly and completely received.<br>Sockets - is a name given to the package of subroutines that provide access to TCP/IP on most systems.<br>Network of Lowest Bidders<br>The Army puts out a bid on a computer and DEC wins the bid. The Air Force puts out a bid and IBM wins. The Navy bid is won by Unisys. Then the President decides to invade Grenada and the armed forces discover that their computers cannot talk to each other. The DOD must build a "network" out of systems each of which, by law, was delivered by the lowest bidder on a single contract.<br><br>The Internet Protocol was developed to create a Network of Networks (the "Internet"). Individual machines are first connected to a LAN (Ethernet or Token Ring). TCP/IP shares the LAN with other uses (a Novell file server, Windows for Workgroups peer systems). One device provides the TCP/IP connection between the LAN and the rest of the world.<br><br>To insure that all types of systems from all vendors can communicate, TCP/IP is absolutely standardized on the LAN. However, larger networks based on long distances and phone lines are more volatile. In the US, many large corporations would wish to reuse large internal networks based on IBM's SNA. In Europe, the national phone companies traditionally standardize on X.25. However, the sudden explosion of high speed microprocessors, fiber optics, and digital phone systems has created a burst of new options: ISDN, frame relay, FDDI, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM). New technologies arise and become obsolete within a few years. With cable TV and phone companies competing to build the National Information Superhighway, no single standard can govern citywide, nationwide, or worldwide communications.<br><br>The original design of TCP/IP as a Network of Networks fits nicely within the current technological uncertainty. TCP/IP data can be sent across a LAN, or it can be carried within an internal corporate SNA network, or it can piggyback on the cable TV service. Furthermore, machines connected to any of these networks can communicate to any other network through gateways supplied by the network vendor.<br><br>Addresses<br>Each technology has its own convention for transmitting messages between two machines within the same network. On a LAN, messages are sent between machines by supplying the six byte unique identifier (the "MAC" address). In an SNA network, every machine has Logical Units with their own network address. DECNET, Appletalk, and Novell IPX all have a scheme for assigning numbers to each local network and to each workstation attached to the network.<br><br>On top of these local or vendor specific network addresses, TCP/IP assigns a unique number to every workstation in the world. This "IP number" is a four byte value that, by convention, is expressed by converting each byte into a decimal number (0 to 255) and separating the bytes with a period. For example, the PC Lube and Tune server is 130.132.59.234.<br><br>An organization begins by sending electronic mail to Hostmaster@INTERNIC.NET requesting assignment of a network number. It is still possible for almost anyone to get assignment of a number for a small "Class C" network in which the first three bytes identify the network and the last byte identifies the individual computer. The author followed this procedure and was assigned the numbers 192.35.91.* for a network of computers at his house. Larger organizations can get a "Class B" network where the first two bytes identify the network and the last two bytes identify each of up to 64 thousand individual workstations. Yale's Class B network is 130.132, so all computers with IP address 130.132.*.* are connected through Yale.<br><br>The organization then connects to the Internet through one of a dozen regional or specialized network suppliers. The network vendor is given the subscriber network number and adds it to the routing configuration in its own machines and those of the other major network suppliers.<br><br>There is no mathematical formula that translates the numbers 192.35.91 or 130.132 into "Yale University" or "New Haven, CT." The machines that manage large regional networks or the central Internet routers managed by the National Science Foundation can only locate these networks by looking each network number up in a table. There are potentially thousands of Class B networks, and millions of Class C networks, but computer memory costs are low, so the tables are reasonable. Customers that connect to the Internet, even customers as large as IBM, do not need to maintain any information on other networks. They send all external data to the regional carrier to which they subscribe, and the regional carrier maintains the tables and does the appropriate routing.<br><br>New Haven is in a border state, split 50-50 between the Yankees and the Red Sox. In this spirit, Yale recently switched its connection from the Middle Atlantic regional network to the New England carrier. When the switch occurred, tables in the other regional areas and in the national spine had to be updated, so that traffic for 130.132 was routed through Boston instead of New Jersey. The large network carriers handle the paperwork and can perform such a switch given sufficient notice. During a conversion period, the university was connected to both networks so that messages could arrive through either path.<br><br>Subnets<br>Although the individual subscribers do not need to tabulate network numbers or provide explicit routing, it is convenient for most Class B networks to be internally managed as a much smaller and simpler version of the larger network organizations. It is common to subdivide the two bytes available for internal assignment into a one byte department number and a one byte workstation ID.<br><br>The enterprise network is built using commercially available TCP/IP router boxes. Each router has small tables with 255 entries to translate the one byte department number into selection of a destination Ethernet connected to one of the routers. Messages to the PC Lube and Tune server (130.132.59.234) are sent through the national and New England regional networks based on the 130.132 part of the number. Arriving at Yale, the 59 department ID selects an Ethernet connector in the C&amp; IS building. The 234 selects a particular workstation on that LAN. The Yale network must be updated as new Ethernets and departments are added, but it is not effected by changes outside the university or the movement of machines within the department.<br><br>A Uncertain Path<br>Every time a message arrives at an IP router, it makes an individual decision about where to send it next. There is concept of a session with a preselected path for all traffic. Consider a company with facilities in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Atlanta. It could build a network from four phone lines forming a loop (NY to Chicago to LA to Atlanta to NY). A message arriving at the NY router could go to LA via either Chicago or Atlanta. The reply could come back the other way.<br><br>How does the router make a decision between routes? There is no correct answer. Traffic could be routed by the "clockwise" algorithm (go NY to Atlanta, LA to Chicago). The routers could alternate, sending one message to Atlanta and the next to Chicago. More sophisticated routing measures traffic patterns and sends data through the least busy link.<br><br>If one phone line in this network breaks down, traffic can still reach its destination through a roundabout path. After losing the NY to Chicago line, data can be sent NY to Atlanta to LA to Chicago. This provides continued service though with degraded performance. This kind of recovery is the primary design feature of IP. The loss of the line is immediately detected by the routers in NY and Chicago, but somehow this information must be sent to the other nodes. Otherwise, LA could continue to send NY messages through Chicago, where they arrive at a "dead end." Each network adopts some Router Protocol which periodically updates the routing tables throughout the network with information about changes in route status.<br><br>If the size of the network grows, then the complexity of the routing updates will increase as will the cost of transmitting them. Building a single network that covers the entire US would be unreasonably complicated. Fortunately, the Internet is designed as a Network of Networks. This means that loops and redundancy are built into each regional carrier. The regional network handles its own problems and reroutes messages internally. Its Router Protocol updates the tables in its own routers, but no routing updates need to propagate from a regional carrier to the NSF spine or to the other regions (unless, of course, a subscriber switches permanently from one region to another).<br><br>Undiagnosed Problems<br>IBM designs its SNA networks to be centrally managed. If any error occurs, it is reported to the network authorities. By design, any error is a problem that should be corrected or repaired. IP networks, however, were designed to be robust. In battlefield conditions, the loss of a node or line is a normal circumstance. Casualties can be sorted out later on, but the network must stay up. So IP networks are robust. They automatically (and silently) reconfigure themselves when something goes wrong. If there is enough redundancy built into the system, then communication is maintained.<br><br>In 1975 when SNA was designed, such redundancy would be prohibitively expensive, or it might have been argued that only the Defense Department could afford it. Today, however, simple routers cost no more than a PC. However, the TCP/IP design that, "Errors are normal and can be largely ignored," produces problems of its own.<br><br>Data traffic is frequently organized around "hubs," much like airline traffic. One could imagine an IP router in Atlanta routing messages for smaller cities throughout the Southeast. The problem is that data arrives without a reservation. Airline companies experience the problem around major events, like the Super Bowl. Just before the game, everyone wants to fly into the city. After the game, everyone wants to fly out. Imbalance occurs on the network when something new gets advertised. Adam Curry announced the server at "mtv.com" and his regional carrier was swamped with traffic the next day. The problem is that messages come in from the entire world over high speed lines, but they go out to mvt.com over what was then a slow speed phone line.<br><br>Occasionally a snow storm cancels flights and airports fill up with stranded passengers. Many go off to hotels in town. When data arrives at a congested router, there is no place to send the overflow. Excess packets are simply discarded. It becomes the responsibility of the sender to retry the data a few seconds later and to persist until it finally gets through. This recovery is provided by the TCP component of the Internet protocol.<br><br>TCP was designed to recover from node or line failures where the network propagates routing table changes to all router nodes. Since the update takes some time, TCP is slow to initiate recovery. The TCP algorithms are not tuned to optimally handle packet loss due to traffic congestion. Instead, the traditional Internet response to traffic problems has been to increase the speed of lines and equipment in order to say ahead of growth in demand.<br><br>TCP treats the data as a stream of bytes. It logically assigns a sequence number to each byte. The TCP packet has a header that says, in effect, "This packet starts with byte 379642 and contains 200 bytes of data." The receiver can detect missing or incorrectly sequenced packets. TCP acknowledges data that has been received and retransmits data that has been lost. The TCP design means that error recovery is done end-to-end between the Client and Server machine. There is no formal standard for tracking problems in the middle of the network, though each network has adopted some ad hoc tools.<br><br>Need to Know<br>There are three levels of TCP/IP knowledge. Those who administer a regional or national network must design a system of long distance phone lines, dedicated routing devices, and very large configuration files. They must know the IP numbers and physical locations of thousands of subscriber networks. They must also have a formal network monitor strategy to detect problems and respond quickly.<br><br>Each large company or university that subscribes to the Internet must have an intermediate level of network organization and expertise. A half dozen routers might be configured to connect several dozen departmental LANs in several buildings. All traffic outside the organization would typically be routed to a single connection to a regional network provider.<br><br>However, the end user can install TCP/IP on a personal computer without any knowledge of either the corporate or regional network. Three pieces of information are required:<br><br>The IP address assigned to this personal computer<br>The part of the IP address (the subnet mask) that distinguishes other machines on the same LAN (messages can be sent to them directly) from machines in other departments or elsewhere in the world (which are sent to a router machine)<br>The IP address of the router machine that connects this LAN to the rest of the world.<br>In the case of the PCLT server, the IP address is 130.132.59.234. Since the first three bytes designate this department, a "subnet mask" is defined as 255.255.255.0 (255 is the largest byte value and represents the number with all bits turned on). It is a Yale convention (which we recommend to everyone) that the router for each department have station number 1 within the department network. Thus the PCLT router is 130.132.59.1. Thus the PCLT server is configured with the values:<br><br>My IP address: 130.132.59.234<br>Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0<br>Default router: 130.132.59.1<br>The subnet mask tells the server that any other machine with an IP address beginning 130.132.59.* is on the same department LAN, so messages are sent to it directly. Any IP address beginning with a different value is accessed indirectly by sending the message through the router at 130.132.59.1 (which is on the departmental LAN).<br><br>Additional information is available in self-study courses from SRA (1-800-SRA-1277)<br><br>TCP/IP [34610]<br><br>[This message has been edited by da_xing_xing (edited 31 May 2002).]</div>
