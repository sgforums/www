            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I've never done ths before.  This will come as a bit weird, but what the heck, we only live once <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  I don't think this is against forum rules anyway.<br><br>Some months ago, I was at PF Suntec Gym working out and minding my own business.  Suddenly, this guy wanted to use the gym equipment I occupied and we started talking.  We found that we had the same sports interest and thus became friends and training partners.<br><br>It turned out that this guy has just come back from years of studying overseas and was trying to build up his social circle again (a grim task many locals have to face after being away for years).  While he's doing fine with guy friends, he's apparently having a bit of trouble meeting the opposite sex.  I guess he's a bit shy in that sense.  I can understand that its not easy when starting from zilch.  So....being friends, I try to help lor.....which is the reason for posting this message.<br><br>A bit about him....he's Singaporean Chinese, in his mid-20's, 1.7+ (probably around 1.75), surprisingly mild-tempered, well-to-do, quite heavily into fitness...and I think he's on the lookout <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.  My friends, I sh1t you not when I say that he's one of the two decent chaps left in this world (the other one is me lah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ).<br><br>So, ladies, any takers? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">   Just to get to know each other.  Nothing pushy, nothing pressurising, nothing awkward, nothing embarrassing....and most of all, nothing commercial or indecent.  JUST FRIENDS.  Please either reply here or PM me - your choice.  I'd be happy to answer any serious questions too, either privately or publicly.<br><br>Would be very convenient if you're also a member of PF Suntec gym 'cos he works out there frequently.....perhaps we could all try to plan a time when everyone is in the gym together for a "say hi" session.  He's too shy to plan something like that himself - and it'll also be too awkward for him to do so.  (Shy is good mah....its a rough indication that he won't play around).<br><br>I suspect that I won't get many serious messages or PMs, but aiyah...worth the try lah, who knows?<br><br>PS:  For those who suspect that I'm advertising myself, sorry to disappoint you, but I'm way above that late-stage puberty age of 25.  Its impossible for me to pretend to be 25 anymore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">.<br><br>PPS:  Ladies only please.  He's straight as an arrow - on this, I'm very sure.<br><br>PPPS:  Yes, he knows I'm helping him in his sense, but he doesn't know how.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wahhh...thanks for the overwhelming response! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Fugue,<br><br>A man who doesn't stay home is not necessarily bad leh.  Maybe he's out there doing charity work every night?  Ahhh.....see?<br><br>OK, actually, he works in the day, then at night he goes gymming or dinner with friends.  He's also a member of more than one gym.  He's 25 lah, of course he won't stay home and waste his youth.<br><br>But yeah, I agree with you that the reverse is true.  A guy like me who spends lots of time at home is definitely a good guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>No lah, he doesn't sound like a gigolo.  Sounds like some lost kid who was a tsunami victim from Aceh being sold here in Singapore <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">.<br><br>Ching wan pu huei chia.....(sorry, my Mandarin sucks big time).<br><br>FireIce,<br><br>Thanks for the invite, although....sigh....I'm sad that I have to use someone else's photo as my avatar.  Next time I see him, I take a photo of his chest, then I'll sign up lah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>On Tenterhooks,<br><br>Of course one can say "no" in a warm and friendly way.  For example, "No, I'm sorry that you can't use the machine now.  But if you don't mind, I'd like to buy you dinner after gym tonight".  See?  Its not that hard. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I advertise myself many years already lah....still nobody wants.  I scared this friend of mine end up the same as me, so I help him lor.<br><br>Glad you found your personal trainer.  Is it tough?  Remember to ask questions and not just follow through blindly with the motion.  Only then can you gain knowledge for future use (which is what you want) and not just a shapely body.<br><br>Mistyblue,<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion....but first of all, I need to know more people here first (I'm new here) in order to organise some outing.<br><br>I don't think he's the play-play type, but then again there's a bit in that in all of us.  Overall, he's quite decent lah.<br><br>Actually, I find women above 25 most chio....and I know I'm not alone in this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">.  Er...you like guys in their 30's? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Care Bear,<br><br>Wah, still wallowing?  You not working today again ah?<br><br>See?  Ronnie_2600 also gave you the same advice as I did....take a 7-day free trial with each gym and see how you like each lor.   Thats the best way to judge for yourself.<br><br>I can't confirm this, but I've heard more than a few times the CF staff are very pushy.  If you take the free trial, they try to pressurise you to sign up, etc.  Even after you sign up, they try to pull more money out of you.  I don't know if its true.  Oh, also, there have been many complaints that CF is overcrowded.<br><br>If you drive, PF would be a better choice for parking.<br><br>If you are interested, I can enquire about PF's 7-day free trial.<br><br>Zodi,<br><br>Thanks for the link!  Wah, I didn't know there were so many programmes.  Looks interesting.<br><br>Besides badminton, do you guys do other sports, like say....er...boxing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  (kidding, kidding).<br><br>Ronnie_2600,<br><br>Thats exactly what I told Care Bear in another thread.  Are you a 'gymmer' (this is a word I conjured up) too?<br><br>I guess that about covers it all.  Time to take a short evening nap, then head down to PF again!  Happy Friday everyone!  I hope your work/business is better than mine.  I received only two calls from customers today - and both were complaints. No enquiries, not orders.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
