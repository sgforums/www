            <div class='col-md body'><br>... wat is the point of getting a degree or PHD even when u know the economy is not stable and that retrenchment is widespread?<br><br>Getting a degree has become too common in Singapore. Eventually one out of four Singaporean will be a graduate. Given that there are no natural resources in Singapore,  the quality of our workforce become the driving force of the economy.<br><br>The purpose of education prepare you to work in the society. Eventually, it drives down to your altitude in your work to remain viable to your company. If you are in demand, you can join another company.<br><br>.... Isnt this what everything about? About money?<br><br>Money is not everything. It is the root of all evil. It depend on what goals you want to seek in life.<br><br>2ndly wat is the point if u know that if u get retrenched, there goes all your chances of promotion and need to start from scratch again?<br><br>Be positive, fully assert yourself in your work. Learn and experience new ideas from your work. In the new economy, no one can promise you a life long career. But the experience and knowledge which you have learned will help you to be employable.<br><br>I wish you all the best in your endeavours.<br></div>

Ur starting pay will be higher than those without. Jobs in singapore are not as secure as before. U will get retrenchment once the coy see there is no need for ur service. But if u think that u will get retrenchment sooner or later and forget about further study just bcos of this, i think its too pessimistic. U gave up at such a young age, imagine what will happen when u r old. And as for trying to earn more than the rest...maybe u can try having more partimes or OTs. Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed,its hard to maintain jobs in singapore unless u are in an important position whereby its hard to find people to replace u. For me,i rather finish up my 4 years university studies rather than trying for masters or even PHDs,waste of money. Some companies rather hire masters/PHDs grads from overseas who doesnt mind a lower pay compared to u.<br><br>IMO,poly cert/degree is enough,it is the work quality and personality that is the most important. Provided with the right kind of attitude and meticulous in work,im sure there are employers out there who do recognise and value these. Work under these employers and u are sure to blossom.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a higher level education may not be only for the sake of money and even getting a job too. its to learn more knowledge and able to contribute to that given aspect of your studies - especially so on phd levels.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Getting the degree is like getting the key the unlock the door of company so that you got a chance to go inside interview and hence if got luck land the job. Without a degree it is useless. Having said that, once you enter the door it is your work performance that counts. Of cuz, this will exclude those scholars who already have their career path mapped out for them by powers above.<br><br>So to conclude, get a degree is to get a key as simple as that. Degree is not everything but at least you give you the initial boost in securing a potential job.<br><br>Btw, in england the ppl making most money in those suburbs are plumbers and electricians etc cuz there is a lack of such talent due to too many educated ppl there vying for a small set of professional openings hahahahahahahah..............maybe a handyman job can pay a lot after all hahahahahhahahh................  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
