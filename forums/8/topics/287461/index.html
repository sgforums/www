            <div class='col-md body'>Should go to DARUL ARQAM or better known as THE MUSLIM CONVERTS ASSOCIATION located at geylang Near to Kampong Melayu. the classes are conducted by lecturers who're able to help you understand more about this religion and also able to help you understand more better.<br><br>Together with other Non muslim you'll be discussing about sensitive issues without having to feel you're hurting anyone.<br><br>Join people from other countries who're also coming to listen and participate. If you have doubt about the teaching do not only check from websites or forums. these places might not be created by people who're qualified lecturers. just because we are born muslim does not mean we are following the guidance given by islam. also there are many who just wants to mislead people.<br><br>Just because somebody studied in NUS or NTU or even Oxford or Wales does not mean they are qualified to give you explaination on the topic. He must undergo studies in the Islamic university in order to teach.<br><br>Question: can you ask a Chinese teacher who studied Chinese language in the university something about chinese food. Yes he may be able to answer you but there's a limit to it because he only can answer what he knows from he's experience from everyday life but he does not go into in depth in the food topic cuz he is not a chef. in order to be a chef he needs to learn about food even if he eat chinese food everyday.<br><br>Hope this help. contact the association, the last seminar just ended tuesday 23/10 but a new one is starting soon so don miss it.</div>
