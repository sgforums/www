            <div class='col-md body'>if you were given a choice to BE a tai tai (meaning stay at home and no need to go out and work), would you say YES immediately or would you actually think about it and maybe even say NO?!<br><br>and guys... honestly, do you want your wife to stay at home or go out and work?<br><br>personally, as much i think being a stay home wife and maybe even one day be a rich man's wife.. i dont think i can sit around and shop all day. i hate shopping and i desperately NEED to work. i cannot dont work one lah. WOMEN also have dreams and goals that they want to achieve u know.<br><br>my bf wants me to stay at home and look after the kids but he also know i need to have my career and he let me. i think many men are like that! they would let their wives do whatever they want.<br><br>unless of course if you marry a rich man's son and he need a trophy wife to sit around all day and cannot move a finger except play mahjong, socialize and look pretty. Do you think its SO EASY to be a tai tai? do you know there are a lot of things you cannot do and other things u might not enjoy that you must do?<br><br>im sorry, i cannot live like that. could you?'<br><br>i think we're all a bit sick of this kinda man / woman related topics on sgforum lately so i mean let's just reach a blardy consensus ok?</div>
