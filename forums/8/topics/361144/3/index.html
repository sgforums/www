              <p><br>what standard?? there shouldn't be any benchmark to set on, we are the sisters, mothers, aunties and daughters of Singapore men, and if sgmen wishes to marry a PRC gals, by all means, so far, there is no objection from anyone. Just marry your PRC gals, be happy and we wish you the best, we can take care of ourselves, there is nothing to do with standard if you take on a PRC gal or maybe there is within the PRC gals, but definitely not us. We are born and breed here, what happen to both sexes in this society, both of us hv to take responsibility, given a choice, you will definitely choose a wonderful sg gal who can love you dearly, help you financially and raise a true breed Singapore family for you. So do we, we do hope to get a good sg man to marry to and have a lovely life. But if you talk about standard, what standard do you have in the first place, a true misconcept of us, if you like PRC gals, go ahead, or if you cannot get a sg gal and opts of a PRC gal, go ahead. There is nothing to be standardise about. But whether you can find true love with a PRC gal, u take care.</p>

              <p>A couple of things about this topic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On page 1, a member pointed out that SG girls make ok friends, but not good wives.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing about wealthy and educated countries is that it tends to benefit the women the most. They go from low education and housework to having univeristy education and the choice of many professions. It doesnt change much for men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So in SG, SG women find themselves equal or higher than the men, hence the achievers often flock to those they perceive as being higher- white men.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last weekend had a double spread on some of Singapore's Miss Singapore winners. Only Jamie Teo married an Asian. They rest were either still single or married Caucasians.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The "Rise of the Women", so to speak, has also affected white men. That's why millions of the poorer, older and lower class white men have married Thais and Philippinos. They are also marrying hundreds of thousands of PRC's in China too. (50,000 in 2006, 70,000 in 2007).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Equality for women in wealthy countries has really played a role in changing things. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men in countries like Singapore have to marry those from poor countries in order to marry down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>More and more educated Asian women are marrying up.....to Ang Mohs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But is this really a problem, or just a shift in behaviour we should all just accept?</p>

              <p>More and more educated Asian women are marrying up.....to Ang Mohs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But is this really a problem, or just a shift in behaviour we should all just accept?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans guys cant match Ang Moh's, at least the expat ones, because they have the American and British culture backing them, and they have higher paid and positioned jobs, and they are often nicer, friendlier, more outgoing, physically bigger and more worldly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In contrast, Singaporeran guys are skinnier, shorter, nerdier (most guys wear glasses and study, play role playing games and play hardly any sports) are locked into this tiny island, and are often spoilt by their mothers and maids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Are there outgoing confident Singaporean guys around?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But not many compared to Ang Moh's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's why so many Mediacorp women and most of the Miss Singapore's married Ang Moh's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And it's my expereince that Singaporean ladies who are educated and make it to senior management or above usually have dated ang moh's at least once or twice, and have many of them in their circle of friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is just my own opinion, but I think the only Singaporean guys who have the social clout to match the Ang Moh's are doctors. But there's not many of them, and they are usually snapped up by pretty girls during university or soon after graduation.</p>

              <p>I noticed one thing.</p>
              <p>They needed to feel superior to their gal.</p>
              <p>If the gal has money.. has a good education. What else is there for SG men to offer her gal ?</p>

              <p>Most men do not mind marrying a wife who is of a lower socio-economic status.</p>
              <p>This is different with women. Most women would mind marrying someone who is not their equal.</p>
              <p>For men, they will think about beauty, compatibility, family acceptance, same values, and then educational/ financial status.

              <p>I think this is different with women who would place educational/ financial status at a higher level priority.</p>
              <p>So that is why for you gals out there, dont be surprised and look down on men who marry "downwards", because men's thinking is different. For men, it is implied and ingrained that men should be the dominant person and should persue career and status, so in his mind, he is looking for a "supporter" or a "companion" while a woman's mind is looking for a "protector" or a "guardian". It's a different kind of thinking and different positioning based on each gender's roles and values, which is ingrained.</p>
              <p>So that is why I dont look down on men who marry "mail-order-brides" as long as they are serious and they can establish a harmonious family.</p>
              <p>My only objection is people who marry Thai and Viet brides, because I am a bit racist.</p>

              <p>Due to not enough land, space is cramped, people cannot excercise so much, and spent too much time in near-work activities (reading, computer) which results in near-sightedness and nerdiness.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a high value knowledge economy, everybody is stressed, everybody need to load up on knowledge (high studies hours, even plus tuition) which continues even after working life (work until late in night).</p>

              <p>But that notion about " If the gal loves you .. she will accept your every flaw". That has to go first. Because in a man-woman relationship.. that just doesn't work.</p>
              <p>For a human being to fall in love.. and stay in love. They need to have a reason to love.</p>
              <p>I just don't understand why guys are so unwilling to be externally attractive to gals ?</p>
              <p>Sure mommys says.. she must love you for who you are. But if she wasn't attracted to you externally in the first place.. what makes guys think he will have a chance to show her his inner beauty ?</p>
              <p>i believe Asian guys can be attractive . If they want to. But most are simply too lazy.</p>

                  look down on men who marry "downwards", because men's thinking is
                  different. For men, it is implied and ingrained that men should be
                  the dominant person and should persue career and status, so in his
                  mind, he is looking for a "supporter" or a "companion" while a
                  woman's mind is looking for a "protector" or a "guardian". It's a
                  different kind of thinking and different positioning based on each
                  gender's roles and values, which is ingrained.</p>
              <p>So that is why I dont look down on men who marry
                  "mail-order-brides" as long as they are serious and they can
                  establish a harmonious family.</p>
              <p>My only objection is people who marry Thai and Viet brides,
                  because I am a bit racist.</p>

              <p>As third world countries in our region becomes more economically viable. There will be less women whom will fall into the categories men sought after.</p>

              <p>Being skinny and nerdy is due to environment.</p>
              <p>Due to not enough land, space is cramped, people cannot
              excercise so much, and spent too much time in near-work activities
              (reading, computer) which results in near-sightedness and
              nerdiness.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a high value knowledge economy, everybody is
              stressed, everybody need to load up on knowledge (high studies
              hours, even plus tuition) which continues even after working life
              (work until late in night).</p>
              <p>If you want to see more people excercising and moving away from
              nerdiness, first and foremost the environment must change. If
              Singapore economy is still dependant on knowledge economy, nothing
              will change. Unless if tomorrow Singapore finds oil field near
              Sentosa island or something like that. Then Singapore populace can
              relax a bit.</p>

              <p>But that notion about " If the gal loves you .. she will accept your every flaw". That has to go first. Because in a man-woman relationship.. that just doesn't work.</p>
              <p>For a human being to fall in love.. and stay in love. They need to have a reason to love.</p>
              <p>I just don't understand why guys are so unwilling to be externally attractive to gals ?</p>
              <p>Sure mommys says.. she must love you for who you are. But if she wasn't attracted to you externally in the first place.. what makes guys think he will have a chance to show her his inner beauty ?</p>
              <p>i believe Asian guys can be attractive . If they want to. But most are simply too lazy.</p>

              <p>I actually disagree with you about the flaws. I think both men and women have to open their minds and accept that both have flaws, to accept the good with the bad. I think both have expectations of the opposite sex that are really very difficult to find.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One thing about women becoming more educated is that they are not so willing to accept flaws anymore since their expectations have risen in line with their education and professions. SInce they essentially live, speak and do the same things as the men, they arent going to find a very different "higher" Singaporean guy very easily. Hence they turn to Ang Moh's.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men, on the other hand, have increased their expectations of how a woman should look and behave. The internet hasnt helped- while women are supposed to act like virgins, they are also expected to be sexual dynamos at the same time and know how to act like American porn stars (and take it on the face, if you know what I mean).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The mother's havent helped either.</p>
              <p>I agree with you about guys needing to smarten up and look good. I'm quite aware of this cuz I'm overweight and fighting a losing battle with my tummy :(</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know one guy who I knew as an acquaintance. Very nerdy church guy. Bowl haircut, thin, shy. Didnt see him for about a year. Next time I saw him I literally did a double take- He still wore the loser gold rimmed glasses, but he bulked up massively. He was just like Arnie. If he wore contacts or did lasik, he'd have been awesome.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But you know what jojo? I think it's going to be hard for Singaporean guys to smarten up their looks. I know a lot of Singaporeans dont like Hong Kong style of fashion, and most guys would be too scared to let their hair grow longer.</p>

              <p>Singaproean guys really need to find themselves a niche in the relationship market. It's either they evolve or be left behind.</p>
              <p>Girls don't need guys Hong Kong high fashion nor long hair to be attractive.</p>
              <p>Singaporean guys have this very distinctive aura of insecurities about them.. that makes them less attractive in a manly sense. And dressing up nerdy , hoping for the best.. ain't helping much either.</p>
              <p>I really hope to see more well groomed males in our society.</p>
              <p>If a guy can exude self-confidence.. he is attractive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The biggest bane for SG guys are mommy boys. There are more mommy boys in our nation than those of ang mohs.</p>
              <p>In ang moh countries.. there are also mommy boys.. and these are the men who has the bigger chances of getting divorced or left on the shelves.</p>
              <p>Gals simply don't find mommy boys attractive at all.</p>
              <p>The more mommy boys we have in Sg.. the less chances the relationship success rates of sg guys in SG.</p>
              <p>Mothers are always good at teaching guys how to be a good son. Just they are not good at teaching their son how to be a good gf or husband.</p>
