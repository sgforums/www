              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>China wives</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-Shapely figure compared to SG girls. Their waist curve in and hips portrude out. Very obvious. The really pretty ones (quite rare) are really chio.....can easily compete with the prettiest SG chick and yet win, because their eyes very alive, very shiny (not dry)</p>
              <p>-Said to be better in bed</p>
              <p>-the good ones are very sweet and know how to behave like real women and make their men feel like real man</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>-gives me a dirty, unhygiene feel (maybe due to chinese products being unhygiene and dirtier)</p>
              <p>-accent is very annoying.....Huang Hui's type of accent is ok, but those whose accent is very thick i cannot stand</p>
              <p>-it's a gamble......what if she leaves you to be with ang-moh? or be with richer guy?</p>
              <p>-dress sense and fashion is quite bad for most of them (a lot)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SG wives</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-Majority of SG girls u see on the streets daily are prettier than majority of their counterparts in other asian countries (although our prettiest lose out to their prettiest)</p>
              <p>-more intelligent in terms of knowledge and academia</p>
              <p>-easier to dupe and con (this is very true!!!!!!!!) and that means easy prey for us real men</p>
              <p>-generally cuter and cleaner</p>
              <p>-doesn't have strange accent</p>
              <p>-can connect more easily due to same culture</p>
              <p>-nicer to fark and bully in bed, easy to tame and train;</p>
              <p>-very nice to flirt with</p>
              <p>-has high perceived value. according to industry estimates, 1 SG girl is worth more than the combined sum of 45 girl of other asian nationalities, and 1 SG girl is worth about the same as 7 Caucasian girls</p>
              <p>-when people hear u've SG wife, their reaction is "Whoa......power man! Must be a real man with a real dick!!!!!"</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>-Very materialistic (most, NOT ALL)</p>
              <p>-not very street-wise and smart; not very sharp</p>
              <p>-the young ones nowadays can be very career minded and aggresive due to corporate culture</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VERDICT: SG girls are still the woman of choice for most men in this world.</p>
              <p>tasty, fresh-out-of-the-oven and babelicious. i told myself and swore before heaven that if i cannot have SG wife, i rather remain bacherlor forever.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>China wives</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-Shapely figure compared to SG girls. Their waist curve in and hips portrude out. Very obvious. The really pretty ones (quite rare) are really chio.....can easily compete with the prettiest SG chick and yet win, because their eyes very alive, very shiny (not dry)</p>
              <p>-Said to be better in bed</p>
              <p>-the good ones are very sweet and know how to behave like real women and make their men feel like real man</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>-gives me a dirty, unhygiene feel (maybe due to chinese products being unhygiene and dirtier)</p>
              <p>-accent is very annoying.....Huang Hui's type of accent is ok, but those whose accent is very thick i cannot stand</p>
              <p>-it's a gamble......what if she leaves you to be with ang-moh? or be with richer guy?</p>
              <p>-dress sense and fashion is quite bad for most of them (a lot)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SG wives</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-Majority of SG girls u see on the streets daily are prettier than majority of their counterparts in other asian countries (although our prettiest lose out to their prettiest)</p>
              <p>-more intelligent in terms of knowledge and academia</p>
              <p>-easier to dupe and con (this is very true!!!!!!!!) and that means easy prey for us real men</p>
              <p>-generally cuter and cleaner</p>
              <p>-doesn't have strange accent</p>
              <p>-can connect more easily due to same culture</p>
              <p>-nicer to fark and bully in bed, easy to tame and train;</p>
              <p>-very nice to flirt with</p>
              <p>-has high perceived value. according to industry estimates, 1 SG girl is worth more than the combined sum of 45 girl of other asian nationalities, and 1 SG girl is worth about the same as 7 Caucasian girls</p>
              <p>-when people hear u've SG wife, their reaction is "Whoa......power man! Must be a real man with a real dick!!!!!"</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>-Very materialistic (most, NOT ALL)</p>
              <p>-not very street-wise and smart; not very sharp</p>
              <p>-the young ones nowadays can be very career minded and aggresive due to corporate culture</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VERDICT: SG girls are still the woman of choice for most men in this world.</p>
              <p>tasty, fresh-out-of-the-oven and babelicious. i told myself and swore before heaven that if i cannot have SG wife, i rather remain bacherlor forever.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Foreign Husband</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-More sexy than sg men, well dress for any occasion, usually bigger and stronger, and definitely more romantic and cheerful, good in manner, very creative, very gentlemenship and treat gender on equal footing, respect wifey and speak out things that doesn't go right on the spot rather than keeping it in the heart. Respect each other culture and take life more easy going. Love family.</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>--Like to flirt but limited, weak in saving, like to travel, adventures, particpate in dangerous sport, like to drink beer and need to give them freedom.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>SG husband</strong></span></p>
              <p>Pros:</p>
              <p>-Very conservatives, filial piety to his parents, workaholic, thirfty in term of saving, drink lesser, can be controlled, obedient to govt, dun like to travel much, law abiding, danger conscious, flirt less due to weaker condition</p>
              <p>-more intelligent in terms of work and academia</p>
              <p>-easier to dupe and con (this is very true!!!!!!!!) by us, the sg gal into parting his material</p>
              <p>-doesn't have strange accent</p>
              <p>-can connect more easily due to same culture</p>
              <p>-easier to deal in bed, less pattern and very easily get weak-very nice to flirt with their money</p>
              <p>-has high perceived value. according to industry estimates, 1 SG men is worth more than the combined sum of 100 workers of other asian nationalities, and 1 SG man is worth about the same as 7 Bangala men.</p>
              <p>-when people hear u've SG man, their reaction is "Whoa......power gal! Chop them hard hard!!!!!"</p>
              <p>Cons:</p>
              <p>-Not very fun in bed due to lamer organs, yet like to act with a kind male chauvinism, which is actually very lame, like to uphold their ego even provern wrong.</p>
              <p>-easily subdue to gay activitives-the young ones nowadays can be very career minded with a bull drive to out run we gals, but usually end up in a wall.</p>
              <p>-easily con by other nationalities gals and yet act machosim, fall prey to materialism, believing love belong to them only, very kiasee and kiasu the wife talk to other men, lack of gentlemenship</p>
              <p>-Like to complain alot especially on the govt issues but offer no solution, expect wife to listen to his whining, always like to talk about the pass when the police are wearing shorts. Very sissy culture.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VERDICT: SG men are still the woman of choice for most gal in this world.</p>
              <p>easy to Con and chop, loose also act win, just let them win and they will give whatever you ask for, can fully take advantage of their male chauvinism weakness. Weak in bed, so we dun hv to work so hard. And finally, very easily subdue to their knees by fake praising.</p>
