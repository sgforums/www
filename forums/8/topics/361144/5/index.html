              <p><strong>The Star Online, 30 May 2009, Seah Chiang
                                      Nee</strong><br> <br> <span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Made-to-order
                                      playmaids</strong></span><br> <br> <strong>No contract, no marriage, no legal complications. The woman
                                      just moves in as part-time mistress and home minder.</strong><br> <br> Big Brother Chen, can you help me find a boyfriend as soon as
                                      possible?<br> <br> This appeal was made to an old acquaintance of mine one recent
                                      night by a Chinese immigrant, who was working as a beer
                                      promoter.<br> <br> For those unfamiliar with the latest social changes brought about
                                      by the influx of mainland Chinese here, the request might sound
                                      baffling, but not to my friend. He had heard it several times
                                      before.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>What the middle-age lady wanted
                                      was to be introduced to a Singaporean man who was a widower or a
                                      divorcee of any age, who could do with a live-in companion.<br> <br> For S$300 a month, she would move in with him as a part-time
                                      mistress and home minder.<br> <br> In return she would earn extra money to add to her salary selling
                                      beer, as well as free board and lodging that she would otherwise
                                      have to spend on herself.</strong></span><br> <br> It’s mutually beneficial, since the man could have a
                                      companion-cum-domestic help at half the cost of a full-time maid
                                      (plus levy).<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>No contract, no marriage, no
                                      legal complications! It is temporary and no notice of termination
                                      is needed. “Just say goodbye and pack your bags’” she
                                      said.</strong></span><br> <br> How widespread such arrangements are is anyone’s guess, but it is
                                      believed to be on the rise, particularly in view of the severe
                                      downturn when jobs for the ladies are scarce.<br> <br> According to agents importing Chinese workers, the practice has
                                      become popular among elderly Singaporeans who are living
                                      alone.<br> <br> “These are lonely men whose wife has died or who are divorced, and
                                      their married children long gone, so the companionship is as
                                      important as the sex,” said one agent.<br> <br> It is useful to eliminate the risk of lonely, vulnerable men being
                                      cheated by a foreign spouse.<br> <br> Such cheating cases have been on the rise where the Chinese “wife”
                                      disappeared after she had emptied the man’s savings.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>“Live-in” companionship is the
                                      latest practice to emerge from a society that is fast changing
                                      under the weight of an influx of foreign
                                      immigrants.</strong></span> While it is deemed harmful to the
                                      institution of marriage and family, there is, however, a growing
                                      acceptance that it does meet a pressing need of lonely old
                                      men.<br> <br> “Since no marriage is involved, it doesn’t change Singapore’s
                                      family unit because these men live alone,” a retiree rationalised.
                                      “At least no one has to be cheated.”<br> <br> The conservatives, however, disagree. “It just panders to the
                                      lecherous demands of the men,” said a housewife.<br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>This issue of temporary
                                      mistresses and marriage scams in Singapore mostly involve Chinese
                                      mainlanders because of ethnic familiarity.</strong></span><br> <br> <span style="color: red;"><strong>The tidal wave of arrivals in
                                      recent years – especially the women – has brought about tremendous
                                      social changes to this small island that are both good and
                                      bad.</strong></span><br> <br> It has added to a vibrancy never experienced before, but it has
                                      also created social friction among the locals, including family
                                      break-ups.<br> <br> Their number is unknown. According to Tian Fu Club, a clan
                                      association formed by the mainlanders here, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>300,000-400,000 Chinese have become
                                      citizens or permanent residents here.</strong></span></span><br> <br> Many are young women who have left families behind in rural China
                                      to come for that pot of gold after investing a small fortune in
                                      fees to agents to fix them a job or a “student” pass (there are
                                      90,000 of the latter).<br> <br> “These women are tough, determined and they believe that Singapore
                                      is rich,” said my friend, who once witnessed an angry exchange
                                      between two mainland factory workers.<br> <br> One was furious with her friend for dating a China mainland man.
                                      “You are silly. You remember why we left our village to come here;
                                      it’s to earn money,” she rebuked her.<br> <br> “How can you waste time with a penny-less ‘Ah Tong’ (slant for
                                      Chinese man)?” she wanted to know. “Get a Singaporean.”<br> <br> The vast majority lives a decent, hard-working life and returns
                                      home when the time comes, but a minority falls prey to the
                                      temptation of easy money.<br> <br> The best pickings can be found among lonely retirees who live alone
                                      on their Central Provident Fund retirement savings.<br> <br> The CPF amount, however uninspiring to the locals – is a fortune in
                                      most parts of China. For that, a number of women will readily break
                                      hearts and families.<br> <br> Worse still, the victim often gets no sympathy among fellow
                                      Singaporeans for his “lustful behaviour” chasing after young
                                      skirts.<br> <br> One private investigator told the press that his company was
                                      getting more requests for help by wives here to investigate
                                      husbands who they suspect were keeping a China mistress.<br> <br> On the average of 50 extramarital cases that his firm handled a
                                      month in the last two years, 20 would involve a “China student” as
                                      the third party.<br> <br> In a recent reported case, one student-mistress lived off a
                                      stockbroker like a rich tai-tai for months, before leaving behind
                                      large credit card bills, a tearful wife and a broken
                                      marriage.<br> <br> I can go on and on with such tales.<br> <br> “They are giving a poor – I must say undeserved — image that
                                      Chinese women are home wreckers,” said the agent.<br> <br> “The vast majority works hard to earn an honest living.”<br> <br> Like all capitalistic pursuits here, this practice also stems from
                                      balancing supply and demand, which means the men must share the
                                      blame.<br> <br> Professor Fu Tan-ming, a social behavioural analyst who is based in
                                      Beijing, noted that Chinese women with a history of suffering are
                                      more resilient than the men.<br> <br> “They have a stubborn streak in them that propels them forward,” he
                                      said.<br> <br> “They would not think twice about packing up their bags to begin
                                      life anew thousands of miles away from home. Why? It’s because they
                                      know they can survive.”</p>

              <p>Yes! CHinese products are SHIT, they are not built to last like our western european works craftsmanship. My father still has his old english bicycle from 1965 complete with an internal gear system and it still runs! I got my nephew a mountain bike made in china and the darn thing broke after a couple of weeks, and dig this, the brake handles are made of cheap plastic but are spray-painted to look like metal.</p>
              <p><br>Its part of the crap chinese work culture of export export, short term money thinking. Horrible. They'll be like us some day and make something that lasts.</p>
