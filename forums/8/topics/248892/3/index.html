            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jondizzle foshizzle:</div><div class="quote_body">Being a teenager myself and having experienced life in different cultures, I have come to notice an undeniable fact - that Singaporean teens are some of the most well-behaved. In almost any other country teens do drugs, have underage sex, drink alcohol and smoke. Yet none of this happens at secondary schools in Singapore yet in Australia it would be extremely unusual to find a school whose students don't do these things. Whereas in Singapore all that teens are concerned are about their exams all they seem to do is study, study and study some more. Perhaps it's the extremely strict Singaporean laws or the general lifestyle here but your opinions would be much appreciated thanks.</div></blockquote>Non-existence of bad = ? Good or Bad?<br><br>SG as you can see is a small dot. Easy to be controlled and manipulate. What is ideal? Drugs? Smoke? At young age? Or do we perceive it as freedom? Or do we see them as evil. Both. So should we pursue them? I ask again. What is ideal?<br><br>Differences in cultures. In religions. In individualistic preferences. What is ideal? An integrated sole superior set of culture/religion? Or a harmonious network of multi-racial cultures? I ask again. What is ideal?<br><br>The world we know for sure decides on one thing. Good over bad. Right over wrong. If we have total goods and rights. Absence of bads and wrongs. Good or bad?<br><br>I leave my views and opinions in short sentences. In questions. To provoke your thoughts. To think deeply. To truly understand yourself. We are all humans. But not the same. Same maybe but not identical. Sorry to waste the time of non-thinkers. Congrats to the thinkers.<br><br>Play nice. Be good. Or not?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
