In almost any other country teens do drugs, have underage sex, drink alcohol and smoke.

            <div class='col-md body'>yup, i agree that singaporean youths are doing more drugs, more porn, more smoking, more fighting, more drinking and other supposed vices.<br><br>apparently that's called globalisation and it's the same reason the Ministers are using to substaniate their pay increments.<br><br>But I digress..<br><br>However I don't think for drugs, prostitution and armed robbery... these are not as widespread as other neighbouring nations. You've got to attribute it to social factors...i still feel as a whole our teens are doing pretty 'decent' things.<br><br>But of course smoking, drinking, fighting and what not... that's common in sg.</div>
