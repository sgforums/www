            <div class='col-md body'>Do not forget people that this is not a debate. Each path has its own strengths and weaknesses. It is up to the person to choose the path he wishes, and to proceed from there.<br><br>The Poly Path was originally intended to cater for students who could not qualify for JC. The objective was to teach them a skill, so that they could join the workforce once they graduate.<br><br>The JC Path has always been the same. It is to prepare students to go to the university to obtain at least a degree. Have I got all these right? Please update me if I am wrong.<br><br>However, the government did not forsee that there would poly graduates who did not want to join the workforce, but who instead wished to continue their studies. This number of poly graduates who wish to further their studies has been growing and is still growing.<br><br>Now, there is a problem. NTU and NUS were there to cater only to the JC students at first. Now Poly graduates want to have a chance to further their studies at these places as well. But NUS and NTU cannot allocate enough places to satisy them, because they were there to cater to JC students, not Poly Graduates.<br><br>So the Poly graduates have no choice but to either go to work or further their studies overseas. Not everyone can afford the cost of studying overseas, so those who cannot want to study at the local universities.<br><br>But like I said earlier, the universities were there originally to cater only to JC students. And due to the limited number of places, only a small fraction of Poly graduates could manage to get a place. Imagine two universities catering to graduates from 14 JCs and 4 Polys, not to mention foreign students as well. There is simply not enough space for everyone. I am not counting the places of SMU in this case; the number of places they have are not significant yet.<br><br>So some people started to complain about this, and the whole thing became JC vs Poly, when there is actually no conflict at all. It is not a faceoff. And here I see people arguing about this, trying to prove that each is better than the other.<br><br>Well, I shall state my opinions objectively. Choose the JC path if you are certain that you will be able to make it to a university, because frankly an 'A' level certificate is not a job certicate. Be prepared for fierce competition for limited places. There are 14 JCs and only two universities.<br><br>Choose the Poly path if you wish to obtain a job certificate and have no plans to further your studies yet. After all, a diploma does command  higher pay and rank compared with an 'A' level certificate, but of course, the best is still a degree at least.<br><br>There are factors that may influence or affect your decision directly or indirectly, and you may have no choice at all. For me, I got a E8 for my mandarin paper, so there is no way I am going to qualify for JC. Yes, I am not afraid to say that my mandarin is like shit, and I do not give a damn about Chinese culture sorry.<br><br>So I had to go to a polytechnic. Is that the end of the world? Now, in just six months, I will be graduating from Temasek Polytechnic. I have plans to further my studies in NTU, which is why I have chosen an elective that will enable me to do so.<br><br>Bottom line: It's your choice, your life. You do want you want.<br><br>------------------<br>This is merely the path I have chosen. You decide yours.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>terence<br><br>in fact...i wansn't really happy with PM Goh's classification of people into the Categories of heartlanders and cosmopolitans but i gave it a second thought and i realized that what he did was to identify certain trends of the population. PM goh made it clear that singapore needed both groups to keep it together. however he encourages the cosmopoliton way of living.<br>and i guess that it would only be good for the country.<br><br>you see, generalisation can be good or bad. i wouldn't say that PM Goh's plans are evil. he wants a change but it dosen't involve destruction and murder. being a heartlander also does not make you inferior. you cannot compare the PM thoughts with Hitler. it's a totally different agenda.<br><br>maybe i went overboard by comparing you with Hitler but next time when you make a "light remark" do think twice and don't forget to say that it does not reflect you personal views cos' you really pissed many people off by casting the poly pple in such and inferior light. as hitler did to the jews.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ticonderoga (edited 20 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Relek lah, all. Don't go Poly or JC... go private school best, like me... Hahahah...<br><br>Jokes aside, I would have chosen Poly if I could turn back the clock. I took my 'A's privately (I got a full cert, not great results but still full.. in case ppl think private A level students are even more inferior to JC/Poly students  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">) and I would have liked to go poly.<br><br>More technically inclined, more industrial experience, and if u get good results, u can jump to year 2 of Uni, which closes the 1 yr gap advantage that JC students supposedly have.<br><br>And Terence is rite about MOST poly students being a bit 'Cheena Helicopter'... but then again, JC also produces the arrogant-rich men son-young master swines  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> that make me just wanna hang out with down-to-earth people. Both places produce good and bad ppl. Bottomline, it's who u are, not where u go.<br><br>So, Racife, u want some real skills, I believe Poly is better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Esp if u wanna go the IT way.<br><br>------------------<br>Is it cold in here, or is it just me?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Terence,<br><br>At this juncture, it is perhaps evident that the dialectical aspect of such a forum (and indeed the presence of such a thread) should alert you to state of mind of the receipiants. Continguous to this, I somehow doubt that your remark made earlier lends itself to the purpose it you deigned it to be.<br><br>Yes, I did spot that "oh boy" appended and was laughing so hard... simply because, in the one and zeros of the digital Acropolis, a different yardstick is applied when discussions take place. The surface is often skimmed and is accepted without deeper inquiry. The reactionary and furious remarks are thus well-justified IN THEIR CONTEXT.  :p A friend is wont to say, "This is IRC (or in this case a BB)...!" and in that, hermeneutically encapsulates the reality of the situation. This simply means that formal expectations of what constitutes meaningful discourse are thrown out of the window.<br><br>On a separate note, I gather you must be at least around 26 and while we can be PC and declare that maturity is not poportional to age, looking at the posts in this forum, most of the respondants are in their late teens or very early twenties ... where issues such as NS and Poly/JCs are still relevant. Think back, Terence, do you seriously think that the majority (yes, I dun mean ALL)at that tender age, having seen and been disappointed less in life, have the ability to take a step back and respond with poise?<br><br>I followed the whole of the Hitler issue ... and I understand what you are trying to do here. i.e. Hopefully, someone will see that Hitler has became for all intents and purposes, a convienent (thus unthinking) target in the siting of blame in prejudice.<br><br>To MIND and TICON, I understand your agitation at Terence's remarks but unfortunately, Hitler is simply too big to use as a rebuttal. Yes, there are so many other reasons to why the genocide happened and frankly, it's not because of one man's delusions. So to say that Hitler was elitist is quite funny because he was more than that and at the same time, less than that. Lest I sound like an apologist for the third reich, I just want to perhaps point out that making specious arguments is also tantamount to sweeping generalisations.<br><br>I'm sorry if this takes out space from the Poly/JC issue, but something need to be said abt the quality of responses here in the forum.<br><br>Thank you for your time  :p and pardon the spelling... I am not good at that at all.<br><br>------------------<br>Cindy Crawford,<br>ON COURAGE...<br>"They were doing a full back shot of me in a swimsuit and I thought, Oh my God, I have to be so brave.

            <div class='col-md body'>Barclays,<br><br>I'm glad you saw the nuance of the 'oh boy' remark. Not many people got it.<br><br>I didn't know the average age in this forum when I first started but now I'm getting a clear picture. It may be true that age and maturity don't go hand in hand but it sure as hell isnÂ’t looking that way here. I realise the relevance of JC, NS and poly to this age group and that was why I expected some honest and thoughtful replies. I didnÂ’t expect poise or eloquent rebuttals Â– IÂ’m not that naÃ¯ve Â– but I also didnÂ’t expect obstreperous and blind diatribes. YouÂ’re probably right in saying formal dialectic doesnÂ’t not exist in this medium. This could be due to the fact that people donÂ’t actually read carefully before writing. Even between my last post and this one I still see glaring misinterpretations even after my last post was as clearly laid out an agenda as I could have written. IÂ’m not going to reply to the repeated misinterpretations. But thanks for your clear-headedness and reason, believe you me, I appreciate it in this place.<br><br>By the way, I bank with you!<br>Cheers.<br></div>
