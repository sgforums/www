            <div class='col-md body'>terence,<br><br>i suggest you take back you words. generalisation and discrediting of such a large group of people is parallel only with the thoughts of people like Hilter.i'm downright disgusted by how you feel. in fact i still don't believe people can bear such thoughts in this day and age.<br><br>there may be a certain norm or a culture that poly students have which is different from JC students but that dosen't mean we  don't have any culture or do not appreciate literacy etc. we have other skills that you don't have yet i am not blowing my trumpet in your face.<br><br>despite what you have said, i will not imagine that all JC students are like you, i believe that they are cool people and they are cool about poly students too. YOU are a disgrace to all the other JC students. please don't start a war.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would prefer to go to JC if was given another chance. It all depends what U wanna be in future. As a psychologist, JC offer more arts course which might nurture me into a better cultivation of the courses in University and improve on the languages aspect too. Poly emphasize more on technical courses and to prepare for working life which is good if u are intending to start work early. So it really depends which course of studies u are interested in to see where u want to go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its wrong to say that poly students dun appreciate literary stuff. Thats over generalisation. Its kind of an elitist attitude.<br><br>JCs or polys, i think it will be a gd idea to go for poly then uni but then again the chances of getting into uni then isn't very high</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My advise is to go to a JC if you can. And then go to a university. It may seem harsh but a degree really goes a long, long way in our society. While poly may seem very attractive now...can start work earlier, learn more technical stuffs etc, the hard truth will sink in when u go to work. Without a degree, you will not go anywhere. I have seen poly grads who r now 30+ close to 40 in the working world. Every single year, they will try to get into one of the universities here. Why? Coz without a degree, their chances of promotion is very, very slim. Even if they get promoted, their pay is still much lower than a grad.<br>Of coz there are also poly grads made good...but those are few and far in between.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok i'm going to make this very clear juz in case i get misunderstood again.<br><br>What he meant by parrallel with hilter i think is bcos hitler has an elitist attitude. Hitler thinks that Aryan race is the superior race ( which is wrong) while u seems to have the idea that jc students are better( from the way u described poly students)<br>What terence said :"definitely JC cause poly students can't write, speak english nor are they appreciative of the literary arts.<br>oh boy...."<br><br>Okie to make things clearer again, those are what I THINK why he meant by the parrallel, its NOT from his mouth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And i think maybe he dun want to reply is bcos he dun want to be drawn into a ptless arguement.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends on WHAT you would want to do ultimately in the end. Do you wanna be an Engineer ? A Mechanic ? Lawyer ? Medicine ? What ? Once you have an idea, then you can plan where you wanna go.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>One thing of note though. If you're from a pure English speaking school (ACS, RI, SJI, St. Pat's, etc etc....), and your chinese/dialect really really sucks.... its better to aim for a JC, or at least, Business in Poly. Otherwise, you're really going to have communication problems with your classmates. (At least, that's what I noticed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>Another thing of note are friends. In JC, I think that the "enjoyment" level is so much more interesting, and relationships with teachers are much much better compared to that of a Poly. You sorta know EVERYONE in the JC campus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> In Poly, its well... much more stifling socially. (Sometimes, its akin to having no friends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>Also, propagandists keep telling us that there's essentially no time difference between the time gap between Poly and JC students when they make it to the University, but they neglected to mention the erm.... "clauses" in between.<br><br>In JC, if you fail, well... you either retain, and do the whole syllabus again, or get kicked out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Those classic "If I don't make it, I'm screwed." stories.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>In Poly, if you fail a subject in between semesters, you drag your overall time to complete your diploma by half a year. (Think about it as something like, fail a subject/subjects every semester, add another half a year to the total time taken.) I believe that also applies to the University.<br><br>Not to mention that you have the extra half a year wait for Poly to open, <strong>AND</strong> the subsequent extra 4 months wait if you're combat fit. Then there's the customary 2.5 year training (rumoured to be 3 years....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">)<br><br>By the time you're done with everything, you're gonna be 23 years or so by the time you're in University, and if you take the JC to University route, you're in by around 21  years of age.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Depends actually. Would you prefer to be able to have a few more years of working ability ? Or to delay it for later ?<br><br>------------------<br>"A Gentleman is not an implement."<br>-Confucius, Analects, 2:12</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mind, for heaven's sake don't you know what devil's advocate means?<br><br>and for your information, hitler did not simplistically feel the the jews were inferior. given the economic and politica sanctions imposed on germany by the league of nations, he saw that these sanctions were benefiting the jews while the rest of germany suffered. so its not a straightforward case of elitism because hitler (for very misguided reasons) genuinely felt that germans were at a disadvantage to jews.<br><br>also, are you comparing my light-remark (meant to stimulate discussion and not my personal view) to the systematic murdering of over 6 million jews?<br>just get you history right before you generalise ok?<br><br>mind, if you are so worried about people misunderstanding you then perhaps you should refrain from attempting to explain what others mean.<br><br>as for illegal operations, piss-off.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 18 January 2000).]</div>

If u go to JC, u school for less then 2 years, serve NS for another 2 to 3 years and go to a local Uni for 3 to 4 years depending on your course.<br><br>You go to a poly, take a 3 year course go to NS for 2 to 3 years and then probably go to a foreign U for 1 to 2 years.<br><br>Both pathways can lead to a degree(foreign or local)<br><br>And as for unfair generalisation of poly students well there are equally injustified generalisation of JC students.. They can't endure, can't speak Hokkien and have no understanding of Ah Beng culture. How quaint.<br><br>And to Terence: While your "quote" is tongue in cheek... perhaps you may state it more clearly?

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to disappoint u terence but i know what devil's advocate means.<br><br>And yah i didn't get my history wrong. Its a fact that hitler has the elitist or superiority attitude. If u really want to dig into history, then do u know that the sanctions are not the only reasons why hitler hate jews. And by the way jews is not the only race which he looked down upon. There is also a group of historians who believes that he hates jew in particular cos of his mother. His mother, if i'm not wrong got breast cancer, and the doctor who treated is a jew and his mother died soon afterwards and he blamed the doctor for that. When he was young, he inspired to be an artist. He left for an austrian town where he lived in poverty while the jews lived in riches.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 18 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>heyyyyy, i can't be logging on every now and then to read the postings, i'll always be happy to discuss.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>what? you said all that cos' you wanted a resonating response ?!?! that's weird and sick!<br><br>well it's been long since i touched history. i'm telling you what i know from memory so correct me if i'm wrong, yah<br><br>Put the nationalism aside, Hitler was an evil person, he waged a campaign against the jews. He blamed the jews for all their(Germany) problems. His "final solution" sent 6 million jews to thier deaths in the second world war in an attempt to wipe out the jewish race altogether systematically . He considered the Aryan mankind a superior race. i believed he also got rid of many handicapped and mentally challenged people of germany too.<br><br>i'm not saying you want the lives of all the poly students! no! what i mean is, you "generalized them". you put them in a class lower than the JC students! You suggest that JC students are a superior group of people who can speak english, appreciate literacy.. do educated stuff. and the poly people are just a bunch of Grunts who probably never will surpass the standards of the JC students.<br><br>That was what Hitler did to the Jewish race. Now you are doing this to us?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* for the last time, my remarks were not a reflection of my personal views. it was contructed to promote a discourse between JC and poly students. if it has offended poly students, i apologise since it was NOT meant as an elitist slight but as an edu-cultural antagoniser to see the ideological perceptions held on both sides.<br><br>the robust remarks made by poly students (i assume) were in raison d'etre mostly denials of the charges i made which is indicative of their sensitivity. understanding the depth and reason for this sensitivity is one of the reasons why i made the provocative remarks in the first place.<br><br>it is true that poly-students are BETTER trained in the technical sciences than JC students. the courses and ethos of polys are designed for a particular purpose. no one doubts the importance of this, least of all me. however, the point i was trying to make is, even with this advantage OVER JC students, you seldom hear of JC students displaying the defensiveness and sensitivity displayed by poly-students when the advantage of literary grasp of the former over the latter is voiced. i had hope my remarks would provoke a discussion that would re-assess what we think of as 'prestige', the validity of JC/poly educations and the importance of social sciences and humanities in this vastly technical world (via globalisation) - instead of the foul-mouth reactionary responses i've received. perhaps i should have anticipated it since most do not practice reading between the lines or the fact it is easier to scream and rant than argue cohesively.<br><br>bishamon; it is important to see which discipline the poly students are in during university if you want to prove that they push uni standards up. a technical field in which they have prior training or something like say, social anthropology or comparative literature? your argument fails to provide an empirical ground from which to base your observation on.<br><br>mind and Ticonderoga; yes, my remarks were of a generalisational nature, but so is PM Goh's generalising of s'poreans into Cosmopolitans and Heartlanders - so if by prima facie you see generalising as inherently bad then by deduction you akin PM goh to hitler. this is just NOT logical. telling me about how evil hitler was and his sick mother's diagnosis does not even construct an argument to parallel his deeds with my generalisation. it has sensational value but empty on evidential convergences. my point being that the social and cultural history behind hitler's adversion to the jews is complex and idiosyncratic and it is too convenient and certainly dangerous to analogise without prior consideration of the context.<br><br>illegal operation; surely you have something at least half-intelligent to offer than mindless diatribes?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Terence (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>FYI terence, hitler did not simplistically hate jews juz bcos of the sanctions. There are many other factors be it social or politically.<br><br>To accurately define why a person is behaving in a particular way, we have to analyse the person's life in close details. We cannot arrive to a conclusion juz by looking at what the person did in public. In hitler's case it is too simplistic to conclude that he hate jews bcos of the sanctions in the post world war 1 era.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Mind (edited 19 January 2000).]</div>
