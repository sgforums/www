              <p>well, it's a suggestion. SDF exists, and I feel that it should incorporate basic language skills. (Perhaps they do, could anyone clarify) I think a 1-2 months course in simple english phrases relevant to the industry would do the trick?</p>

              <p>If they are not apologetic, then they dun deserve our empathy. I mentioned that in my other posts.I did not insist that if they are bad at their product knowledge or if they are rude, we should still tolerate.</p>
              <p>I just do not agree with the way you put it that you INSIST in speaking in English on PURPOSE to make things difficult for them regardless of any situations. <strong>"I suggest when we encounter such service staff, we insist on
                                      speaking in English.  If they fail to deliver good service due
                                      to communication barrier, lodge a complaint</strong>.<strong>"</strong></p>
              <p>And hey, I dun have to appear to be a saint. There are people here who knows how good or how bad I am. I do not have to hide behind a computer and pretend.</p>
              <p>And its not Sympathy I am trying to talk about. It just a bit of äººæƒ…å‘³. If in case, you dun understand that, Babel Fish translates as touch of humanity.</p>

              <p>I do agree that we shd live and let live. If the chinaman or woman asks u in chinese, so be it. If we are chinese, then graciously reply in chinese. But if u speak english to her and she gives the wtf look, lodge a complaint by all means. All the more if she speaks chinese to a malay or indian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i do not agree with purposely speaking ang mo to make it difficult for them. Singapore is not inherently just an english speaking society....chinese is our roots too. Most are out to make a living, whether they truly have a passion for service or not. Must see their face, and their attitude too.</p>

              <p>There are already tourists from Japan who seem to be complaining about that. They had thought that Singapore is very big on English so they actually spent time to learn that language before they came over, and even bought electronic Japanese-English dictionary to help them along. But when they reached here, they found out the shop owners kept talking to them in Chinese instead.</p>
