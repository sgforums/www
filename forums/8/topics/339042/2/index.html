              <p>Over here in Australia, when you go to some Chinese restaurants,
              if you can't read Chinese, you might miss out on nice food. 
              The menu in Chinese posted on the wall is usually different from
              the menu in English.</p>

              <p>Oh yea, that happened to me in US as well. We used to ask someone who can read Chinese to go with us.</p>
              <p>Actually I find that to be acceptable, because if we ask, the staff there will still explain to us some of the menu items to us in English. They are really nice and patient about it. Whereas here, if you ask, you might either get a blank stare or a "huh"?</p>
              <p>Which reminds me, I called up several catering services to ask about their menu and prices, encountered a few who couldn't speak English and continuously replied to me in Mandarin and they got more and more short-tempered as I asked more questions in English and finally they said,"You cannot speak Mandarin ah?"</p>

              <p>I recently noticed a lot of people in the service industry, especially restaurants, who expect you to speak Mandarin to them. If you can't, you wil get a glare or they might even refuse to serve you.</p>
              <p>Does it mean that if I look Chinese I am assumed to be able to speak Mandarin automatically? Apparently it has also got to a point that they expect other races to be able to speak Mandarin as well, including Malays and Indians.</p>
              <p>Is this place turning into China?? I don't have anything against speaking Mandarin, I am learning to speak it more fluently as well but I don't like the idea that if I can't speak it fluently, I can't order my food or something. What do you guys think?</p>
