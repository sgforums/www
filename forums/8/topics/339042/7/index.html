              <p>That is expected cos French are very passionate about their own language. And French is the national language there, so it is reasonable to expect people there to converse in it.</p>

              <p>No, they usually speak to me in Mandarin with their heavy China accent which sometimes make it hard for me to understand.</p>
              <p>What I mean is, why is it always expected for every chinese to know Mandarin? They are not forgetting their roots if they do know of some of other chinese dialects. It just happens that those dialects are not as popular as Mandarin.</p>
              <p>I hate it when people come up to me and say that I am a banana or potato because I can't speak Mandarin that fluently. I happen to speak in English most of the time now because if I speak Hokkien, nobody except the older generation would understand me.</p>

              <p>It's really quite terrible especially for the non-chinese who can't speak mandarin in Singapore and it's not fair to them because the official business language is English</p>
              <p>And if the old hokkien speaking uncle at the kopitiam can learn to speak English, I don't see why those young PRCs can't!</p>
              <p>Then again I think they think Mandarin is the only language in the world. Just last month I think there was this article about this PRC guy who got beaten up in a PRC resturant in China because he placed an order in English because he had been living in USA for like the past 10 or 20 years and is used to speaking English.</p>

              <p>It's really quite terrible especially for the non-chinese who
              can't speak mandarin in Singapore and it's not fair to them because
              the official business language is English</p>
              <p>And if the old hokkien speaking uncle at the kopitiam can learn
              to speak English, I don't see why those young PRCs can't!</p>
              <p>Then again I think they think Mandarin is the only language in
              the world. Just last month I think there was this article about
              this PRC guy who got beaten up in a PRC resturant in China because
              he placed an order in English because he had been living in USA for
              like the past 10 or 20 years and is used to speaking English.</p>

              <p>I understand they are proud about their language, but sometimes it is going overboard.</p>
              <p>I remember of an incident where I was buying a drink in a neighborhood stall, the drink list was written in English. Since I do not know how to call the drink in Mandarin, I thought it would work if I just point to the one I want in the list. Surprisingly the person who tended the stall told me she could not read the list and repeatedly asked me to tell her in Mandarin. When I tried my best to figure out how to say it in Mandarin, she said,"Wa so slow ah! Want to order a drink also have to think for so long!"</p>
              <p>I was like wtf. I was trying to help her ended up got scolded. I have been boycotting the stall ever since.</p>
              <p>Another incident happened in IMM, with the dessert stall. I wanted to order peanut soup with the tang yuan balls inside and I saw someone before me ordered that. So I said to the auntie tending the stall in Mandarin, that I wanted the same as the customer before me. She then asked me,"Say out your order." So I said it while pointing to the menu so that there was no mistake. But apparently I must have mispronounced some words because she proceeded to correct me and then added in some snide remarks like "So easy also don't know how to say." And then she told me cannot have tang yuan balls inside the peanut soup. I was too lazy to argue with her so I just had it without.</p>
