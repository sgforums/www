              <p>generally, isnt it a shame that a chinese cant speak
              chinese or arent interested in conversing in chinese?  the
              same goes for a malay or indian who cant speak their own language
              (never met one until today.  but plenty in the case of
              chinese)</p>
              <p>i know a lot of people defended this situation by saying all
              singaporeans study and speak english because of
              survival.</p>
              <p>but the unfortunate thing is a lot of local chinese arent
              interested in learning chinese or are not interested in conversing
              in chinese.</p>
              <p>why?  because the english language is more 'high
              class'?  i cant help but believe that many chinese actually
              think or feel that way.</p>
              <p>its the fault of our educational system that local chinese
              can hardly speak the chinese language and
              dialects.</p>
              <p>i think it is only 'normal' for a mainland chinese to want to
              converse in chinese with a fellow chinese, regardless of
              nationality.</p>

              <p>I think it is very inconsiderate for them to expect everyone to speak Mandarin to them. This is not China, you can't expect everyone to speak Chinese here because there are so many different races and not all of them are fluent in Mandarin to begin with, heck, it is not even their mother tongue!</p>
              <p>Plus if we don't know Mandarin doesn't mean we do not know other dialects. We speak English not because we think it is high class, it is because it is an universal language which can be understood by most people here, except for those who are unwilling to learn and expect everyone to speak the only language that they know.</p>

              <p>I think it is very inconsiderate for them to expect everyone to speak Mandarin to them. This is not China, you can't expect everyone to speak Chinese here because there are so many different races and not all of them are fluent in Mandarin to begin with, heck, it is not even their mother tongue!</p>
              <p>Plus if we don't know Mandarin doesn't mean we do not know other dialects. We speak English not because we think it is high class, it is because it is an universal language which can be understood by most people here, except for those who are unwilling to learn and expect everyone to speak the only language that they know.</p>

              <p>Some chinese are not born in China or country which has a lot of Chinese-speaking people so can't assume that they are fluent in Chinese either.</p>
              <p>Yes, of course they should make an effort to learn but I am talking about those in service industry who take for granted that everyone knows how to speak Chinese and make no effort to learn English so that they can communicate better with the customers.</p>
              <p>If they expect us to speak in Chinese, why can't we expect them to be able to speak in English as well?</p>
              <p>It is more of an attitude problem, of taking for granted that everyone here must adhere and give in to them until they are now complacent and even dare to be sarcastic to customers who are unable to speak fluently in Mandarin.</p>
