              <p>My good friend witnessed this incident in a restaurant.  There were 2 oriental looking customers trying to communication with the PRC waitress.  They wanted to add soup to the soup noodles.  Same thing lah. PRC dun want to make an effort to speak commercial language. The customers were either Indonesians or Koreans (I can't recall liao).  They could not speak in PRC's language and it's not their fault.  So my friend who's seated at the next table helped to translate and explained to the waitress that they just wanted to top up the soup.  But the PRC not happy with them not able to talk in mandarin or simply too stupid understand simple request, she brought them a pot and left on their table.</p>

              <p>I believe they are just obtuse when defending their belief in Chinese should speak Mandarin to Chinese. Which isn't wrong, but just darn biased views.</p>
              <p>Try talking to my dad in English and I believe he will spew forth obscene vulgarities at you for trying to make a fool out of him. He will start grumbling about cultural roots and other myopic beliefs and more profanities.</p>
              <p>It is not very difficult for me to accept their views. Afterall my dad's like the Chinese Nationals except he can only speak in Chinese Dialects and can't even handle mandarin.</p>

              <p>Let's not go into our language policy here. The issue at hand is whether service staff should know basic conversational English because we are a nation that is made up of many ethnicities who speak languages in varying degrees of fluency.</p>
              <p>Everyone got along in Pasar Singlish in the past, and simple English phrases were understood because it was what most people picked up due to ease of usage across different races.</p>
              <p>Look at the situation closely, and you'll realise that there's a huge problem at the moment, in the service industry, where ironically, it forms the first line of contact and impression given to visitors as well.</p>

              <p>Its not like the newly arrived PRC guys aren't making an effort to speak English. I'm sure most of them are. As I said before, this whole issue is blown out of proportions.

              <p>And so what if the impression given to visitors is that some service staff can't speak good English? That our nation suck? Why are we so worried about how we come off to others? And why should good English be a criteria to giving a good impression to others? If we want authencity, perhaps Singlish should be a better language to use. I don't see the Japanese forcing their service staff to learn English in order to give a good impression to others. I don't see the French doing that. I don't see the Germans doing that. I only see countries who have been colonised by the British before doing that. India, Malaysia, Singapore, etc.. Its time we leave our colonial baggages behind.</p>

              2,000 people have joined a group called 'I am Singaporean and tired of
              service staff who can only speak Mandarin' on the popular social
              networking site.<br><br>At least 20 establishments - from big-name
              supermarkets and foodcourts to retail shops - have been singled out by
              members who have come forward to share frustrating experiences at these
              outlets.<br><br>Started in August by undergraduate Kavita Devi
              Thamilselvam, 22, the group has drawn many non-Chinese as well as
              Chinese who are not fluent in Mandarin.<br><br>'It's as though
              non-Mandarin speaking customers are not valued. It makes us feel like
              foreigners in our own country,' Ms Kavita told The Sunday Times.<br><br>Another
              member of the group, Ms Nor Hafiza, 28, said she once had to approach
              four different sales assistants at a supermarket before a Singaporean
              employee was able to answer her queries.<br><br>The early childhood educator was surprised one of them even asked if she could speak Mandarin.<br><br>'When you are serving a multiracial community, it's important to have employees who can speak English,' she said.<br><br>Most
              members in the group said they are not against hiring foreigners, but
              are frustrated at the lack of English training given to them.<br><br>Ms Kavita said she had initially set up the group so that like-minded customers would have an outlet to vent their frustration.<br><br>But she now wants to take the group's feedback to the establishments. Industry watchers empathised with such sentiments.<br><br>'This
              sends a clear signal to the operators that it is important to ensure
              the competency of their service staff,' said the president of the
              Consumers Association of Singapore, Mr Yeo Guat Kwang.<br><br>Singapore
              Retailers Association executive director Lau Chuen Wei felt that
              English tests may be a good idea to ensure a minimum level of English
              proficiency.<br><br>'If such tests can be implemented for domestic
              helpers whose contacts are largely confined to the families that they
              work with, what more for those whose contacts are with the larger
              community?'<br><br>First-time maids have to sit for an English entry
              test to ensure that they have basic numeracy and literacy skills to do
              household tasks and adapt to life here.<br><br>When The Sunday Times
              did its own tests on five big businesses listed on the Facebook group,
              three - Giant, Kopitiam and Food Republic - did not fare well, while
              two - Haagen-Dazs and Takashimaya - passed with flying colours.<br><br>When contacted, all except Takashimaya said they have already been conducting some form of English classes for staff.<br><br>Companies
              explained that recruiting English-speaking service staff in both
              F&amp;B and retail industries is already challenging enough, as many
              people shun such jobs.<br><br>Most added that employees from China form
              barely 10 per cent of their total staff strength. Service-sector
              companies are allowed to employ foreign workers on work permits - up to
              50 per cent of the company's total workforce.<br><br>Said a spokesman
              from supermarket chain Giant: 'It will take some time for them to learn

              <p>The article is so obviously and glaringly opiniated. Nothing short of what I expected from a pro-English paper's article.</p>
              <p>Lets pull out the key facts from the article:</p>
              <p>1) 20 establishments have been singled out by the group. A group of 2000 members.</p>
              <p>2) The facebook listed 5 big businesses accused of having service staff with bad English standards and these 5 were tested. 3 Failed and 2 passed. (May I add that these were the companies that were already accused of having bad English standards. What of the thousands others who have not been accused? The writer would want us to believe that 3 in 5 of companies have failed the English standards.)</p>
              <p>3) Most companies hire only 10 percent of their employees from China. (The article added that the companies could hire up to 50%. This point is irrelevant and seemed to be a way to have the reader subconsciously believe that the PRC employees are higher than 10 percent.)</p>
              <p>And despite all these facts, the article would have us believe that the overall service staff's standard of English in Singapore is poor.</p>
              <p>The writer's comparison of personal experiences and opinions against facts does not and should not cut it. I could experience racism in the USA but does not mean that all Americans are racist. In psychology, students learn that people remember incidences that support their view and forget those that don't. Maybe Singaporeans should start trying to keep in memory the occasions where foreigners are trying hard to learn English too.</p>
