              That is feeble reasoning to increase pricing.  They need to train their staff to speak English for their own benefit as well.

              <p>Hmm, on this note, it is not only the China people that they are hiring, some workers from Myanmar/Vietnam/Philippines also..</p>
              <p>Then got one time, I want to order the food and ask this Myanmar(I think) waiter a question and he couldn't understand me. I asked him whether can I order tom yam kuey teow bcos menu only have tom yam soup at 8 bucks the kind that many people share one.. he dont understand because he expect to copy paste whats on the menu. So after 5 minutes of trying to explain, he say ok he go check first, so i say ok and then find out the price for me first. He came back he say got and I ask him how much. He say 1 dollar and keep insisting on it. I was damn shock and find it funny that the dish cost 1 buck LOL. Then after trying so hard trying to find out the price, the other waiter intervene and explain that it is 1 dollar extra for the kuey teow. No way am i going to eat a 9 bucks tom yam LOL.. but i remain patient lah, must be gracious mah, then ask him to change the order. He got shocked that I want to change order and rush to the back, maybe because he scared the chef cook orledi liao.. I neber ask him to order for me mah I say check for me..</p>
              <p>See lah, one whole big troublesome order just because of language barrier.. Haiz.. Or maybe it's just me ordering the tom yam kuey teow which wasnt on the menu HAHAz.. But usually, I ask normal local waiter they understand lehx.. lols.. but its kinda irritating I order then the foreign people they dont understand.. =( testing my patience and graciousness lehx.. i feel like im no longer Home..</p>

              <p>I recently noticed a lot of people in the service industry, especially restaurants, who expect you to speak Mandarin to them. If you can't, you wil get a glare or they might even refuse to serve you.</p>
              <p>Does it mean that if I look Chinese I am assumed to be able to speak Mandarin automatically? Apparently it has also got to a point that they expect other races to be able to speak Mandarin as well, including Malays and Indians.</p>
              <p>Is this place turning into China?? I don't have anything against speaking Mandarin, I am learning to speak it more fluently as well but I don't like the idea that if I can't speak it fluently, I can't order my food or something. What do you guys think?</p>

              <p>It cant be helped that English is the universal language that most people would know nowadays. It is a common language that is spoken by all the races in Singapore.Plus it is also the language that can be spoken by most tourists.</p>
              <p>Mandarin is spoken by only certain percentage of Chinese so it is not right to assume that all of us Chinese are fluent in it. And customers do not come from just the Mandarin speaking group.</p>

              <p>Depends. Â I will actually speak English first because thats my primary language. I went to school that educated us primarily in English, I grew up in a Singapore where all the road signs are in English, and the language of parliamentary discussion is, English.</p>
              <p>I'm not a Chinese helicopter, so I communicate in English. Â Unfortunately, I find it annoying that I have to use chinese so often these days cos some farmduck Chinese from Mainland can't speak English. Â Talking to elders in Chinese I don't mind. Â But these are young people from China who should have learnt the language before coming here.</p>

              <p>If you can speak in mandarin, just do so lah. Dun need to make such a big fuss. But i think its reasonable to say that they should be trained in basic English to serve the needs of our non-chinese friends. And if you are in a business where your products need to be explained in English, please make sure your chinese staff know lah... I went to buy some chocolates and the Chocolates only have French words on it and I ask the staff what flavour it is, she tell she dun know...what the hell...</p>
              <p>I think it is not necessary to speak excellent English but:</p>
              <p>1. basic english to attend to the needs of non-chinese friends and customers.</p>
              <p>2. Product knowledge is a must, its not a matter of English or Chinese. Its a matter of service.</p>
              <p>I am fortunate that I am pretty ok with my languages (that saved me during my O levels, my maths and sciences sucked haha). So i can communicate in both english and mandarin or HokkienÂ  and Teochew if I have to haha.</p>

              <p>I accept what you said. Its true some of these Chinese staff from China are rude about it. They seem to suggest sometimes through their expressions that we owe them a living instead of giving us a smile for buying things from them. Those are no longer the issue of language, that is the problem of attitude which is not contained to just China chinese or non-chinese staff.</p>
              <p>But not all are like that. I do have good experiences for Chinese staff who make an effort to speak in English or apologise if they do not understand me and try to get someone else to help. And if there is no one else, I can speak in Mandarin, no issues with me.</p>
