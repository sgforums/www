              the UN employs lots and lots of translators because they don't agree that english is the universal language. i think they are just stubborn, english is definitely the most used language out there. the guy running the business is the one to decide on who to hire. we call it freedom to run any business as long as it is not illegal. who knows, maybe some MP will hear your plight and enforce 3 day language course for all new PRC workers.

              <p>maybe instead of being stupid, they have unique business plan.</p>
              <p>for example, the bak chor mee uncle realised that no malay eat his food because it is not halal, and no indian frequents his stall. all his customers talk to him in chinese, so he thought, hey, a PRC can do this, and so PRC happens.</p>
              <p>of course, once in a blue moon some indian or chinese people who can't speak mandarin comes along, and they lose that business. but the boss calculate and finds that the cheap labour offsets the lost in profits.</p>
              <p>and than, some guy from orchard road hears of this success story and try it out in his orchard road shop, and shit happens.</p>

              <p>maybe instead of being stupid, they have unique business
              plan.</p>
              <p>for example, the bak chor mee uncle realised that no malay eat
              his food because it is not halal, and no indian frequents his
              stall. all his customers talk to him in chinese, so he thought,
              hey, a PRC can do this, and so PRC happens.</p>
              <p>of course, once in a blue moon some indian or chinese people who
              can't speak mandarin comes along, and they lose that business. but
              the boss calculate and finds that the cheap labour offsets the lost
              in profits.</p>
              <p>and than, some guy from orchard road hears of this success story
              and try it out in his orchard road shop, and shit happens.</p>
