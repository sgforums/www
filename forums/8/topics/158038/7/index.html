            <div class='col-md body'>Contributed by Lamckay:<br>TOPIC: THE GRAVE EXPLORATION<br><br>I convinced my friends to visit a grave yard one night. I have been to the grave yard a couple of times before, alone and with friends. It is truly a weird sight to behold. To get there, you have to drive about a mile up a gravel road, park your car in a small ditch, hop over a fence, walk about five minutes through a corn field until you are greeted by a large white cross. You don't see any graves at first, only rusted metal markers. I don't know if they are graves or not, but it's pretty creepy. Farther back are the graves. Graves of the insane and mentally ill.<br><br>Equipped with flash lights, we trudged through the corn field into the grave yard. My friends clung to each other as we entered the clearing. The tall white cross loomed out in front of us. "If some thing happens, our best bet is to go under that cross," I teased my friends. We laughed together and split up to explore. The MHI grave yard has three main grave areas. Each area has about 20 graves. I made my way to the farthest area. The graves there were the oldest. Some were broken, some were sunken far into the ground, all were covered with green moss. I carefully avoid tripping on the sunken graves and tried to make out the lettering in the starless night. I couldn't. But I knew from experience none of the graves here had names, only numbers and dates of death. No one has been buried here for more then 100 years.<br><br>I felt the yellowing graves and tried to imagine why the people underneath me were placed in a mental health institute, when I felt a cold breath on my back. I stood still. I heard my friends laughing towards the corn field. Minutes passed and I dismissed the breath as a cold piece of wind. I went back to my thoughts.<br><br>There it was again, an icy breath on the back of my neck. This time it wasn't just cold, it also smelt like decay. A rotten stench filled my nose. I didn't stop to think about what had happened this time. I took of running to the cross. Underneath the cross, I stopped for breath. Finally regaining confidence, I looked up for my friends. I saw one. "Bill," I said gratefully, "I'm so glad your here." I walked towards Bill and the smell of decaying flesh hit me again. I tried to take Bill's hand but my arm flew though his hand. It wasn't Bill. The object smiled at me, his teeth black like tar, his hair ruffled in the wind. He was transparent. I saw through him. He asked me, "Is this cross going to protect you?"<br><br>I never found out. I ran away from that smelly man, through the corn field, and into my car where I waited for my friends with the radio turned all the way up. When they came back, I told them what happened. They think I'm full of crap.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>JAPANESE OCCUPATION COLLECTION<br>TOPIC: SQUEAKING CHILD<br><br>My uncle used to work in a school administration office when he was about 25 prior to venturing into the fields of tourism industry. This happened in the 80s when the computers were not much popularized yet in every home. The only computers available for office work is of course in the school.<br><br>My uncle would go there at 8pm and complete his office job up to about 11pm before retiring back to his house for the day. Nothing much happened throughout his one year work there but towards the very end of his working days for the school, he finally came across the supernatural.<br><br>He was up one night in the school preparing exam papers for the following day submitted in late by the teachers. While typing, with his table lamp on he could hear from the next room, a sound of a kid screaming in excitement. It was not that loud, yet it was quite soft... But it was audible. My uncle did not know what fear is. He went to check out the noise coming from the next door, thinking that someone might have gone inside the room. He could not find anything at all, but kept hearing the voices throughout his night there. He was disturbed but nevertheless, he kept on with his work, until he saw a white orb flashing outside of his room door. He was of course surprised to see the orb, but kept quiet and resumed his work, until he finished his job.<br><br>Without much fear, he talked to the orb, plainly telling it the purpose of him staying up late in his mother tongue. The orb seemed to have understood it and fled off towards the main gate of the school and back towards the cemetery (the school opposite the cemetery horror story as promised).<br><br>He put this report to the security guard taking care of the school outside who also reportedly said that he has been seeing these orbs lately, but dismissed them and ignored them, hence it did not really disturb him except for turning on and off the corridor lights.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is one before I go to work...<br><br>TOPIC: STOWAWAY<br><br>There is this group of 5 friends who decided to go up a once common holiday location in Malaysia (I forgotten specifically where this happened). They did not believed in the spirits when they were told that it was the main reason the resort up there had to close down. There were less and less tourist up there as the days went by and finally they had to shut down.<br><br>Villagers there often hear dogs staying up late at night, howling and barking, and they would see orbs or flames floating nearby the jungle. There was a strong spirited sense in the whole holiday resort and almost everyone who went up there would either at times witness a black hole in their hotel room which never existed, or could never see their reflection in the mirror. Some would get diarrhea or piss out blood during their stay but automatically resolve without treatment when they get down from the hill.<br><br>These group of 5 friends wanted to explore like most eager teenagers and drove a Pajero Jeep up at about 9am. The trip from their house to the hill would then take about 4-5 hours judging from the road condition that they have to take. When approaching the hill, they rested in a nearby R&amp;R and the uncle there warned the group about going up there. The group members laughed inside their hearts and took him as a fool. Now there is one particular member in the group whose courage wasn't that great, so when the uncle offered help by passing them his telephone number when problem arises, he accepted it. The others didn't really bother about it.<br><br>As they make their way up the hill, they could sense their jeep getting slower and slower. The slope of the hill wasn't that great, it was just about a 25 degrees slope. Up and up they went until they reach halfway (now about 4 pm) their car came to a sudden halt. The engine died out. The driver got down and checked his car. There wasn't anything wrong. The battery was new, the radiator was good, all the oil towards the necessary compartment of the different systems of the car were well-functioning. But what could have happened? He just sent it for an overhaul 2 days prior to travelling up the hill.<br><br>After a wild check, the driver heard some unsound noises that irritated his nerves. It was uncomforting and the rest was able to hear it as well. It was a noise of a shriek followed by laughter in high pitch. It continued over and over again. Seeing that it will get dark soon, the member who has the telephone number called the uncle. He arrived about an hour later, and his facial expression was not good. He looked very disturbed, but nevertheless he and his mechanic got the car done by hot-wiring the car and took all of them done without a doubt. They were able to see the uncle mumbling out unintelligeble words throughout the time when the mechanic was getting the car fixed.<br><br>As they got down to the base of the hill, they were told that there were altogether 6 spirits holding up the car under them and another one that is floating nearby, surrounding the car and making a circle repeatedly. Had they stayed on, they would have been possessed by the spirits. The driver and 2 other passengers was able to sense the eerie feeling and they had goosebumps and stomach irritation when they were up there. Although they were not able to see the spirits, feeling their presence was meekly enough to scare the living guts out of them.<br><br>This place was especially haunted as there were hidden graveyards along the way up the resort. These graves were constructed for unknown soldiers who resist against the Japanese during the World War 2. Some unfortunate tourist would hear their name being called, and would venture into the deep and were never found again. Some would appear again 2 weeks later, with bruises and lacerations all over their body, as though someone attempted to skin him alive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BRIEF SPOOKY STORIES 2<br><br>While at a hostel at night, Kesavan noted that there was an old lady craddling a child walking into the room. He has never noticed her before in the campus and furthermore, if she were a stranger it was hard for her to get in as the security in the campus was very tight.<br><br>Kesavan noted that the old lady would walk around passing through bed by bed and taking a look at the person asleep in his bed. If the person is asleep, she would move on towards the next bed. Kesavan knew that his bed would probably be the last after catching the pattern of her walking from bed to bed. He pretended to sleep and covered himself with a blanket over his head.<br><br>The old lady passed him by after noticing that he was asleep. Curious as Kesavan was, he decided to take a peek at the old lady as she was walking out, and thinking that he was safe.

Orang bunian are known to abduct human children, and are often blamed for leading people astray in the deep forest.<br><br>As orang bunian are very similar to human beings(except for the fact that they are usually 'ghaib' or 'halimunan', i.e. invisible and have supernatural powers) it is not unknown for them to intermarry with humans. Once a human being has gone to live with the orang bunian, he or she cannot return to the normal world, as orang bunian live far longer than human beings. Stories are recounted of men who married orang bunian, but pining for their families they left behind, decided to leave the orang bunian. Upon their return to human society, they found that everyone they once knew has died, and that many years have passed- similar to the tale of Rip Van Winkle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The mysterious disappearance of tourists and common village folks in Pulau Redang were once thought of as being lost as they wandered deep into the forest.<br><br>Some mysteriously return 3 months later with stories to tell. These Orang Bunians are invisible and was learnt that they may capture you while you are walking in the forest, hence taking you to their village. It was thought that they have very beautiful women. Could it explain the reason why these tourists does not come back after quite some time? There have been a lot of hypothesis.<br><br>It was then, after the reappearance of the first person lost in the jungle, and his story about the group of people, that made everyone understand of their existence and regard the disappearance from now on to the cause of Orang Bunian.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SOME Malaysian BELIEFS (Special Thanks to TheTropics for the source)<br><br><strong>Toyol</strong><br>This is a spirit which is kept in a jar with a fetus and some special liquid to preserve it. The toyol is kept by people to do their bidding, but the price for keeping it is you have to feed it your own blood everyday. Some toyols have special 'needs' as well. If the spirit is that of a child, you'd usually have to provide it with a couple of toys to play with. If money goes missing and white ants (or termites) are found where the money should have been, the toyol has just done its bidding for their master.<br><br><strong>Pontianak</strong><br>This is perhaps the most frightening of all ghosts and ghouls of South East Asia. It is said that the pontianak is the spirit of a woman who died of childbirth. Sometimes she can look very beautiful, but most of the time she has razor teeth and stalks the night in search for men or pregnant women (it is said she could not bear the thought of other women being able to enjoy motherhood)to suck blood from (sometimes eat the flesh of babies ripped out from their mothers). There are many stories of the pontianak, but perhaps the scariest is the one which happened on the Malaysian highway.<br><br><strong>Kum Kum</strong><br>The Kum Kum is an old witch who attacks young virgins in her attempt to regain her youth and beauty. According to legend, she got her name as she cannot say the whole Malay greeting and can only say these 2 syllables.<br><br><strong>Hantu Tetek</strong><br>Loosely translated from Malay, Hantu Tetek means 'Ghost Breast'. This ghost is female and has huge Breasts, which she is said to use to suffocate her victims.<br><br><strong>Bomoh</strong><br>This is neither ghost nor ghoul, but a man practised in the arts of magic. He is often the man locals will turn to with a 'difficult' problem to solve and he will do it, often for a small fee.<br><br><strong>Jiang-Shi</strong><br>Jiang-shi is the Chinese vampire. Does the same thing as Dracula and sucks blood, but they can only hop around with their arms outstretched. They don't talk at all &amp; you can escape them by throwing a handful of glutinous rice. The grains will hit the Jiang-shi like little firecrackers, giving you time to make your get-away.<br><br></div>

I could hear the sounds from kitchen, my mother was already up and preparing tea.<br>Then I started to feel like if someone or something wa sitting on me, I couldn't breath nor move, like if it was holding my hands and strangling me. I wanted to scream but I couldn't, wanted to open my eyes but I couldn't. I was getting no air, was trying hard to scream and breath but the thing was stronger. I didn't want to give up, did my best to scream and breath, then when I was thinking I'm going to suffocate, I gave it the last try, I gathered all my power and when hearing my mother behind the door of my room, I screamed. She came to my room and the thing disappeared. I was breathing deep to get as much air as possible, mother got scared seeing me like that. I was really scared too much that time, thought I would die.</div>
