            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: I NEVER BELIEVE!!<br><br>There was this group of 3 friends who were very close to each other, Rama, Muthu and Natasha (not their real names).<br><br>Natasha was Muthu's girlfriend.<br><br>One day the three decided to go for a retreat in a small chalet at a beach in Malaysia. According to the well-known history of that place, a girl killed herself there 20 years ago.<br><br>The story went like this. A couple who were deeply in love planned to get married but was rejected by their parents for status difference in the society. They were saddened and while standing on a roof-top of the current place, the girl came up with an idea that both of them could jump off the roof and be together forever. The guy was shocked when he heard what his girlfriend just said but nevertheless with anxiousness stood with his girlfriend at the ledge. The girl held his hands and jumped off the roof, but the guy pulled out at the very final minute by letting his girl's hands free. She screamed horribly as she falls, and it was thought that from then on, she must have placed a curse over that place...<br><br>Hence, when the three friends arrived at the place, Natasha and Muthu decided to get two chalet, one for themselves and one for Rama. Rama agreed and went into his room.<br><br>They met at the lobby, all the three friends and Muthu related to Rama (who didn't know) about the story behind the place and told him to behave himself. Rama, with courage shouted out, I tak percaya ada hantu kat sini, you semua memang hilang akal sekiranya kamu percaya bahawa benda sepertini memang wujud (I don't believe in ghost, you all must have lost your minds in believeing something that never exist in the first place). He then went around the place spitting and shouting and cursing the girl for being stupid to jump off the ledge... He laughed and laughed so loudly that his voices could be heard everywhere...<br><br>That night, as Rama were preparing to sleep, he saw a figure out his window 100m away, white and slightly lit up with a yellowish light. He thought it was the reflection of the moon or something and went 'bah, barang bodoh' (stupid stuffs)... so he went to sleep. 30 minutes into his sleep, he began to hear disturbing voices and he woke up again and the apparition he saw earlier got closer to about 50m and he could see that the figure is now brilliant white and appeared as a figure of a young girl. "It was walking" and it got nearer and nearer until at 10m, the figure looked up at him.<br><br>Rama went pale and shook in fear and could not do anything. There was no eyes and nose on the face and the hair was disshevelled. The figure took several more steps closer to him and yell at him!<br><br>SEKARANG PERCAYA TAK!!!! (Now, do you believe??!!)</div>

Seriously.<br><br>Not because I was making up stories, thus unable to produce any evidence. But rather, it's better to let it be that way and not pass it around.<br><br>I was rather shocked myself after watching the video, so much that I refuse to transfer the video to my phone despite some of my other friends begging me for it.</div></blockquote>I think I saw the vid at other website...........</div>

Most of the tourist decided to stay behind and rest, coz it was very tiring. He and another of his partner decided to continue the climb up to 100m as it has always been their trend since young to complete the climb whenever they go there.<br><br>Both of them were busily hiking up when they saw a white lady sitting near a rock. She was dressed in white blouse and was seen weeping. She was looking towards the other side of the hill and when the two friends approached her, they could sense that their hairs were standing on end for no apparent reason. They could smell a sweet sickly scent coming from the figure. As they approached the girl they tapped her on the shoulder and asked whether she needed any help.<br><br>The lady kept on crying miserably and wept on and on and did not replied them. They thought that she needed some time so they stood around talking to her and calming her down. 15 minutes into talking to her, 4 other hikers came along and saw the both of them. They approached them and asked them what had happened. The two buddies pointed to the girl and spoke in Hokkien "Chi le cabo mm chai co ha mi su, hau ka buay teng" (Donno what happened to her, but she seemed to have been crying for a long time)...<br><br>The hikers asked the two friends this question that freaked the heck out of them, enough to make them vow not to climb the hill again...<br><br>The question was simply, "Girl? What girl?"</div>
