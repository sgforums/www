            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: BASEMENT<br><br>Tom was staying over at Jim's place that night to watch a video tape. Seeing that they didn't have their dinner, they decided to go down to Jim's basement to grab some potato chips and some drinks. Jim's basement has always been dark, since there was no light. His father had not want to fix one for the basement was not used that often and told the family members that if they want to 'explore' around the basement, use a candle or a torchlight.<br><br>Both Tom and Jim climbed down the stairs leading to the basement and went to one corner to grab their foodstuffs. Tom somehow had this cold weird feeling as though he was being watched from behind. He turned to look at the basement stairs and to his dismay, there was this soldier standing behind the stairs holding a musket he had a bayonet pointing towards the stairway.<br><br>Tom then tapped Jim on the shoulder and asked him to look towards the stairway. He turned pale as he saw the figure. Tom and Jim hurriedly ran across the basement towards the other end opposite the stairway and climbed out through the window. They got back into their house through the kitchen and up to Jim's room. They sat there whole night not moving an inch, fearing of the unknown.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: THE WORMHOLE, PENANG (one of the apartments)<br><br>I know of an aunty who had recently passed away. She related this to my mother and a few friends when they visited her in her apartment.<br><br>It so happened that (this story happened 7 years ago) when they moved in to the new apartment, her husband had fallen ill, terminally ill for the next coming few months and was not able to work and walk around.<br><br>Her housing appliances were always haywire, her banknotes always displaced and her books were always disappearing, only to reappear on the same place days after frantically searching for it.<br><br>It was not until 2 months into her stay in the apartment did she began to feel the heavy presence in her room which was disturbing her. She could not fall asleep like she could previously and had this feeling of being monitored closely and watched. She judiciously claimed that the person watching her is on the wall above her clock, which was directly opposite to her bed.<br><br>At night when she was sleeping, she will almost always be awakened by a swirling noise in the water. She would wake up and see this black spot on the wall which grows bigger and bigger and would then spin in circular motion. She could hear disturbing voices of evil spirits and devils chanting in her ears. At times she would even feel her feet burning and though this may be quite a few encounters, she actually see her feet on fire. At this occassion, she began to scream, but her neighbors and her husband did not respond. They were so sound asleep as though the evil spirit might have cast a spell on them.<br><br>She would be pressured both from the visions and from the anxiety. Her heart would weaken with every episode and she would not be able to sleep and concentrate the next morning. This would go on for several weeks, until towards the final day before the devil was exorcised from the house, she came to the devil face to face. She was threatened with her life and she could feel her soul being taken out from her body (feeling of a rollercoaster making a sharp descent). She fought hard and remembered the Bible verses and the Lord's prayer she was taught in church. She recited it several times, but with each time the pressure got harder and the noises got louder and much more irritating. She could sense more evil spirits surrounding her and making her go crazy. She would sweat buckets and her arms and legs would be paralyzed (no, not sleeping paralysis). She would be in a sitting position but she just can't move her arms and legs. It was as if she was being held down.<br><br>She cried out loud that very final night and shouted out the prayer she was taught several times. The Devil at first went against her by slapping her and pulling her forwards, but towards the end, they decided to leave her alone.<br><br>Daybreak, she called up the priest from the church she was attending, and her house was then blessed. There were still occassions when her electrical appliances still would auto-shut and on... however, she moved out the very following year.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TYPICAL STORY<br><br>This is a typical ghost story used to frighten jokers around...<br><br>A man entering the lift to get down after work at about 11pm from the 67th floor. As the lift descended to the 50th floor, a beautiful and sexy young lady walked in, much to his surprise because he did not know the girl from that floor, since he was previously transferred not long ago from that department. He could be confident to say that he knew everyone there, but this girl was different and what's more, she's not wearing her office attire.<br><br>However, being nice, he introduced himself to the girl, but the girl kept quiet and walked towards a corner and turned her face against the wall. Seeing much horror movies, the guy freaked out and prayed that he would reach ground floor as soon as possible.<br><br>Halfway through the lights of the lift went out, it was about 11.20pm around that time. The guy freaked out and tried to calm himself. He dare not turn around to look at the girl and suddenly he started smelling things. A sharp, yet an odd fouling smell came from behind the girl. It smells as though there is a body in the lift at an advance stage of decomposition...<br><br>He prayed and prayed and as the lift descended to the 10th floor, the lights came back on. He thanked his prayers and waited impatiently for it to reach ground floor. As the lift door opened up, the guy got out and curiously turned around to see the girl who was just walking out. The security guard greeted them and to the guy's relief, the girl was a human after knowing her name from the security guard.<br><br>He asked her, aren't you afraid at all at that time when the lights went out? And did you smell that horrific smell? I thought there was a ghost.<br><br>The lady shyly replied, no I wasn't afraid... the guard told me that there will be an electric disturbance at about this time, but its only for a few seconds. And sorry about the smell, I actually farted.... I had garlic for dinner...<br><br>The guy stared at her momentarily and the lady replied, WHAT!! Beautiful girls like me don't fart?<br><br><strong>BUSTED!!!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: LICKING<br><br>A young girl lived at home with her mother, father and her much loved pet dog.<br><br>Being 16 years old her parents decided that she was now old enough to be left alone without a minder while they went out for the evening. Although there was some concern about leaving a young girl in a house all by herself, they knew she was sensible and would behave. And besides, she did have the pet dog to look after her and keep her company.<br><br>The parents left, leaving phone numbers and supplies for the night. The girl was thrilled to be spending her first night alone and mainly watched TV until 11.00pm.<br><br>Deciding she was tired she moved upstairs to her comfy bedroom to retire for the night. Her trusty dog following her all the time.<br><br>After being asleep for a short while she awoke to a dripping noise coming from the bathroom. Not afraid, but curious as to what the noise was she lowered her hand down beside her bed to gain a little comfort from the dog. She felt the warmth of his soft tongue as he licked her hand, showing her that he was alright. Feeling assured she drifted off to sleep once more.<br><br>Waking once again to the sounds of the dripping tap, or whatever it was, in the bathroom she instinctively dropped her hand down to pet her dog. Once again her dog offered up the loyal companionship that only a much trusted and loved pet can, and licked her hand and she once again fell asleep.<br><br>For the last time she woke up again, that annoying noise was still going, she reached for her dog but found that he wasn't there. Wondering where her parents were at this time of night (it was about 3.30am by this time) and looking for her dog she walked out into the bathroom.<br><br>A horrifying sight met her, the dog had been killed and was making the dripping noise, as blood slowly fell and pooled on the floor below. Screaming, she ran back through the house and attempted to call the police. The phone was dead, and she turned to suddenly see her parents also killed behind her. She looked down at a note written in blood, it read:<br><br>"Humans Like To Lick Too My Dear".<br><br>She then runs madly for the stairs only to see a black figure waiting with open arms to catch her.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: WAR VETERAN - CLICKETY CLICK, CLICKETY CLACK<br><br>There was this old war veteran. His legs were blown off in the war, and so the only way he could move around was by dragging himself around by his long nails making the clicking sound. He was also a madman. He would come to the nearby town and start to cut people up in the evening after 6 pm. The people were hence ordered by the headhouse to go inside at exactly 6:00 pm and lock their doors.<br><br>One night, a little girl asked her mom if she could go play at her friends house. The mother looked at the clock, it was 4pm. She told the little girl to be home by 5:45pm because thats when the "click-click" comes out. The little girl agreed and was on her way. She played and played and lost track of the time, it was already 5:48pm when she started back home.<br><br>She thought to herself that she is in no hurry since she will be able to make it home on time. But that was when she saw the ice cream man. She bought one and by the time she started to go back home, her watch struck 6pm. She began to see people locking their doors and calling in there kids.<br><br>"Oh no, I better get back fast", she thought. Finally she reached her street. But thats when she heard the noise, click click drag click click drag.<br><br>It got louder and LOUDER.<br><br>She turned around to make sure he wasn't there but he was. Meanwhile, her mother was already inside getting ready for bed. She had assumed that her daughter was already asleep so she decided not to wake her. Just then, she heard knocking and pounding on the door, she figured it was the war veteran and ignored it. It was really her daughter, wanting to get inside. However, the pounding on the door soon faded.<br><br>The next morning, the mother opened the door to get her newspaper, but to her dismay, she could only see her daughters body shredded into pieces and in blood written on the pavement was, "Mom why didn't you open the door for me?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: LIVER LIVER LIVER<br><br>There once lived a couple called Harry and Mary. Harry was an abusive and lazy guy who only spends his time eating and eating. He works at a nearby mill 5 miles away from their home. His favorite meal would be one of liver and onions cooked with garlic in which something Mary was skilled in.<br><br>Mary is a loving, shy, suppressive and obedient character. There were lots of times when she was physically and verbally abused by her husband, but she took all into her heart. She loved cooking and didn't mind to cook for those who love to eat and love her food especially. That is probably why both of them could stick quite well together.<br><br>One day before Harry went off to work, he had told Mary to prepare liver and onions with garlic for his dinner and Mary being the coy type agreed and nod her head. She head off to run her errands and stopped by the butcher shop with a limited amount of money her husband gave her for the meal preparation. She got the liver and hurried home to cook it, and the whole kitchen smelled wonderful. After finished cooking, she could not resist to taste it as this was one of her finest meal preparation ever. She took a bite and again another, and another, and before she knew it, she had finished eating the whole chunk of liver. She freaked out, and looked at the time. She had only an hour and a half before her husband would come home. Scared as she was and she had no more money left, she ran down to the butcher hoping that he would have mercy on her.<br><br>But halfway to the butcher shop, she came across a funeral parlor. Something struck her and she went inside and saw that there was a coffin inside, with no one else lest her and the corpse. She got an idea, and took out a knife in her purse and got to work with the corpse, cut the liver out and hid it in a plastic cover and in her rain coat. She hurriedly ran back home and prepared the meal for her husband. This time she did not dare to taste it as it was from a human.<br><br>Her husband returned and as usual devoured the meal as rapidly as he could and commented the food to be delicious and fabulous. Harry had always liked the way she cooked his food.<br><br>That night as Mary lay in bed with Harry snoring loudly next to her, she thought she could faintly hear<br><br><strong>"whoooo's gooottttt myyyy liiiveerrrr? "whoooo's gooottttt myyyy liiiveerrrr?</strong><br><br>She dismissed the thought and closed her eyes to try and sleep. About 15 minutes later she heard a little bit louder<br><br><strong>"whoooo's gooottttt myyyy liiiveerrrr? Giiiiive meeee baaacck myyyy liiiverrrr!" </strong><br><br>Gripping the sheets, she closed her eyes tightly, the fear raising in her stomach. About another 15 minutes went by and she heard it again, this time it sounded like it was coming from outside of the house. Ten minutes went by, and she heard it yet again. It sounded like it was coming from downstairs.<br><br><strong>*THUMP THUMP THUMP THUMP*</strong><br><br>Mary heard footsteps on the stairs. Harry was still snoring away loudly. The door creaked open and Mary heard whispered in her ear<br><br><strong>"you've got my liver, and I want it back!" </strong><br><br>The fear that gripped Mary lifted and she was able to point at the sleeping George and exclaim<br><br><strong>"I DON'T HAVE YOUR LIVER! HE HAS IT!!!"</strong><br><br>The only sound then was the one of Harry's scream.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I hope you guys like the stories I posted... here is another one...<br><br>TOPIC: MEMORIZING MARRIAGE VOWS MAY BE HARD, BUT SEALING IT AS A PROMISE IS ANOTHER THING<br><br>There was a couple by the name of Huang Tat (HT) and Gene (G), not their real names. Just married they wanted to move out from their parents' house and with little money left in their pockets after spending it big in the wedding, they decided to get a low cost house first before making it big.<br><br>They found a beautiful apartment instead, 5 class apartment at a very negotiable and yet low price. The realtor had told them that this house was haunted and that there was a serial killer who was found murdered in that room by cops long before they were even born. However, the couple took it as though it was just another urban legend, they proceeded to seal the contract.<br><br>One night, while G was sleeping with HT in the room, G was able to feel someone touching her and blowing her ears even though all the windows were closed. She panicked and told HT the very next day of the incident and told him to stay awake and see who is in the house. HT promised G and stayed up the whole night that night, except for a moment when he felt thirsty and went down to have a cup of water to drink. As he was drinking, a scream could be heard from the room upstairs belonging to his wife. He freaked out and ran upstairs and to his horror, he found his wife's body being chopped to pieces.<br><br>He rushed down to call the cops.<br><br>Several nights later, HT was sleeping peacefully, until about midnight. Feeling very thirsty, he went downstairs and got a cup of water. He went upstairs and noticed a lump in the bed. He took off the covers and the ghost of G floated up.<br><br>She had unholy light in her eyes, and the dark form of another man floated beside her. G held the biggest knife HT had ever seen in her hand.<br><br><strong>"Didn't you promise, HT? Didn't you promise? Till death do us part? Didn't you promise?" G said as she floated towards the paralyzed HT. </strong><br><br><strong>Please, no, forgive me, I was thirsty</strong><br><br><strong>And I want you with me!!!</strong><br><br>The house being far out into the rurals, no one could hear HT's horrified and pain-filled screams.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">So to you guys out there, beware when you say your marriage vows, don't take it too simply...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: JAPANESE OCCUPATION, PENANG SCHOOL, TOILET SHRIEK<br><br>This happen several years back in a school in Penang where a platoon of girl guides had their campfire. It was a 3 days 2 nights camp and all were very excited.<br><br>There was a particular group or you may call it squad who were very likeable, since they were always helping people. Theirs is a group which bonds from friendship. The five stick together like glue, and their names (not real names) were Amanda, Betty, Cathy, Dorothy and Esther.<br><br>Night fall and after the campfire, they got into their designated classrooms and put in for the night. There were about 15-16 girls in one classroom and about 12 classrooms at the east wing and the west wing were each filled up, to give you a rough idea of how big the attendance is.<br><br>At about midnight, Esther decided to go to the toilet, but she was scared of the dark and were not allowed to turn on the lights since there was a strict ruling about lights out. Hence Esther grabbed her pen torch and awaken her four other friends who were sleeping next to her to accompany her. At first, Betty and Cathy decided to escort her, while Amanda and Dorothy would stand around the area to warn them about spot-checks. Finally the five decided to go to the toilet together.<br><br>As Esther went in to relieve herself, the four waited and looked at each other. It was not until halfway through waiting, did they hear a shriek coming from the toilet, and it sounded like a child's voice. They dismissed it as a hallucination and waited again. Next, they began to hear scratches made on mirrors, the walls and the toilet door made of aluminium. This sound was irritating and all 4 freaked out. They called out to Esther in a low voice to hurry up, but their voice were unusually echoed back by a low tone harsh voice. A green ghastly figure appeared right in front of them in front of the toilet door. The four had goosebumps and panicked without knowing what to do. They ran and screamed at the top of their lungs forgetting about Esther. The commotion brought out everyone from the dormitory and the girl guide leader - teacher - advisor to the balcony.<br><br>The four explained what happened and soon the designated authorities followed the four to the place accompanied by their teachers and some fellow students. What they saw will forever stick in their imagination for as long as they live on. Esther was found lying on the toilet floor, covered with dump and a green figure was stroking her hair and pulling out her limbs one by one leaving her for dead. As soon as one of the authorities and a religious leader shone light and started chanting, the ghost disappeared.<br><br>The religious leader, who stayed in the school for 8 years since it was constructed related the story that a student girl was brutally raped and murdered in this particular toilet. Her soul still seek revenge and several girls have fallen prey towards it, and that is why they had sealed the toilet since then, but confused over the matter how did the toilet remained open that particular night.<br></div>
