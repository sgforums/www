            <div class='col-md body'>TITLE: HANDS AND AXES...<br><br>Deep in the reserve forest of Pahang, about 50 years ago during the Japanese occupation, life was tough for Mr A as he could not work to earn enough money after the impose of curfew throughout the country. He had to sneak out at night to the jungle at times to avoid the Japanese soldiers who believed that he is giving out information of military positions of the Japanese base to the enemy.<br><br>Sneaky as he was, he was finally caught by one of the soldiers. In an attempt to run off from the soldier, he tripped and fell off from a tree root. The Japanese soldier cut off his right hand with his bayonet and stab him on his leg. He managed to fend off by throwing his personal axe towards the Japanese's head.<br><br>As it was dark, he could not police a search for his hand as there were more soldiers lurking nearby. He grabbed a first aid kit from the soldier and quickly wrapped his hand with a bandage. He ran deeper towards the jungle but never did survived long enough for the severe shock he suffered from the blood loss. However, his body was never seen, not up till today when the forest has declined in its area and now preserved as a forest reserve.<br><br>Students who carry out their research or study in that jungle would often encounter Mr A. He would appear as a normal person, explained one of the students. He would appear to be looking for something that is missing, and at the same time holding up his right arm still wrapped with the bandage. Some of the students did mention that they were not afraid of him as he appeared normal until he pop the question to them in Hokkien...<br><br>Ah ba, ah ba... lu oo kua tio wa eh chiu boh? (Have you seen my hand?)<br><br>Once he complete the question, he would disappear in thin air.</div>

This must be crazy, he thought to himself. He armed himself with his flashlight and walked towards the court, where to his amazement, he saw a clear headless figure playing basketball with his head, bouncing it up and down. He stood there in shock and peed in his pants as the figure slowly turned and looked at him since he was flashing it with his torch.<br><br>He ran stiff and soon gave out a loud cry. The figure disappeared... The next morning, he quit and told the headmaster about the incident. Though the headmaster shunned him, he was told by one of his friends (another security guard who introduced him to work there) that one of the student was decapitated during the occupation.<br><br>This school still stands, and is 80 years old as of this year.

            <div class='col-md body'>Classification of Story :: Severely disturbing, not for the faint hearted...<br><br>There is one school in Penang, known as Peng Hwa (in Hokkien) where about 5 years ago, five willy students decided to check the place out at night. They have heard that the school field was haunted and they could see visions at night, so they decided to go there at 12 am midnight.<br><br>The main entrance was shut, so they decided to get in through one of the sidewalls which was low enough to get over. As they got over, they make their way towards the school field. There was a sign where they never did saw before in the morning, they did not freak out, but read the sign which was imprinted in Chinese and it said:- LOOK DOWN, NEVER LOOK UP!!!! Or you will suffer the consequences.<br><br>They decided to defy the sign and walked across the field by looking up. Nothing happened, except they felt something soft on the ground, unnaturally soft where they have never thread before. They started to get scared because they defied the rule. Nevertheless, they made it across the field and when they reach the end, they were happy that nothing happened.<br><br>Suddenly they smelt something terrible!! Horrible!! They freaked out, but it smelt like sh.it... They were looking at each other and noticed that they have stepped on sh.it throughout the whole field. And that's why the sign is there for!! LOOK DOWN!! DON't look UP or suffer the consequences!! =)<br><br>Hahaha... some light joke to cheer u up!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>GENTING HIGHLANDS : PAHANG : VILLAGE<br><br>As all of you probably would have known, GH is the only place which houses the only casino in Malaysia. There has been a lot of encounters within the nearby villages. Nowadays, two hotels have been constructed for increasing influx of tourists, and it so happens that the villages are no longer occupied these days, for reasons logically known and explained above...<br><br>My aunt (true story) loves to gamble, and would go up there once or twice every week to gamble. She always wins and was said to have a very good luck (in Chinese, there is a particular word which I don't know)... The very last time she went up there to gamble, about 2 years back, she started off the evening by winning, but then started to lose all her current savings she would keep with her whenever she go gamble.<br><br>Tired and depressed from the loss, she ventured outside and walked around until she came to the place near the village, where she heard her name being called...<br><br>RULE #1 : Never turn back when you hear someone call you, unfamiliar voices especially<br><br>RULE #2: When you lose, you are more prone to the dark and you will often hear such things...<br><br>My aunt turned around not knowing what was going on and thought that it was her friend who was there with her at that time. What she saw made her trip to GH the final, and as she relate the incident to me, she was still in a state of shock and fear. She trembled and was icy cold as she was admitted to the ICU for life support.<br><br>As she was recovering, she said that there was a young lady, beautiful who was dressed in red looking at her at first with kind eyes. My aunt, still in a sad mood that time, ignored her and turned away. The lady called out to her again and as she was about to shoo her off, the lady's eyes turned red with anger and told her that she has been neglected since she was born, and now when she is dead, she deserve a little respect and wanted company. My aunt thought that the lady was drunk and shouted at the lady in Hokkien to shoo her off.<br><br>The lady in red then took off her scarf and blouse and levitated. Her face at first which was flushed turned snowy pale and her hair which was not seen at first, was disshevelled. Her guts was seen hanging from her neck and blood was dripping out towards the very end of her gut. The figure sped towards my aunt. She was stiff and shocked at that time, that my aunt did not know what to do but to scream her lungs out She then fainted and woke up in the ICU... She was fortunate to only have a broken hip from that fall. She never wanted to go there again.</div>

I am not sure where this place is, but I am sure it is in Malaysia   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>In one of the villages, there was a house where this incident happened. In that house, there were 7 people. Mr H owns the house and is married to a beautiful wife who is recently pregnant. They have 3 kids and the other two members of the family who lived in with them are Mr H's parents.<br><br>One night, one of the children wanted to go to the toilet, and it was already 1 am. Since this kid is closer to his mother, he waked her mother up to take him to the toilet. The toilet setting in the kampongs are located several meters away from the house. She then lit a candle and took her child by the arm and accompanied him towards the toilet.<br><br>As he was doing his business in the toilet, his mother waited patiently under a tree while humming a small tune. It did not take her long enough when she began to hear an accompaniment who is humming along with her. At first, she thought that it was her son, so she called out to him. He answered as usual, but the humming sound kept on coming. She looked around her and could find nothing. Senses came to her to look up tree when she saw a head floating upwards humming the tune. It had sharp teeth and blood dripping out from the mouth. The eyes were nearly popping out and was red with anger. It was about to attack the lady when she freaked out and yelled...<br><br>She screamed for her son and her husband, who then came to her aid but they did not see anything. Her father in law who is a well known bomoh, took her back into the house, and blessed her, telling the family that she has seen a spirit which attacks after pregnant women. Those not pregnant can never see the spirit.<br><br>The lady's shock caused her a miscarriage.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SARAWAK<br><br>There were 2 good friends in KL who grew up and studied together from young. Their names (not their real names) were Mary and Jane. They were so close that it was almost near impossible to split them apart. Apart from telling each other's problems and happiness, they were often seen wandering around in complexes, food courts and sundry shops. They were wonderful examples of the meaning of friendship.<br><br>Then came a time when Jane has to leave for Sarawak because her father's job demands him to migrate there to continue his supervision as a manager there. Mary was saddened with the news but promised Jane that she would call her every night. Jane said that since it will be quite far away and it might take a lot of time, effort and money (Mary's family was not very well-off) Jane decided that she be the one to call her. Mary agreed.<br><br>It was not long, about 1 week when Jane moved in to her new place when she decided to give Mary a call. There was no one at the other end of the line, so she tried again. It was almost night-time when she decided to give it another try before she goes to bed. A cold soft voice replied with sadness and tears in her heart. It was Mary... she was sad yet happy to have heard from Jane again. Jane reluctantly wanted to talk very long because she was tired but told Mary that everything is going on well, that the place she is staying in was wonderful and the sceneries were exceptionally beautiful. She described how the people there were and which school she will be attending the following week.<br><br>Mary listened with eagerness, but replied with one word sentences. Finally Jane decided to hang up on Mary because she was tired, she said goodbye without waiting for Mary to reply. As she was sleeping, she felt a sharp sudden jolt of electricity spearing down her spine and a warmness covers her over her body. This was impossible as the room was set to the lowermost temperature (air conditioned). She did not bothered until she felt a cool breeze on her right ear.<br><br>She almost freaked out, but decided to pretend to sleep and closed her eyes even tighter. The trauma then resolved and she woke up the next morning refreshed.<br><br>That morning, she received a phone call from KL, it was Mary's brother who informed her that Mary has recently passed away and that they were unable to reach her as they didn't have her phone number until recently when they found it on her diary. Jane was shocked and broke into tears and said that it was impossible... she just talked to her yesterday through phone. I called her, said Jane... at midnight...<br><br>Mary's brother, Thomas replied, that is impossible, she passed away 3 days ago. We didn't hear any phone ringing yesterday night...<br><br>Jane hung up the phone... she had two feelings in her... one is that she was depressed over her friend's death and guilty as she should have called her earlier... She flew back to KL to attend her best friend's funeral and apologized to her while saying a prayer for her.<br><br>Her friend never visited her again after that...</div>

Like you  can see the ghosts with the help of dogs eyes, preferably black dogs, but I have never tried it and won't try it.<br><br>Don't challenge the ghosts and don't let them know you can see them, else they will be visiting you and asking you to solve things for them, things which are keeping them still here among us, instead of on the "other side".</div>
