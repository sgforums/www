In the video, they were seen and heard singing and fooling around with each other. After about 10 seconds into the video, one of the guys heard a distinct laughter.

When the Japanese invaded Penang, they took over the bungalows and convert them for their military usage. They massacred the brothers (parishioners), and hung them... That was years ago...<br><br>Nowadays, when you go there and stay overnight, there are rules you must follow, the bungalow keeper will tell you upon entering. Never use the toilet at night, must wait until break of day, coz that was the time the brothers were murdered... Never relocate the bibles in the cupboard or u will see it back on its original place the next day. Never relocate the beds in the room and never make a noise at night, or you will hear something disturbing (my friend acted hero and thinks it doesn't exist, pity)...<br><br>Many other bungalows are constructed in Penang Hill, there are many other haunted ones... some you may hear the swing creaking at night, some you may hear objects flying and some of the campers fall ill one by one, severely ill until they got down from the hill, the will then get better...<br><br>I personally stayed in one of these bungalows before, and I tell you, I dare not make a single noise at night... not even snored... can't sleep at all..</div>
