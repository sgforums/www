            <div class='col-md body'>Here is my own experience:<br><br>Few years ago, I was sleeping. I don't know why, but I opened my eyes and saw something like a shadow standing beside my bed and looking at me. It was about 130 - 150 cm high, like a 3D shadow, the neck and head were like one, it had no fingers on its hands. When it saw that I woke up and saw it, it went to the corner of my room and disappeared there. I was a bit scared, I turned on the other side, closed my eyes and tried to sleep, not thinking of it.<br><br>More such things happened to me, can post them if you are inerested.</div>

They are once a part of the team who investigate for the paranormal. So they know quite a lot of stuffs...<br><br>Here is another one...<br><br>TOPIC: HIGHWAY PERIL: PLEASE DON'T STOP YOUR CAR UNNECESSARILY!<br><br>This happened along the KL-Seremban Highway about several months back in a place called Nilai. A father and his two daughters were travelling back at about 9pm from a mall after they purchased their stuffs. They were in Tiroi the whole day visiting a relative and they come from a place called Cheras.<br><br>While on the way home, they happened to use the KL-Seremban Highway to get back to Cheras. This trip would take them about 20-25 minutes and since it was already late and dark (the highway is poorly lit), the father decided to take it slow and drove slowly at the speed of 60 km/h.<br><br>It was not long when one of his daughters spotted a well-dressed lady in yellow crossing the highway road under a fly-over. She looked quite distressed from a distance and was seen to be carrying a baby. She looked ill and the daughters took pity on her and decided to ask their dad to give her a ride. Their father then pulled over near the other side of the divider seeing that the roads were not busy at that time and they were the only car around. The two daughters were a little afraid at first, but they carried their guts and stepped out of the vehicle and approach the young lady.<br><br>From a distance, they could only see a figure, but as they got closer, one of the daughters tapped her on the shoulder. The lady turned around and on her arms cradled a baby who was already dead with blood oozing out from the head. It appeared that the baby was shot. The daughter screamed her lungs out and the lady started to bleed from her eyes and her back, which suppossedly must have originated from the head. The lady got irritated and started to scratch the daughter's face...<br><br>The father stepped down of the vehicle to come to her aid. She stood there stunned and shocked while the other daughter fainted almost immediately after seeing the dead baby.<br><br>The lady happened to be a victim of rape in the highway and the baby was not even born yet. She was raped and beaten before the alleged person decided to kill her. The rape incident happened several years back near Nilai, and it was in the Malaysian papers. Just that, the accused escaped from the charges.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOCATION:  Genting Highlands Resort<br><br>Many people incurred gambling debts and committed suicide here.<br><br>Some visitors leaving the hotel lobby admitted to seeing a man in red shirt and jeans jumping off from the rooftop, just to disappear before he hits the ground. This action repeatedly occurs several times before it really disappears in thin air.<br><br>Certain rooms are not available for rent no matter how full the hotel was. They were closed down, however the route towards the area are still accessible, a place where most gamblers who have had a bad day would unintentionally wander there.<br><br>Those who have witnessed the incident reported that i t was filled with old Chinese ghost wards. They would subsequently fall sick for a few days afterwards. Most came up with fever and extreme fatigue. No common medications used for these symptoms were capable of treating them back. However, it was self-limiting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>LOCATION: KUALA KANGSAR COLLEGE<br><br>This academic institution is said to be a former site of a Japanese occupation camp during WW2. Students who stays there in the hostel sometimes found themselves awakened by something that stares down directly at them. They will remain paralyzed for a few minutes (not sleeping paralysis) and will be treated to a vision of the figure, with red eyes, sharp teeth, ragged clothes, strange sick smell and a monotonous facial expression.<br><br>A marching platoon can be heard coming from the field, together with the sounds of chains. A tree on campus which is right beside a lamp-post where the light shines down on it casts a shadow of a man hanging from the tree. Cries could be heard from the school basement, sound of a knife plunging onto a wooden table and bottles rolling on the floor repeatedly.<br><br>A vision of a Japanese officer with his uniform still on would lead a squad of British soldiers in the hallway for execution. The group would march across the hallway and after taking a turn towards the execution chamber, the column will disintegrate in thin air. This is where the sounds of chain and cries would come from.<br><br>These are typical urban legends where these schools were once colonial sites where executions are carried out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TOPIC: HOTEL ROOM HAUNTED<br><br>This one occurred several years back whereby I heard from my uncle. He as most of you recalled from the previous posting works as a tourist guide. One day, when taking a group of tourist to the Genting Resort, he decided, out of reluctance to book the old hotel which was primely noted to be haunted.<br><br>The tourists, after being told about the story wanted to experience for themselves as they never believed in the supernatural. They thought that it was just based on superstition, the believe of the Malaysians.<br><br>Henceforth, came the first night, I shall relate the story on one couple who experienced the phenomenon. They were sleeping (a guy and a girl of course) in a small room (the old hotels) occupied with a one-man fitting bathroom.<br><br>After a whole day of gambling and outdoor theme park activities, they retired to bed, both of them really tired. The girl immediately fell asleep while the guy decided to read a book he bought earlier from the Genting Souvenir and Book Shop. While reading halfway, he fell asleep leaving his bedside lamp on.<br><br>About 3 am, the girl was awokened by a harsh voice calling out to her. She opened her eyes and freaked out because this voice was not of his husbands. It was deep and coarse. The voice then stopped and she could hear someone vomiting severely with fluids hitting onto the floor as though this man was drunk. The vomiting action continued and with each gasp and throw, the girl had goosebumps. She decided to pretend to fall asleep and felt a pressure over her chest. The pressure became harder and harder on her, and she was nearly out of breath.<br><br>The voice came back again and ask her to leave the next day for this was his room. And he was angry particularly for she was sleeping on her bed. The pressure became deeper and deeper and nearly choking her to death, she pleaded and cried out verses and scriptures from the Bible. The figure was reluctant to let go and instead push her towards the other side and she fell with a thump, hitting her head on the wall. As she opened her eyes, she could see a silhouette of a dark man, with no eyes and unshaved beard. The right chin was pierced with shards of beer bottles and his nostrils were stuffed with cigarette butts. His mouth was filled with black spots and there was a slash mark on the upper region of his neck. There were more glass shards on his chest piercing through his body. The figure had no fingers and one of his arm was cut off. She promised the ghost that she would leave immediately and would not make a fuss out of it anymore.<br><br>The ghost disappeared and she woke her husband up and they both left the place hurriedly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE CEMETERIAL ENCOUNTER - SINGAPORE, contributed by a photographer, I shall relate this story in my own words, since I don't have the real copy with me.<br><br>Alright this happen about 2 years back when 2 students decided to hand-in their project on carvings in the eleventh hour. They only have one day left when they finally decided to sit down and do their project. Above all, they have one week to complete during their break but decided to hack it and save it by going shopping and hanging out.<br><br>This 2 girls by the fake name of Yolanda and Genie decided to go to a cemetery, since that place offers the best carvings on the tombstones and also the statues. It would be a marvellous idea, according to Genie, for they can capture wonderful engravements and designs on the burial ground. They went there at about 9 pm when the cemeterial guards are off-duty (somewhat a silly time to do so, however, like many of you, they did not believe in the supernatural). Henceforth, when arriving they get their camera ready and moved through the place to survey for the most beautiful carving. There were some, but it was located deep inside the burial ground as these tombstones were the earliest of the rest since it was constructed in honor of the British Soldiers who died during their service against the Japanese occupation.<br><br>Yolanda and Genie came upon an especially much older tombstone and looked at it in awe. There was a beautiful carving on the stone and a statue of Virgin Mary located towards the front of the carving. While Genie was setting up her tripod and settling the camera on it, Yolanda was admiring the carvings. As she was about to touch it, she noticed the statue tipped towards the left (as in move by itself). She freaked out, rubber her eyes and looked again, and indeed it was a little bit towards the left now. She decided to keep quiet and did not want to frighten Genie, so proceeded to take pictures of the tombstone.<br><br>They went around the burial site and took more pictures for about 1 and a half hours, and decided to call it a night when Genie noted that her camera lens cover was missing. She must have left it in the first tombstone area since she recalled not closing her camera lens after that. Both of them ran towards the site and yes, it was there right in front of the statue, but they noticed that the statue had disappeared. Where could it have gone? Replacing the statue was a hole.<br><br>They search frantically for it around the stone with their flashlight but they were not able to came up with any findings. Yolanda came up with the conclusion that probably Mary must have sunk inside the hole. Genie grabbed Yolanda's hand and took flight, leaving behind her water bottle. They did not dare to even turn back.<br><br>Both did not discuss about the issues anymore, and decided to put it back on their minds.<br><br>FIVE days later, Yolanda decided to go back to explore again in broad daylight. She brought three friends, this time Genie not included and they reached the place at about 9am, where there were several other people around cleaning their relative's tombstone. Yolanda went straight to the burial ground and found to her amazement that the statue was back as it was again, together with Genie's water bottle right in front of the statue.<br><br>Could this have been a case of thievery, it would not have been returned...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>PENANG: PLAYING WITH DOGS: AYER ITAM<br><br>This one is peculiar yet interesting. One of my childhood friends would walk to school every single day, and he would notice this in his neighborhood's house almost every day at about 7 am.<br><br>This was his first morning when he saw the incident. While walking down the street that leads to the school, he heard a dog barking several times followed by a whining sound. He walked towards the sound of where it came from thinking that there was a dog abuse case happening.<br><br>As he reached the place, he saw a terrier (small sized dog) prancing and pouncing towards something in mid air, yet falling down again backwards instead of forwards (since there was nothing towards the direction he was jumping at). The dog did this several time, without barking, yet it started to wag its tail. The dog's eyes was especially shining at that time. My friend knew the owner of the dog and would often play with it, but never noticed the eye was so shining before.<br><br>My friend was tickled at the dog's behavior at first, but when the dog did his last jump, it never came down. The dog was floating in mid air in a cuddled position as though someone was carrying it. My friend was spooked and nearly pissed his pants. He gave out a loud cry calling out his neighbor's name... The dog was then thrown vigorously onto the floor surprised probably from the scream.<br><br>The neighbor already knew that this will happen after my friend explained what happened. The dog was very close to the neighbor's father (who is also fond of it) who just passed away several days ago. According to the Chinese belief, the dead will visit the house on the 7th day after their death.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THE CURSED MIRROR<br><br>This story was told quite commonly throughout Malaysia, but I don't know how many of you have heard about this...<br><br>There was this well off lady who stayed in a now abandoned house a long while ago (name of location shall not be disclosed). She was married to a rich husband and was staying in this bungalow. Life was good and they did not have any kids because they did not planned to.<br><br>However, out of mistake, one night the lady discovered that she was pregnant after missing her period for 3 weeks. She decided to test herself with the test kit and it was positive. Much to her dismay and to her husband's they agreed to abort it, since they have no likings or interests in bringing up a children.<br><br>The procedure was carried out. Thinking that this was over, they were both smiles as they had the problem settled. One week later, the lady's husband suffered a heart attack and passed away quietly in his sleep while hospitalized in an ICU.<br><br>Sad as she was, she remained single after her husband's death. Often she would look into her mirror day and night, staring into the blanks because she was really depressed. It was not until one night when she decided never again to look into the mirror.<br><br>As she was sitting down for the night after a simple dinner, she brushed her hair by looking in the dressing table's mirror. A flickering of light happened in the glass and stunned by the occurrence, she dropped her brush on the floor. Thinking that she must have been tired, she smiled and bent down to collect the brush. As she got up again, what she saw in the reflection of the mirror shocked the living guts out of her.<br><br>A long haired lady, much to her resemblance, but with black and bruised eyes was staring at her with a depressed expression. There were fluids trickling out from her nose and it was creamy yellowish in color. The eyes were distorted and it looks as if it was about to pop out anytime. The reflection's head was filled with plenty of bruises and part of the scalp could be seen peeling outwards. The reflection was wearing the same night gown as the lady and before she could scream or do anything, the reflection put her own hands onto her face and gently squeeze it. The whole skin of the face melted and peeled off. What was left was a yellowish slough filled with reddish and bloody base. The mouth was still intact and the whole skin of the body began to peel open. Flesh by flesh, her skin was torn apart. There was no blood, but as each flesh tears apart, the attaching structures could be seen to come off together.<br><br>The reflection asked the lady... Why did you take me out? Why!!<br><br>The lady gave a loud scream, fainted and never recovered from her illness. She passed away 3 days later from severe cerebral hypoxia and status epilepticus.</div>
