White figure, 10 feet tall and penetrates through the wall. It has a strong smell, incense burning kind of smell, but was way too strong. My dad smelled it first and figured that there was something wrong, since they dun have incense there. Just that he was about to ask his friend, he saw the spirit walked across the place where both of them were working. My dad was at one end and his friend another end. The spirit walked in between. My father and his friend kept quiet and went pale, they sweat buckets and vowed never to return to that place anymore...<br><br>WARNING: The Chinese believed that you should not shout or scream all the time, or whack the floor and make all sorts of irritating noise, coz he will appear, but this encounter is rare, under the grade 4 classification of spirits. There are spirits everywhere, you respect them, they will respect you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay this is the last for tonight...<br><br>Have you guys heard of the song sang by Siti Nurhaliza called Cindai?<br><br>This one is written in one of the ghost stories...<br><br>There was this group of young students who went camping in the beach near Terengganu. During the night, one of them decided to put on the radio and the song Cindai was one, so one of the student was outside listening to it, while the rest was in the chalet playing cards.<br><br>The guy listening outside was dancing and humming to the rhythm when he suddenly heard a voice, a lady's voice singing from the back of the radio. He thought that it was his friend so he called out to her rudely for singing lousily...<br><br>The radio suddenly went static halfway and when he turned around to fix the radio, it was totally spoilt, and there was no way to get it fixed... static can only be heard... then he turned it off... as he was going back into the chalet, the song was heard again, but this time, since the radio was off, he was spooked. He turned around and he could see a yellow apparition dancing and singing... Just an apparition, he was freaked out, fell down on the staircase and collapsed at the doorway. He turned pale, white and all his limbs were as cold as ice. His face became blue and his eyes were engorged...<br><br>The friends could not see the apparition as they did not cursed it, but their friend did and he was in a coma for 5 months when they brought him back. He never dared to talk nonsense in the beach or jungle again...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

Anyone from Penang will know... In the 80s they allowed students to go in there at night until 11pm for self-study.<br><br>They no longer have it because some of the students experienced apparitions and fell sick, some passed away, and according to the forensics, they died of unknown cause, some they found the liver was covered with fat...</div>

During the night, one of them decided to put on the radio and the song Cindai was one, so one of the student was outside listening to it, while the rest was in the chalet playing cards.<br><br>The guy listening outside was dancing and humming to the rhythm when he suddenly heard a voice, a lady's voice singing from the back of the radio. He thought that it was his friend so he called out to her rudely for singing lousily...<br><br>The radio suddenly went static halfway and when he turned around to fix the radio, it was totally spoilt, and there was no way to get it fixed... static can only be heard... then he turned it off... as he was going back into the chalet, the song was heard again, but this time, since the radio was off, he was spooked. He turned around and he could see a yellow apparition dancing and singing... Just an apparition, he was freaked out, fell down on the staircase and collapsed at the doorway. He turned pale, white and all his limbs were as cold as ice. His face became blue and his eyes were engorged...<br><br>The friends could not see the apparition as they did not cursed it, but their friend did and he was in a coma for 5 months when they brought him back. He never dared to talk nonsense in the beach or jungle again...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div></blockquote>Heard of this story also. Apparently, the title of the song "Cindai" also meant Pontianak. The other meaning is silk.<br><br>Another variant which was told over the radio was that a young lady was busy doing the laundry by the rive at the break of dawn. To keep herself from being bored, she hummed herself to the tune of Cindai. She jumped when she discovered that she wasn't alone humming to the song. Something else near her was humming along with her.</div>
