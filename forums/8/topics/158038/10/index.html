            <div class='col-md body'>A certain rich businessman had a beautiful daughter, who fell in love with a guy who was a cleaner.When the girl's father came to know about their love, he did not like it at all, and so began to protest about it. Now it happened that the two lovers decided to leave their homes for a happy future. The girl's father started searching for the two lovers but could not find them.<br><br>At last, he accepted their love and asked them to come back home in a local newspaper. Her father said "If you both come back I will allow you to marry the guy you love, I accept that you loved each other truly." So in this way, their love won and they returned home. The couple went to town to shop for the wedding dress. He was dressed in white shirt that day. While he was crossing the road to the other side to get some drinks for his wife, a car came and hit him and he died on the spot. The girl lost her senses. It was only after<br>sometimes that she recovered from her shocked. The funeral and cremation was the very next day because he had died horribly.<br><br>Two nights later, the girl's mother had a dream in which she saw an old lady. The old lady asked her mother to wash the blood stains of the guy from her daughter's dress as soon as possible. But her mother ignored the dream.<br>The next night her father had the same dream, he also ignored it. Then when the girl had the same dream the next night, she woke up in fear and told her mother about the dream. Her mother asked her to wash the clothes which have blood stains immediately. She washed the stains but some remained. Next night she again had  the same dream she again washed the stains but some still remained. Next night she again had the same dream and this time the old lady gave her a last warning to wash the blood stain, or else something terrible will happen. This time the girl tried her best to wash<br>the stains, and the clothes nearly tore, but some stains still remained.<br>She was very tired.<br><br>In the late evening the same day while she was alone at home, someone knocked the door. When she opened the door she saw the same old lady<br>of her dream standing at her door. She got very scared and fainted.<br>The old lady woke her up... and gave her a blue object, which  shocked the girl. She asked "What is this...?"<br>The old lady replied...<br>"Try DYNAMO Liquid Soap... just a dab and it will remove all<br>stubborn stains!!!" ...<br>....<br>.....<br>......<br>........<br>...........<br>I know how you all are feeling now... I have been through this too<br>mah.<br>But don't look at me like that leh... I'm also hunting for the<br>idiot<br>who<br>send this to me!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here is the next story:<br><br>5 years ago, my other grand father was in hospital for a stomach surgery. The surgery went good, grand father was fine, but still in hospital.<br>One night, I woke up at around 1 am and heard some knocking, like if someone would knock on something with a wooden stick. I could hear it for about 2 or 3 minutes, I was wondering where it comes from, couldn't localize the source of that sound. I got the idea that something bad might have happened, thought of my grand father but I felt peaceful and when it stopped, I fell asleep.<br><br>The next morning the phone rang and we were told that the grand father has died around 1 am.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This story is of same kind as the previous one.<br><br>I was a kid, maybe 8 years old. My mother had an uncle who she liked a lot. He had a skin cancer, hif face looked like burnt after a fire, he had many plastic surgeries but they made him look even worse. He got also other kind of cancer, I don't remember which one, something with his guts I think. He was in hospital in a bad shape.<br><br>One morning when I was still sleeping, my mother was in the kitchen preparing breakfast for me. There was a glass on the desk in the kitchen. In the edge of her sight field my mother could see the glass falling off the desk and hear the sound of breaking in pieces. But when she looked properly, the glass was on the desk and nothing broken on the floor. Then she felt a cold breeze and a hand on her shoulder. She said "Uncle!"<br>Since that moment she knew her uncle has died.<br><br>The uncle died exactly at the time when this happened in the kitchen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Orbs and Tuju-Tuju are two completely different entities.<br><br>Quoting <a href="http://theshadowlands.net/ghost/orbs.htm" rel="nofollow">The Shadowlands</a>...<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">One of the leading theories concerning what orbs are and the one that I lean towards the most is that they are not the spirit at all.   The orb is the energy being transferred from a source (i.e. powerlines, heat energy, batteries, people, etc) to the spirit so they can manifest.   This may not even be a conscious thing the spirit is doing, just a natural way they get their energy.  This would explain why the orbs are round balls.  According to the laws of Physics energy being transferring like that would assume is natural shape of a sphere.   This theory can also be tied into the EMF readings we get during spirit activity.</span><br><br>On the other hand, a Tuju-Tuju is a ball of fire, some claiming as big as a soccer ball. The Tuju-Tuju is usually sighted at night, rarely during the day. The most effective way to stop a Tuju-Tuju from reaching its intended victim is, apparently very simple. You just have to point at it and shout its name as loud as you can.</div>

TT is "to send" to a person, presumably a curse. so, if a person is looking at it, u are sort of "disrupting its motion". look longer and the TT will come to ur face and you'll faint. yes, this is how scary it can get.<br><br>when i saw the TT, i looked away. my chinese friends were fascinated by it. i told them to look away. when they were still looking at it, i got all fired up and scolded them to look away. den they asked why and i only told them abt it when the sun rose.</div>
