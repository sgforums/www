              <p>If you think about it, good looking women may have a harder time finding true love.</p>
              <p>They have a difficult time distinguishing whether male attention was there in the first place due to their personality or their physical attributes.</p>
              <p>Likewise for wealthy males, some will constantly be wondering whether women are falling at their feet due to size of their wallets or their all round personality.</p>
              <p>You cannot assume a beautiful person has no inner beauty.</p>
              <p>Likewise you cannot assume plain janes/average joes wind up with more inner beauty simply because they need to make up for their lack ofs in the looks department.</p>
              <p>Best to assess ourselves first before spending all that time assessing reality.</p>

              <p>WICHITA, Kan. — Authorities are considering charges in the case of a woman who sat on her boyfriend's toilet for two years — so long that her body was stuck to the seat by the time the boyfriend finally called police. Ness County Sheriff Bryan Whipple said it appeared the 35-year-old woman's skin had grown around the seat. She initially refused emergency medical services but was finally convinced by responders and her boyfriend that she needed to be checked out at a hospital. "We pried the toilet seat off with a pry bar and the seat went with her to the hospital," Whipple said. "The hospital removed it." The county attorney will determine whether any charges should be filed against the woman's 36-year-old boyfriend. "She was not glued. She was not tied. She was just physically stuck by her body," Whipple said. The boyfriend said he brought his girlfriend food and water, and asked her every day to come out of the bathroom. "And her reply would be, "Maybe tomorrow,' " Whipple said.</p>

              <p>This is another crazy happening in this world. But for the purpose of this thread, look beyond that. Here is a relationship. Do you think the girl has looks, inner beauty. For the toilet seat to be imbedded into her flesh, she must be extremely obese. Relationship is how two people are committed to each other. And expecting Mills &amp; Boon type of relationship will only lead to disapointment.</p>
              <p>Just go about your business of living, and  let it be. You will know, when your expectations meshes with your significant other.</p>
