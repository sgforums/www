            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, u could have just asked the waitress right from the start if there is any promotion. I always asked if i go to any cafe or restuarant, just as I would ask if there's any promotion for any credit card(meaning, if i use a certain credit card, can get discount)<br><br>Sometimes, all it takes is for u to open ur mouth. The cafe should not be at fault for having failed to inform u. The fact that u just sit down and continue eating the meal even though u were upset at not being informed earlier shows that u have already accepted the fact that u are not going to get the student meal. To bring up the matter again after ur meal will only make u seem in a bad light.</div>

The reality is that the customer is only right if he is is worth the profit. The problem is that some Singaporeans think that they should be served well but they don't tip well.<br><br>No outlet manager has the time to sit down to talk cock sing song with every unhappy customer, especially over a one who suggests that every promotion be brought to the customer's attention. People with this keep of sh--ty attitude have obviously no idea what it is like to work in an F&amp;B outlet. They should try one for a holiday job and get real!</div>

I dun think the threadstarter had done anything so offending or insulting that the manager had to show that kind of attitude and be so utterly rude. A simple communication would probably have solved the dispute.<br><br></div></blockquote>Well, if your Mother &amp; Sister is insulted and you can still keep quiet after a joker keep saying it than i would say so sad, you are not a good son or brother. I could imagine that if your sister or mother is being rape you will be the firth one out the door for your own life...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I ask have you come across a service staff giving you a black face on first impression? well i haven't. It will probably happen if you keep asking stupid questions again and again or you argue with the person am i right. No service person will give you a black face for no reason and that is a fact.<br><br>The very fact is the thread starter first started to question the waitress over this minor thing and you can imagine after a few exchangers with her, he wasn't happy with her replies cos it wasn't going his way summon the manager in the hope that he is right and the waitress was wrong but unfortunately all the manager could give him is a straight answer and he probably wasn't happy with it.<br><br>Like i said, this case is not worth bring up after so long... the thread starter can't seem to get over it... and the zizu case, well whatever happened he is still the player of the tournement am i not right?<br><br></div>

Insults are just so common on the football field and opponents will do anything to get the best player off the field, especially since it's the World Cup finals. There are a lot of ways to get back at them but if u choose to fall right into their trap and losing a great glory for ur country, i have nothing to say.<br><br>U ask me if I had came across a service staff giving you a black face on first impression?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  U dun? Are u sure u're living in Singapore? How the hack did Singapore get a low rating for service standards? Because all the customers asked for it by asking stupid qns or arguing with them? Even if i ask stupid qns, i must be treated badly in return? Must i smile, say thank you and bow to u after buying things or eating at ur restaurant?</div>

I am sure zizu has come across it many times and he have controled himself too just that this time he lost it shows that he is also human not right?<br><br>I am not speaking up for anyone here just that in every incident, i belief there are two sides to it thats all... and since the guy is not here to defend himself, we cannot jump to conclusions base on just the thread starter's claims... Ah, and last time i check, I am very sure i am still in singapore. So i can say it again i have never come across any service staff that greeted me with a  shout or a raised voice on first impression... Have you ever got a loud shout or shove by a service staff on first impression?<br><br>I said before, The very fact that the thread starter questioned the waitress over this minor thing and didn't get the answer he wanted to hear could have made him angry...  and after a few exchangers with her, he summon the manager but unfortunately, the manager couldn't give him the answer he wanted too.<br><br>You just look, this case is not worth bring up after so long... yet the thread starter can't seem to get over it... Do you bring up something like this after more than 2 weeks? Normally we may if it happened today, yesterday or even over the weekend, i can understand, it something sponteneous... But to wait more than 2 weeks than put it in such a way, i call it devious, he could have an ulterior motive.<br><br>For what its worth, the Zizu affair. Well, he was still voted the player of the tournement regardless of what he did am i not right?<br></div>
