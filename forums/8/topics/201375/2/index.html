            <div class='col-md body'>Well... the thing was... I was talking in a nice manner to the manager.. even invited him to sit down and discuss it...  but he didn't even want to and instead said he had nothing to discuss then stomped off...<br><br>I mean.. why treat a customer like he's a criminal when he's just trying to provide feedback! At that point I was not even expecting a change in my orders anymore... I just wanted to provide feedback, and I thot as a manager the least he could do was just to say "I'm sorry, but we really can't help you with that"... correct anot? Instead the "sha qi" in his voice hinted that I could well have been his kitchen cleaner who had just broken his favourite bowl!<br><br>Yup some of u guessed it... this place is at the top level of the mall..<br><br>Ha and I think only someone who hasnt seen a student before would think we're not students lor... i mean... t-shirt, slippers, slingbag!! well I think the waitress said that cos she din noe wat to say at that time, but the manager totally lost the situation then.<br><br>I really admit that it's a few bad eggs in the basket who spoil it all... I've encountered several cases of friendly and helpful service personnel at retail outlets, and there are those GEM cards we can give them for their efforts, which I gladly do often. However, I'm perturbed by the few black sheep who can effectively spoil one's day or perhaps even a foreigner of Singapore just with that kind of "why must I serve u" kind of service attitude... dun u agree?</div>

But it seems like the thread starter could bare a grudge on the manager and restaurant for something that happened more than 2 weeks ago shows that he is no simple fellow too.<br><br>Do you belief that voices would have raised if insults wasn't used by both parties? Its very easy to always put the blame on the service staff because they are in a sure lose position but customers who always thinks that they are right just because they are spending a few dollars in the place are the ones that need to re-look at themselves.<br><br>I don't really care or who is right or who is wrong here, but the manager is also a human being least you forget... Just because he is a manager does not make him any different from you and me. He is paid to do his job, he wasn't sold as a slave and he is entitle to his dignity too. We have people in higher positions getting angry too cos there is always a line before you let loose... Remember Zizu... World Cup Player of the Games. Our own political leaders... also lose their temple occasionally too. The customer here probably isn't truthful enough to mention that he wasn't diplomatic himself too.<br><br>Anyway, i would be surprise if the service staff or the manager didn't spit into their food or drinks before serving cos there is no angels in us too remember.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
