Can u forget it the next day if it was ur gf who went through that? </div></blockquote>First of all, I think you may have mistaken what i have said. I didn't say people or football players acting violently can be forgiven... i said even someone as experienced and seasoned to such insults can still lose his temper or get angry, meaning zizu... so i see no reason why it can't happen to you or me or anyone else thats what i said.<br><br>As for the thread starter claim that he was talking calmly, well... do you seriously belief that for a minute, he was talking calmly? Even after he claims that the manager told his Gf not to shout? Come on, letÂ’s grow up... Just think for a minute would his GF be shouting at the manager if her Bf wasn't? They were creating a scene already as he claimed the manager said. Can you create a scene if you don't raise your voice? Or can two person talking calmly create a scene? Just with this part i can say the thread starter is not being truthful what actually took place.  Cos subconsciously we always think we are right, we are never the one at fault and when we tell it, we will tell it to our advantage and conveniently forget our fault am i not right?<br><br>Honestly we don't really know what was said or not said but to be very frank with you, i find the words said "donÂ’t shout at me you WOMAN!" to be perfectly alright under the circumstance where all 3 parties were hot under the collar. I don't find even an ounce of sexism here. It seems the thread starter was trying to portray or suggest he is prejudice against women. I see a very mischievous act here by the thread starter. He could have told her to SHUT-UP woman and not to get involve or worst, he could have said Shut-UP Bit ch right? But he did not... Instead he told her not to shout at him only. Which under normal circumstances, is perfectly correct as no one wants or like others to shout at them right? Anyway, did he really say those words? We really don't know, would we? All we are fed with came from the unhappy thread starter thatÂ’s all. And to think that he took the trouble to create a new id just for the sake of this matter makes me wonder about his motives.<br><br>Strangely, you never seem to answer my questions in full, just selectively only when I have answered yours in full. I shall just summarize it again,<br><br>1. Do you seriously belief he was only "just trying to provide feedback". Without other intentions? Feedbacks to the waitress would have been enough, if that was his intention, Cos good feedbacks if not taken is their own loss don't you agree?<br><br>2. Do you belief that voices would have raise if insults wasn't used by both parties?<br><br>3. Have you ever got a loud shout or shove by a service staff on first impression?<br><br>4. So you agree that a customer is always right just because they are spending a few dollars at the place entitles them to treat others like slaves without dignity?<br><br>5. Blaming the service staff for not informing him of the promotions and getting into an argument over a student meal when in the first place he should have looked before placing his orders.<br><br>6. Do you think this is something worth bring up again after it happened more than 2 weeks ago?<br><br>And finally to your last question, Yes. If this unfortunate incident had happen to my sister, my mother or my grandmotherÂ… I could get over it in a day or two honestly like most people would I believe. Like I said, you donÂ’t keep such things more than a week unless you bare a grudge over someoneÂ… cos there is really no point to even remember this kind of things when there are so much other things to think about.<br><br>Cheers Bro.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The manager was in the wrong as soon as he raised his voice &amp; became rude.  He should seriously consider a change of career.  Debt collector or something.  Handling all sorts of customers is part of the F&amp;B line.  It doesn't matter what job u're in - if u have any self-respect &amp; integrity, you do the job well.  alonevoice is @ most a demanding customer, but he and his gf shouldn't have had to put up with it.<br><br>Anyway threadstarter, u shd either take action, or forgetting about the incident.  Mulling about it for such a long time can't be good for anybody.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by a lone voice:</div><div class="quote_body">On 8th July 2006, we were looking forward to a good lunch at a certain cafe in Tiong Bahru Plaza. After placing our orders, we noticed another customer looking at a flyer promoting student meals. Our request to change our orders was turned down by the waitress as the food had already been prepared.<br><br>We queried the waitress on why the promotion was not pointed out to us when we first stepped in. We were given an explanation that the flyer was not on all tables and that we did not look like students. In my opinion, a promotion at a restaurant should be made known to all patrons before orders are placed, and never held back just because someone doesnÂ’t Â“look like a studentÂ”.<br><br>Unconvinced with her answer, we approached the manager to get a proper explanation and to feedback this incident. However, his lack of empathy and tactfulness did nothing to defuse the situation. Instead, he fanned the flames and aggravated the situation by commenting that Â“a promotion is a privilege, not something we NEED to offer to youÂ”. Amazingly, he went further to say that he had nothing to say to us and shrugged off the episode by asking us not to come back to the restaurant again.<br><br>Not that we will ever patronize this cafe again, but we just felt really short-changed by this level of service, or rather dis-service. Our day and appetite had already been spoilt. We had no choice but to consume the food.<br><br>As I was settling the bill, I invited the manager over, with the aim of having an amicable discussion over the incident. Instead, he was not in the mood for any discussion. He adopted a highly defensive and hostile attitude. The moment I brought up the incident, he blamed us for creating a scene and being rude. He then stormed off saying he had nothing to say to Â“people like you (us)Â”. I wondered who was the party being rude - Customers who tried to have a discussion and provide feedback, and an assistant manager accusing them of being at fault entirely and being rude. In fact, my whole discussion with the waitress had been very polite, and I was not even angry at her.<br><br>This really got us incensed. My girlfriend joined in the argument, and I was totally disgusted when he said Â“donÂ’t shout at me you WOMANÂ”. All of a sudden it has become a case of sexism in addition to the bad service. I demanded that he apologise. He refused, warning us not to Â“p**s me (him) offÂ”.<br><br>Totally furious by now, I demanded that he took out the service charge from my bill for this bad service. He said Â“you might as well donÂ’t payÂ”, implying that we were out to get a free meal. Totally upset at the way he looked down on us, I demanded on paying for the food I had, but not the service charge. We then told him this was unacceptable behavior from a service personnel, what more, an assistant manager. He barked at us that Â“I donÂ’t careÂ” and told us to Â“just get lost and donÂ’t come back againÂ”.<br><br>This had been my worst experience at any dining outlet anywhere in the world, and it had to happen in Singapore. I regret to admit that even as we strive to achieve global standards in the service industry, there are such black sheep out to destroy the effort that the government and the whole industry had put in.<br><br>We do have the GEMs cards for us to nominate good service providers, but I realize there is no platform for us to feedback on negative examples. In this case, the assistant manager of the cafe at Tiong Bahru Plaza, appeared so smug perhaps because he was confident that there was no avenue for complaints to be lodged against him ( there was no feedback form or email address for customers). I am totally disheartened by this incident, and really hope there will be a feedback channel for the service industry in Singapore.</div></blockquote>From my viewpoint, I believe reasonable service was rendered to you, and you were merely exercising every ounce of Customer Rights you think you may have.<br><br>I'd say Live &amp; Let Live, as would most commonly phrased; Don't make a mountain out of a mole hill.<br><br>A purer form of Bad Service can be found at hawker centers, Sim Lim Square, and such. Try bugging them....<br><br>Service Standards goes both way - not just customers only.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree that Service Standards in Singapore has degressed to some extent over the past decade, but it has recently been addressed, and the service industry has responded possitively. But I know there are existing pockets of blacksheeps who refuses to change or improve, and they're mainly small medium retail setups.<br><br>Actually, how does one define Good Service? I tend to believe that it is subjective and varies from customer to customer.<br>And how does one define Bad Service? The same applies.<br><br>Just a run down, not in every detail:<br><br>Good Service is;<br>&gt;&gt; Giving customers what they wanted or have asked for<br>&gt;&gt; Going the extra mile for the customer - doing or giving more than what customer paid for<br>&gt;&gt; Assistance in every aspect during the sale and after the sale<br>&gt;&gt; Addressing the customer appropriately and being polite to the customer throughout<br><br>Bad Service;<br>&gt;&gt; Not attentive to customers' needs and or enquiries<br>&gt;&gt; Not willing to answer questions pertaining to service and or products<br>( this includes not willing to let customer see or examin goods without proper and or reasonable explanation why if not allowed)<br>&gt;&gt; Making customers wait unnecessarily, and making customers feel unwanted or unwelcomed<br>&gt;&gt; Being unhelpful or disinterested with customers or impersonal<br>&gt;&gt; Addressing customers inappropriately, being impolite and impatient with customer<br>&gt;&gt; "Shadowing" customers who are looking around<br>&gt;&gt; Insisting that customer buy something which was not what the customer wanted (this one is subjective depending on product and or service)<br><br>Your imput on this would be good for all...<br><br></div>
