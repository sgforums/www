            <div class='col-md body'>you may be frustrated at the question of what life is because life really isn't anything in particular. the answer will evade you as long as you believe that life's meaning is waiting to be discovered. i think the meaning of life is meant to be created - in other words, meaning comes from what you make of your life and what you do with it. if there is any discovery at all, it will have to be found within you. now the question is how to do that. to find contentment in life, you have to ask yourself what is impt to you. how do you define yourself? what will make you content or happy with life? i assume that this is what you are looking for - peace of mind and a sense of meaning or purpose. understand that these answers will not appear to you just by sitting down under a coconut tree (or any other tree of your choice) and thinking or meditating really hard. neither will soul searching help too much or else i'm sure you would have found an answer by now. if u don't know what u want, i suggest you go out and have more experiences in life. only by going out and meeting ppl and getting new experiences can u find out what is impt to you and what u feel content with. it's an ongoing process. u don't just get the answer one day and be a wise old sage the rest of your life. after a while, something you thot brought u meaning in life may cease to do so. but that's okay. it would be a mistake to think that one answer will be THE answer for all of your life.<br><br>"What do I live for?", you ask. you are assuming that you have to live FOR something. you seem to believe that seeking after something will bring meaning to your life once you find it. is there any other way of finding happiness? can you find meaning without constantly seeking? can u live for the day and find joy in that and that alone? but u seem to be looking for a deeper meaning. even if there were a deeper meaning, it may not sustain you for the rest of your life. ppl and circumstances change and what may have been fulfilling b4 may not be fulfilling now. what u need to rid yourself of is the belief that there is a once and for all solution to the meaning of life. maybe the meaning comes just in the search, the journey itself and not in the destination. along the road of life we find little taverns and inns and we settle down for a while to rest. we may be happy then. but soon we get restless and want to move on to see another part of the world. the little town no longer makes us happy. we want to move on. but this doesn't mean u can only be happy once u come to the next town. along the way, smell the roses and listen to the birds sing and learn to take pleasure in the beauty of the uncertainty of life. so u don't know where your head will next find a resting place. but why is that bad? u will be unhappy if u believe that happiness only comes with knowing what u want. certainly knowing what u want gives u a goal, an aim. but it gives only temporary meaning. do not take the town for the whole country. only by moving from town to town can we have said to have explored the entire country. only by moving from purpose to purpose, from experience to experience do we experience all of life, all of OUR life. and at the end of it all, after seeing all the towns, or as much of them as u can, it no longer makes sense to say u still haven't seen the country. moving from one experience or purpose to the next, u can't say u haven't experienced life. life just is your experiences.<br><br>i think perhaps your unhappiness comes from the fact that you are a seeker and not a traveller. a seeker hopes to find. and will be agitated until he or she actually finds something. a traveller enjoys the way. so ask yourself if you think that life is a destination or a long and winding journey.<br>i am not saying the answer is straight forward. some ppl can find meaning by being devoted to one cause all their lives. others cannot. do not be afraid if what gave you sustenance b4 no longer satisfies you. your fear and tiredness come from having to travel again. but if u understand life as a journey, then u will no longer look for only one answer that will satisfy you for life. just like you will no longer wish to see or live in just one town for the rest of your life.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Tormented,<br><br>I really have to agree with what fais de beaux reves said. I wouldn't have put it that nicely, but my thoughts go somewhat along that line.<br><br>From the different views on the meaning of life here, it only goes to illustrate that its a subjective thing. Perhaps life has no meaning. It is a biological process that lets DNA of every species propagate. Yup, you are but a side effect of the selfish quest for survival for some nucleic acids.<br><br>Human beings being the vain creatures as we are, we want to find a purpose for doing stuff to prove our existence. We want to place importance in things that we do, because we are conscious of our existence. A sort of arrogance if you like.<br><br>That said, I have nothing against finding something interesting to do to pass time as we live out our existence.<br><br>Some people find that being thankful for small things reaffirm their life. Others take pleasure at looking at pretty girls flicking their beautiful ponytails. Some think helping others is the way to happiness. Some think being the first to achieve things that others desire drives them forward in life.<br><br>You will have to find out what you want. Just bear in mind that people and situations change. Perspectives change. What you value now, you might grow out of soon.</div>
