Really, you are a good writer and your words carry much weight. Thanks for enlightening me and I'll say that I've finally found a wise guy after months of searching.<br><br></div>

I wouldn't have put it that nicely, but my thoughts go somewhat along that line.<br><br>From the different views on the meaning of life here, it only goes to illustrate that its a subjective thing. Perhaps life has no meaning. It is a biological process that lets DNA of every species propagate. Yup, you are but a side effect of the selfish quest for survival for some nucleic acids.<br><br>Human beings being the vain creatures as we are, we want to find a purpose for doing stuff to prove our existence. We want to place importance in things that we do, because we are conscious of our existence. A sort of arrogance if you like.<br><br>That said, I have nothing against finding something interesting to do to pass time as we live out our existence.<br><br>Some people find that being thankful for small things reaffirm their life. Others take pleasure at looking at pretty girls flicking their beautiful ponytails. Some think helping others is the way to happiness. Some think being the first to achieve things that others desire drives them forward in life.<br><br>You will have to find out what you want. Just bear in mind that people and situations change. Perspectives change. What you value now, you might grow out of soon. </div></blockquote>I agree that fais de beaux reves really do a great job. And I have accepted his and yours points.
