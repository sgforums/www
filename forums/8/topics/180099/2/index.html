Gone are the days where condos are supposedly to be built far away from bus stops or MRT. So when you say you live in condo you MUST have a car else how are you going to move to and fro between where you live to where you work or study?<br><br>It seem that notion or idea are outdated. Condos are built more closer to public transport and for some they even provide free shuttle bus service to the nearest shopping mall and bus interchanges.<br><br>However to get a condo and not to feed a car is quite wasteful cuz a parking lot will be allocated to all units so if you dun have a car may wanna consider sell it to other residents who own &gt; 1 car<br><br>Am I rite in the above assumption?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Btw I live in HDB if you are curious to know.[/b]</blockquote>Condo mgt would not allow selling of parking lot from one resident to another. Any other arrangement would be strictly between residents.<br><br>From an economic point of view, condos in the outskirts are so inexpensive that I would suggest that those of you who are considering buying 5 rm HDb or executive apt or Mansionette to go for condos. The price is so close!<br><br>For those who cannot afford a condo, go for resale exec condo which comes with full condo facilities as well but much cheaper.<br><br>My advice is not to go for HDB flats just because its cheaper. Always look at location and amenities. Is it convenient for you? A old unit after renovation (which is so much cheaper than buy a flat) would look as brand new.<br><br>Never take the HDB grant of $30K/$40K, unless you have already planned NOT to get a 2nd new HDB flat any more. The resale levy would kill off the benefits of taking the grant. Sugg: leave the grant for you to get a smaller flat when you retire. Buying a smaller flat with the fixed grant is more worth it than getting it to buy a large flat.<br><br>Amt to pay for monthly HDB carpark is almost similar to paying for monthly maintenance of a condo. Would be even better if you own 2 cars. Plus you get to have other facilities, e.g. swimming pool, tennis court, gym, BBQ pits at yr doorstep.<br><br></div>

The price is so close!</strong><br><br>Define close? My HDB 5 room reslae is 300K at 125 sq meter. It is big by my standard but with that pricing I can't get any outskirt condo with same floor area equivalent and floor also. Close is subjective.<br><br><strong>My advice is not to go for HDB flats just because its cheaper. Always look at location and amenities. Is it convenient for you? A old unit after renovation (which is so much cheaper than buy a flat) would look as brand new.</strong><br><br>My flat is quite near the shopping mall within walking distance. It is resale and I redo all renovation completely so it is as good as brand new.<br><br><strong>Never take the HDB grant of $30K/$40K, unless you have already planned NOT to get a 2nd new HDB flat any more.

Buying a smaller flat with the fixed grant is more worth it than getting it to buy a large flat.</strong><br><br>Correct and I dun intend to sell it any soon. I want this flat to contain my kids and my spouse and hence I need the floor area and rooms. Selling it will be at least 10 years down the road when my kids get married.<br><br><strong>Amt to pay for monthly HDB carpark is almost similar to paying for monthly maintenance of a condo. Would be even better if you own 2 cars. Plus you get to have other facilities, e.g. swimming pool, tennis court, gym, BBQ pits at yr doorstep.</strong><br><br>That is assuming you feed a car. As of now I am not feeding so I save at least S$90 every month not counting the car associated cost.<br><br>So for my profile it is better for me to have a HDB rather than a condo. As for image sorry I don't care much. In fact except for working, I prefer to walk ard in t-shirt, bermuda and sandals. Sometimes to give some face to ppl, I put on a pair of jeans  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i look at the condos nowadays, I was like....wtf? pay so much for such a small floor area??? is it worth it or not???? u stay in those old type 5 rm flat, its so much cheaper and the floor area is so much bigger. kitchen bigger, living rm bigger, bedrooms bigger....every fark thing also bigger...to me HDB makes sense. I will only consider condo if i have like what a previous forumite has mentioned, $$ to burn.</div>
