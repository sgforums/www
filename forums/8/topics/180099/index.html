            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The 7k will allows u to live comfortably in the condo + own a car to bring you ard. </strong><br><br>Unlike the condos built in the 70's or 80's nowadays condo are built very near to public transport like MRT or bus interchanges. Gone are the days where condos are supposedly to be built far away from bus stops or MRT. So when you say you live in condo you MUST have a car else how are you going to move to and fro between where you live to where you work or study?<br><br>It seem that notion or idea are outdated. Condos are built more closer to public transport and for some they even provide free shuttle bus service to the nearest shopping mall and bus interchanges.<br><br>However to get a condo and not to feed a car is quite wasteful cuz a parking lot will be allocated to all units so if you dun have a car may wanna consider sell it to other residents who own &gt; 1 car<br><br>Am I rite in the above assumption?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Btw I live in HDB if you are curious to know.</div>

For ppl who wan to earn extra money that is the way to go if not how to feed every month maintenance fees rite? Maybe they can charge secretly for ppl who wanna use the swimming pool and gym also, How to sneak them into the condo is a skill. Usually condo allow some cards to be made for access via the back door rite?
