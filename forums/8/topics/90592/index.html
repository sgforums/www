            <div class='col-md body'>First Steps, The Kalama Sutta<br>Anguttara Nikaya, Tika Nipata, Mahavagga, Sutta No. 65<br><br>When first introduced to buddhism, I was most impressed by this teaching which exhorts one to not rely on what others say in what to believe. I originally ran across it from a copy of "What the Buddha Taught" by the Venerable Walpola Rahula. This exerpt is from that text.<br><br>"The Buddha once visited a small town called Kesaputta in the kingdom of Kosala. The inhabitants of this town were known by the common name Kalama. When they heard that the Buddha was in their town, the Kalamas paid him a visit, and told him:<br><br>'Sir, there are some recluses and brahmanas who visit Kesaputta. They explain and illumine only their own doctrines, and despise, condemn and spurn others' doctrines. Then come other recluses and brahmanas, and they, too, in their turn, explain and illumine only their own doctrines, and despise and condemn and spurn others' doctrines. But, for us, Sir, we have always doubt and perplexity as to who among these venerable recluses and brahmanas spoke the truth and who spoke falsehood.'<br><br>Then the Budhha gave them this advice, unique in the history of religions:<br><br>'Yes, Kalamas, it is proper that you have doubt, that you have perplexity, for a doubt has arisen in a matter which is doubtful. Now, look you Kalamas, do not be led by reports, or tradition, or hearsay. Be not led by the authority of religious texts, nor by mere logic or inference, nor by considering appearances, nor by the delight in speculative opinions, nor by seeming possibilities, nor by the idea; "this is our teacher'. But, O Kalamas, when you know for youselves that certain things are unwholesome (akusala), and wrong, and bad, then give them up ... And when you know for youselves that certain things are wholesome (kusala) and good, then accept them and follow them.'<br><br>The Buddha went even further. He told the bhikkhus that a disciple should examine even the Tathagata (Buddha) himself, so that he (the disciple) might be fully convinced of the true value of the teacher whom he followed."<br><br>http://www.saigon.com/~anson/ebud/ebidx.htm<br><br>http://www.accesstoinsight.org/<br></div>
