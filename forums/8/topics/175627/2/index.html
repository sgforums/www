            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore's prosecutors are far too arrogant, thinking that they can slam any charge on the defendants without even having circumstantial evidence to prove their charge.<br><br>Btw, many people think that by hanging the person, it'll save taxpayer's money but it's wrong. The actual fact is hanging costs more than putting a person in jail for a lifetime because when serving jail term, the convict works in the laundry, kitchen etc and in the end, more money is saved.</div>
