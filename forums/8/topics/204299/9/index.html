            <div class='col-md body'>I'm still not sure what the big hooha is about, and I find the arguments of double standards quite weak and unlikely to stand in a court of law.<br><br>Is proposing in uniform unheard of? Most militaries have a tradition of that, in fact they often go out of their way for such events. Is a kiss an acceptable part of a proposal? Certainly.<br><br>Is kissing in uniform unheard of? Not unless we want to chase down all those soldiers who kissed their loved ones after coming back from Iraq or East Timor. No, the restriction given out was a more general restriction on being publicly amorous which ought to be applied with common sense. In the same way it's unacceptable to play with the officer sword but acceptable to use it in parade. Both actions involve holding the sword but it would be illogical to deem all acts illegial by virtue of holding the sword.
