Bear with my lengthy story here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>From a normal person who hasn't gone tru NS b4 will consider him as a very romantic guy. He's kinda lucky to have propsed in front of the whole nation on national tv and also it was the last yr that the stadium will be around. Good memorable proposal. From a girl's point of view, she couldn't possibly ask more, a CPT earns quite alot in SAF, so future is secured. Proposal of marriage such a memorable 1, hard to reject. That CPT certainly has a win-win situation here under his control. Yes true that he displayed a good leadership by setting an example of getting married fast to have kids which is what those guys in white has always been promoting.<br><br>Now here comes the bad part of the proposal. <span style="color: red;">How come only recruits are affected by the wearing uniform no holding hands or kissing in public? Apart from the rank difference, aren't recruits also wearing the SAF uniform?</span> or are they wearing some kind of alien uniform that makes them different from others? To most guys in the SAF serving BMT now, will start to wonder if the "unwritten rule" exists in the 1st place or not. I do not think recruits as the lowest life form on this earth but i do admit they stink whenever they book out. Guys u all were recruits once, so does that mean u were also the lowest life form on this earth??? kinda funny hearing some1 scolding himself that u know.<br><br>back to the CPT. Such high risk he is taking might get him in trouble. He might get demoted on 1 hand but wins a wife on the other. He might be charged to detention for not respecting the uniform especially N-day.<br><br>After this incident, some ppl might envy him, some might congratulate him, some might even hate him. But for all i know its takes alot of guts to pull that kind of stunt and for that i salute him as a man. but risking his career over a proposal, this is an act of stupidity. Never go tru any deep thoughts. i might not know if he has alrdy discussed this over with the commanding officers on this stunt. Well if he hasn't, lets wish him good luck that nth bad will happen to him ba. </div></blockquote>My HR told us that we have to report to work sharp at 8:30 AM but my MD never show up until 9:00 AM.  Apart from salary and position different, aren't we all working for the same company?  Why my MD come at 9:00 AM and I have to report at 8:30 AM.  The moral of the story is wheter its corporate world or military world, when one get higher position or rank, one will get more privilages.  The ideal world is that all men are equal and one rule for everyone.  Unfortunately, in our "not ideal" world, not all men are equal and there is not such thing called one rule for everyone.</div>

Just stating some facts and thoughts about how some of the ppl out there might think.<br><br>If lets say u are a recruit currently, and u were told by ur PC about those kissing and holding hands not allowed in public as long as u are in Green.<br><br>Then the following week u watch NDP and u see that A CPT in Green who is part of the parade, actually kisses his wife to be after a marraige proposal. It will leave a big qns mark for the recruit, in fact he might come to question about the SAF Rules liao.<br><br>And if by saying what i highlighted in red, does that mean if a CPT has canot keep his cool when being provoked by some other officers, the CPT rains punches on the officer and he won't get charged becos he is of high ranks?<br><br>if its that way then what are the SAF rules for? Its very questionable u know?<br><br>If those rules are meant strictly for lower ranks ppl. then i shld say have another set of rules and conduct for those higher ranks ppl too.  like that it'll be more troublesome for the MOD dont u think its true?<br><br>1 more thing i would like to add on is, CPTs may not have as much experience in the army than the RSM or even the CSM. and just becos the CPT has a high qualification in studies which brings him up to being a CPT doesn't means he gain the respect he shld as a CPT.<br><br>In fact in any camp i go i fully respect the CO and the RSM and CSMs but not those officers. All they do is to command ppl and let the men do the sai gang.<br><br>Altho officers have gone tru 9 month in SAFTI but that doesn't mean after suffering in SAFTI u no need to suffer liao and throw ranks mah.<br><br>Hmm... end of day i'm still hoping that this CPT come out fine and doesnt get anything from the higher authorities. And pls next time think b4 u take action.<br>I wonder if he has given a serious thought b4 he planted that kiss lolx.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agreed with what boredandsleepy. I think those people who don't even know the basic meaning of regiment, either they have not been through<br><br>NS yet or they are just woman. You don't expect a leader who always talk about rules and regulation which they don't follow at all. We can throw away<br><br>the GOM about dress code and order and also throw away the rank. If you call that lead by example then we guys can do it also. Why only people with<br><br>high rank can do it? By the way in corporate world is a bit different. Because military talk about discipline. You don't get charge for insubordination but in<br><br>SAF you will. So come on. Think before you start talking about people are loser or Sillyporean. Only show that you haven't been through NS and you<br><br>don't even know anything about Military. Somethings are there meant to be followed, because there a reason behind it. Or else other countries people will<br>think Singapore Army wayang wayang one, can do anything they like.<br><br>P.S.(A person who been through NS will know what we talking about. And those who didn't will not know nuts about it.)</div>
