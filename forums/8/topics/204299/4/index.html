            <div class='col-md body'>I think SAF always got this "Abuse authority" problem. How come CPT can do such things in the public. Somemore in front of national TV? And a simple NSF or normal specialist can't do that in the public? Why? becos government spend money on them training them to become leader of tmr so that they can abuse authority? If everything like what you guys say things should be given some levy way, why they never seems to give NSF any of them? I mean if you do it not in front of national TV still ok. but What you telling the citizen of Singapore? That SAF got no Regimental? Officer can kiss in public and even in front of national TV? while NSF cannot? Then GOM fark one loh. Can just burn it and drink it liao. How come anything disadvantage to them will just not mention. I think all these regulars deserve to be hanged sometimes. I'm not saying all of them. But a lot of them. They either brain left it at home or never even exist after they join SAF. Doing such things in front of national TV and still so proud of it. Where all the regimental implement on NSF gone to? only apply to NSF only?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Typical pathetic Sillyporeans...so uptight and straight-laced about such minor issues like proposing to gf at National stadium in No.4<br><br>No wonder the country cannot progress....frankly, I think its sweet and nice to propose to one's gf during National Day...Like I always say..tyo each his onw and its things like this that makes life more interesting and more unique...What rules has he broken...I'm sure he serves the nation with pride and protecting the stupid butts of all these critical Sillyporeans from all threats...so why can't he be allowed some leeway to express his love...<br><br>What about the time honored tradition of getting married in No.1 with an arch of swords by fellow officers....C'mon...how about the many soldiers after WW2 kissing their loved ones in public to celebrate V-E day or V-J day...<br><br>Again I say...pathetic pathetic singaporeans...don't know when to let loose and only know how to complain...no wonder I am getting out of here...One-dimensional and one-track mind to all those who complain about proposing in National Stadium</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah tyhis topic very debatable sia... altho i myself nvr see the actual news but i heard it over the tv while playing games. Bear with my lengthy story here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>From a normal person who hasn't gone tru NS b4 will consider him as a very romantic guy. He's kinda lucky to have propsed in front of the whole nation on national tv and also it was the last yr that the stadium will be around. Good memorable proposal. From a girl's point of view, she couldn't possibly ask more, a CPT earns quite alot in SAF, so future is secured. Proposal of marriage such a memorable 1, hard to reject. That CPT certainly has a win-win situation here under his control. Yes true that he displayed a good leadership by setting an example of getting married fast to have kids which is what those guys in white has always been promoting.<br><br>Now here comes the bad part of the proposal. How come only recruits are affected by the wearing uniform no holding hands or kissing in public? Apart from the rank difference, aren't recruits also wearing the SAF uniform? or are they wearing some kind of alien uniform that makes them different from others? To most guys in the SAF serving BMT now, will start to wonder if the "unwritten rule" exists in the 1st place or not. I do not think recruits as the lowest life form on this earth but i do admit they stink whenever they book out. Guys u all were recruits once, so does that mean u were also the lowest life form on this earth??? kinda funny hearing some1 scolding himself that u know.<br><br>back to the CPT. Such high risk he is taking might get him in trouble. He might get demoted on 1 hand but wins a wife on the other. He might be charged to detention for not respecting the uniform especially N-day.<br><br>After this incident, some ppl might envy him, some might congratulate him, some might even hate him. But for all i know its takes alot of guts to pull that kind of stunt and for that i salute him as a man. but risking his career over a proposal, this is an act of stupidity. Never go tru any deep thoughts. i might not know if he has alrdy discussed this over with the commanding officers on this stunt. Well if he hasn't, lets wish him good luck that nth bad will happen to him ba.</div>
