            <div class='col-md body'>Hmph, nice to see the kangeroo court and lynch mob is out in force.<br><br>AFAIK, the greater militaries of other nations have always made it a point to involve their men's personal lives to some extent or another. The US military regularly helps out with their personnel marriage proposals and there are even such things as military weddings. Why the SAF does not do this could be due to the fact we are a conscript force and usually don't give a @#$ about the personal lives of our men. But when people actually care about their own lot like family... I don't think we should stop them.<br><br>While personnel getting amorous in uniform in public should be frowned upon, I don't think the CPT in this case went against the decorum of the uniform. Given the fact she had just accepted the marriage proposal, it is socially acceptable (and desired) at least for him to give her a kiss. I don't think they made out or anything, and that's that.<br><br>As for resources... I'm not sure what waste there has been. The parade is over and anything else is going to be discarded and thrown away anyway. This is act get in the way of anybody? Or is the public nature of the proposal too much for some of us to bear? I don't know but what I do know that in other nations people have gone to great lengths for proposals. I've heard of one being done on an US aircraft carrier deck with the entire crew involved. They're all family, and they know how to look out for each other and make the proper exception here and there.<br><br>I think we are starting to split hairs on getting this this guy and I frankly think that some of us should learn to back off and get some fresh air. And frankly I think that NS has been a miserable experience at times for me a lot because some people just can't seem to see beyond the rules and the books and the blacks and the whites. That would be quite a sad thing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by UandMe:</div><div class="quote_body">umm is it everyone, or just some of u?</div></blockquote>Hmm....I seriously wondered how many people really do support that ns officer for pulling that kind of stunt in national stadium on national day.<br><br>In fact, I strongly believe that nobody cared if he had pulled that stunt on any other day in the national stadium. My main concern is the feelings and confusions that ran through everyone's mind when they are forced to witness his act of bold, outrageous, arrogance, shameless, planned drama.<br><br>This cpt obviously knew that he would be putting his career at stake for committing that act on national day in the national stadium, and yet he chose to go ahead with it. -&gt; This is not an act of bravery, but an act of determined  insanity when he chose to persist on against his own sense of righteousness.<br>Now...tell me, does that makes him any difference from any terrorists out there as they both chose to abandon their sense of empathy for others and went ahead to execute their planned actions for the sake of their own beliefs. Does Singapore need people like him to be living among us?<br><br>Have anyone wondered what might the headlines and news reports be on if it wasn't a President-commissioned officer who tried to execute the exact same planned action? I believed the outcome would be alot different.<br><br>I am in awe when I read about those people who actually supported him in this post. Clearly, there are a few who secretly wished they were him. Hope that they can find their own sense of justice within themselves and not followed other people's sense of justice as their own. (That's the reason why cults, gangs, politics existed and are easily formed.)<br><br>Well, I condemn that cpt's actions cos he does not represent Singaporeans in any manner and he is a fine example of an ugly Singaporean who allowed his own personal happiness to throw and places other people's peace of mind at risks.<br><br>People will openly support the wrong when they do not have the courage to stand up to them or come to face their own inner justice. You'll find out that alot of people are in this category if you're not born yesterday.<br><br>A person will know that he/she is wrong if he/she chooses to go against his/her own sense of justice.<br><br></div>
