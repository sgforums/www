              <p>whatever it is...its not a good idea to lie in a court of law...the AG chambers may not charge the mother today....but they can still do it years later.</p>
              <p>And I dont think its a good feeling wondering when the charge will come(if it comes)...its the uncertainty that kills.</p>

              <p>well.....I know of another case where a preschool child was doing very well, until the mother took him away and prevented the father from seeing  him. A few days later, he became violent and was brought to the hospital for psychiatric treatment.  She made a child abuse report and took out a protection order claiming that there was a child abuse investigation. Only months later was it discovered that there was never any investigation as the attending physician did not find any signs of the claimed abuse.</p>
              <p>I think the courts tend to be more sympathetic towards mothers and don't really take much action against them.  Sadly, the ones that have to pay the highest price are the children.</p>

                                i remember this case clearly, only the son was his, the 2 daughters belonged to the woman's boss, one of the girl was strangely the result of an artificial insemination.....it was a really sad case, the mother poisoned the girls' minds and they became distant from the man, but at the end of the day, the man retained custody of his son while the woman married the boss who had fathered the girls and the woman cut off all contact with her son.....the judge had strong words for the woman for her character flaw....
                                
              
                                there was another case too where this engineer married a prc who later bore a son, she then fell for her ang mo boss, divorced the man and dumped the son but not before conning him of $10k and married the ang mo and bore him children....women can be vicious too...
