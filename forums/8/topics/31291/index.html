            <div class='col-md body'>just watch it on vcd . I didnt watch it before cos I m not a Starwars fan.<br><br>ok I m puzzle at why Count dooku aka Darth Tyranus let the clones he ordered at Kamino to fight with his own army of droids?<br><br>Is it a plot for the chancellor Palpatine to gain power so that he become the Emperor of the Empire in the future? That would mean that he is collaborating with Count Dooku and Darth Sidious secretly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no no the Emperor is not Darth Sidious.....I got info from starwars.com below on Count Dooku:-<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">But the Jedi didn't realize Dooku's secret. Behind a veneer of elegant charisma and well-tabled political arguments, Dooku had been corrupted by the power of the dark side. After his departure from the Jedi order, Dooku was seduced to the dark side by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith. By Sith tradition, Dooku adopted the name Darth Tyranus and added deceit and treachery to his already formidable array of weapons.<br><br>In both guises, Dooku began recruiting agents for what would eventually amount to the death of the Old Republic. As Tyranus, he contacted the notorious bounty hunter Jango Fett to become the template for a hidden clone army on Kamino. As Dooku, he appealed to the greed of the galaxy's most powerful commerce barons to consolidate their forces to challenge the Republic.<br><br>Deep within the mighty spires of Geonosis, Dooku chaired a meeting of the minds to formally create the Confederacy of Independent Systems. Separatist Senators alongside representatives from the Commerce Guild, the Trade Federation, the Corporate Alliance, the InterGalactic Banking Clan and the Techno Union pooled their resources together to form the largest military force in the galaxy. The Separatists were ready for war.<br><br>The Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi discovered the treasonous meeting and warned the Republic, but not without being captured. Dooku met with Kenobi in the Geonosian dungeons, and revealed to Obi-Wan the truth about the Republic -- that it was, in fact, becoming increasingly under the control of Darth Sidious. Distrusting of Dooku's words, Obi-Wan refused to believe and refused to join Dooku in rooting out the corruption.<br><br>Kenobi was soon joined by Anakin Skywalker and PadmÃ© Amidala, who had come to Geonosis in an ill-fated attempt to rescue him. Dooku placed the three captive heroes in an execution arena, but their deaths were staved off by the timely arrival of Jedi reinforcements.<br><br>The droid armies of the Separatists engaged the Jedi, and later the newly crafted Clone Army of the Republic. Dooku attempted to escape but was intercepted by Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi. The two Jedi challenged Dooku to a lightsaber duel, but Dooku's masterful skills in old-style lightsaber combat made short work of the younger combatants. As they lay wounded, another Jedi entered into Dooku's secret hangar.<br><br>The Jedi Master Yoda confronted Dooku. The two engaged in a titanic struggle of Force powers, neither besting the other. It came down to a contest of lightsabers. In a blurring tangle of speed and light, the two masters of the Force dueled. Unable to find an advantage, Dooku distracted Yoda by endangering Kenobi and Skywalker with a toppling crane. As Yoda used the Force to save his fellow Jedi, Dooku fled.<br><br>Dooku escaped, with the Jedi aware of his succumbing to the dark side, but yet still unaware of his Sith allegiance. Aboard his exotic interstellar sail ship, Dooku traveled to a decrepit warehouse district on Coruscant. There, he met with his master, Darth Sidious, and delivered the good news.<br><br>The Clone Wars had begun. </span><br><br>I guess maybe Count Dooku didnt expect the Republic to use the clones but Jango Frett would have told him about the incident at Kamino. Probably Episope 3 will clear this up......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I'm too early to say that Palpatine is Darth Sideous. But look at Ep3,4 &amp; 5,<br>why do Darth Vadar address Palpatine as Master? If code of the sith only allows 1 master and 1 apprentice then who will make Emperor Palpatine be?<br>But base on Ep1 &amp; 2, I speculate that Darth Sideous=Emperor Palpatine, look at the end of Ep2 with the battle, if he is playing either side and using Count Dooku as his runner, he will have the last laugh. If the Driod army wins, he as Darth Sideous wins, if the clone army wins, he as the head of the senate wins.<br><br>But again it is just my speculation. Let see in Ep3 who really turns Anakin to the dark side if it is really the same person!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
