            <div class='col-md body'>Birth is the beginning of a long journey that everybody has to go through. From young, everybody has to learn to discipline themselves and blend in society. Technology has made it a must for Man to be educated. Throughout the years, Man has made many technological breakthroughs that has benefited Man but further destroyed the Earth.<br>After Birth comes babyhood. Many a times, babies cry for nothing and for normal thinking older beings, we would usually be irritated by the cries and start to wonder what the baby is crying about?<br>Growing up, many children think it is hard to be young and they want to grow up fast and be an Adult, without knowing the consequences of being old. Adults think that, their childhood is still the best and they always seem to miss it the most. Children running around happily, without having to go to school, ever gay and joyful.<br>Man has added many implications in life and has made life more challenging for future generations. Society has become more stressful and people living day-to-day find themselves lagging behind and they usually think that the only way out of their misery is Death.<br>To some people, Death is horrible, but to others, death is just another phase of life, but no matter what, death is still an inevitable part of life. Many religions depict the picture of life after death while others creates the impression of eternal pain for sinners and luxury for saints. What if there isnÂ’t life after death? Or there isnÂ’t such thing as spirits? WonÂ’t it be scary to know that, after you physical form dies off, you wonÂ’t ever exist in the world that is ever improving? You will just be a forgotten figure out of countless of billions or even trillions that died since the world started. You will cease to exist, your memory goes away with you, other people shall just live their normal lives and you just donÂ’t exist. Your life will just be another that has passed just like countless of others. Though technology is considered advanced, Man yet to find a way to cure Death, or maybe Man can concoct a medicine that will stop Man from fearing Death. All in all, more Man fear death more than they fear birth. And Man is forever in fear for every minute every second of his life. Consider various events like a child, he/she is afraid of thunderstorms and loud sounds. Teens, they are afraid of allowances cut and relationship problems. Adults, afraid of whether they are able to afford living in this world. Come to think of it, Man can fear almost anything. Yet man has to face these fears and try to live their normal lives. Life, why is it created? To let Man suffer? Think about itÂ…<br><br>------------------<br>Born to the prophecy of the world</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Life is just like a blank piece of paper... With our stories written on it.... If you're afraid that you would 'disfigure' or dirty the paper.... Or you're afraid that you would not be able to draw a beautiful picture out of it, then there's really no point in giving that piece of paper to you in the 1st place....?<br>Just when you're afraid of death... I can assure you that there can be many more things which could be more terrifying than DEATH itself.....<br>Just when you're questioning why they draw the 'life force' out of you.... Why haven't you thought of what of you done to deserve it in the 1st place...?<br>If you think that life's miserable and suffering... Why complain when they've decided to end it for you...? If you think that life's all happiness and sunshine... Why complain when they've already given so much to you....?<br>If you've not wasted that precious gift given to you.... In other words, not commit a suicide... Your life would have ended by its 'destiny'.... Perhaps it's really time for you to move on for the 'next life'...? The 'next phase'...?<br>Does it even matter if the next phase exist at all...? Are you sure you want to hold on to it? What if it's even more tiring...? Would you rather your 'life' ends here...? If 'it' exist... You'll be on your way to finding out more about it when you die... If it DON'T, spare yourself the agony of trying to guess about something which DOESN'T exist at all......<br>But last but not LEAST.... Other than the fact of IF you commit a suicide... DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD HAVE A CHOICE IF IT'S REALLY THERE FOR YOU....? Whether another world awaits you, whether another misfortune is waiting to befall you, whether your PAST have dragged you down..... The FACT is.... Are you gonna 'DROWN' yourself....?<br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SilverWings:<br>I understand taht you're of a certain religion background.... Now... My answers may not be satisfying to your religious needs NOR maybe not even to your PERSONAL ones.... But these are just MY VIEWS... So please BEAR with me for the moment..? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>1. Why are we borned on Earth?</strong><br>To EXPERIENCE... Nobody ask you to be born into this world just to suffer or enjoy...? Everybody have their OWN BELIEFs.... And that is what I would call PERSONAL LIFESTYLE....<br><br><strong>2. Why do we have to die since we are already born?? </strong><br>Debatable.... One of the reasons I can suggest is when a certain LIFE is 'overloaded'..... May it be TOO MUCH SUFFERINGs for a particular person... Too much STRESS and such..? GROWING OLD.... Your body no longer functions as it used to.... You can no longer think properly.... You might indirectly be a HINDRANCE (I'm not saying that the aged are hindrance..)? You may be suffering ALOT of pain because of your health status.... (And you continue to LIVES in that condition it could then be 'THEORICALLY' proven that 'HELL' EXIST...)<br>For IMPROVEMENT..? So that NEW and STRONGER species or kinds could emerge...?<br>To move on to the next phase if there is one...? &lt;- Think about your primary school days asking... "Why do I have to leave this Pri school? My friends are ALL here..??" I guess it's something like that...?<br><br><strong>3. Why cant we live forever instead of just living a few tens of years?</strong><br>I think ALOT of the answers could be found in the answer to the above question..? At least I would answer it more or less the same way... &lt;- Taking into consideration that there're TOO MANY to be all listed out here.....<br><br><strong>4. Why do we have to suffer and work for food on Earth after birth? Can't we just enjoy Life?</strong><br>1st, I'm gonna talk about FOOD... PERSONALLY I think it's MOTION... On Earth, I think TIME don't make the world moves.... I would rather believe 'MOTION' does... It's a 'Time-frame Theory' of my own.....<br>2 points I would like to put up here.... 1st of all, if humans are created without DEFECTs... The COMPETITION would be TOO STRONG... Theorically 2 things can HAPPEN... Other species find much difficulty in taking over their 'leading position'... OR other species might even be ELIMINATED by them (not only talking about humans here... Can be ANY other 'leading species'....) ; The 'leading species' would be CREATING their OWN DOOM.... Through a GREAT REDUCTION in number... Because their 'powers' and 'control' are so DEVASTATING that it would soon wipe themselves out... Through a SHORTER TIME and MORE RUTHLESS manner... AND... IF 'leading species' are created without defects... Humans would not even have their chance to build their empire up to this status today.... Searching for food is just one of our 'defects'....<br>Talking about 'MOTIONS'.... Given the ability to live without the NEED to search for food or reproduce so that our species would carry on to exist (who needs a new generation when we can live eternity anyway..?) Chances for MOVEMENTs and CONFLICTs would be LOW.... Equally for 'connection', 'interaction'..... WIthout need for food there would be farm... Won't be trade... Won't be market... Where people come together to talk and walk.... Need for MOTION is GREATLY REDUCED.... Whatever disasters we won't die.... The result would be NO CHANGE in MOTION or a VERY SLOW MOTION movement going on.... Which 'theorically' would result in a CHANGE in 'TIME FRAME'.... LESS people to be born (If there is ANY need at all...? You and I might not even exist...?)<br><br>NOW, I talk about SUFFER... As another form of EXPERIENCE.... 1st of all, IF 'SUFFER' don't exist... I BELIEVE that humans would label ANOTHER experience as a 'bad experience' in turn of 'suffer'... Maybe 'laughter'...? (Like... It's 'killing' me...? NO GOOD...?) How do you even DEFINE 'SUFFER' in the 1st place...? I can tell you that MINUS off those 'things' now labelled under 'suffering'.... Humans would STILL categorised some NEW things under 'SUFFERING' anyway....?<br>And like MANY would have already know by CONTRAST.... Without 'suffering' people won't understand the 'meaning' of enjoyment and happiness.... (Like it would make any difference anyway now that 'suffering' is gone...?)<br>And ALSO... I believe that if there're such things as MOTIONS and CHANGES in 'Time frame'.... THEN 'suffering' would NATURALLY occur due to the 'change' or moments of 'inbalance' humans call 'CHAOS'.... It's 'inevitable'...? &lt;- Otherwise we would not even get our SHIT TURN at typing onto this FORUM already...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong>5. Where do we go after Death? Do we just disappear from the Universe?</strong><br>NAY... Can't help you on this one SORRY.... AnywayZ, to me... It's DOESN'T matter..... &lt;- Like when asked WHICH UNIT would you be POSTED to when you're 'POP'..? (PASSING OUT PARADE... &lt;- Many people PASSED OUT during the PARADES..? :p) You can go ahead and SERACH YOUR HEAD.... For an ANSWER that EITHER don't exist... Or CANNOT be as REAL as it gets when it comes to the REAL THING.... Hmm.... Just like when I tell you watching TV is sitting in front of a box which flickers images that would make you LAUGH and CRY... FEAR and SMILE... And SO MUCH MORE... &lt;- Not ADVERTISING for MEDIA CORP.... It's still not an inch as close as compared to you EXPERIENCING it yourself...?<br>Some people are just TOO EARLY... Rather than indulging on something which you'll learn about soon or later in life (out of life...?) why don't you just concentrate on the CURRENT PHASE before you MISS it..? AND.... PERSONALLY I believe this phase is NOT really REVERSIBLE ya know...? You SURE don't see DEAD PEOPLE coming out of nowhere to tell you about their 'after death' experience...? Well... Even if ya tell me that they DO.... They SURE won't join you for a cup of coffee like a normal living human does...?<br><br><strong>6. Whoever brought us to Life on Earth, has he already abandoned us to perish and suffer?</strong><br>Do you even know if such a character exist...? And even if he/she exist would you TRULY know who he/she is...? I mean... Everybody claims him/her to be WHO they BELIEVE IS.... I'm NOT saying they're WRONG.... IN FACT, I ALSO have a 'theory' for THIS.... But it's kinda LONG-WINDED (Not like I'm not long-winded...? :p) and out of topic lah... So I'll omit it here and SPARE you all the SUFFERING....<br>EVERYBODY have their own BELIEFS..? As long as they DON'T cross my path and DISTURB the OTHERS... I'll say 'PEACE'.... &lt;- Kinda hard to accept it from a Devil don't ya think...? :p )<br><br><strong>Ask yourselves these questions..<br>Think about it at night..<br><br>The answers to these questions are rejected by countless people, but still , He has already given us the Truth. He hopes that we'll accept it.<br><br>Seek Him, and you'll find Him.<br>If you dont seek Him, you'll NEVER find Him.<br><br></strong><br>Ok... Nothing to say about this part... Not like I'm gonna be doing my part for SATAN here...? ~Hohoho..~ OKAY!!! Don't BASH me!!! :p<br></blockquote>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....
