            <div class='col-md body'>Was reading Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus.  Found this really interesting passage...<br><br><blockquote><strong>Falling in Love Right Away</strong><br><br>Sometimes a woman will see something or even imagine something about a man that triggers a surge of confidence in her.  She feels, "This is the man of my dreams; he is the one for me; he is perfect for me."  It's is as though she falls under a spell.  In this state, she responds to him as if she were already getting everything she could ever want.  She is lovingly responsive and receptive to whatever he does.  The excitment certainly brings out the best in her and makes her very attractive, but it can also prevent him from continuing to feel a strong attraction for her.<br><br>She feels so satisfied by his presences that she begins to think, "He is so wonderful, what can I do to be worthy of him? How can I make sure he likes me? How can I be most attractive to him?"  These kinds of thoughts then lead to action.  As she proceeds to pursue him, he becomes less interested in her.<br><br><strong>A wise woman is careful to not pursue a man more than he is pursuing her.</strong><br><br>A wise woman approaches the situation differently.  Even if she does fall in love, she is careful to remember that even though it feels as if she is in an exclusive relationship with her ideal partner, she is not.  Even if he has the potential to be the man of her dreams, he is not yet.  She needs to remember that they are in stage one.  He is not even exclusive with her, nor does she really know him, and they definitely are not engaged to be married.  It is vitally important for a woman to remember that stage.  Having a clear awareness of the stages of dating helps us to keep this balanced perspective.  Even in an exclusive relationship a woman needs to practice not giving more or will will inevitably get less. </blockquote>You guys agree?!<br><br>I, for one certainly do...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 10 October 2000).]</div>
