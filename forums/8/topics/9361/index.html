            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Love is a passion. Obsession. Someone you can`t live without. Someone you fall head over heels for. Find someone you can love like crazy and will love you the same way back. Listen to your heart. No sense in life without this. To make the journey<br>without falling deeply in love, you haven`t lived a life at all. You have to try, because if you haven`t tried, then you haven`t lived. </blockquote>On love...(Oh yeah...that 4 letter word no one can escape from...<strong>L-O-V-E</strong>)<br><br>As young girls, most of us grew up listening to fairytales starring 'Prince Charming' or some knight in shining armor, or as we now call him 'The [imaginary]Mr. Right'. In a sense we have learned to be idealistic and somewhat fantasy-driven in the practical or theoretical search for this person. We often set out 'qualifications' that this person must meet which ends up looking like a greedy and indecisive child's christmas list.<br>"All I want is an attractive, intelligent, financially secure, ambitious, athletic, humourous, articulate, romantic, confident, and communicative guy - is that too much to ask!?" is what we often hear over drinks amongst girlfriends and often playing in repeat mode in our own minds. We say this, when perhaps the reality of the situation is that all we want is someone that will understand us and make us feel loved unconditionally - then maybe we'll be able to settle for less of the above (maybe). As human beings, the one thing that we all have in common is love. Yet, just as unique as our DNA, so is our concept of this phenomenon and the way in which we approach it. Everyone believes in some theory about what happens to someone after they die, but no-one ever knows for sure. This is a somewhat morbid, yet illustrative comparison to the notion of love - one of the great mysteries of life. To define love, however, is not impossible. We create our idea of love from experience, inexperience, others' experience, or perhaps even movies or song lyrics. Whatever the case, it is specific to the individual. My own definition of love would be that it has to be a two-way street. To be 'in love' with someone requires that the other person feel exactly the same way in heart and in mind. For example, I cannot say that I'm in love with Ekin Cheng for obvious reasons (though I wish that I could!).<br><br>Confused and somewhat hopeless about the whole issue at hand, my two closest girlfriends and I pondered about this concept this weekend on San Francisco's beautiful wharf. We sat on our blanket, admiring the glitter effect the sun had on the water, sipping Starbucks and reading one another real life love stories from a compilation book. It made me realize that every single person "owns" a collection of stories of love that makes her the person she is today - one that is unique to only ourselves, and cannot be compared, duplicated, or judged in any way. Also, that love, although felt by all, is understood by few, if any. We all have our own ideas about what constitutes love - like receiving poetry, having our passions unlocked, or being complemented by your partner when waking up with no make-up and your hair being in a mess! (oh the horror!). All in all, it is the little things in love that count. Love is something that could make the most articulate person at a lost for words, or make the most stubborn heart become mellow. It is something that we all set rules upon, yet break it when we do happen to find our that certain somebody. It is something that we all ask for advice about, but only end up following our own hearts.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...<br><br>[This message has been edited by NaiveGirl (edited 03 October 2000).]</div>

But, is it really possible to just move on with my life without letting the special someone enter my heart?  By starting a relationship, you are not only giving him a chance, but also yourself, and him and i, as a couple...<br><br>I have never regret meeting/knowing any of my ex-bfs.  They taught me a very valuable lesson.  All of them.  They loved me during the relationship, and they allowed me a chance to love them back.  It's just too bad that things didn't work out.  But, they will always be someone that understands me for who I am and loved me for who I am.  They helped me grow and become who I am now.  I still keep in touch with most of my ex-bfs.  There are not many people in the world that understands you and love you for who you are.  Once I find that person, I will not let go of him, even if he hurted me...It takes a lot of fate to even become a couple.<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...</div>

ACK!)<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Each of us has a hidden place somewhere deep within ourselves; A place where we go to get away, to think things through, to be alone, to be ourselves. This unique place, where we confront our deepest feelings, becomes a storehouse of all our hopes, all our needs, all our dreams, and even our unspoken fears. It encompasses the essence of who we are and what we want to be. But now and then, whether by chance or design, someone discovers a way into that place we thought was ours alone. And we allow that person to see, to feel and to share all the reason, all the uncertainty and all the emotion we`ve stored up there. That person adds new perspective to our hidden realm, then quietly settles down in her own corner of our special place, where a bit of herself will stay forever. And we call that person a friend.<br><br><img src="http://www.geocities.com/naivegirl00/gold.gif"><br><br>My Gold is not an object, nor is it anything of monetary value.

There are NOT many people that I open my heart to share life`s special moments with. However, those who I do care about, they are My Gold.

I wanna tell you that I'm a very bochap guy... If not that the fact that I'm quite in the mood to type today, I won't even bother to say a thing in here nor to even lift a finger for this....<br>2nd of all I'm a LAZY guy... I would rather talk to someone, forget about what I've said (because there're simply too many things in this world to remember... Happy or unhappy, I just choose to let go....)<br>Last but not least, because I want the way ya phrase things... Many of the ideas are very much just like my own... This is Devil1976 here... Nice to meet you.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>One of the guys wrote from above (I think it's bochup?) that we shouldn't put in too much effort in love... I TOTALLY agree with that.... At least at this point of my life this is still my belief.....<br>Native girl... I think you're right and I agree with you that people's prospective of LOVE (in fact not only that but also for life in general...) is greatly influenced by the MEDIA... TV, songs, internet, news, gossips, friends.... I used to wish to share with this world my point of view... Until I became tired... Afraid that people would abuse the information that I provide for... To cheat for a relationship maybe...? I dunno... Sometimes I just look at people... And I couldn't care less... Not like who I used to be... Always trying to help... Anyway, take this as a small token of 'gift' from me..? Because I like the way you are... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br>My belief.... That almost ANY relationship (Includes LOVE) is based highly on TRUST and UNDERSTANDING..... No matter how close 2 people stand together, it can NEVER be as close as their minds can get... That's why talking, communicating and UNDERSTANDING is VERY IMPT.... As a BGR, or should we call it 'love'? 2 people come together because of certain attraction or reason... A 'natural' form of 'trust' builds up from there... The 'trust' in your own taste... In who you choose.... In who you chose to be with... But you won't be able to see beyond the mind... You won't be able to see beyond the future.... So you're DUMPED... With just TRUST... Something which would make you CRY when your 'trust' doesn't live up to its name... Something which would make you FEAR the rest of your 'trust'.... DO NOT HAVE HIGH EXPECTATION of your LOVE... You're RISKING your sanity... You're RISKING your own BELIEF in love...... I USED TO failed... Because I thought of love as a FAILURE... Because I thought LOVE has failed me so many times.... By the law of simple probability, it SHOULD fail me again.... But think of love as NOT LOSING but WINNING.... To know someone better in your life and to let someone know you better... A chance to let you try... At least you know that you've TRIED.... If you failed it's okay.... You're ALWAYS STRONGER than a tortise that chose to remain in its shell forever as because it's afraid of how big this world is... And the imagination of how it's gonna hurt it..... We live life to SEE.... To LIVE.... We should not be going backwards... Nor to FREEZE it or END IT there.... If you feel that you need a rest... Then take a rest.... But NEVER give up on HOPE...... Because you SHOULDN'T indulge in just the FAILURE in LOVE.... Think of the memories of sweetness... The laughters... And though HE/ SHE might be a bitch/ bastard...... At least ya got to know another... Learn from it, absorb from it... And ya SHOULDN'T FEAR it.... Nothing in this world is really for free..... Sometimes ya take more, sometimes ya give more.... Just take WHATEVER ya can and leave the rest as PAYBACK... Don't be SAD... At least not for too long... Don't cry..... The more ya do of those things.... The more you're gonna hurt yourself... And in other words... You more you'll have to pay... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">) LOVE is NEVER meant for measurement.... Because it lives on TRUST, it's gonna be a light that's gonna glow FOREVER... As long as the TRUST is there... And so you can't measure LOVE because you CAN'T measure TRUST (which is what it lives on..) For as long as TRUST exist, you don't have to measure it.... And if you do, you'll most probably find that it's no longer there anymore (because you've already lost trust when you choose to DOUBT and hence measure it...) What you would be measuring would be what ya BELIEVE is TRUST... But in reality, what you've measured would be just flickers of your imagination..... Memories of the past... Memories ya chose to linger on and believe in..... Just like if I were to ask you to choose from a whole set of album containing pictures of your daily life... You CHOOSE what you wanna believe in... What ya wanna see... And the MEDIA, just STRENGTHEN your BELIEF.....<br>When you UNDERSTAND, you don't TRULY UNDERSTAND.... For UNDERSTANDING like LEARNING is a never ending process.... Things changes, so do people.... When ya believe that ya UNDERSTAND, ya thought your UNDERSTANDING is COMPLETED... Ya STOP LEARNING.... And HENCE, has given up hope on your relationship.... LOVE requires UNDERSTANDING.... Because LOVE is a NEVER ending process..... No matter how ordinary things might seems to be, no matter how boring things might seems to be.... DON'T BELIEVE that you've COMPLETED the 'cycle'... For if you do, then my answer is YES... You HAVE COMPLETED it... Just by putting an END to it.... Just like a man digging for a SURVIVER among the ruins.... No matter how ordinary and how CONVINCED he is that there simply won't be anything or anyone down there anymore, he shouldn't give up.... If not, the story would just end there...... DON'T THINK OF LOVE AS JUST AN INTERESTING AND LOVING BUSINESS... THINK OF ITS HATRE AND UNDERSTANDING.... THINK OF ITS SHARING... THINK AS IT AS HAVING JUST ORDINARY PLAIN WATER AND BREAD.... Do you think you're ready for THAT...? If you think you ONLY want the MERRIER part to the WHOLE picture... Then THINK AGAIN.... The PRICE could be PAIN.... Don't say I didn't warn you on that....<br>Love the other party for who he or she is, don't create expectations or a DREAMWORLD... Understanding that when 2 people stands in 2 DIFFERENT ROOMS.... They can never know where exactly the other party is standing.... It's neither party's FAULT that they don't know.... It's just a SIMPLE game of TRUST that HEAVEN is playing on you.... TERMINATED~~~~<br>Sorry that I have to stop here... Explanation? Whenever I'm writing such articles I'm not really 'being myself'... I need high level of concentration and cannot be distracted... YUP... I was distracted... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> That's why I usually choose to talk in person too.. Because we can choose wherever we wanna go..... Pardon me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hope the above is enough to help to a certain extent... Of course there're more to it and this is an incomplete article....

Love is not something that can be measure.  In a relationship, you must give a little and take what is offered.<br><br>Trust, understanding, chemistry, and communication is the most important factor in love to me.  You must be able to trust your partner for taking care of your fragile heart.  You must understand that your partner too have feelings and needs, most of the time it's different for your own.  Chemistry is what keeps the sparkes in the relationship going.  To make sure that the lust is still there.  Communication, one must tells the partner what's on their mind.  No one is born to understand another human being.  We are not mind readers...<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...sting like a bee...</div>
