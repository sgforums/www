            <div class='col-md body'>this is what i have experienced before<br><br>i was in a crowded train and it was heading towards BB,then there were 2 stupid chinamen who stood dead centre in front of the train doors and alot of ppl get off at BB esp during evening rush hours.<br>then when the train stopped at BB,the idiots refused to move and continued to stand there and happily chatting away.then i managed to squeeze past them from their sides and i could feel many ppl pushing me so that they can get out of the train but i dont blame them for it since the fault lies in the 2 stupid idiots.as i left the train i could see an uncle point fingers at them and mumbling something under his breath and then 1 of the gay couple led the other guy deeper into the train to sit down. farking idiots<br><br>now mrt stations got those markings where passengers are not allowed to step beyond so that passengers alighting from the train can do so with ease.<br>but there are some idiots who are either blind,illterate,brainless,think they are nightcrawler's descendents.<br>purposely stand inside the area marked by the yellow lines.<br><br>and of course as mentioned before.<br><br>there are indeed alot of farking idiots.<br>along the escalator there are signs to tell u to stick to the left side. but there are ppl who do the following.<br><br>1.stand on the right.<br>2.rush down the escalator using the left side and others stand on the right.<br>3.couples who blatantly hog the escalators.FARK YOU!<br>4.when getting on/off the escalator,they do it sloooooooooowly. are u retards? for the senior citizens they are excused. wht i am refering to are those able-bodied young men and women.<br><br>senile at this age ? nope. just plain stupid.<br><br>lastly.bus cheats.<br><br>either their dads/mums own SBS/TIBS or their parents are big shot.<br>when they board the bus at the interchange ( this is what i saw) they walk towards the exit and tap again. are they idiots or are they idiots? mind u,some of these ppl are students frm good or at least not bad schools ok?<br>and yes adults do it.<br><br></div>

I felt it's wrong to do so, regardless of the thought that they have (tap now or tap later is the same, cause I'm paying concession, the amount deducted will be the same anyway).<br><br>The correct way is to tap the reader when you are alighting, because that marks the end of your journey. If I'm the bus captain or ticket inspector, I will not hesitate to ask them to get off the bus because what they have done, to me means that they want to alight, so they shouldn't remain on the bus anymore. Agree?<br><br>Also, if they have this kind of mentality, then they should as well just tap on the entrance reader only, cause even if they do not tap the exit reader, the same amount will be deducted (for concession), so why still tap on the exit reader?<br><br>Next, there are this kind of bus commuters, when the bus is at the stop and the exit door is already opened, those people will slowly rise from their seats, take their own sweet time to walk to the exit, stand beside the ezlink reader, then again take their own sweet time to search for their ezlink card, tap and slowly exit.<br></div>
