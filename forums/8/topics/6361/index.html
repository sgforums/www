            <div class='col-md body'>It's about professionalism. I'm not defending the SAF, nor am I criticising them. But the training that we experience now is basically just as tough. But because the calibre of soldiers now are much different from old timer soldiers, the training has to evolve.<br><br>The soldiers of yester-years were those prepared to take hard knocks, they were accustomed to hardship, they grew up in such environments, so it's alright if the army did not have much welfare for them.<br><br>New generation soldiers are thinking soldiers, they are smarter, they are able to think for themselves, and are not afraid to complain when they feel the need to, as such, the old methods cannot work on them.<br><br>Training has to be adjusted, modified, so that we can keep up with out neighbours in terms of training, weapons systems and capabilities. Is it wrong to provide a little comfort to the poor soldiers who go out to train hard and come back with knocks and bruises?<br><br>This form of welfare serves to boost morale as soldiers know they have something good to look forward to when they return from training. It gives them an incentive to train harder.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oakley&gt;&gt; The bionix vehicles were used a year or two ago already. 42SAR was one of the first. I had the "honour" to have fun in it for a year and let me reveal something..the HQ bionix vehicles do not have a workable turret. It doesn't move, the gun tube is fake, there's only a radio set behind the tube!! (I mean the bionix used as tactical HQ, not all the bionix) Er..better not say too much or SAF internal security come find me..<br>How's that for "Scare the enemy away with your water gun?"<br><br>BTW SAF going soft is the result of countless USMS suggestions..and of course parents' complains.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It isn't really a bad thing, considering in the U.S. these days the recruit trainees are given  a small "we care for you" notebook instead of being greeted by a "in-your-face-screaming" sergeant. Anyway in armies thru'out the world only the voluntary ones are damn tough. The mandatory services are much easier.

I hate to dampen anyone's arduor, but allow me to present a hypothetical situation for your consideration.<br><br>Imagine this. An economic crisis several times the severity of the '98 recession hits SE Asia. Relations between Singapore and Malaysia deteriorate to unbelievably low levels. One fine day the water pipeline running from Johor to Singapore gets blown up, claimed by Malaysian authorities to be the work of "extremists". Malaysia assures Singapore they will do everything to restore the water supply, and even send elite army units to guard the pipeline. Yet, in the meantime, the pipeline remains broken. The lofty promises aren't very reassuring.<br><br>At this point Singapore has no choice but to annex Johor and hold the water supply ourselves, by military force. Let us then make the assumption that the attack is a success. International condemnation of the aggressor (that means us) notwithstanding, a holding operation in foreign territory against a hostile population is terribly expensive both in terms of money and manpower. Remember, many of our troops are reservists who hold regular jobs in peacetime. How long can we conceivably sustain a state of war before the domestic economy is crippled? And then the counterblow is delivered : Malaysia notifies us that some of the water has been poisoned.<br><br>The point I make is that in this particular scenario, all your fancy military gadgets will matter only in the first few days. After the initial victory they are utterly useless. Consider that.</div>
