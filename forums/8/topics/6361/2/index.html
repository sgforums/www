The MIG-29 squadron?? ha..ha...they can't fly. The MIG-29 is not built for the tropics in the first place and lots of other problems ensure that the entire squadron is operationally-grounded. If u want to sound smart, read a bit more Jane's and analyse the combat capabilities of the Fighting Falcon and the MIG-29 first.<br><br>The Bionix has some problems, dun wanna comment too much on it (security risk) but since Estranged is from 42 SAR, u'll agree with me that the Bionix's swimming capability is a nice joke and the plain sight of it is damn funny. Though it can swim.....<br><br>Nothing much I say here can't be found in Jane's, so quite safe. And yah.....we're getting Apaches!!! With Longbow!!! Damn...no Maverick though.<br><br>Take KL in 2 days? Overly optimistic I feel....though we can indeed put more men in the field.<br><br>Ok, even I must admit that my dear SAF has indeed has indeed gone soft. Recruits nowadays are damn "nuah". Dun agree too bad, lots of us can testify. Even, OCS is "nuah" too. Training standard still there (more or less), a lot of interesting things dun happen to u anymore. coupled with an increase in attitude problems, and the ban on "harsh" punishments to weep out these problems, (7 min FBO inclusive of drawing arms for 4 hrs sound familiar to anyone out there?) doesn't help things much. Amazingly, Commander OCS, CO SISPEC and CO BMTC are all SOF men.<br><br>Food wise, ok lah...men need good food. Can't fault it. But if the elevator thing is true, what the heck.....then we build stairs for wat??? life is always exciting when u are somewhere very high and they shout fall-in..<br><br>conclusion.<br>SAF got problems, but still a good force (regionally at least). SAF getting soft in terms of hardship, but I still think the training value is there.<br><br>Lack of war experience? Pls...tell me besides the Gulf War and little armed conflicts involving mainly the US and such, which other wars are they for any armed force to fight? we're not the only ones with this problems. look at everything relatively pls<br><br></div>

And if either falls, Singapore will fall as well. That's probably why we try to maintain good relations with our neighbours.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, as I am now in army, i really do not know how tough army was last time. All I know that now, there is a lot of welfare given to soldiers compared to last time. Restrictions of punishments by the OO (Orientation Officer) has loosen up a lot of the toughness that once linger around bmt. Even the place for bmt have improved by leap and bounce. Just imagine sleeping on king coil bed.<br><br>Anyway, if war really broke out in Singapore, I really wonder would ever survived the war, neither would I dare to go think about the consequences, Singapore Army troops are still very 'green' in the sense of war experience, although we always have 'exercise' going on, it will always be different from the realities of war. I also cannot imagine myself facing the bloody scence.<br><br>Also another question is, would the soldier and citizen of Singapore really stay and fight? Although many would give answer as yes for this question, but who would know and predict what would happen if a real war broke out? The cruelty of war is so devastating so that people would just break down and maybe just 'run away'.<br><br>Let us just pray that no war would happen and that we would never have to go through such 'experience'.<br><br>------------------<br>Zhi~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This I have to speak out against.<br><br>I think the SAF is an excellent organization. It's a bit inefficent at time,but bearing in mind 70% of the soldiers aren't professional soldiers, almost all of whom are which 24 and below, the SAF runs pretty smoothly.<br><br>Tough training doesn't make a good soldier. it provides the skill, it provides the endurance and stamina. But what it also incalcuates in u is an extreme dislike for the system. Gotta agree right? Change parades, punishments for minor offences, crazy time limits for doing things. You would really really hate the system if u went thru all that daily.<br><br>What the SAF aims to do is to provide the skills to fight a modern war, as well as an interest to fight it, and an interest to cooperate with everyone, regardless of rank.<br><br>A good soldier is one who's physically fit and is is rock cold due to the harsh training received during peace. A good solider is one who has an interest to fight and feels comfortable fighting/training at his own pace and to steadily increase that pace. That is why our conscript army is probably one of the more successful conscript armies in thr world.<br><br>Remember a bullet can kill anyone, trained on untrained, regardless of whatever form of training he's gone thru. War's a matter of luck and will.<br><br>I think u guys think the SAF is going soft coz u guys had it worse. But i mean the standard's still there, and if the standard can be achieved without as much mental/physical stress as before, wouldn't that be make for a better soldier?<br><br>Plus i don't think even under the harshest training will we be prepared for war. As  such, malaysia wouldn't be prepared, neither would Indo. They too don't have the experience. We're all be on equal footing right?<br><br>I think having good camp facilities is good too. I was at Pasir laba camp and that place is a shithole. Really run down, u don't feel like training. On Tekong, among new buildings, you feel so much better. And the lifts on Tekong aren't for recruits use. On;y if u have a severe lower limb problem can u use it. We still use the stairs. I had to go up to the 5th floor daily. My section mates tried testing the system and got 1 week's confinement just to go down 1 floor for fun.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Soft ?<br><br>I think the kind of training we give to our men depends on what kind of warfare we will like to engage when a war breaks out. Technology.<br>That's wat we can play with. Man to man fight ? Difficult because we dun have many soldiers. Remember, we are only a "little red dot" to our neighbour who has 7000 commandos.<br><br>In the Chinese Art of War, the most important element we need when a war breaks out is money. The cost of war is very high, especially if it drags. Without money, we cannot buy weapons, without money, we cannot buy food. Soldiers without food will starve and morale will run low .. how to fight ? Now you know why Singapore like to have large reserves.<br><br>Depends on US ? Forget it.<br><br>Can Singapore be defended ? YES.<br><br>Why would people attack us ? Many reasons. All it takes is an extremist to be the PM of M'sia or Indonesia. Racial and religion issues can be the cause too. Look at Kuwait. He was attacked by his "brother", let's not take things for granted. Peace will not last forever .... I personally believe the 4th world war will take place one fine day .... just when.<br><br>But I think certain amount of "tekan" is still necessary for our soldiers. In many occasions, when I am in deep shit, I always tell myself "I have been through worse in the Army" and that serves as motivation and encouragement. It makes me feel more confident.<br><br>I was from 40 SAR. And you know wat life is like in a mono-intake. Remember once when we had day AND night range for a whole week. For that week, we only slept 30 minutes each day, AND I AM NOT JOKING !! For that week I only slept for a total of 2 hours 30 minutes ! Book out i koonz like siao ah !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Shiok: Welfare is indeed a lot better than last time. Now they have such rules as no pumping above 20 and such.<br><br>At least the condition of the camp increase greatly with the shifting to the new camp at the jetty.<br><br>When I was in BMT, I was in camp 3, the condition there is very bad, just imagine one whole platoon sharing a bunk ( 40 person ), then the bed is those bed that have been slept by thousands of people. And worse thing is that only the water from the canteen can be drank. Just imagine going all the way to the canteen just to get water to drink.<br><br>Swimming was even worse, camp 3 have no swimming pool and everytime for swimming lesson, we actually had to march all the way from camp 3 to camp 1 just for a 1 hour swim and march all the way back to camp 3 to continue with the training.<br><br>Booking out from camp 3 is another major problem. At that time, we have to actually wait for the 3-tonner to come fetch us, just imagine 3 3-tonner coming to fetch the recruits of the whole camp , we could sit there and wait for hours before coming to our turn to load up the tonner.<br><br>Thus in comparison, who would say that presently the situation is bad, we must always not forget one thing is that we are serving the army, and in army there is no such things as an easy task. Thus the only thing that can be improved is the condition, so better not complain so much when so many before you have suffer so much more.<br><br>------------------<br>Zhi~</div>

Do you really think the commanders really go fight the war outside with the men, or do you think commanders would be hidding somewhere inside the Mindef building doing the commanding? Maybe many still do not know that there are many secrets inside, all top secrets which is unsuitable to post it here.<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 11 March 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Max_rian:<br><br>SAFTI MI has to look nice. It's our show-piece to the world. Fact of life.<br><br>Does the niceness of the place affect the training in any way? No. It doesn't. Besides, do u know how many hours cadets spend a day in the nice nice looking room? How many hours on the nice nice bed?<br><br>I know specs go through tough times in less amiable conditions in Pasir Laba too, but u spend less time in training school. The longest time a spec spends in training school is a AI spec i believe, 10 weeks BSLC and 18 weeks AISLC. That's barely half the 42 weeks an OCT spends in OCS.<br><br>They may be soft officers around, but lots of tough ones around too. Don't be judgmental just because of the room and the bed. Make our way to OCS and "enjoy" the bed if you're so envious. There'll be people in every batch willing to trade places with you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True to what you all have said...and i do agree to the fact that MORAL is indeed important to fight a war...in this case fight a war in case deterrence is not possible.<br><br>For me, i am currently disrupted, but i had been through OCS for a certain period of time. The only thing that i can't stand is how we wayang so much when a higher ranking officer is present. However, i think we ought to see that it is indeed different when you are there outfield in the shitholes and trenches while your buds are fighting during an exercise. And it is indeed different when you think of yourself in a situation when there's a real war and you are hiding in a shellscrape...i think all you guys will understand.<br>Come on, lets move on to the whole picture of the real intent of our conscript army. We, are indeed citizens and for some of us,PR. While some of us might say we are forced into Army, while some of us might say its for the betterment of themselves etc...we must not forget that we are all Singaporeans, and we too have to defend our motherland in times of trouble. This is our life and destiny. The army has gone 'soft' like some of you all has said, this is all because our government, or to be more exact the defence ministry, cares about us, Singaporeans. But that doesnt mean we have to be 'soft'. We should never take these things for granted and should approach training like a professional and loyal soldier that has Singapore in his heart...that i think this is the most important lesson to get into a singapore soldiers heart, the words ' Singapore'&amp; ' Loyalty'. This i feel is seriously lacking in many of our guys heart and soul.<br><br>Different Era, different Feelings, that's why some of you has commented on how well army has been treating us. But instead of asking why army has gone soft, ask yourself whether the people in the army has gone soft and whether they still have Singapore written in their hearts. Think about it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am now currently in BMTC 2 V coy. In the PTP batch.Just served over 3weeks...and this is my first book out.I dun think that SAF is getting soft. But is going towards the right direction.However i still think the tekaning is ok.But sometimes i do feel that the seargents are a bit F*** up too.NO unity among them while expecting the "cao recruits" to become unified.Even my PC doesn;t show leadership capabilities...<br>I think that it is the pple in SAF that cok up and not the ORG itself.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well if Commanders fought along side the men, and if Commanders died in the fighting, who would lead? Leadership and communication is most impt during a war. Why have snipers otherwise?<br><br>I guess Commanders seem to have an easy life. They probably do. But think of it this way. They've worked in the organization many many years, and like the private sector, they obviously are recognised and are entitled privelleges due to their long service. Plus many are very smart men when it comes to thinking out strategies at  country-level. Note the difference between a Master Sgt and a BG, both who have probably served the same amount of time, but who's the bigger shot and why?<br><br>We're probably all complaining because we're NSF. Paid little, holding an insignificant rank. If you were a office boy or a clerk in an MNC, i'm sure you would feel the same. THe only comfort u get is that ur just abt the same rank as ur peers so in that sense there's equity.<br><br>The one thing the army has tried to teach its soldiers is to respect rank at all times and know ur place. THere's jealousy and all that, but someone has to lead and someone has to follow, at all levels. At BMTC, 3SGs get shit from above, and we get shit from them. Even a LTC has someomne pressing down on him. While we may get pushups and confinements, officers may get other forms of non-physical punishments, which may actually be worse than physical ones, because it may affect their chances of getting promoted and that's important, since these men have chosen the SAF as their career for life and they probably have no alternative in the private sector.<br><br>And of course there are secrets all about! Rumours too. But I seriously doubt anyone besides the top brass would know anything about them. So don't come behdey I know this and that. Everything and everything in the SAF is "restricted" if u haven't realised.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well after reading posting from some SMART people, I personally fell very sad and disappointed to know you have this type of thinking, do you know what is warfare? Do you know that other country, commanders fought together with men in the batterfield? That is mainly because they can understand the situation better and command the next move. Imagine commanders inside the underground waiting for people to report back the situation to them, and some people still expect to win a war like this, JOKING. As for a commanders, they chose to hide inside underground doing commanding, there could be many reasons, the main reasons I think is because they got no confident of winning, if not why they dare not command the war in the batterfield?<br><br>As for top secret in military, don't assume that only top brass knows everything, don't forget also got securities, first line defence people, people gathering intelligents there and even cleaners. So what if it is restricted, if a place where nobody go in there, do you think still can be used during war time? So as for those smart guys who don't know anything about military, DON'T ASSUME, ALWAYS ENSURE, go and be humble and go find out more before talking rubbish here.<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 12 March 2000).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by millennium (edited 12 March 2000).]</div>
