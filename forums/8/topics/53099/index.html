They are:<br><br>NS6 between NS5 Yew Tee and NS7 Kranji. Proposed station name is Kadut. Proposed location in Sungei Kadut Industrial Estate.<br><br>NS12 between NS11 Sembawang and NS13 Yishun. Proposed location near Yishun Industrial Park A.<br><br>NE2 between NE1 HarbourFront and NE3 Outram Park. Proposed location is part of Tanjong Pagar railway station nearer to Kampong Bahru Rd.<br><br>NS6 cannot be build now as land aquisition is necessary (there is currently no vacant land there for a station. Also the station serve little propose as it's being build in an industrial estate. Actually the government planned to build NS6 Kadut station along with other stations on the Woodlands line back in the 1990s, but withdrew the plan probably due to low demand.<br><br>NS12 can be build now but too serve little propose as there's only an industrial estate nearby.<br><br>NE2 cannot be build now as where the station is to be build is currently owned by Malaysia's KTM Berhad, which provide railway service.<br></div>

So expect that the passenger load on this line is lesser than the NEL, which may mean higher fares during the time when the line first starts operation in 2008.<br><br>The CCL too, span over the sub-urban towns of Singapore in a loop and orginates from Dhoby Ghaut which is in the city, and pass thru busy commercial corridors in the city, serving Bras Basah area, Suntec City and Millennia Walk.<br><br>Only the under-construction station next to City Hall station is within walking distance from an existing station, while others are build to integrate with existing stations to form an interchange, like the current Outram Park and Dhoby Ghaut stations.<br></div>
