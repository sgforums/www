            <div class='col-md body'>This is a rather strange GP question, though i would like such argumentative essays as it causes a writer to position himself by defining why he chooses his side of the fence.<br><br>Comments:<br><br>1. Very wrong, almost sweeping statement for local gals. This statement applies more for jap and korean gals rather than our locals.<br><br>2. Weather conditions here cause our skin to require plenty of 'drying' agents like tar soap. If not frequently applied, face will appear oily and concentrate in their pores to develop pimples and warts. Temperate climates in the northern asian states do not have this problem.<br><br>3. Rebonding is usually for gals who think their hair is simply too dry and shampoo/conditioner combination cannot cope with the frayed and split hairs. Unfortunately, it has been marketed as a 'feel good, look good' flavour, hence it's misconception that rebonding makes a gal look more beautiful. In some cases, it is the exact opposite.<br><br></div>

As long as one substantiates it properly, the answer is plausible. Argumentative essays has always been the kind that: if you 'lean' too far to one side of the argument, your essay will seldom score.<br><br>I never really liked the marking scheme for GP anyway, too subjective: if the tutor likes what you wrote and your point of view concurs with his, then he grades you well.<br><br>Bah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
