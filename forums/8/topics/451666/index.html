            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>First, I'd like to declare I am not in the medical profession nor in the legal profession (anymore). Everything I comment is based pure on my own opinion and facts gathered from certain online websites. The conclusion is up for you to decide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cannabis is a first scheduled drug according to singapore's Misuse of drug act and possession/consumption of a certain amount leads to the death penalty. We were taught from secondary school that cannabis is dangerous and could lead to addiction and bodily harm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But now, debates in the US are threatening to render everything we learnt about cannabis for the past 30 to 40 years invalid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, let's talk about addictivity. According to several pro-cannabis website and testimonies in America, Cannabis is non-addictive but possibly habitual. The chemical compound in Cannabis called delta 9 tetrahydro cannabinol is the cause of the "high" feeling when someone smoke/consume cannabis. However, this chemical compound does not cause physical dependency unlike tobacco and alcohol. Long story short, cannabis is less addictive compared to tobacco and alcohol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://recoveryguy.hubpages.com/hub/Is-Marijuana-Addictive">http://recoveryguy.hubpages.com/hub/Is-Marijuana-Addictive</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, let's talk about the harmful nature of cannabis. According to the CNB website, consumption of cannabis could cause the following syntoms.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inability to concentrate.</p>
              <p>Slow reaction.</p>
              <p>Distorted thinking and perception.</p>
              <p>Poor balance and coordination.</p>
              <p>Extreme anxiety, depression and paranoia.</p>
              <p>Decrease in motivation and drive in long term use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above syntoms are the exact same syntoms as if someone were to consume alcohol. But in Singapore, though heavily taxed, alcohol remain legal.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, there have been no recorded death from cannabis consumption alone aside from accidents. The cannabinol compounds is not toxic in humans in small amounts. There are theories that the lethal amount of Cannabis is if someone were to smoke 3x their body weight, average 210kg, of Cannabis in a 15min period.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Research into if Cannabis destroy brain cells shows surprising results. It turns out if taken in the correct amount, the compounds in Cannabis actually repairs nerve cells.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.selectsmart.com/DISCUSS/read.php?16,693724">http://www.selectsmart.com/DISCUSS/read.php?16,693724</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, the claim that Cannabis is a "gateway drug" and it induces a Cannabis user to try harder drugs. This is actually a flawed claim. There are currently thousands of Cannabis users in America that never even try harder drugs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The arguement is that Cannabis users tried harder drugs simply because the illegality of Cannabis causes users to get their supply from black market which also sells harder drugs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the theory is, if cannabis is not illegal and is sold in the open market, Cannabis users will not be exposed to the black market and harder drugs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, we already established that Cannabis is less addictive than alcohol and tobacco and also less toxic. You may not advocate the use of intoxicant and I respect that, but there is a reason why you should look at Cannabis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recent studies in the west shows that the chemical compound in cannabis actually have anti tumor and cancer fighting properties.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.nowpublic.com/thc_marijuana_helps_cure_cancer_says_harvard_study">http://www.nowpublic.com/thc_marijuana_hel...s_harvard_study</a></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The delta 9 THC and CBD compounds in Cannabis have the properties to induce the cancer cells to commit suicide while leaving healthy cells untouch, according to these articles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, there is currently only one company in the world that is actively researching on using cannabis for medical purposes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.cannabisscience.com">http://www.cannabisscience.com</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of their latest news shows positive results in their cancer/cannabis treatment research.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.cannabisscience.com/news-a-media/press-releases/284-cannabis-science-reports-second-cancer-patient-receives-clean-biopsy-report-confirming-the-biopsy-is-free-of-cancer-cells.html">http://www.cannabisscience.com/news-a-medi...ncer-cells.html</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A POT (Patients out of Time) conference was held in Arizona, America on 29 Apr 2012 at 0027 HKT. Speakers of the conference are qualified medical doctors and researchers in cannabis.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The video of the conference was recorded on live stream and was later uploaded to YouTube.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NORMLnet">http://www.youtube.com/user/NORMLnet</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Speakers of the conference touch on topics on addictivity of cannabis and it's medical uses in HIV, neuropathic, cancer, alzymer's disease and many more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One of the video to take note of is Cannabinol and Cancer care, presented by Donald Abrams, MD. Qualifications: [url="http://medicine.ucsf.edu/hemonc/faculty/donald_abrams.html"]http://medicine.ucsf.edu/hemonc/faculty/donald_abrams.html[/url]</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8KW_j2KGUA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8KW_j2KGUA</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Claims made:</p>
              <p>Cannabis via vapor inhalant induces appetites in HIV patients who suffers from anorexia and body degradation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cannabis helps in pain management in peripheral neuropathy patients who suffers from HIV, cancer and those undergoing chemotherapy. Cannabis causes anti inflammatory effects and studies shown to be more effective than opiates like morphine and neuropathic drug like pregabalin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Studies also shown that usage of vaporized cannabis are safe for patients use together with oral opiate drugs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note: Dr Donald Abrams mentions that it is important that the word "cure" is not used as it shows bad image for the research and may sound like quackery. However he admits that studies has shown that Cannabis could be used as an effective complimentary treatment together with conventional treatment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is also important to not ignore conventional treatment</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I do not condone the use of cannabis in Singapore as it is illegal and it carries the death penalty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But this question must be raised. If all the claims turns out to be true. If Cannabis turns out to be less dangerous and addictive compared to alcohol and tobacco. And that it has medicinal properties that could help in cancer treatment. Why are we hanging people for it? Why is it still illegal?</p>

              Gosh I wrote a reply then it didn't get posted. Now what did I write...
              
              Well, I've never tried it so I won't know. I do believe that most of the things we've been fed by the media and government, even the culture, are distorted and inaccurate. Just look at our food industry. Those that are marketed as 'good' may be the worst food one can ever ingest for their health. Do you think cow milk is as good as marketed? It is this huge because it provides good money for the selected few who controls the world market. And what about coffee?... People end up in rehab because of alcohol addiction and alcohol is legal. Why? Think lobbyists.
              
              I have read stories about people who used marijuana for recreational purposes and all I read was positive feedbacks. It is better than calming pills (psychiatric medicine), which is addictive in nature and alter brain chemistry. My point is, some people must be getting stinking rich by not legalizing weed.

              <p>I believe there are reasons why certain forms of drugs are illegal. When I took some of them, during those times, I am super pro-drugs (fuck I feel so good these drugs and heroin should be legal to everyone man!)... because I don't see myself dying from it, and in fact, drugs provided articifial instant happiness...</p>
              <p>Now that I am clean, I reflected back and realize that I could have done things differently like rob or kill someone else to feed my drugs habit. The reason I didn't do that is simply because I don't need to but the habit is wasting my money lots of it, but assuming I am heavily addicted to drugs, I could possibly do things like murder or robbery.</p>
              <p>So I believe there are reasons the moment they place a certain drug in the illegal lists. But of course, humans have err before, so I won't be surprise if they realize some drugs are actually good and should be legalize.</p>
              <p>So basically you need to find out the exact reasons why people put these once legal drugs into the illegal section. There must be justifications for it, you need to find out what are these justifications.</p>

              <p>Honestly, I just dont know where to begin.</p>
              <p>First of all, WHY is Cannabis criminalised in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Secondly, WHO criminilised it in the first place ?</p>
              <p>Thirdly, IS Cannabis a "drug" or a "medicine" ?</p>

              <p>And the list goes on.</p>
              <p>I can tell you one thing. It is political from the very start. The experiments they used back in the 1950s in teh U.S  are totally outdated. E.g gasing monkeys  with THC resulting in death NOT by cannabis, but by suffocation. Just to add a little bit to the legal consequences, it is the US of A that criminalised Cannabis, and like the good followers of the world power then, adopted it into national law. </p>
              <p>I know many of yous just simple say that its illegal because the LAW says so. But seriously.. ever wonder and questioned WHY ? HOW did the such a law come into the first place ? Is it still practical now ? Is such control needed in this context and this situation? Are we actually sacrificing countless lives in the name of Pharmaceutical companies instead of using a natural plant like Cannabis to cure cancer, epilectic attacks, chronic pain and many many other diseases. </p>
              <p>Cannabis is an amazing natural phenomenon. The Indica and Sativa varients both contain THC and CBD that is crucial to the human body in terms of recovery. But not much reseach has been done until recently, e.g University of Jerusalem successfully extracted CBD to begin positive trials on major diseases. </p>
              <p>Those that talk  about Cannabis as bad bad bad.. and evil . Are just.. pretty much either never smoked the good shit or just down right ignorant and dense. </p>
              <p>Of course I am not considering chronic consumption. But lets face it, even with chronic consumption, there has yet to be a worst case scenario where death actually occured or any extreme violence or deaths associated with it.</p>

              I had been on Xanax for years and never am I going back to it again. As tiny as it seems, it calmed me, yes, but the side effects it brought take a long time to wear off. I am still having memory problems after quitting it for a year. Do a simple google search and you will know how damaging this pill is to the brain.

              <p>Give it 5 more years and you will see health products with THC or CBD elements in it. Companies scrambling to assert claims into thier products that all along, they have been researching these health benefit properties.</p>
              <p>I am just appalled by medical practitioners who totally discount any alternative treatment while insisting on seriously harmful pharmaceutical products. I am already on a campaign on Chemo awarness for various types of cancer. These kind of alternative treatment should also be given equal weight.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, due to various levels of national criminilisation of Cannabis, many more will continue to have to pay hundreds and thousands and even millions on products that only have a 20% chance of success on a specifc kind of cancer.</p>
              <p>The other is the countless ammount of people put to death over something that should not have been illegal in the first place.</p>

              <p>But better now than never. A convulsion of issues have forced the US of A to actually reconsider it's prohibition. Economy, social and political awareness, its just a matter of time now since major developed western countries have pretty much either relaxed substantionally the criminilisation of Cannabis or the de-classification of it as a Class A drug.</p>
              <p>Which reminded me of a National Geographic show I saw few weeks ago, a series apparently on Medical Cannabis. Informative on a general level for those that are interested.</p>

                              <p>But better now than never. A convulsion of issues have forced
              the US of A to actually reconsider it's prohibition. Economy,
              social and political awareness, its just a matter of time now since
              major developed western countries have pretty much either relaxed
              substantionally the criminilisation of Cannabis or the
              de-classification of it as a Class A drug.</p>
              <p>Which reminded me of a National Geographic show I saw few weeks
              ago, a series apparently on Medical Cannabis. Informative on a
              general level for those that are interested.</p>
