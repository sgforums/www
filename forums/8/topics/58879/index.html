            <div class='col-md body'>Received this in my mail...not sure true a not but just shared with u all...<br>-----------------<br>Please read it is worth it,<br><br>Microwaving Water!<br><br>I did not know this, did you?<br><br>A 26-year old man decided to have a cup of coffee. He took a cup of<br>water and put it in the microwave to heat it up (something that he had<br>done numerous times before). I am not sure how long he set the timer<br>for, but he wanted to bring the water to a boil. When the timer shut the<br>oven<br>off, he removed the cup from the oven.<br>As he looked into the cup, he noted that the water was not boiling,<br>but suddenly the water in the cup "blew up" into his face. The cup<br>remained intact until he threw it out of his hand, but all the water had<br>flown<br>out into his face due to the build up of energy. His whole face is<br>blistered and he has 1st and 2nd degree burns to his face which may<br>leave<br>scarring.<br><br>He also may have lost partial sight in his left eye. While at the<br>hospital, the doctor who was attending to him stated that this is a<br>fairly common occurrence and water (alone) should never be heated in a<br>microwave oven. If water is heated in this manner, something should be<br>placed in the cup to diffuse the energy such as a wooden stir stick, tea<br>bag,<br>etc.,<br>(nothing metal).<br><br>It is however a much safer choice to boil the water in a tea kettle.<br><br>GENERAL Electric's RESPONSE:<br><br>Thanks for contacting us, I will be happy to assist you. The e-mail that<br><br>you received is correct. Microwaved water and other liquids do not<br>always bubble when they reach the boiling point. They can actually get<br>superheated and not bubble at all. The superheated liquid will bubble up<br>out<br>of<br>the cup when it is moved or when something like a spoon or tea bag is<br>put<br>into it.<br><br>To prevent this from happening and causing injury, do not heat any<br>liquid for more than two minutes per cup. After heating, let the cup<br>stand<br>in the microwave for thirty seconds before moving it or adding anything<br>into<br>it.<br><br>Here is what our local science teacher had to say on the matter:<br>"Thanks for the microwave warning. I have seen this happen before. It is<br><br>caused by a phenomenon known as super heating. It can occur anytime<br>water is<br>heated and will particularly occur if the vessel that the water is<br>heated in<br>is<br>new, or when heating a small amount of water (less than half a cup).<br><br>What happens is that the water heats faster than the vapor bubbles can<br>form. If the cup is very new then it is unlikely to have small surface<br>scratches inside it that provide a place for the bubbles to form. As the<br><br>bubbles cannot form and release some of the heath has built up, the<br>liquid does not boil, and the liquid continues to heat up well past its<br>boiling point.<br><br>What then usually happens is that the liquid is bumped or jarred, which<br>is just enough of a shock to cause the bubbles to rapidly form and expel<br><br>the hot liquid. The rapid formation of bubbles is also why a carbonated<br>beverage spews when opened after having been shaken."<br><br>If you pass this on ... you could very well save someone from a lot of<br>pain and suffering<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
