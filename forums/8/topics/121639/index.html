            <div class='col-md body'><br>To me its always the parent's fault for not teaching kids manners and how to behave.<br><br>Today I met this neighbour and this is the 2nd time I caugh him smoking in the lift.<br>He waltz in with his wife (my bf caught her smoking in the lift with her 4 kids. The kids are worse) as if its his right and just puffed away. I told him off that he should not smoke in lifts.<br>He is a tattooed ah beng and goes:  Yah lah! yah lah! Then he behaved childishly right there and then, shake his head, open his mouth and mouthed what I said.  So to told him to talk to town council. And I have town council a call to report the matter.<br><br>To me, always, I balme the parents for poor parenting skills if the kids act like bastards. This is because I see this kind of ah beng, ah lian and their irresponsible, uncivil manners .. i know their kids also will not be any better.  Anyways, I know they have equally tattooed friends who are really bad people (like loansharks, underworld kind) and they gamble in their house. I'm waiting for a time to call the police and raid their house.<br></div>
