Was just joking wif u. Now i can safely say u r not from coslab rite?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Anyway, I know wat u r driving at. There is a whole world against MLM and another for it. At the end of the day, if the prooducts aint gd at all, why are pple still buying them rite? Prob pple are paranoid cos many MLMs focus on getting more pple in than to sell the product. But having said tat, we cant yi zhu gan da fan zhen shou chuan rite?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeap..absolutely agree...i do tink that MLM is a feasible business plan...juz tat alot of pple here are doing it the wrong way....they are hard selling to their own frens rather than coming a good intention to share..if every networker can share with true and sincere intentions, then the power of networking is unimaginable...of coz, having said all these, the products are ultimately the most important factor in all forms of business...without good products, u dun get good word of mouth and u dun get the advertisements which u really want...actually , MLM makes and breaks a company..hence it is still impt for the company to maintain itz good reputation and service or product standard to ensure happy networkers in the biz!!</div>

I think that this exponential growth also means that there must be exponential number of downlines to support your success.... Too many sacrifices don't u think?.... To all those good folks out there, there are many ways to earn money, but are you going to sleep well if you know that eventually there will be many exponential bottom downlines who would be trapped in this game?.....
