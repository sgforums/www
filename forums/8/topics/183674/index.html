            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Mariner:</div><div class="quote_body">last time he wasnt like that. until he entered secondary sch i guess. sec 1 he was something like currently, sec 2 and 3 he would at least talk to people at home. sec 4 till now jc1 he became back what he was now. i know he doesnt seems to like my father. cause when he was young always got beaten up cause he was quite naughty i can say. since he was young he seldom talk to my father. you know those kind of dad who was brought up in the 60s and 70s under harsh disipline who could not take any nonsense you thro at him...<br><br>when you try to pick up a conversation with him, he will either ignore you or he will give you some rude replies. </div></blockquote>it shldnt be the case of the beatings..surely, some other things had happen, which you might not know..<br>there is another possibility. You mentioned that he is in JC now..probably, the transition is too great for him, that he decides to study very very hard for it to get good grades. I have seen people, who can ignore everything around them and concentrate on studies....worse than bookworms...Then, they get burnt out, and sometimes, get emotional unstability..<br><br>but since your bro has social life too, then its not that bad...probably he feels that the family do not understand him, so no point talking to you all..that is why, i suggest you have a heart to heart talk to him, and make him really realise that people in family care for him, and is worried because he dont talk at home...<br><br>good luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The fact is you're a very concerned brother and that's good. However, I would not agree with your actions. In your brother's case, I think it's an extreme situation of not confiding into family members. We're all basically like that. We prefer to share our thoughts and views with friends rather than family members because some infomation may be too personal.<br>You don't watch porn with your brother rite?</div>
