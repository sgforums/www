All your parent will think that their sons or daughter who is a poly student, are way much inferior to a jc one. And what do i mean by lousy? It means everything. Your character, future, abilities are all in question. And then poly student feel upset that they are lousier and that makes her claims more valid. She is probably right that JC students are able to get scholarship, but is wrong if she use it to comment that jc are better than poly. Doesn't mean that someone is willing to pay for her education means she is better than you.

I feel that JC are people who are more motivated to concentrate on their studies, therefore achieving gd results. While Poly people tend to play more than their effort in study, only start study when near exam. I say this as a general term. Of course there will be exception in every case like JC CMI or Poly got straight A student. I m a poly student b4 by e way. I think the reason most of us ended up in Poly is that our o-level we never really make an effort from the very beginnning, only start towards the 3 quarter of the yr and some even last min. Most of you guys, dont u wish u had a chance to go JC if it is possible? after all sch fees are cheaper, the route to Uni is wider. again. i say Most. not all. Some of u will have a preference for Poly instead. But i believe most of the ppl here will always harbour a dream of If Oni i can get into Jc. its like in your Primary sch, where u hope to get EM1 instead of EM2 or Em3. In seconday school where u hope to get into express instead of normal.<br><br>Aniway i wonder why the author make such a remark. What is she trying to prove aniway? There is no definate answer JC ppl are better than Poly. What are we comparing? Book Smart? Survival Skills? Can she prove that all JC people are better? What she can provide is that she based her assumption on the Generalised O-Level results oni and the university intake for JC students compared to Poly, and the behavior of some. To be honest it doesnt matter who is smarter. JC people or Poly. There will never be a conclusion. So my advice is dont get upset over this. Let these shallow people think what they like.<br><br>There will always be people who are better than u. If you think JC people are better than poly, thenthe public sentiments is that poly girls are more pretty than JC people. Fair enough? Of course it isnt, coz it is just an assumption as there will be pretty, and no so pretty one in each department</div></blockquote>considered summrizing it n sending it to Straits Times..<br><br>Regarding this statement, " think the reason most of us ended up in Poly is that our o-level we never really make an effort from the very beginnning, only start towards the 3 quarter of the yr and some even last min. "<br><br>That is abosolutely wrong. In my case, i did study very hard for my Os...I started revision as early as Mar n a few mths before the Os i would mug until midnite n sometimes even later...Well in the end i got l1r5 16 pts n well i was utterly disappointed...friends who dont even study can get 10-12 n go to a top jc..even my 2 siblings who study only about 2-3 weeks before the Os got single digit for l1r5..<br><br>I considered going to a jc..but seeing my  engrish grade of C5, i doubt i could cope with GP. My chinese though average of B3, i find that i have so much diffculty trying to memorise words that i think Alvl chinese will be worse since i believe there is no textbk n those vocab handbk that i used to memorise...I also have no A maths n i took only combined science thus i doubt i would be able to cope with A lvl science..<br><br>As u can see some ppl who dont want to go jc  because of the subject comb in sec school n also wHether they can study..some ppl r born to study like my siblings who have fantatstic memory..<br><br>I actually hopE to go to a jc  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

Or perhaps how life in poly has braoden your perspection in life like forming several groups who go round doing something meaningful to the society etc compared to some who only had books stuck to their face... And perhaps to add on, JC students may have ideas for some product, but they don't know how to implement it, whereas poly are much better in this area.<br><br>I think you guys should consolidate such experiences and wrote back against Adeline because if you never wrote back, its just implying some misconception to the public. Its no use saying here in this forum because your audience is only a limited number.</div></blockquote>Why waste time and write back to the press when they are going to edit if some sentences or words are not suitable? It may just make matters worse. There's no point writing back. At least in this forum, our words won't be edited, unless the moderator finds it unacceptable.</div>

In fact, I think they read it, think it make sense and is a good article, and they just publish it. As long as you writing something worth to publish, and can be seen in public, they will publish. If they are really going to edit it, it is probably the grammer mistake or spelling etc. And i doubt they will edit those as well.<br><br>Newspaper would not want to be in a shoe where they publish a letter and the author wrote back complaining that the letters were edited and the papers had distorted his viewpoint. Then people loses trust with the papers. Of course, articles written by their own journalist is a different matter.<br><br>And looking in this matter, I am sure the papers are happy to publish your letters. Since Adeline had set poly students a challenage, so are you going to take up this challenage and put up a strong debate with her? Honestly, I think you guys will win already by getting the papers publish 3 of your articles even if you lose the debate.</div>
