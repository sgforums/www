So happened that there was this fellow colleague (who took the A Level, Uni route in Computing in NUS) who joined my worksite from another place.He was mentored by a senior programmer ( a poly graduate but working 2 yrs already) on the architecture and framework stuff.3 weeks on the poor senior programmer was still helping him execute a piece of java code that the giy didn't noe how to run ...<br><br>Yes she does not claim to saying poly ppl are dumber and the works. However I feel that her words are certainly pretty dumb for a uni grad.<br><br>Maybe its time for her to start working than see whos winning in the coporate circles.You can have the brains, but without EQ or being street wise, you still be eaten.<br><br>PS: I have personally worked with 1st class honours grads from local uni who are just working as ordinary programmers who think that their results will rescue them to something bigger...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Sorry ppl,but have to state a case really.</div>

So happened that there was this fellow colleague (who took the A Level, Uni route in Computing in NUS) who joined my worksite from another place.He was mentored by a senior programmer ( a poly graduate but working 2 yrs already) on the architecture and framework stuff.3 weeks on the poor senior programmer was still helping him execute a piece of java code that the giy didn't noe how to run ...<br><br>Yes she does not claim to saying poly ppl are dumber and the works. However I feel that her words are certainly pretty dumb for a uni grad.<br><br>Maybe its time for her to start working than see whos winning in the coporate circles.You can have the brains, but without EQ or being street wise, you still be eaten.<br><br>PS: I have personally worked with 1st class honours grads from local uni who are just working as ordinary programmers who think that their results will rescue them to something bigger...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>That fucker is a senior what... he has got 2 years of experience! Im sure he was as blur when he first got the job, if not, even BLURER! hahahahahahaha.... And maybe he took 2 years to learn while tht fresh uni grad needs only 2 days? And people, stop quoting examples lah.... you guys are representing everyone with the minority... Having found a pearl on the seabed doesnt mean that all the sand around it are pearl too....</div>
