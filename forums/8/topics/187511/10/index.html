            <div class='col-md body'>Why some students who can go jc want to go poly? because they just want to end their suffering early and earn money asap. Poly teach you a skill that you can use right away in the working world. jc? i dun think so, what can they do? clerk? bank assistant? 1 hr earn $6 - $6.50?<br><br>For me, when i was in sec 2, i already decide i nv go to jc, cos it wun suit me.<br></div>
