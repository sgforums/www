A student may find it easier to score better because<br>(a) The JC he comes from is one the best. He finds relatively less competition here because he now competes with people from JCs that are not the "best".. again generalizing here but bear with me.<br>(b) He works even harder than he did in JC. Or he now has better time management than he had during his JC years.<br><br>Anyway score better doesnt mean more slack. So many other factors that must be considered as well   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>2. I dont know about you but I have friends who got A1 A2 for G.P essays come to uni and realise with a shock that they can only get a B for all the arts gem module essays they write.<br><br>The essays in Uni are more focussed on analytical skills and application of topics learnt so for those who are not too strong in those, its very very siong for them. This is especially so for certain  arts essays which are available in level 3- level 4 cross-fac modules<br><br>3. Avenues of study? If you live in hostel then congrats. But lately there are fewer and fewer places to study. Maybe this is so 3 years ago. Take the central library for example. It was deserted during my 1st year. 3 years later, I cant even find a table to sit down at.. let alone study in the study room. The faculty itself has limited tables with access points and are dominated by whoever gets there first. This applies to classrooms, lecture halls as well<br><br>4. And the places with air-con are occupied to the max because they are so sought after. Not everywhere is air-con like parco bugis junction la.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If you are referring to classrooms and lecture halls please look at point 3. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>5. I dont have to wake up at 6 a.m for marikita but I have to wake up at 5.45 am because I have an important tutorial/lecture/class test on that day. Also I have an 8 to 8 class schedule during my 1st 2 years. 8 to 8 means i have to wake up at 6 am if I dont live in a hostel and live in the N.E or East. Again, this is dependant on where you live and which uni you go to. If its NTU, its 10 times even worse  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I think the standard for GP is higher.<br><br><blockquote>3. Avenues of study? If you live in hostel then congrats. But lately there are fewer and fewer places to study. Maybe this is so 3 years ago. Take the central library for example. It was deserted during my 1st year. 3 years later, I cant even find a table to sit down at.. let alone study in the study room. The faculty itself has limited tables with access points and are dominated by whoever gets there first. This applies to classrooms, lecture halls as well</blockquote>well I was actually talking about seeking help compared to JC. In JC the most you seek help from your classmates and tutor. In uni now, you have ivle, consultation with lecturer AND tutor and more informed seniors.<br><br><blockquote>4. And the places with air-con are occupied to the max because they are so sought after. Not everywhere is air-con like parco bugis junction la.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If you are referring to classrooms and lecture halls please look at point 3. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></blockquote>better than JC right? most classrooms no aircons. Only LT and library got aircon.<br><br><blockquote>5. I dont have to wake up at 6 a.m for marikita but I have to wake up at 5.45 am because I have an important tutorial/lecture/class test on that day. Also I have an 8 to 8 class schedule during my 1st 2 years. 8 to 8 means i have to wake up at 6 am if I dont live in a hostel and live in the N.E or East. Again, this is dependant on where you live and which uni you go to. If its NTU, its 10 times even worse  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </blockquote>agreed. NTU is much worse than NUS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

On the other hand, you may find that some of the essays you took in uni are easy because you were able to grasp the relevant topics and concepts taught. In that sense, you can score better because the things you learnt were well defined.<br><br>Based on my personal experience, if I define an area of study for GP, I am able to do well for it.
