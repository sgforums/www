These students are not even the best of the JC cohort. The best students usually win scholarships and go overseas.<br><br>Seen many casualty in my batch who still think they are top poly students. The truth is top poly students are just top poly students. No big deal. COMs holder are a dime, a dozen and many are casualty of a normal system. Not a scaled down system like poly.<br><br>So fellow poly students!! We may be weak academically but let's make up for it with hard work!</div></blockquote>Reality is not easy for everyone.

            <div class='col-md body'>The word is not smart or not smart. I feel that JC are people who are more motivated to concentrate on their studies, therefore achieving gd results. While Poly people tend to play more than their effort in study, only start study when near exam. I say this as a general term. Of course there will be exception in every case like JC CMI or Poly got straight A student. I m a poly student b4 by e way. I think the reason most of us ended up in Poly is that our o-level we never really make an effort from the very beginnning, only start towards the 3 quarter of the yr and some even last min. Most of you guys, dont u wish u had a chance to go JC if it is possible? after all sch fees are cheaper, the route to Uni is wider. again. i say Most. not all. Some of u will have a preference for Poly instead.
