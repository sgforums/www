            <div class='col-md body'>actually does not matter jc or poly....<br>who got most $ who win..<br>if u do a salary survey survey on poly grad and uni grad. The result will probably be uni grad higher. In that sense, uni grad. are better. Jc students mostly go uni except for a few lousy ones like some from CJC and some other ones...They probably go overseas U ,SIM , or even apply poly.<br>Those highly successful ppl from poly are exceptions just like there are also exceptional uni grads .<br>Having said that , gg poly or jc or uni whatever is personal choice, just like a 1st class hons student can choose not to study masters and go out work instead. Would he feel inferior that he does not have a Masters or pHD? No, because he might be a manager in a few years time as compared to a phd student doing research in labs.</div>

I won't mention their names to prevent discrimination, but it is commonly known that students from these JCs tend to get lousy A level results.
