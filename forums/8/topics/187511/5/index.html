Of course there will be exception in every case like JC CMI or Poly got straight A student. I m a poly student b4 by e way. I think the reason most of us ended up in Poly is that our o-level we never really make an effort from the very beginnning, only start towards the 3 quarter of the yr and some even last min.

But i believe most of the ppl here will always harbour a dream of If Oni i can get into Jc. its like in your Primary sch, where u hope to get EM1 instead of EM2 or Em3. In seconday school where u hope to get into express instead of normal.<br><br>Aniway i wonder why the author make such a remark. What is she trying to prove aniway? There is no definate answer JC ppl are better than Poly. What are we comparing? Book Smart? Survival Skills? Can she prove that all JC people are better? What she can provide is that she based her assumption on the Generalised O-Level results oni and the university intake for JC students compared to Poly, and the behavior of some. To be honest it doesnt matter who is smarter. JC people or Poly. There will never be a conclusion. So my advice is dont get upset over this. Let these shallow people think what they like.<br><br>There will always be people who are better than u. If you think JC people are better than poly, thenthe public sentiments is that poly girls are more pretty than JC people. Fair enough? Of course it isnt, coz it is just an assumption as there will be pretty, and no so pretty one in each department</div></blockquote>Nice one.....i just think she's the only lousy one...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
