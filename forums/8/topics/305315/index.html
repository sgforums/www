If you are talking about non matrimonial homes, then you would be right.<br><br>In the rights and duties section of Women's Charter, it doesn't specifically states that the rights and duties will only be contingent on marriage annulment.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><br>Rights and duties<br>46. Â—(1) Upon the solemnization of marriage, the husband and the wife shall be mutually bound to co-operate with each other in safeguarding the interests of the union and in caring and providing for the children.<br><br>(2) The husband and the wife shall have the right separately to engage in any trade or profession or in social activities.<br><br>(3) The wife shall have the right to use her own surname and name separately.<br><br>(4) The husband and the wife shall have equal rights in the running of the matrimonial household.<br></span>[/b]</blockquote>She does not have a claim to the home because he is the absolute owner to the house and it is mortgaged to a third party ( "DBS" )who has a right as a creditor to foreclose. That is the issue.<br><br>The only right she has now is to chase Ben for maintenance provided she knows his bank accounts or where he is working. If she manages to track Ben and his place of employment , she may be able to apply for an order to garnish his salary as maintenance.<br><br>Even if she has a part ownership of the house - the creditors are still entitled to foreclose.  Price of joint ownership and accounts. Only her sole accounts are  protected in the sense that it is hers, not shared with him.</div>

Check notice to quit again because it is roughly the same in common-law country.<br><br>Notice to quit - Landlord issues the written notice to the tenant within the legal specified time required aka 30 days. The tenant has no recourse and no appeal. They have to move out, under the law.</div>
