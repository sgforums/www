            <div class='col-md body'>churra:<br>what would u do wif the M&amp;Ms if he gave them to u instead? eat them up or keep??<br>I once receive chocolates in a lovely transparent teddy bear container for my birthday from a friend. Was so lovely I didn't bear to open it up, so just kept it as display..then one fine day (at least two years later! amazing!) I noticed that the chocolates were melting and i had to throw the chocolates away. Kept the container though, but it just doesn't look so good w/o the chocolates inside.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
