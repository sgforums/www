Right now, Keegan is struggling to get his 5 strikers. Cole is having some problem with his toes, and would be possibly excluded from the squad. I heard Owen has been given the go ahead, Shearer, Heskey and Phillips is okay, Fowler is doubtful. So for the fifth striker, hard to decide. The standby striker, Michael Bridges, is also out. Leed's Wilcox out also and replaced by Aston's Barry, whom I think is not ready for the competition yet. But then, these are my views...... any other views?<br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i support England, but don't think they will even go through the first round!!!!<br>as to who will win, very difficult to predict, this time round there is no clear favourites, just look at the strong teams current form:<br>1) Germany: old man squad, peform badly recently<br>2) Holland: bookmakers favourite, but doesn't perform well since new manager took over<br>3) France: a cock up team since winning WorldCup 98<br>4) Italy: very shacky nowsaday<br>5) Spain: doesn't perform in big tournament<br>so its everybody's guess!!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Belgium was also tagged as favourites for some odd reasons, but I believe that the style of football is blurred by the fact of the EU constitution thingie, so everyone seem to know everyone's tactics and style...... But I would think the hot favourites would be France and Holland, with France going on to win the cup. Holland, well, I'm sure many are trying to recover from their Barcelona defeat, but the French is going from strength to strength, with the emergence of form for players like Henry and Anelka. But it would be a definitely pleasure seeing them play. Too bad, exams during kick-off, that is a very bad timing.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Keegan does have a place for McManaman, but with the win over Valencia, he is giving time off to McManaman so that he can celebrate with Real Madrid. Thus, McManaman will be out for the Brazil match, knowing very well that he has proven himself enough for the Euro2000 squad. Keegan will most likely be using this Brazil match to gauge the fitness of the likes of Fowler, Gary Neville, and expose the youngsters like Gerrard and Barry. Not to worry, in fact, Keegan has even specified that he wants McManaman to play as left winger, which I doubt is his natural position, but rest assured that McManaman has done enough to secure first team place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>"Don't fight with the sea, dance with it......"</div>

Thus, McManaman will be out for the Brazil match, knowing very well that he has proven himself enough for the Euro2000 squad. Keegan will most likely be using this Brazil match to gauge the fitness of the likes of Fowler, Gary Neville, and expose the youngsters like Gerrard and Barry. Not to worry, in fact, Keegan has even specified that he wants McManaman to play as left winger, which I doubt is his natural position, but rest assured that McManaman has done enough to secure first team place.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Ohh....mistake here.McManaman is rooted as a free role in Real.If he was shifted to the left...i doubt he can perform so well like he is in Real.<br><br>[/B][/QUOTE]<br><br>well i think he can do well...<br>english wingers are more effective the most other positions<br><br>dont u think ??<br><br></div>

He could be a winger on the right, but Beckham as already stamped his authority there. So it will be the left for him then. Would be quite interesting who England's midfielder would be, with Wise and Ince fighting for a place there.
