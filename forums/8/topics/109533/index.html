            <div class='col-md body'>not sure how nice he is but i read this from another forum-<br><br><blockquote>Quote:<br>I witnessed the most shocking thing that ever happened in every day life to<br>me, for a long long time.<br><br>I was walking at the underpass between Orchard MRT and CK Tang (you know the<br>one with the blind accordian player, you know him!) and when I came across<br>what I thought was the most attention grabbing marketing gimmick in a very<br>long time. There was a girl standing in the middle of the path with A4 print<br>outs on her back and on her forehead which had " <br>www.stevenlim.net" on it.<br><br>The girl was using a newspapers to cover her face too. Wow, I thought to<br>myself. This "Steven Lim" guy has a completely new "out of the box" method,<br>perhaps "artsy-fartsy" approach to getting his website known! I mean, EVERY<br>SINGLE PERSON was literally stopping dead in their tracks to look from<br>either direction!<br><br>Excited, I quickly called my friend Elgin that I was supposed to meet at Far<br>East Plaza to come along to have a look. Before Elgin arrived, I found a<br>tall guy in his late 20s wearing a black sleeveless tight t-shirt hanging<br>around the side of the underpass, and I presumed him to be the "Marketing<br>minded Steven Lim". I told him that I was impressed by the idea and asked<br>him how he got it. He told me proudly that he thought about it himself.<br>However, I couldn't help but keep looking at the girl but feel that<br>something wasn't right. I also noticed that the girl had two girls on either<br>side of her who seemed to be encouraging her in a "don't worry, we're here<br>for you" kind of way.<br><br>"Who is that girl? Did you employ her? She's very brave! Where did you get<br>her from?"<br><br>Steven replied by saying that it was his girlfriend. The horror hit me when<br>when her friends came up to me and told me and Elgin that she was doing it<br>completely against her will. Steven has asked her to do it with funny<br>sunglasses and when she refused, he got angry. Apparently she loved him so<br>much that she didn't want him to be angry with her and so she'd rather bite<br>the bullet and cover her weeping eyes with the newspaper the whole time.<br><br>And what did this 28 year old hunkalot Steven do? He stood by the side and<br>soaked up the glory and attention that he got as a result of his 16 year old<br>girlfriend's humiliation. Angered, Elgin and I questioned him about his<br>"business practices" and his only defence were lines like "I'm paying her $5<br>an hour" and "Of course I got unhappy when she didn't want to do it for me,<br>it's only natural"! The whole time his poor girlfriend stood crying next to<br>us, and her friends started looking to us for reason and support.<br><br>Elgin and I went on to give him a half an hour lecture on how NOT to treat<br>his girlfriend and suggested other ideas to market himself without having to<br>resort to emotional blackmail. His final response was "Thanks for the<br>advice, but please visit my website. It's really good. Ask your friends to<br>visit it as well!"<br><br>I felt so bad that ANY girl had to live with loving such a person that I<br>ended up giving her a $300 watch loupe that I just happened to have on me. I<br>just felt so sorry for her, and even more than such guys existed.<br><br>During the half hour lecture, he also asked me to support him on Singaporean<br>Idol, let other people know about his website and how interesting all the<br>new stuff is, and how he thinks he'll succeed in life by doing things like<br>that.<br><br>God Bless his girlfriend, and all who stood with her.<br><br>http://pachome1.pacific.net.sg/~freestyle1279/sl.jpg<br><br>PS: I've attached a photo that I took of the "ad campaign" before I found<br>out the truth. I'd like to hear your views, but please let me know if<br>you're going to do anything drastic or public with this.</blockquote>from <a href="http://www.petfrd.com/forum/showthread.php?t=12908" rel="nofollow">here</a><br><br><img src="http://img59.exs.cx/img59/1036/sl8wd.jpg"><br><br>btw he SUCKS!!</div>
