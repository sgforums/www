            <div class='col-md body'>WHAT is the difference between "I do" and "abracadabra"?<br><br>Easy.<br><br>One is what you say when you're at the altar and making a lifelong commitment to your loved one.<br><br>The other is what you say when you wish for someone to disappear.<br><br>Some Singaporean women, though, seem unable to fathom the meaning of the words.<br><br>Somehow, they get them all mixed up.<br><br>Take The New Paper on Sunday's package on failed marriages last weekend.<br><br>The paper spoke to several women, who all blamed their husbands for the break-up.<br><br>They said that the men were insensitive, mollycoddled, childish,emotionally dependent and a chauvinist pigs.<br><br>Ouch!<br><br>That hurts more than being called a Faggadydoodahdei.<br><br>Whatever that means.<br><br>Yet, all the women walked down the aisle with their big eyes wide open.<br><br>They knew all about their future husbands' shortcomings, yet married them anyway.<br><br>Then, after marriage, they made the shortcomings into one long issue that inevitably led to Splitsville.<br><br>Why were they prepared to turn a blind eye to their boyfriends' flaws but not their husbands'?<br><br>Shouldn't it be the other way round?<br><br>Meaning they should be tougher on their boyfriends and more forgiving on their life partners?<br><br>Having taken the vow of "till death do us part", shouldn't they at least make a strenuous attempt to keep the promise?<br><br>If not, why marry in the first place?<br><br>In the TNP interviews with Melissa, Carol and Mary (not their real names), they seem to me to have dug their own graves.<br><br>No? You decide, then.<br><br>Case 1: Melissa, the sexually-repressed wife Before meeting husband Bernard, she had five sexual partners and definitely knew her Ps and Qs in the bedroom.<br><br>On their first night together, she discovered that Bernard was "bad in bed" and could not satisfy her sexually.<br><br>Yet, she went ahead and married him.<br><br>Now, she complains that in the last four years of her marriage, sex with him was so dull that she resorted to reading story books or watching TV while he was making love to her.<br><br>What did she expect, then? To wake up one morning and discover a sex guru preparing breakfast in bed?<br><br>Case 2: Carol, the spendthrift's wife.<br><br>She divorced her husband, Chris,as he was a show-off and loved buying expensive things -only to end up $50,000 in debt.<br><br>Was he a penny-pincher before marriage? Nope.<br><br>During courtship, Carol admitted that despite his $3,000 monthly salary, he used to surprise her with pricey jewellery, watches and clothes.<br><br>She was flattered.<br><br>No complaints about his spending habits then, so why make such a hue and cry now?<br><br>In her defence, she said that she assumed he would change after marriage.<br><br>Yeah, right.<br><br>Case 3: Mary, the jealous wife<br><br>Her husband, Alan, wasn't a philanderer.<br><br>Mary was just jealous of her mother-in-law, who ran Alan's life.<br><br>Ironically, it was this filial trait of his that attracted her in the first place.<br><br>Oh, there were also the fancy cars and exotic holidays.<br><br>She said: "He would come to pick me up after clubbing at 3am. And I would tell him to come in the Ferrari instead of the BMW and he would."<br><br>Yikes! What a show-off.<br><br>They divorced in 1993 and Mary re-married in 2001.<br><br>Guess what? Her second husband has since left her.<br><br>I can't help wondering if the mother-in-law is to be blamed again.<br><br>Thankfully, men are not so fickle as shown by the Department of Statistics' 2002 report on marriages and divorces.<br><br>Only 30 per cent of the divorces were initiated by men.<br><br>The other 70 per cent probably still value their wives even if they balloon to the size of bus tyres shortly after saying "I do".<br><br>It will never cross men's minds to say "abracadabra".<br><br>Cross my heart.<br><br><a href="http://www.asiaone.com.sg/streats/2...3_story4_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.asiaone.com.sg/streats/2...3_story4_1.html</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
