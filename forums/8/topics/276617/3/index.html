            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly, I cannot stand the smoke but I think several of the arguments here are certainly lacking.<br><br>Firstly, all this stuff about smoking areas is a silly and ridiculous facade, at least in most places. There are places where the smoking tables are placed right next to the non-smoking tables. And a fan to blow the smoke at the faces of those non-smoking to boot.<br><br>I mean, come on. What's the point then.<br><br>To be sure, smokers cannot be blamed for whatever health risk they pose from wherever it is that they've been alotted to smoke. It's well within their right. I only wish the authorities would be smarter to define more guidelines so that the law doesnt become redundant.<br><br>What I cannot stand are the friggin irresponsible smokers who sit next to you in a coffeeshop and just put their cigarettes in your face while taking a break from sucking.<br><br>Smoking is already banned from bus-stops. People just dont know. And there just is no enforcement. The laws are quite pointless now, it would seem.<br><br>I dont think anyone really has enough bite to complain about the present laws. Smokers have their rights and privileges. And so do non-smokers. Remember how in army, you couldn't take a break from cleaning your weapons or area cleaning, while the smokers "take 5" with the platoon sergeant? Or how smokers continue to blow smoke into your face. Go ahead smoke and do what you want. It's your right. Just don' take away my right to clean air.<br><br>I think the problem would be solved if people became more considerate. The solution lies less in law.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Humans fight over everything; land, rights, money and blah blah blah...<br><br>So I guess this issue is about territory for the smokers and air for the non-smokers....<br><br>First thing first, why was the law for having the yellow box introduced? Isn't it because that the non-smokers has complain about the quality of air so much that the non-smoking government personnel finally put this law into practise ? When the law was put into placed last year, I believe the non-smokers were overjoyed while the smokers kpkb ?<br><br>And now what ? Non-smokers sitting at the designated smoking area complaining of polluted air ? So what do you want the government to do ? Designate another smoking area for the smokers ? Than the non-smokers too will complain about that particular area being polluted with cigarette smoke. There is no end to this.<br><br>If you do notice, the non-smoking tables are usually quite vacant and I believe there isn't any problem looking out for an empty one, while the smoking tables are usually 100% occupied. And so, to find someone who don't smoke sitting at the smoking area and complaining of the smoke is quite rare, unless they are trying to find trouble.<br><br>The smokers pay averagely $10 for a packet of cigarettes and they have to smoke it. The non-smokers save $10 a day from not smoking, I guess this $10 is enough to take them to a nearby air conditioned food court and back.<br><br>Well, it's my opinion anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not a smoker, and don't intend to be.<br><br>But i think some of the comments in this thread so far are totally uncalled for. Firstly, to smoke is everyone's right. I don't think we can take that right from people simply because we think it is bad for them. To call for a ban, is being insensitive and helping the government push their nanny-state policies.<br><br>Secondly, tobacco is a major source of income. Even though the government keep pushing prices up in view of preventing smoking, it doesn't really make a difference. If you study economics you'll understand that tobacco is a inelastic good, so pushing up the price will make little difference in profit, or infact more, for the government.<br><br>Lastly, don't impose your beliefs on others.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't understand why people hate smokers that much. Its just another form of addiction that's difficult to stop. If you are one yourself, you will know how difficult it is to completely stop smoking. There has been many people who tried very hard to stop but in the end went back to smoking. The best you can do is to advice your smoker friends and pester them to quit smoking, rather than ranting on and on about how much you hate smokers. Doesn't that seem to be a more logical and wiser thing to do ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
