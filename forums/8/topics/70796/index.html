You also want to think about whether you want to work in the vendor or customer environment. vendor environment usually you have to support the customers which is a bit more shiong, and customer environment you will support in-house, so is better. Also consider where you want to go in few years time, whether you want to stay technical, as a technical manager, or project manager, or moving towards business.<br><br>These are the things you can consider.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>You also want to think about whether you want to work in the vendor or customer environment. vendor environment usually you have to support the customers which is a bit more shiong, and customer environment you will support in-house, so is better</strong><br><br>I object to say support in-house is better especially if you are developing customised software for them. Since it is in-house system, enhancements and changes are like eating different dishes everyday from the users. They know they can cuz they won't pay extra as compared to if it is done by vendors which charge money for all enhancements and changes.</div>
