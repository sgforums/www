Their usual clinic was closed, but she managed to find one that was open.<br><br>They reached the clinic in Woodlands more than half an hour before its closing time.<br><br>But the clinic's counter staff did not allow her son to see the doctor.<br><br>Their reason: They had reached their quota of patients for the night.<br><br>Madam Linda Mohd, 37, told The New Paper that she noticed that her 8-year-old son had a fever on Sunday. His left cheek was also slightly swollen.<br><br>After taking his temperature and finding it was 39.5degCelsius, she decided to take him, along with her daughters aged 10 and 7, to the clinic.<br><br>She said she got there around 8.50pm. It was open and its closing time was displayed as 9.30pm.<br><br>ASKED FOR NUMBER<br><br>Madam Linda said: 'The staff asked me what my number was and when I told her I had none, she said the clinic had already met the quota of 50 patients for the day and they were not taking in any more.'<br><br>Madam Linda said she was surprised and upset.<br><br>Asked why she did not insist on seeing the doctor, she said: 'I did not want to create a scene. The staff did not even look at my son or take his temperature.<br><br>'My impression was not good. How can you turn away sick people before the closing time, especially a child with fever in this case?'<br><br>Unable to find any other clinic that was open, Madam Linda, a nurse, went home and managed to bring down her son's fever by using a rectal suppository, which she had kept at home for suchemergencies.<br><br>She consulted a doctor at another clinic the next day.<br><br>Her son was diagnosed as having parotitis or mumps. This is an inflammation of the parotid glands, which are saliva-producing glands buried within each cheek.<br><br>He was prescribed medication and Madam Linda was given five days of medical leave to care for him.<br><br>When we spoke to the general practitioner whose clinic had turned her away, he admitted that he enforced such a quota - because there were simply too many patients.<br><br>However, none of the 20 other clinics we checked with has such a quota system.<br><br>Twelve said they have more patients than they could handle. But they have other ways of coping with that. (See report on facing page.)<br><br>The GP said: 'We are one of the few clinics open on Sundays for about three hours from 6.30pm to9.30pm.<br><br>'If each patient takes 5 to 7 minutes for consultation, I can clear up to 10 patients an hour. So we have no choice but to limit it to 50, and even so, we may stay till nearly midnight to see all of them.'<br><br>He does not display any sign about the quota.<br><br>He added: 'Of course... anyone who has a real emergency, suffers from asthmatic conditions or has a high fever... we will admit them and let them jump the queue.'<br><br>When told that Madam Linda had claimed his staff had not checked her son's temperature, he said they had been trained to do so and assess real emergency cases.<br><br>He said: 'I do not think there was any real mismanagement on the part of the staff in this woman's case.<br><br><span style="color: red;">'She is unreasonable, I think, to expect to jump a queue when other patients have taken the trouble to book their consultations.'</span><br><br>The doctor felt that if Madam Linda felt her son's high fever was an emergency, she should have told the staff and they would have assessed it.<br><br>He said doctors who run their clinics solo, like him, are often overwhelmed by the number of patients.<br><br>His clinic is open daily, and three days of the week he is there morning, afternoon and evening. On the other four days, he opens for only one or two sessions.<br><br>The doctor is aware that some patients queue from 7.45am on days his clinic opens at 9am. So he encourages his regulars to call for a queue number before showing up.<br><br>He said: 'Frankly, we are overloaded. As doctors, of course, we would want to take in as many patients but we are humans too.<br><br>'We can't run the risk of over-working ourselves to the point that we are so fatigued and prescribe inappropriate medication.'<br><br>- additional reporting by Yeh Wei Xuan</blockquote><span class="large"><strong>No doctors should turn away a patient especially when the door to the clinic remains opened</strong></span>. Did she request for a jump queue or was it the doctor assumption? On one hand, we have doctors competiting for patients and then this report that doctors are overwhelm?<br><br>so sad that medical enthic is going down the drain.<br><br></div>
