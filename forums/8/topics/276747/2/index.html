Once he get tired , he is in the danger of diagnosing the wrong sickness and giving the wrong medication.  As those he turn away after his quota is not emergency case - also it give other doctor business -this will  help other doctor to stay in business, also improve their skills  - thus this benefit - him , his patients and other doctors also ....<br><br>Remember like he say - if he overwork and get into ill health - his patients will be forever deny of his services .... also if he get all the business, the other doctor will all move away or not enough patients to improve their skills.... result is everyone too dependence on him, if one day he die or can no longer up to it, then it is actually worst for the whole community... !!!<br><br><blockquote><strong>No doctors should turn away a patient especially when the door to the clinic remains opened</strong> </blockquote>That the most dumb sentence !! that was not even an emergency case .... there is other doctors and hosptial - unlike there was a accident or the patient have fainted !!! You force the doctor who is tired out - he make a mistake in diagnose of sickness , give the wrong medicine - you think that lady who force him will say - sorry i force him one  ... she will again write to newspaper complain more and sue the poor doctor !!!<br><br>Remember this lady is a parent, to her, her kids fever is super high and it is a emergency !!! but to other it is not she can bloody well go to somewhere else !!!<br></div>
