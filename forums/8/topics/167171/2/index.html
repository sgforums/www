            <div class='col-md body'>The Cause and Effect Sutra<br><br>Inroduction:<br>The life of a human being is within his one breath...<br><br>The life of a human being exists within the process of one breath. Once the breath is stopped, the man will die!<br><br>Suppose i were able to live for 100 years. Indeed, among the millions of people, how many can really live for 100 years?<br><br>Jus take an average count of the breathing of a man who can breathe for 16 times within a minute, then in hour he will breathe 60 x 16=960 times.In a day which consists of 24 hrs, he will breathe for 24 x 960=23040 times. In a year which consists of 365 days, he will breathe 365 x 23040= 8409600 times. Then a hundrd years he will breathe eight billion four thousand million times.<br><br>Everytime when i breathe in the air and send it out, i will be losing breath... oh, poor me, every day i lose 23040 breaths. Our lifespan which amounts to a few tens of years will come to an end when i finished sending out the last breath.<br><br>From here, we can see that life is indeed short and impermanent!<br><br>Some people say, "As soon as a child is born, he begins to die."<br><br>Indeed, the day we come to the human realm is also the day we start walking towards death! In this Saha world, what is that in life which is really worh our clinging to?<br><br>Because i want to be liberated from the Saha world of the 5 turbidities. I am mindful of the Buddha. "NAMO AMITABHA" May i be born in the pure land of Ultimate bliss!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To those who aren't too familiar with it, the above is not the actual Sutra - just someone's view &amp; intro into it - however, it does have some good insight.<br>(Just dun wan someone to get confused<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The fact is that life is full of things that can make the [insert a phrase you are comfortable with here - awake, conscious, sensitive, doubtful, whatever]<br>person feel extremely negative feelings about people in general, systems, government, economy, opportunity (or lack of), history, and a lot more...<br><br>Many religions &amp; spiritual paths speak of gods, or other heavenly beings fighting or being "clever" (stabbing in the back, etc.) to each other. A simple but obvious question is - if they act this way, then...<br><br>I personally fight an internal battle often myself. Sometimes I truly wish I could spend time like in the merely learning everything I could and contemplating, studying, etc. all the ancient spiritual practices, searching for the real truths that face us. But sorry, I am a smoker, and I love my beer...So not now...lol<br><br>The point is that there is a LOT in life to be sad, angry, etc. over. The people who smile all day and say life is great, etc. have probably not been faced with a psycho holding a gun to their head while their partner holds one to the head of their mother, forcing them to sniff cocaine at the same time as being raped.<br><br>Graphic? Yes - not my personal story, but this and worse and many other things in many different ways happen all around the world in past, present and future.<br><br>Unfortunately, for those of us in the world who "can be bothered" enough to give a Sh@! about things, and are usually controlled by them, need to become more picky about what we let in.<br><br>Figure out what your true interests are, and go for them. Learn everything inside and out from all angles. Question everything and learn everything you can about it.<br><br>During this phase of learning about it, you will find that learning about yourself in general will become easier too. Things will come, but it's just a slightly different tightrope that you have to walk then the rest of the population, that doesn't care...<br></div>

Sometimes, no matter how hard you try, the things you do will hurt someone in one way or other.<br>... the saying "Money is not everything, but without money you have nothing" is very true.<br>... simply accepting the dire situation you're in makes you a loser.<br>... trying to change a dire situation does not necessarily make you a winner.<br>... you just can't rush some things. If it's meant to be yours, you'll get it eventually. If it's not meant to be yours, you'll never find it even if you try hard.<br>... like it or not, there are some things you just have to let go of.<br>... constantly looking back and thinking about what you should have done and what you should not have done in the past brings nothing but regrets. The more often you think back, the more regrets you will have.<br>... we are always taught to look to the future, but thinking about the future inevitably brings up the past and the regrets of past that many are more than willing to forget. Like it or not, we will always be stuck in this vicious circle of thoughts as long as we live.<br>... even though I hate the way the society works, I still have to live in it no matter what. I can't just go and die, can I?<br>... trying to solve problems by death is sheer escapism and a totally selfish thing to do. While you might think all your troubles have been solved with your departure from this world, you have given the people around you nothing but more trouble and grief, as though there is not enough to deal with without you adding to it.<br>... things are always easier said than done.<br>... there are far too many things out there that you wish to change but can't, so just accept it!
