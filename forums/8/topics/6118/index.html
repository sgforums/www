            <div class='col-md body'>ok time to get serious....<br><br>I can seriously say that if my other half(gf or wife) gets raped or molested or what...I would still be by her side night and day...It will never change how i view her...I won't see her as dirty or or unowrthy of my anymore...What dchikenshit thing is this to ditch someone because they got raped or molested...even if she contracted aids i weould stay with her man....and shame on all you guys who think otherwise.<br><br>is love so fickel that you can drop it just like that when something so tragic happens to ur loved one?????  this si the time they need you most.  You fail! F!!!! if you think otherwise.  Better that you don't get attached if you think like this.<br><br>Sorry I have no tolereance for guys like this..or for girlslike this either...Like they are so selfish that they can't see beyond themselves to notice what and who is really suffereing and who is the one that really needs love, and understanding...<br><br>Throught thick and thin I thought. as it should be!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>Unfortunately i know people who told me they would leave if their partner gets raped becaus ethey can't stand the thoguth of them getting touched by another person...I feel very bad to hear this...the ultimate in selfishness I say.<br><br>Whatever happens to your partner you have to take care of them.  You can't ditch them when suddenly you can't stand something that happened that was out of their own control....Even if it was her fault, there should be room for forgiveness I say.<br><br>For those who think I dun practivce what I preach, tehn obviously you dun know me.<br><br>I can seriously tell you that if any of my X gf ever came calling and told me they were raped and needed help(or for any reason) I would be there in a flash!! (unless it's for really stupid reasons ar....<br><br>This is what commitment and love is all about.  Please don't forget this....would you feel great if your wife or gf, whom you love more than life itself and thought would be there for you, left you because you got raped by another guy or girl???? ...or because of some unforseen circumstance that befalls you???<br><br>hmm...i may be a bit overemotional about it but it's how i feel ...<br><br>what to do to the rapist?...penalise him to the fullest extent of the law....If I could get away with it, keep him prisoner somewhere and everyday torture him.</div>

It happened many yrs ago, my so-call gf was raped but luckily not that violent. Not physically hurt but was threatened with a sharp scissors at her face. She was under 21 at that time. So dissappointed that the bastard was never caught. Stay by her thru-out, police report &amp; so on. Well, case already closed long ago but never forget &amp; hard to forgive.</div>
