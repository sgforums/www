Most of them when answered honestly would tell me, "I also don't know..".<br>When they don't answer honestly, they would tell me, "Because he is there..."<br><br>I do not believe in Christianity as I feel that Christianity is just a belief base on books(Bible). Who can justify that the Bible is true? I don't think anyone can. The Bible looks just like a history textbook to me and history all along is written by man and man can hide the truth from us.<br><br>Though honestly, I do not really like the majority of Christian but I do respect those who really believe in their religion.<br><br>I am not flaming Christian but just stating my views here =) </div></blockquote>ok to tell u something... first u are right about one point.. most youths who go to church is to sian gals only... i seen it everytime i go to church... their very obvious one...<br>and the second thing to tell u is that u are wrong about the bible.. see although u said that history is written by men and that men can hide things from us.. think from another angle... from their perspective why should they hide something from us??? and the bible is not just another history book... although it tells us about the accounts and deeds of the past... these storys or parables are actually to teach us the right and wrongs of life u see... and if u are looking for hard evidance about the accountability of the bible ... well heres something.... scientist have found that through calculations of the orbits or the earth and sun in order to calculate the number of days that passed... they found a discreptioncy in the number of days against the number of orbits the earth around the sun.... and this missing day is accounted for in the bible.. although i forgot ehick book and verse.. its in there all right...<br>so if u still dont believe in me.. read the bible yourself.. also read the last book (revelations)and u will notice that almost all the prophercys had came true<br>so read the bible...<br><br>------------------<br>i am a hardcore Metallic!

Once they are there, if they keep their minds open to learn more about what they are supposed to be learning about, then I think it is okay.
