Imagine for a moment that you're a judge, and there's this criminal who has commited crimes over and over and over again. In the past you have already given him many many many chances to repent. You even let him off on several occasions. Now one day when your patience has run out with him, you decide to throw him in jail for the rest of his life. Is that considered as what you term, 'selfish'? When in this case he has already gotten many chances to repent and be let off scott free, he just decided to commit more crimes. Will it be fair to those people who accepted forgiveness, and quit commiting crimes?</div>

What's more, The way they say it, it is as though I am condemned forever just because I am not a christian. Does being a christian elevate you onto higher ground and gives you the authority to condemn people who are not of your religion.<br>I myself have read the bible before and I find some of the things stated in the bible contradictory. Since it has proven to be true, why does it contradict itself?<br>Next, if God could forgive those sinners who commited really serious crimes like killing hundreds of people and such, why can't he forgive someone for not beliving in him? The one who killed has sent so many innocent lives to hell while the one who does not believe in him did not kill or anything and he is sending someone to hell like this?<br>I am not trying to flame christians or anything and if you have any rebuttals you could post them on.<br><br></div></blockquote>ok i garee with u to an extent.... its wrong to force someone to believe in a religion.. i personally saw it before.... but to tell u these kinds of cases are very rare... in most cases we tell other people about god and to explain wat does being a christian means lah...( preaching the gospel) it is not brain washing or anything... after that we ask the person if he is willing to be a christian... if he is not willing then ok... we wont go any further.. but will still keep in touch with that person.... to us spreading the gospel is not brain washing.. its that we want to save as much people as we can.... so u cant say that it is brain washing cos your parents or friends say it.. u must understand the purpose of spreading the gospel.... wat your friends or wat u had seen was totally wrong.... we do not force our friends to be christians.. i have a lot of friends who are not christians....<br>second.... christians do not condemm or discriminate against non-christians or other religions.. we respect every other religion.. cos if we condemm them then we are no better than being not a christian...<br>third.... the bible has a lot of twists and turns..... so i am not surprised that u state one of the contradictions... as i said before... to many people the bible may look contradicting.... but actually its not.... why??? cos u must really fully understand wat the bible says... not just the words but the entire meaning of the verses....<br>so i state my point....<br>[/B][/QUOTE]<br>You see MeRv, it is not the seriousness of the sin which God looks at. God WILL still forgive you on 2 conditions. 1)As long as you true and sincerely repent. 2) If you ask him to forgive you. But in the case you stated, as someone NOT believing in him, this is not possible to forgive, because the person does not even believe in GOd, and cannot ask for forgiveness in the first place. So God cannot forgive him.</div>

It is the nature. In my point of view, all sins are the same. They all boil down to one thing : Rebellion against God. But unfortunately, NOT believing in God is a totally different sin altogether. It is actually throwing a direct insult in God's face. It is denying God's very existence, God's very being, God's very nature and goodness. That's why it cannot be forgiven. It seems like God is actually tying his hands in this situation. Yes, as God's minimal request is that we believe in him. If we can't even meet this request then how can we expect more?<br><br>------------------<br>It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.</div>

THe essence of all sins are still rebellion against God himself. And the penalty is everlasting punishment in hell. So you decided for yourself if the severity is the same. It varies from people's views. From the shoplifter's view, he may think that his sin is not as serious as the murderer's since his sin does not affect anyone. But then, is 'sin' defined by the number of pple it affects? From a neutral point of view, all the sins are still as severe since the FINAL punishments are all the same.<br><br>------------------<br>It is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to religion.</div>
