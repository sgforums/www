            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Top civil servants to retire young<br>New blood can then move up the ranks, says service chief<br><br>RETIRING young will become the norm for top civil servants as the service seeks to rejuvenate itself and pave the way for younger officers to move up.<br><br>While it can recruit talent aggressively, it must also ensure that new blood gets a chance to go to the top of its ranks, said Mr Lim Siong Guan, the head of the civil service.<br><br>'If you want to keep a continuous flow of these people, you need to have a flow out,' he told The Straits Times.<br><br>'Otherwise, you will jam up the whole system and all the effort you've spent to bring in the young people is going to go to waste because the guy is going to quit.'<br><br>Given that the civil service is structured on the basis of a continual inflow of talent, it needs to open up.<br><br>It is all part of the rejuvenation of the service's leadership, said Mr Lim.<br><br>So, former permanent secretary Peter Chan's retirement from the Ministry of National Development (MND) yesterday at the relatively young age of 56 should not be all that surprising.<br><br>His successor - Mr Tan Tee How - is 44 years old.<br><br>Mr Chan, who joined the civil service in 1970, was permanent secretary of the Foreign Affairs Ministry from 1987 to 1993. His last posting since 2001 was as MND's permanent secretary.<br><br>'We are all going to retire young,' said Mr Lim, who is 57.<br><br>The Government has a 'flow-through' mechanism in place to ensure adequate renewal in key public sector positions.<br><br>Under this system, which was introduced in 2000, those holding top jobs will relinquish their posts after fixed 10-year terms.<br><br>Before that, Administrative Service officers appointed to 'public sector leadership' positions - permanent secretaries, deputy secretaries, chief executives of major statutory boards and heads of key departments - were expected to be able to stay on in these jobs until they retired.<br><br>After completing their leadership appointments, officers can opt to stay on in the public service. They will be offered non-leadership jobs if available. They can either serve in these jobs until retirement at 62 years or be granted early retirement.<br><br></blockquote>I remembered LKY saying that we have to be prepared to work till our 70s bcos our lifespan is getting longer and our retirement savings may not be enough to cover our retirement age if we retire too young.<br><br>With all these civil servants retiring in their 50s, I can only assume that we taxpayers pay a hell lot of money to ensure that those retirees can live the rest of their lives comfortably.</div>
