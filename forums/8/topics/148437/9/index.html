            <div class='col-md body'>Realli disappointed at Xinhui's exit... Kelly is good but I think Xinhui is better... her singing is great, her confidence and poise is astonishing, reali impressed me alot... remember how she encouraged other contestants when they got eliminated, and how she carry herself when she herself got eliminated, that not easy for anyone, she reali exhibits the "Da Jiang Zhi Feng" that a SUPERSTAR should possess... Plus she's the one that made consistant improvement throughout the competition, whereas Kelly didn't improve much...<br>perhaps it's luck that Xinhui lacked...<br>Buck up Xinhui, we'll are be supporting you!!!<br><br>XINHUI NI YONG YUAN SHI WO DE SUPERSTAR!!!<br>JIA YOU!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ITs biased anyway. And there are good biases and bad biases... leaving everything aside (the fact that WL is visually handicapped).... if you compare their performances... JY definately did better than WL... But just because WL is blind, maybe people just lowered their expectations in him... they already felt so touched when they saw WL having so much courage, singing on stage, whether he can sing better than the others, whether he can dance... it didn't matter to these compassionate audience anymore...<br><br>I'm not saying that he's not good, but the term SUPERSTAR just isn't right for him....Ocean Ou De Yang's album topped the charts....I can say he is a very successful music  talent.. but that doesn't mean he's a superstar right... I believe Weilian belongs to this category of artises instead. E.g of superstars = Lin Junjie, Yanzi, Yida...and the 4 heavenly kings..etc..<br><br>The other contestants got criticised in everyway for not having  superstar calibre...e.g looks.. confidence.. style... and got booted very shortly after.....even when they can sing... Ignoring the fact that Weilian is blind, I don't think his performance is any better than the others... and this is a Good bias.. coz if he isn't visually handicapped.. he might have got booted earlier on...<br><br>Anyway... speaking of SLY...<br>Yeah i agree.... anyone in the top 10 of Superstar.. is much more better than him... I wonder how the heck he even became runner up..... and regarding his new album.... yah i can't deny that the songs are great (coz they weren't written by him) but his singing sucks... he sounded like some pathetic rock star wannabe... cannot make it lah... i wonder if they sell his album in Taiwan anot.. better not... better not make a fool outta himself and throw Sinapore's face.......<br><br>And.. he doesn't look like an idol at all... he looks more like a typical chao ah beng next door.... oh yah.. with a permanent cramped face and slanted lips <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>And P.S  I'm not a fan of JY.. infact I haven't been watching Jue Dui Superstar until this wednesday...only then I gotta know who's Jun Yang... i'm merely stating the facts.. what I have observed..<br><br></div>
