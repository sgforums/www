            <div class='col-md body'>i watch e show dat nite, after e second song, i'm sad for Wl, cos looking at his performance dat nite. he indeed is not dat gd as jy. so when e result is announce, i'm surprise n happy for wl. for jy, maybe a lot of ppl will tink its unfair for him. but remeber, this is a competition mainly base on the support of the public.  just like a football match, sometimes e better team might not b able to win, maybe not even get a single point! for those who think his vote is all sympathy votes, is dat really possible. if only base on sympathy  votes, he can get this far. then why can't e other hadicapped ppl do the same?   is he e only hadicapped ppl in singapore?  well, maybe yes huh! then wat about those hadicapped ppl in other country? why until  now only 1, only wei lian is able to get this far? no doubt there some of the vote he got is sympathy votes, but there definately is some other qualities in him dat make him e only hadicapped ppl to become e champion of a singing competition. i also feels dat his performance this week is not as good as jy, but is this his true ability? well, if u tink so. then its either u didnt watch much of this competition o ur decision is competely base on emotions.</div>

E.g of superstars = Lin Junjie, Yanzi, Yida...and the 4 heavenly kings..etc..<br><br>The other contestants got criticised in everyway for not having  superstar calibre...e.g looks.. confidence.. style... and got booted very shortly after.....even when they can sing...

BUT we can accept this, because he's blind.<br><br>So when he tried, even though its nothing compared to what the rest had done, we already gave him full marks for his stage performance.<br>Subconsciously, we are lowering our expectation of WL.<br><br>I recognize WL as a talented singer, but definitely not a superstar.<br>Too bad for JL, cos I think he's got the calibre.

            <div class='col-md body'>However I feel that this isn't a fair match afterall.. coz there are circumstances which will affect audience's biasness (both good and bad) against and for the particular singer.....

Or how crazy their fans , friends and family members are? It's not limited to a vote per person (of coz.. how to make money that way?)..you'll never know there are crazy people who can vote a few hundred times for their favourite contestant..? If that fella is a good talented singer, with recognition from professionals, and enough exposure from such big events like Jue Dui Superstar, he will automatically be well recieved by the others. It'd be a better idea if their voting system work the other way, 30% from audience and 70% from judges... but this will never happen...knowing that their votes have so little impact on the final results, alot of people would be discouraged from voting..... and they can't earn big bucks....however, this system will give fairer results..<br><br>P.S I'm not implying abt WL in my second para... i'm just stating my overall view on their voting system, thats all.
