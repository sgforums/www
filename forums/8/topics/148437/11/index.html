Normal ppl in the finals want to compal,handicap ppl in the finals want to complain. So wats more,at least they have the guts to compete. I'm not a follower of this show cos i'm not chinese but i think the blind guy has got talent...why criticise since sngapore has produced stars like stefanie sun,jj lin,yida,tanya for the mandarin market..why we won't accet that that blind guy could be as big in the mandarin music industry as wat the late ray charles did and even stevie wonder..if u ppl notice these music greats are <strong>BLIND</strong>..<br><br>thank you.</div>
