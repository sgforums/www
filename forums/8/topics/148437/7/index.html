            <div class='col-md body'>I think when both contestants went into final, they are equally good in their vocal.<br><br>1 real thing about Superstar in today's era to me is: "how long can they last in the singing market" ,ask yourself.<br><br>So who cares who gonna win and make money for others!<br><br>End of the day, I don't just vote base on the fact that who going to contribute more to help the music company make more money. Or rather who looks good and can attracts more attention and more marketable in future. Or who has more potential to go further in singing career. All this is too tangible things that we will always see. No dept !!!!<br><br>If Weilian wins, he is going to be giving an "intangible" social gift  to many people in future. His winning will really inspire many people who are down and out in their lives to strive on.  Weilian is a Superstar in my heart . He is what Chinese call ( can er bu fei )"Â²Ã�Â¶Ã¸Â²Â»Â·Ã�Â¡Â± . I first see him quite weird . But after hearing him and seeing him taking all steps to improve himself and making moving steps on stage just to create that touch with the audience. My heart numbed.<br><br>I personally got inspired by him and I tell myself if Weilian can do it in his singing career on stage, so can I be able to overcome all my personal problems now if I persist and perservere like him on stage. I must'nt give up so easily.<br><br>Anyway, Weilian can he be like (Ou De Yang) "Ã…Â·ÂµÃ‚Ã‘Ã¹Â¡Â± Â£Â¬singing behind the scene. Anyone has ever see our Ou De Yang real person singing on stage before ? I don't think so.  Who knows if our Mr Ou is also a handicape ? Possible ?<br><br>So guys and gals, just cast your vote and don't comment too negatively. Just don't vote if you don't like.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I vote for Weilian. Cos that Junyang is very hypocrite. You can see it from his face. He acts guai and cute to please the judges but you can tell that is not his real self. But this shy act cannot last for long, and many voters, like me, chose for the more sincere weilian. Check out JY's disgusted face yesterday when he was so confident he would win.<br><br>Well Project Superstar is to groom and find a superstar, and the definition of a superstar is one who can hold a rapport with the audience, not just about dancing or singing or looking good. Sun Yan Zi is a superstar because her voice touches our hearts, and her character scores well with most. Same for Weilian - he may be blind, but his eyes can reach out to your hearts. He does his best for each song, and though not many times technically flawless, you can sense the effort he puts in. I must say that the judges are biased against him (that Yip auntie has no clue as to how to sing, she follows the first judge's lead, and can only give crude comments on fat thighs and dressing) but nevertheless his perseverance paid off. And though his score was lower last night, the majority of Singaporeans surged to push him forth. That, in my book, is what makes a SuperStar.</div>

Ya i agree WL hav the heart and courage.. but his singing cannot compared to JY. and  how do u noe tht isn't  JY normal self? i don find him act cute or act shy.<br>agree wif u WL hav more sincerity..but look at his perfromance tht day..he is clearly disturbed by the scores of JY..esp his 3rd song. Went totally off.<br>A superstar will continue to give his best no matter wad diificuties they hav.. though the other contestant might hav high marks. But WL din show tht at all.<br>i am not a fan of JY and WL..juz givin some comments. in conclusion..i feel tht JY shld be the champion instead of WL.<br><br>But singaporeans hav decided..and i respect the decision. Good luck to both weilian and kelly.</div></blockquote>Double disagree with you, are you from the TV or are you the mighty that can say on behalf of singaporean din see and vote for Wl...that is a lame statement...no facts and figure at all</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, relax.<br>runner-up can be more popular than the winner. It's proven.<br>Isn't Sly more famous than Taufik?<br><br>Everyone knows WL wins out of sympathy.<br>I guarantee WL will be already out  if he's not blind.<br>Anyway, if you don't like him, just don't buy his CD. It's as simple as that.<br><br>No need to comment so badly about him.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my 2 cents worth<br><br>firstly, lets look at the song 'tong hua', that was the set song for both of them. compare junyang and weilian's style of singing. both of their style are like worlds apart. who do you think the song 'tong hua' suits? imagine is it was another type of song, would junyang still have sung so well?<br><br>and well, personally i feel its much harder to control ur vocals when u have a blocked nose and flu, as compared to a sore throat.<br><br>and i also feel that weilian seems much more 'real' than junyang. on tv, it seems that his true character is out. as for junyang, he seems 'fake' in a sense. masking his true feelings. perharps im wrong, but thats just my view<br><br>lastly, it seems to me that for all the songs that junyang sang, he sang it well, but there seemed to be no 'climax'. the whole song just seems to be smooth running, with no 'powerful parts'. as compared to weilian, who does have it.</div>
