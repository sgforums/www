KNN.<br><br>then, junyang should win, not the blind guy. KNN. i knew mediacorp will come up with such tricks one.<br>like i say before.....all those people who called for NKF last time will all dial for him one. sympathy votes mah. or even, everyone who donates to charity will definetly call for him one. u all can imagine how much anot?

            <div class='col-md body'>If there's any rigging of results, then mediacorp had failed to make JY win. The disparity of votes was too large for mediacorp to rig the results in JY's favor. Anyway, music street will definitely sign kelly if she wins the grand final. Universal  will get to sign the 2nd placed but I doubt they want a blind man. So music street signs WL as well as JY.

            <div class='col-md body'>kelly going thru is what i had expected...i dun see too many sgpreans voting for xinhui since so many hate her n somemore she's frm malaysia..BUT i have to say she improved tremendously..she's a match for kelly.....i have to say her HER outlook not as gd as kelly..n her dress sense really sucks.....especially for the last song.....so hip hop..n kiddish..which is obviously unsuitable for yi shi de mei hao....a shu qing song.<br>BUT i support kelly......i dun see y sO many ppl critising her...though she had lower scores than xinhui,she didn't performed as well as xinhui,....BUTt she has  reasonable talent,quality in her......she can sing ,she can perform ,she can dress and look pretty.....which in conclusion is FAIR&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>unlike silver ang....hu can't sing for a shit ,but went thru the stages of competition so many times.<br>as for junyang.. i pity him...i think he should go thru to the grand final.....welll......weilian can sing BUT not as well as junyang.....he dun have stage presence hindered by his blindness....not his fault..but reality is cruel....he ccannot be a superstar......i think junayng will be 1 thought he dun win the competition</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me feel Xinhui should win although she dunno how to dress up but tis can be arrange by the image designer or fashion designer. Next ting i wanna say is Junyang should win. Maybe Weilian got his blind association to vote him. only 60cent only compare u call Nkf u can call maybe 10times of it. heee....<br>Overall Xinhui and Junyang score is higher dan the other two. Dame kelong....ppl are saying they let weilian in cos they wanna earn more money.......or is a plot they want Kelly to be superstar. Her three teachers is the judges leh.<br><br>i dun wanna watch it liao since so kelong!!!!<br></div>

JY tries too hard to please, whereas WL takes risk. Anyway people, to be frank I think WL's singing loses out to JY, but he appeals to me. And many many singaporeans as well, hence the majority of the vote. Saying things like sympathy votes and all that is just a bunch of sour grapes. There were so many good singers who got voted out, why? The rapport with the audience isn't there, which makes a superstar.<br><br>Anyway please stop arguing, WL and Kelly are challenging, rather we shld be guessing who might win.
