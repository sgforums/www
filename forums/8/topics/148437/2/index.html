It does speaks volume right?<br><br>Is it because you did not get what you want to see?<br>Or you might think that, comparing your interpretation of those 'judging criteria' and 'results' wasn't in your favor?<br><br>Why did he manage to sustain the competition?<br>What is unfair? Quote 'Where is the Fairness'<br>What do want to see in this 'fairness'?<br><br>It's really hard to find someone who sings with so much emotions and managed to deliver the emotional messages to viewers on TV.<br><br>If Jun Yang should get a contract with recording company, he should do well. It will be a fair competition when it comes to real production. And it's up to you to support him.(If the opportunity exists.)<br><br>Indeed it is going nowhere, the competition between two males have come to an end.<br>Take care Jun Yang.<br><br>Cheers</div>
