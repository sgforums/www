            <div class='col-md body'>Devil,<br><br>I heard that the graphics and animation is a must watch.  Plot-wise, its probably shallow.<br><br>Good quality animation but lousy plots.  Sounds like those action movie flicks.  Lotsa action and zero plot = if you're an action guy, go watch it.  If you want your brains to be tickled by a good plot, forget it.  Dunno what's all these Halibut, Codfish or Monsters are lah.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>go read churra's thread on aki ross<br><br>and for the summary?<br><br>Earth is taken over by aliens, known as Phantoms. and this is a result of a piece of the alien planet crashing into the earth. and the military forces took upon them as an invasion. but they did not eliminate the phantoms, but awoken more of them.<br><br>many years later, Cid developed a special shield whereby the phantoms cannot penetrate. and aki is his student. during aki's study with Cid, she was infected with phantom cells, and she almost died from it, if not for Cid's implantation of the spirits into Aki, she would have died long ago.<br>Hence, Aki's quest here, is to collect spirits, otherwise known as Life sources.<br><br>and, once the council found out about Aki, they gave her the go on more research. but the General was too narrow minded, and only the vengence to wipe out the Phantoms was in his mind.<br><br>further into the show, when gathering the 7th spirit, Aki becomes weaker, and the Phantoms are attracted to her; They treat her as the same kind due to the phantom cells living in her. and further on, the General arrested Aki and Gang, and they finally found out the reason of the Phantom's attacks; they are from their own planet's Gaia, and they are lost because they are in a foreign place, with no resting place, and are being attacked constantly.<br><br>Next the General caused New York to be destroyed, and after that, he went to outer space, while Aki, Cid and Grey, went on to find the 8th spirit.<br><br>When they find it, the General got on Zeus and fired at the core, and destroyed the final spirit. but all hope is not lost when Aki and Grey saw the Gaia for the first time, therefore proving Cid's theory.<br><br>and then, at the end, just when the alien planet's Gaia is about to take over the Earth, Aki recieves the Final Spirit, because the Gaia merged with Aki's Phantom, and then with that, they almost got rid of the Phantom Gaia, when Zeus fired directly into Earth's Gaia.<br><br>Then Grey decided to sacrifice himself to save the earth, and Aki cannot be with Grey, even though she is cured. and when Grey died with the Phantom, we can see the Phantom breaking into a million pieces and flying out of earth in a pillar of bright light.<br><br>The Phantoms are released from their torture, and Aki is cured, but Grey and the rest will never return again.<br><br>Summary of FF movie done.<br><br>------------------<br><br>finally, the movie is related to FF series, but DO NOT EXPECT MUCH OF MAGIC OR WHATEVER RPG ELEMENTS TO COME FROM IT. its made such that its more realistic, and so ppl who have NEVER played FF will watch it, not for the GAME EFFECTS and such.<br><br>if u guys juz want to watch GAMING EFFECTS and such, STAY HOME AND PLAY UR RPG ONLY!<br><br>this is a great attempt by FF's creator, it breaks the tradition of RPGs. so be flexible, and dun juz stay so RIGID and so block headed.<br><br>u are toking to a REAL hardcore FF fan.</div>
