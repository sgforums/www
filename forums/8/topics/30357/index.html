            <div class='col-md body'><br>NOV 26, 2002<br>Temptation island<br>Will even more visitors be lured to Sentosa now that a resort spa will open on the island from Monday?<br>By Elisabeth Gwee<br>FROM next Monday, stressed-out Singaporeans will not have to jet off to Thailand or Indonesia for some resort-style spa pampering.<br>All they have to do is hop into their cars and drive to Sentosa.<br>Singapore's first resort spa opens at The Beaufort Hotel on Dec 2.<br>Sprawled over 6,000 sq m of landscaped garden, which is about the size of a football field, Spa Botanica features six outdoor treatment pavilions, mud baths, labyrinths and a 22-m lap pool. A colonial pre-war building houses 14 indoor treatment rooms.<br>Mr Anthony Ross, Beaufort's general manager, says: 'Previously, if people wanted that kind of spa experience, they'd have to spend time and money travelling to their holiday destination.<br>'Now, they have it at their doorstep.'<br><br>PLANS FOR SENTOSA<br>THE spa is just one of the ways that the Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) is hoping to turn the island into a complete holiday getaway.<br>Other plans include an eco-type hotel set in the tree canopies of one of the island's nature trails.<br>Mr Gurjit Singh, SDC's property director, says that it will be inspired by the five-star Andaman resort in Langkawi. The SDC is currently looking for investors for the project.<br>Two to three informal beach-front restaurants will be added to Siloso Beach by the end of next year. These will be deve loped and operated by the SDC's newly set-up food and beverage team.<br>A theme park also looks set to open along the northern waterfront where the Asian Village used to stand.<br>The SDC is in talks with several foreign theme-park operators to build one that combines indoor</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and outdoor land and water rides.<br>The site of the former Fantasy Island theme park will be turned into an underground car park for about 1,000 cars in 2005.<br>As part of the SDC's 10-year masterplan to make Sentosa more accessible to the public, car entry rates were reduced from $6 to $2 two weeks ago.<br>Mr Singh says: 'The 'old' Sentosa was seen as an expensive attraction. People felt it wasn't up to the mark, so it wasn't worth spending $6 to come in.'<br>Since the price reduction, visitor figures have increased by 25 per cent over the same period last year.<br>This has also increased the demand for accommodation on the island.<br>A spokesman for the NTUC Sentosa Beach Resort says although his hotel is fully booked until December, enquiries from walk-in customers have 'definitely gone up'.<br>A spokesman for Shangri-La's Rasa Sentosa Resort says that hotel guests have never had to pay for entrance fees. But the reduced entrance fees might increase business at its restaurants.<br>'PREMIUM' PRICES<br>BUT while it is now cheaper to get into Sentosa, its newest attraction has prices that might not exactly draw the crowds.<br>Treatments at Spa Botanica cost 10 to 20 per cent more than treatments at city spas.<br>For example, massages range from $110 to $190, while those at Amrita Spa at Raffles City - the largest spa here - range from $100 to $140.<br>Beaufort's spa packages with hotel stays, which range from one night to a week, are also slightly higher than others in the region.<br>A three-night stay at a deluxe room includes a massage, a body scrub, a body wrap, a reflexology session, health consultation and full use of the spa and its facilities. That costs $2,428 for two people.<br>A similar three-night package at the Banyan Tree Bintan's Ocean Front jacuzzi villa costs $2,269 for two people, excluding the $45 return fare for the ferry ride to Bintan.<br>Mr Ross says that treatments are 'priced at a premium' because the spa is targeting an upmarket clientele.<br>He is confident that the spa will open up a new leisure market for the island, and for the hotel.</div>
