How many pple wanna stay alive or fight to stay alive and i just simply can't understand why some pple have this thought! Come on raise yr head up high, and face reality. At least some1 out there will regard u as a MAN!</div>

I had a friends whos girlfriend threatened to do that... She made it known to many people, and when finally the bf when down to her place, she purposely pop the pills in front of him. I mean... whats the point of waiting for the person to come before you perform the act? Its obvious that this act is done only to fill the bf with guilt and regreats, thinking that he might cause a person's life.  It really depends. All it takes is guts. But the ones who have that guts and do it are stupid... I cannot sterotype too... I'm sure there are many angles to look at this issue, every issue in fact.<br>Heehe, didnt have time to read through my post, hope it made sense.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Agreed. People who are really suicidal would not tell anyone, nor would they even hint about it. Those who do are hoping to gain sympathy and compassion.<br><br>Of course there might be exceptional cases. It's up to the individual to judge each circumstance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
