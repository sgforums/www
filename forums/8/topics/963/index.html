            <div class='col-md body'>Let me start off by saying that this posting is not intend as a flame bait or to offend anybody.<br><br>I remembered that I once posted in a thread saying that the Original Sin refers to the sinful nature inherited, rather than the actual sin of eating from the Tree of Life itself. It is this sinful nature that leads us to sin, and we all know that the wages of sin is death. Somebody asked me if I can find any verses to support my view. So far, I have found a few.<br><br>ROM 7:5 - For when we were controlled by the sinful nature, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death.<br><br>GAL 5:16 - So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature. (Gal 5:16-25 all talks about this sinful nature)<br><br>GAL: 5:24 - Those who belong to Jesus Christ have crucified the sinful nature with its passions, and desires.<br><br>I have also found few verses which seem to suggest that for those who died without having the chance to know Jesus will be given a chance even after their death. But bear in mind that this is different from those who knew but rejected.<br><br>JOHN 5:25 - I tell you the truth, a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live.<br><br>JOHN 5:28 - Do not be amazed at this, for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out - those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.<br><br>John 5:28 seems to suggest that those who died without knowing him will be judged by their deeds.<br><br>Any comments?<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>

That's why they believe they do not need Jesus to die for them for their salvation and they wanted the Romans to crucify Jesus instead because they hated Him.  The Jews wanted a Messiah who punish the Jew's enemies, NOT someone who heals the blind and mute, NOT someone who is willing to be crucified by the Romans (also the Jew's enemies) to die for them.<br><br>Untill now they are still waiting for the return of their Messiah who will "punish" those who attack them. But this return of Messiah was also the 2nd coming of Jesus who is supposed to come back to stop countries who attack Israel during the final world war.<br><br>In short, the Jews wanted the 2nd coming of Jesus, and they rejected his 1st coming.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 18 March 2002).]</div>

(Romans 5:12)</div></blockquote>You are right. Sin came into this world thru one man, and death is the result of sin. But HOW did sin come into this world? Because we all inherited the sinful nature of Adam. It is this sinful nature that causes us to sin. Therefore all who sinned will die.<br><br>Clearly in GAL: 5:24 - "Those who belong to Jesus Christ have crucified the sinful nature.....", it is clearly shown that salvation entails the crucification of our sinful nature.<br><br>2 Peter 2:10 - This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority.<br><br>------------------<br>I can live with pain, but I cannot live without hope.</div>
