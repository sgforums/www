Whether the Original Sin had been taught by Jesus himself, or came much later as a result of creeds passed by the Church several centuries after Christ was taken up into heaven.<br><br>2. Whether Jesus was aware of this Original Sin and strove to die on the cross for the sins of mankind.</div></blockquote>hi there, have you missed my post earlier?<br><br>Before Jesus was borned, The old testament speaks of two coming of the Messiah, the first coming to forgive sins and salvation, the second to establish God's kingdom on Earth.<br><br>So from here my earlier post started:<br><br><blockquote><br>From what I found out, the Jews does not believe in Original sin. That's why they believe they do not need Jesus to die for them for their salvation and they wanted the Romans to crucify Jesus instead because they hated Him. The Jews wanted a Messiah who punish the Jew's enemies, NOT someone who heals the blind and mute, NOT someone who is willing to be crucified by the Romans (also the Jew's enemies) to die for them and forgive their sins.<br><br>Untill now they are still waiting for the return of their Messiah who will "punish" those who attack them. But this return of Messiah was also the 2nd coming of Jesus who is supposed to come back to stop countries who attack Israel during the final world war.<br><br>In short, the Jews wanted the 2nd coming of Jesus, and they rejected his 1st coming.<br></blockquote>So if man has not fallen sinners in the first place, the 1st coming of Jesus is not neccessary and Jesus has already died in vain.<br><br>and I myself admit that I have sinned many times....<br><br>Hope i have answered your question...<br><br>[This message has been edited by Rapture (edited 18 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From what I can recall, St Augustine claimed that Original Sin was 'The Sin' Adam and Eve comitted after they ate the damn fruit. That's why he stressed the need for baptism to cleanse that sin away.<br><br>But, it is still a question of definition when it comes to the point whether or not this original sin is linked with our inherent nature. As we all know, the Bible is a very ambiguous ........ script.</div>
