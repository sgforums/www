To you, talking to strangers is a hard thing so you have not much friends. But you will still have some soulmates. You need to treasure ppl who care and love you. You're more interested in your own mattters, you will try your very best to acheive your target. But you can't do everything alone, don't just depend on yourself, learn to open up and accept others opinion. Try to get along with different ppl.<br><br>TYPE B<br>You're a more active person, draw a clear line between happy and unhappy. You're more quick-tempered. If you encounter things you like, you will do it w/o 2nd thoughts. But once you meet things that you hate, you will wish to get out of it asap. As you're a person of your very own views, the friends you tend to have will be the same pattern. But once you're good with your friends, you will understand them a lot and go all the way to help them. Friends are very dependent on you. As you're too emotional, you may make a storm out of a teacup with your friends. Must learn to do things in order and do not give up easily. Can try making friends with those you don't think you can get along with, don't stick with the same category. This will make you more popular and charming.<br><br>TYPE C<br>Gentle like a lamb. You have high level of adaptance power, easy to get along with ppl. Very popular in social life but seems that no one will bad-mouth about you. You hate to have conflicts with ppl so you always try to adapt to everyone. You treat every person differently. To look at the bright side, you adapt easily. But to look at the dark side, you're lack of character, although you're one big nice guy but you lack of charm. On the surface, you have a lot of friends but once you have troubles, you lack of soulmates to help you. You must try to express yourself more and be more decisive . In this way, you can understand yourself more.<br><br>TYPE D<br>You're stubborn, like to go in circles and don't get to the point. Once you decide on something, no one can change ur mind. You're a good leader in a group so you win a lot of trust from your friends. But as you're too persistant on your own thinking, you neglect other ppl's suggestions therefore you can easily make enemies. Although it is good to maintain your own charcter but it doesn't mean you totally ignore others ppl's tots and feelings. You will let ppl think you're hard to handle and lost friends gradually and may end up alone. You need to learn to accept other ppl's opinion. This will make your social circle bigger and understand yourself better.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>TYPE A </strong><br><span style="color: indigo;">Shy</span>, a bit shut down to yourself. You're more stubborn and like to stay alone quietly at home. To you, talking to strangers is a hard thing so you have not much friends. But you will still have some soulmates. You need to treasure ppl who care and love you. You're more interested in your own mattters, you will try your very best to acheive your target. But you can't do everything alone, don't just depend on yourself, learn to open up and accept others opinion. Try to get along with different ppl.<br><br><span style="color: indigo;">Told you pple I'm shy liao mah....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>RESULTS:<br>TYPE B<br><span style="color: red;">You're a more active person</span>, draw a clear line between happy and unhappy. You're more quick-tempered. <span style="color: blue;">If you encounter things you like, you will do it w/o 2nd thoughts. But once you meet things that you hate, you will wish to get out of it asap. As you're a person of your very own views, the friends you tend to have will be the same pattern. But once you're good with your friends, you will understand them a lot and go all the way to help them</span>. <span style="color: green;">Friends are very dependent on you.</span> <span style="color: red;">As you're too emotional, you may make a storm out of a teacup with your friends.</span> Must learn to do things in order and do not give up easily. Can try making friends with those you don't think you can get along with, don't stick with the same category. This will make you more popular and charming.<br><br>RED = Wrong<br>Blue = Correct<br>Green = Indefinite statement. (They depend on me rarely but will believe in my opinions and advice.)</div>
