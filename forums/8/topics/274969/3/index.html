            <div class='col-md body'>1) are you jealous of their development?<br><br>2) China,India and Philippines are the top 3 countries with people movement.<br>So seeing them all over the world is nothing new. I even experience a chinese serving me when I was in tokyo supermarket. She was explaining to me the different sushi sets that I can get during their discount period. I was so appreciative cause I won't get the good offer if she weren't there.<br><br>I was on a trip to US, and when I was at airport, I was surprised at the foodcourt in the airport, 80% of the customers were philippinos, 10% chinese, and only one white american.  Strangely, I felt more comfortable.<br><br>3) their internet sux? compared to HKG or Korea, I bet our internet sux too.<br>Don't compare downwards, compare upwards.<br>Don't be like our leaders who compared their salaries downwards/upwards whenever they like.<br><br>4) China is stamping privacy and corruption across. Compared that to our neighbours (north), it is a shame how they have done virtually nothing.<br><br>5) I do admit that Chinese under the influence of their forefathers, spit. But in my recent trip to Beijing, I only encountered one incident where the lady was doing a loud spit and she was an old woman.<br>During my previous trip, a year ago, it was bad, but now so much progress, it is simply amazing how fast China has progressed.<br><br>6) if you mentioned queuing up, when my ex-colleague was in Korea, queuing for McDonalds, a group of high school studnets just cut queue and dare him to do anything. It is the same everywhere. You speak up, people will give way, else they will eat you.<br><br>7) as for food, I dare you to eat what's on the streets anywhere. Please don't compare. The lesson learned is not to take what we have for granted. We have got good people taking care of cleanliness. And most of them, foreigner workers too. Be appreciative of them lah.<br><br>If you go to the top class rests be it in India or China, I bet you, we would paled in comparisons.  I have been to Delhi, and in one of their better rest, I had had the most wonderful meal.<br><br>Look at the good side, not the weaker side, and you will enjoy this vast country where my forefathers used to call home.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the threads, i have to agree with those who disagree wif TS. I mean, IMHO, i only see <strong>2</strong> actual problem with china in the 10 pointers you gave. The rest is just whining &amp; moaning about china. It's a developing country for crying out loud, and you when there on your own free will, you didnt complain b4 the trip is made, hence you can make none afterwards... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>If i were to go china, i would excuse alot of the shortcoming because they are still developing, i.e spit, yelling, noise pollutions etc.  But, if that country declares otherwise and these still appears(gd[not best] example: neigbhours up north), then it's unforgivable.<br><br>Street food is called "street food" because it's by the streets, not inside a posh restaurant, dude. Have you tried "street food" when traveling up north?(My rumly's burger got SAND in it!! OMFFFFFG <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> )<br><br>Shaddy workmanship is because of companies greed, manufacture things cheap &amp; loosen quality checks to lower cost &amp; maximise profits, "standard" manufacturing style. Capitalism at work baby! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Sides, china still got a long way to go from success, words can come back and bite you in the rear, hard.<br><br>There's places more worst off than china, i'm sure, you'll nvr know till you visit em. The only rant i have is that they compete with locals for jobs and they(workers) complain far too much!(If you missed home, just go back la~Still can come back 1! Quit whining abt it! As if i'll sponser u if u whine long enuff like tt!.)<br><br>Just my 2 cents worth............</div>
