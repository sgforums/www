Also, if TS is Chinese where his/her ancestors came from?<br><br>We are very mistaken about Mandarin as a language. In fact, Mandarin is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">dialect</span> spoken by Beijingers. The rest of China has its own dialects. So, if you can't speak Mandarin, it doesn't mean you are not Chinese. My grandparents don't! Once, a professor made the comment at a Speak Mandarin Campaign: he said those who can't speak Mandarin are not Chinese. I had to stand up and wack him proper. That was the last time I saw the stupid professor!<br>Since, it was a dialect spoken at the imperial courts and by officials (also called madarins), it became the official 'language'. In fact, it is called the common language (pu tong wah), and is meant to be used as a common language for all the various dialects the Chinese speak! Just like in SG, we use English as a common language. Does that mean we are Ang Moh? Of course, some silly gals like Ang Moh and think a great deal about them! As a matter of fact, some mainland Chinese can speak better English than our locals!<br></div>

Horrible Mandarin. A properly educated mainland Chinese person speaks beautiful Mandarin, I have to admit. Unfortunately, most Chinese people aren't well educated and they speak horrendous Mandarin.<br><br>3. Simplified writing is an abomination. It's as if one day the American government decided that not enough people are literate so they decide to adopt text messaging shortcuts as the national written language "cuz it's EZer 2 Lern."<br><br>4. Chinese people have absolutely no concept of waiting in line. It's just one manifestation of the general lack of curtesy here. I've never met a population of people that exhibited such rudeness. It's all part of the lack of education that I mentioned before.<br><br>5. Pollution. And I include with this not only the horrible air pollution, but noise pollution as well. The constant honking on the streets slowly drives me insane as I walk around the city. I know this isn't just Chinese, it happens in many other places, but man, they love to honk here. Car horns. Bicycle horns. Police whistles. It's non-stop noise everywhere.<br><br>6. If the honking doesn't drive you mad, the cacaphony of people hocking up phlegm will do it. Maybe it's the horrible air quality, but why do Chinese people have so much phlegm????<br><br>7. Chinese people love to yell. You'll usually find at least one or two people on every block angrily screaming at someone about something or other.<br><br>8. Food generally speaking is horrible here. The hygiene is low-to-non-existent and the culinary skills are seriously lacking as well. I wouldn't be caught dead eating anything from a street vendor in China. You can get food poisoning just by looking at them. Speaking of restaurants, the quality of service in China stinks as well. Due to the cheap labor, the ratio of the waiters to customers is frequently 2-to-1. Yet most Chinese wait staff have no idea how to properly wait a table.<br><br>9. Bad architecture and design. Chinese people's concept of good architecture is a building with a faux european renaissance look with a lot of gold trimming, hopefully with a fancy top. Driving around Shanghai, you'll notice that almost every building has some sort of "hat" on top.<br><br>10. Too many instances of dirty old men paired with hot young things. It's just disgusting and sad. I know there are sugar daddys all over the world, but it's literally all over the streets here. You can't turn around without seeing an old man with a pretty young girl.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>I sure hope u r not a Singaporean..We oready hav alot of bad remarks on us being arrogant &amp; hard to please, stop being such a snob.

We still have the ISD and SBA you noe.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>(2) hm.. I don't think Sporeans speak fantastic Chinese either.. If TS thinks US is much better, think again... every state in the US have their own accent to the extent that it's uncomprehensible.. so I guess it happens all around the world.. no point debating on this.. Wan to listen to good mandarin, go Beijing.<br><br>(3) No comments<br><br>(4) Agreed. But here in modern and supposedly highly educated SG, we still have a group of ppl we call "aunties" fighting to catch a seat on the trains, rushing in the moment the doors open.. causing huge disruption to the flow of traffic. What more can i say.. the aunties said it all with their actions.<br><br>(5) I agree with you on the horning. Air pollution wise, probably bad governance and also western countries shifting manufacturing industries to china for their low labour costs. this inevitably generated more air pollution that western countries. so we should blame western countries and their irresponsible companies as well shouldn't we?<br><br>(6) This is totally unaccepetable I must admit.<br><br>(7) This is probably the result of the traffic horning. Whenever we look at a problem, we should look at the cause and root of the problem.<br><br>(<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I guess this is lack of hospitality management courses and institutions available. Bad governance.<br><br>(9) If you look into the history of Shanghai, Shanghai was the first port to be opened up the westerners. Thus many of their old buildings along the most famous part of chang jiang have european styled achitecture. People who grew up there naturally refer this to nice. I mean whether something is beautiful is a matter of perspective isn't it? A cliche "beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder" tells it all...<br><br>(10) Pointless to bring up since there's just as many in SG.<br><br>Conclusion: I just wan to point out that TS is perfectly correct. I'm not questioning TS's power of observation but the power of critical thinking. TS has a set of good's and bads.. thus when one looks at another society.. we tend to judge.. Which we obviously shouldn't..<br>Because the society is like this for a reason.. probably due to poor governance or history or the Chinese culture.<br><br>China's a really huge country. If the problems can happen in sg, it can happen a few thousand fold in China. It was already very difficult to govern SG... think about China.. We have 4 major races, they have a few hundreds. So I hope for all readers to have patience.. Soon China WILL be on par with the States. It's not a matter of will it.. but a matter of when.<br>You never know, maybe your kids will adore China instead of the States.</div>
