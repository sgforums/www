            <div class='col-md body'>I'd suggest you go for K750i. The sound quality is superb, even surpassing that of Creative speakers. For better sound quality, you can get the plug type earphones. You can even take pictures with the K750i and the picture quality is also very good. Night shots are exceptionally good compared to other camera phones. The built-in light is also extremely bright. In fact it's so bright that it hurts ur eyes. Oh yes, and there's the video recording, which unfortunately isn't as wow as the stills. Recorded sounds are crisp clear and are in .amr format. SMSing is a breeze with the now available dictionary not seen in previous Ericsson models. Organizing smses is also a less pain because you can now use the delete all function, or you can choose to delete selected smses. To top it up, you have ur usual organizers like calenders, tasks, reminders, etc. I haven't tried using the Internet on my K750i so I can't comment anything on it. The games are just plain boring, not an issue though cuz if you want ur phone to last you won't be playing it. Bluetooth and IR are the standard features you can find on this phone too.<br><br>Alas, such a seemingly perfect phone is not without its flaws. One of its major drawback is in its lens cover design. Since the lens cover is aluminium, it gets dented easily if you bump it against say desks or whatever. Of course, you don't have to worry about it if you're not the type to put your phone in the pocket. Don't expect to be watching movie files other than 3gp cuz that's the only format it can play. If you really need to play other movie files on your phone, you'll have to convert it. Beware though that if you're the type who listens to music all day, your earphones are not going to last. This is due to the wires breaking internally from the constant flexing. The jack point also tend to lose its connection overtime. Most earphones have this problem anyway.<br><br>That's all I can say, HTH.</div>
