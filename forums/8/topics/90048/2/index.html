Better life compared to the deal they are stuck with in their own country.<br><br><strong>Less demanding?</strong><br>What they want in life is demanding in their country if they were to marry a local guy. Not so, if they marry one of the guys here.<br><br><strong>Does all the housework and take care of you?</strong><br>Hey what is housework compared to helping to plough the fields back home? Plus they don't have to get a job outside. Local girls are expected to share the financial burden.</div>

They have this EGO problem with them.<br>And for saying SG women will not take anyone who maybe earn lesser or have a lower education...... I think SG women have learned to become smarter and know what they want or need from a guy (mostly through bad experiences). I know of some girls who help pay off their BF debts or car installments and end up having the guy eloping or dumping them. Maybe these are the girls who learned their lesson and think to themselves that they have to treat themselves better. Hence the higher criteria in choosing a man.<br>I think some men can be intimidated by meeting a career woman who has everything...... and some even choose not to go out with one.... again EGO counts here...........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the first place, the number of women willing to go out with men of lower status are almost non-existance. And secondly men with that kinda egos are morons. I'm not sure about u but EVERY SINGLE ONE of my male friends are more then willing to have a rich gf supporting them.<br><br>As for those men being in debt, they're morons(Fomula for moronic level = size of pay/size of debt, the lower the figure, the more moronic the guy is). There is an old saying, dun have such a big backside, dun sit so big a chair(ok I made this up). The fact that those friends of yours are willing to pay off their debt makes them even more moronic. Being the sole bread winner and financially supporting a useless bum is 2 different thing.<br><br>I heard enough talk about girls care more about how nice the guy is to her, blah blah blah talk. That was of coz from a females mouth. Throw in a totally senitive, caring, funny, *insert whatever other "dream guy" quality* but he sells Newspaper by the side of the road and he's butt ugly, will u even begin to consider him???<br><br>At the very least us guys are frank. We want good looks and Big boobs.</div>
