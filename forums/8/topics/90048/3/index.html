            <div class='col-md body'>I only got one things to say. Many SG girls are hypocrites! Just afraid to admit it. How many of you guys out there got chase girls with higher position and education. I'm sure quite a lot rite. Did it work out. Probably more than 85% not rite? I encounter before man. A lot of rubbish reason came out. The equality thing is rubbish also like someone mentioned. They only want equality when it benefits them. How many of you guys encounter situations when they still like to say its a man job. Many rite. Rich guys being hao lian. Of course what. Its our local ladies who did them to them what. When they poor look down and laugh and despise them rite. When he get rich as in more than a million in cash type, you think he will still have any good will left? Give me a break. Why he hao lian. Revenge of course and since he has the money your can't do a thing bout it.</div>

Way much better man. They at least are still nice to talk with and easy to get along with. I know what they say about China girls being materialistic. But seriously. Most of them at least don't bother to hide it. They will say they hope to improve their life or want better things in life. Local girls like. Like to put a stupid show of acting like it doesn't matter. End of the day it stills does. You guys should try it out man. Ask them to go out for a simple meal or show lor. If you the no money type, you can hear all the excuses coming up. Next time when you have more money, try it again with a car and expensive stuff. BBBBIIIIGGGGG difference man. To be honest, I think Malaysian girls are still the safest for us SG guys.
