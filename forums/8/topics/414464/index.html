              <p>I do not know if this issue have been brought out yet, but in this age, at this point of time, Majority of the schools are still unwilling to teach the proper use of 'F*ck' , hence student use them .</p>
              <p>As most of you may know, children at a age of 7/8 would already start to rebel against the society,we've been there done that. And what these children would do is to go into the taboo within their reach,(in this case vulgarities), and just use them overly to be cool/ show off and more often than not,curse people.</p>
              <p>If the education system and the society as a whole start to teach the proper meaning of vulgarities and make these words more of a norm,do you not think children would minimize on spewing profanity? hence moving the world along to be more open and more acceptable,than to just censor it meaninglessly, Since we are all too familiar with it anyway and we could,more often than not,make out what they are trying to say, no?</p>
              <p>You see, another point that i would like to make is that ; Its not the words,but the intent.</p>
              <p>F*ck itself is an O-K word. It's original meaning is 'To have sex with' (i have a feeling they would censor s3x here,but it would prove my previous point,right?).</p>
              <p>If used correctly, we could replace the 4 word phrase with a single word.</p>
              <p>Other examples are dialects like 'C-B'. Which would be appropriate to use correctly such as when a Doctor is examining a aged female who came to the clinic alone and she has a Vaginal infection. How would the doctor try to tell her? .</p>
              <p>Like wise, even without these profanities, students could still scold each other by using other words. Either way,they would still get the message across, Profanity or not.</p>
              <p>Therefore if schools could teach it more educationally than to just close one eye to the matter,it would soothe the problem, would it not?</p>
              <p>I know this is not a flawless point of view, but i hope you get my point .</p>
              <p><br>Let me know ur comments and another way to tackle this matter.   :)</p>

              <p>Because its not as easy as it sounds...<br>I think society will need to go through many many layers of education before we can remove censorship...Kids mature by level into adults...thats how humans grow...no two kids are the same...some can hear once...some need to learn the hard way...</p>
              <p>In other words, the most sensible solution is to censor less according to specified levels of age...</p>
              <p>If i could create a system of punishment for students myself, it would be making them volunteer for charity...make them spend more time doing these kinds of activity then to waste time with useless methods...the only way you can actually influence a teenager or kid is through his/her emotions...negativity breeds negativity...positivity influences positivity</p>

              <p>Hence then is is not more important to educate this topic more correctly and openly? It is because schools prefer to shun the topic altogether and hence kids uses these as a form of rebellion,which by they are older,it would be a habit. If educated correctly and intensely,more people would understand perceptive and correctness of using these profanities hence minimizing , if not eliminating the use of it all together.</p>
              <p>Another case you said is in the UK. Well,as much as i would like to agree,they have their way of scolding vulgarities and if i could say so,a more subtle and 'educated' way. 'Bollocks' and other slangs are being used over there in the stead of 'F*ck' ,therefore my asumption of 'Intent, not words' stands true.</p>
              <p>Bitches and whores are the same as what 'F*ck' have became now,they can be used correctly,but they are constantly being stamped as 'Bad' and education system everywhere is leaving them out.</p>
              <p>Well, In my honest point of view, Education is a failure as long as they :</p>
              <p>1)Teach you what and how to think (Like labeling 'F*ck' as a profanity and avoiding the matter altogether)</p>
              <p>2)Leave out things (they deem taboo) that are essential in life such as the correct uses of words and the correct use of weapons and why they are originally allowed in the U.S .</p>
              <p>3)Don't teach truthfully enough .</p>
              <p>4)Punishing students without educating them properly (which links back to 1&amp;2) .</p>

              <p>I do not know if this issue have been brought out yet, but in this age, at this point of time, Majority of the schools are still unwilling to teach the proper use of 'F*ck' , hence student use them .</p>
              <p>As most of you may know, children at a age of 7/8 would already start to rebel against the society,we've been there done that. And what these children would do is to go into the taboo within their reach,(in this case vulgarities), and just use them overly to be cool/ show off and more often than not,curse people.</p>
              <p>If the education system and the society as a whole start to teach the proper meaning of vulgarities and make these words more of a norm,do you not think children would minimize on spewing profanity? hence moving the world along to be more open and more acceptable,than to just censor it meaninglessly, Since we are all too familiar with it anyway and we could,more often than not,make out what they are trying to say, no?</p>
              <p>You see, another point that i would like to make is that ; Its not the words,but the intent.</p>
              <p>F*ck itself is an O-K word. It's original meaning is 'To have sex with' (i have a feeling they would censor s3x here,but it would prove my previous point,right?).</p>
              <p>If used correctly, we could replace the 4 word phrase with a single word.</p>
              <p>Other examples are dialects like 'C-B'. Which would be appropriate to use correctly such as when a Doctor is examining a aged female who came to the clinic alone and she has a Vaginal infection. How would the doctor try to tell her? .</p>
              <p>Like wise, even without these profanities, students could still scold each other by using other words. Either way,they would still get the message across, Profanity or not.</p>
              <p>Therefore if schools could teach it more educationally than to just close one eye to the matter,it would soothe the problem, would it not?</p>
              <p>I know this is not a flawless point of view, but i hope you get my point .</p>
              <p><br>Let me know ur comments and another way to tackle this matter.   :)</p>

              <p><br>The condition in singapore is different from other, especially the west and those homogenous country whereby, there is a single language or two to teach them, Singapore have a magnitude of so many languages and dialects, if you teach one, they will use the other, there are indian, malay, hokkien, javanese, north indian, hindi, cantonese, english, thai, viet, chinese, hakka, mynamar etc etc languages and dialects in Singapore, all kinds of vulgar words with all kinds of meaning and pronounciation...</p>

              <p>but at least i am not like those ginahs who riot and kill people with their '10x1' formation. But the FUCK education aside we have to at least let NSF know that the license to kill applies when you are on duty and in unifrom. otehr than that any unauthorize use of force to fulfill any individual's bravado is death by hanging. cheebye kias since their kwailan face in the news know they are not repend. fine the law make it such a way that upo their last breath at execution they will know the truth - the truth i also so much yearn for. but my time is not up yet, and i can choose a death more glorious than - rioting <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
