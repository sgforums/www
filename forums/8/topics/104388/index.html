            <div class='col-md body'>Pretty normal.. most pple will avoid.. coz juz too embarressed by the whole thing.. maybe even disgusted.. however.. try to spare a tot for the person.. it takes some guts n risks to confess to a person.. risk like the potential loss of a fren.. be fair to him.. unless he is a psychopath..<br><br>but if u r open-minded.. den u wouldn't mind continuing the frenship.. but of course muz make it clear that u r not interested in anything further or else he'll mistake ur intentions.. but i dun see why u two cant remain as frens..</div>
