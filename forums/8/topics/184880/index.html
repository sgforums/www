The things that makes your sentence heavier is whether or not it is premediated, whether people are hurt. Premediated will get a heavier sentence because it's planned.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by numby:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">the law states that between 6 pm and 6am, a<br>woman has the right to REFUSE to go to the Police Station, even if an<br>arrest warrant has been issued against her. It is a procedural issue that<br><br>a woman can be arrested between 6pm and 6 am, ONLY if she is arrested by<br>a woman officer and taken to an ALL WOMEN police station. And if she is<br>arrested by a male officer, it has to be proven that a woman officer was<br>on duty at the time of arrest.<br><br>It is good for us to know our rights. To what extent it comes of use<br>remains to be seen in any situation. But as they say, knowledge is power.<br><br>Just thought I`d share this with you.<br>I did not know this and am sure lot of us will not know this -<br>please be informed..... And pass on this info to whom all u know....... </span><br><br>it sounds logical to me<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Always make sure that your source check back to his/her source</div>
