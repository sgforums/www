            <div class='col-md body'>Usually we play such games by STATIONS or LARGE GROUP....<br><br>In large groups, we usually play those hand signs game or games combined with cards....<br><br>The more COMMON and INTERESTING one I guess would be the STATION GAMES.... Stations would be set up with 1-3 MENTORs at each individual stations... Games at the station can be PHYSICAL (Running, sack bags.. etc with some unique demanding stunts(?)..), INTELLECTUAL (which incorporate QUIZs or PUZZLEs to be SOLVED...), PERFORMANCE (Meaning SCORE with CHEERS, SINGING, JOKES, STORIES... etc... Basically something which involves CREATIVITY and PERFORMANCE....)<br>CRUCIAL points to take note in PLANNING OUT the STATIONs would be the INVOLVEMENT of TEAM WORK and PEOPLE.... Though not necessarily all the games would require the PHYISCAL INVOLVEMENT of all parties BUT at least the others should participate by cheering or PLANNING or even with DRAWINGS and DESIGNs....<br><br>COMMON GAMES would be (1) Trying to get a fixed number of people to stay within a certain small area and no one is suppose to touch the area outside WITHIN a TIME FRAME (2) PHYSICAL RELAYs (3) DECORATION of human dummies (4) TALENT TIME perfomance involving the WHOLE TEAM.... (5) CHALLENGEs which test the TEAM's CONFIDENCE in each other, their SPIRIT and COOPERATION... (PS. We had MISSION IMPOSSIBLE before.. Meaning the GAME has NO ANSWER one lah... &lt;- Just to TEST our CONFIDENCE in each other and see if we have a STRONG TEAM SPIRIT or not...? By the way, we DID GREAT!!!)<br><br>You can TRY this as an IDEA? SET up VARIOUS STATIONS to TEST on DIFFERENT COMPOSITIONs of the TEAMs ESPECIALLY on their TEAM SPIRIT and TEAM WORK.... They'll need to perform a CHEER BEFORE &amp; AFTER each STATION.... But ACCESSING the stations won't be so easy... You can INCORPORATE TREASURE HUNT in the WHOLE GAME... They'll need to find the 'key-keepers' based on clues given in order to gain ACCESS to the STATIONs... And in order for them to be GIVEN ACCESS by the individual UNKNOWN key-holders... You can make them GUESS a CODE (magic word?), CONVINCE the KEY-KEEPER, perform certain task(s) for the key-keeper.... Hehheh... HAPPY PLAYING... Hope you guys would have fun then...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Try this game, it's very very fun:<br><br>prepare 2 paper bats (roll newspapers into a thick bat and bind it with tapes)<br><br>all players stand in a big circle. Place 2 chairs (or anything big enough) one in the north and one in the south of the circle, each 15 meters away from the center of circle.<br><br>select 2 persons by random (O-bay-som). One person be the attacker, one be the defender (scissors paper stone ), each of them holds a paper bat. The game starts and the attacker will chase to hit the defender with the bat. the defender can only block the attack with the bat and cannot hit back on the attacker.<br><br>Once the attacker hits the defender, their roles changes - the defender now takes the role of the attacker, and the attacker now takes the role of the defender.<br><br>The chase goes on for the new attacker to chase and hit the new defender.<br><br>Anytime in the game, the defender can go to any of the chairs and hit it then he will be allowed to pass the paper bat to anyone in the circle by hitting the person with the bat and throw the bat on the ground at his/her feet, the person who receives the paper bat becomes the defender now.<br><br>there's no score for this game, no winners or losers. It's just excitement.<br><br>If you like this game, you can try a more exciting version: play this game at a place with obstacles (such as canteen with tables or lecture room with many chairs)<br>Everyone can go free to run about instead of standing in a circle, but they are not allowed to leave the place AT ALL.<br><br>The rule is the same but this time THere is NO more chair at the North or South (they have no more uses in this version).<br>the attacker will chase to hit the defender, and the defender is allowed to hit anyone in the place anytime and pass the bat to the New defender.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  it's very fun and I wish to play it again , too bad I no more schooling liao<br><br>[This message has been edited by pang sai (edited 17 December 2001).]</div>
