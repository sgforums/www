              <p>well lady,I don't know where u come from.actually in this case,your nationality does not matter that much. in ur mind, most singaporean are stupid, so called Chinaman is cheepie.then plz tell me is there any postive words exist  in your smart brain?</p>
              <p>judge from the avatar, I assum that you are person with good education,gorgeous and intelligent. but those words u shxt out here in no way tell us things related with qualities I just mentioned.</p>
              <p>if u still think that's okay with u then, I got nothing to say. I'm not type of person like giving others lecture. so u feel good then, u go ahead. but I've gotta tell u, your high school teachers really wanna drag u back to classes.</p>

              <p>I agree that alot of Chinese from China (not all of them of course) are irritating, cheapskates and arrogant. I have seen them in action all over the world. In Europe, they are like that. In China, they are also like that. In Singapore, they also like that. Just plain distasteful, some of their habits and behaviour.</p>
              <p>The only other thing I want to say is that we Singaporeans are not exactly any better than them.</p>

              <p>To xtreyier</p>
              <p>1.tell me how many times u used shxt or words like that? is that all u got from school,from your teachers?I do agree with your view about teachers in SG, but what a pity that they did't finished the work of edacation on u.</p>
              <p>2.to dat,not just one singaporean leave country,move to other countries,like Australia, US, Canada. could u just tell me, does that mean SG suck so they've gotta  leave for a better conditon?</p>
              <p>3.where the hell  you see so called murder? oh.right, some one told u. I tell u that u're gonna be killed in 2012, u believe it or not? just as I said, if u wanna reveal the truth then, u gotta come to China, walk around, see with your might not fairly eyes. stop yelling here.</p>
              <p>4.do you know anything more about Mao except for his name?I assume u dont speak chinese,all the other comments or articles which u can find everywhere in English  might meet your desire. plus I dont think ur teacher taught  u that if you wanna give someone a comment, then just read one or two comments ppl made before would be pretty enough or cut in short,just listen what others say.</p>
              <p>5.about the Japan. premier Zhou might did a unappropriate decision to give up the war compensation. but that has nothing to do with ignore of ppl's suffering. they just wish China and Japan could go back to the normal relationship. of coz, they may feel regret for what they did yesterday,if they still alive. perfect man doest exist in this world.</p>
              <p>6.I just stand on my postion,  stand for no one else. that's u who enlarge the gap between us,trying to make opposition.all I hope is donnot use derogatory words when u talking about the country actually dont know that much. if it's just fine according to your eduction, I got nothing to blabla over here.</p>
              <p>7."Still water runs deep. ". you are absolutely right.but no way to make me believe that  you are just that kind of guy.</p>

              <p>1. what your  beliefs are, is none of my concern, for I am no commie who do not believe in freedom.</p>
              <p>2. What my education credentials are, is none of your concern, for my text written are evidence for others to perceive as they wish, a right I do not demand, unlike you restrictive commies.</p>
              <p>3. What my fellow citizens, a small minority of them, who leaves our shores, is none of our concern, for each has his/her own freedom of choice, unlike yours.</p>
              <p>4. Patricidal murders and destruction of 5000 year old cultural heritage had been committed by your commie bastards leaders and youth of the 60s, is a fact, Denial only makes you more of an accomplice to such murders, a tacit approval for patricide, for which you shall be held responsible for, if you do nothing to hold the party for final accounting.</p>
              <p>5. Perfect men do not exists, but your bastard commie leaders are alive, with blood on their hands, and with support from you only makes you just as evil. The millions of chinese who died DO NOT REST in peace even today.</p>
              <p>6. You and your kind best Drop your cultural chavuanism and arrogance. You have ABOSOLUTELY NOTHING  to be proud of as long as your allegience is to the murderous CCP!</p>
              <p>7. You are no match for me, and to continue on will only deem me a bully. I will stop here. I only appeal to any goodness left in you to reflect on you and your society's actions before you comment on any of my fellow citizens as a guest here and why we hold some of your cheap charlies, no matter how educated, with low regard. </p>
              <p>My respect for China persons are solely for those whom do not deny their history and strove hard to make China better today, whom I had the priviledge and honour to know them.</p>
              <p>We Singaporeans are not perfect, but we will deal with our issues in our own multicultural way, the way you should too before you comment on us and thereby inviting others to comment on yours.  </p>

              <p>I've asked many of them before. The chinese foreign workers here all spend minimum S$10k agent fees to get to work here, earning about 1.1-1.3k, minus the rental and makan, how much they gonna left per month? Their first year's income is contributed to landlords, kopitiam bosses and agents.<br>The 10k agent fees shared by local kopitiam bosses (asking rebates from local agency), local and foreign agency.</p>
