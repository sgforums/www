It may be an issue only when both decided to tie the knot. This is the time when the pressure is the greatest, especially from friends, parents esp.y.<br>My close friend ( 32 ) just married his gf (20 or 21 - poly just graduated ) . The ROM was a rather tense occassion, where both parents felt uneasy abt it . The main issue was that the girl is planning to study OS to get a degree but her parent cldn't afford so my friend parent felt that the ball has been passed to my friend's shoulder - a heavy burder considering he wld hv zero savings ( his salary abt $4k Gross) by then she graduated.<br><br>But, the main problem &amp; worry is the fact that will she be gone by then ( my friend wld hv left high &amp; dry). I hv seen too many similar cases &amp; to my surprise this kind of story has started way b/4 our time. It happened to my uncle's friend who supported his gf to UK &amp; was left with nothing but nasty remarks such as stupid etc. The gf even shipped all the books she bought using his $ back to S'pore to his house . It was a big blow to him.<br><br>I fear this will happen to my friend , I can sense his fear . I oberved he aged  quite a bit this few mths. For once, I wld said normal guys of our age wld want to settle down with a good family asap. Thus, I understand my friend problem, it is basically loan after loan, HDB loan ( just bought a more expensive flat so his wife can near her parent - burnt $50k more , her study expenses, etc). He now ride a motorcycle instead of buying a car just to save to provide for her needs.<br><br>I believe most girls wld said that not all cases turn sour but the statistics are clear &amp; well witnessed by our friends &amp; relatives . I hv been wanting to help him make up a romantic &amp; warmth story to ask her wife to study in s'pore SIM or the like. At least he can see her every day, &amp; work at ease not always worry. He used to complain abt &amp;leaving his current job . Now, he "praise " his job saying how good the pay is etc. ( just trying to comfort himself) so all our close friends felt really bad for him. But, when two persons reached this point to ensure the relationship cld continue it is best for them to open up &amp; let each other know their really worries &amp; pretending to be ok like my friend.<br><br>Sad to say I still struggling if I shd persuade my friend to stop her fr going OS. I felt that everyone shld work (man/lady) first b/4 spending close kin $ - at least we understand $ is hard earned.Lastly, I felt in today world not just S'pore getting a degree is not really essential , your attitude &amp; creativity is more important. A degreee doesn't gives u a job automatically - so to be studying a degree here &amp; OS in current mkt doesn't make a difference @ all . I see my neighour struggling to provide for her daughter OS eduaction( selling car etc).<br><br>Thus, age gap is not an issue unless marriage is in sight. I agree older guy are more caring due to our society experience &amp; exposure.<br><br>My best blessing to my friend.<br><br>Quote:<br><br>" Love is blind only when our pocket is left unhurt "<br><br></div>

But in the eyes of the man, she still looks young and pretty because by then he's already 60.<br><br>Another senario...<br>20 yr old girl marry 20 yr old guy<br>girl think the guy cute, handsome, probably good body etc<br>guy think the girl pretty, extremely beautiful, good body etc<br>twenty years later....<br>the guy look at the girl and says to himself: geez... how come my wife look so old now<br>then he will oogle at the 20 yr old girls.<br><br>Dunno how true.  But I thought the senarios are kinda funny.</div></blockquote>I carry your first scenario abit further. . .<br><br>By the time the 'girl' is 60 the guy would be 80 and probably passed away or soon to be gone, so the female is gonna be alone for a pretty loooong time. . .<br><br>the wierdest point will be the point when the girl is 30 and the guy is 50, cos erm, 30 still ain't that old YET, but 50 you almost getting your senior citizenship card liao. . .</div>
