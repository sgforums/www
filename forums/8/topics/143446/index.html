            <div class='col-md body'>Human rights watch/asia estimates probably more than a million women and children are employed in indian brothels. 20% of bombay's brothel population is thought to be girls under the age of 18 and half of that population may be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Held in debt bondage (indentured slaves) for years at a time, they are raped and subjected to other forms of torture, to severe beatings, exposure to aids and arbitrary punishments.<br>Women from remote hill villages are lured by recruiters promising jobs or marriages. These women are sold for anywhere between $500 to $1300. Brothels are tightly controlled with constant surveillance. Escape is virtually impossible.<br>A quick snap shot of prostitution in india. Perhaps the fair obsessed bom bom would get off her high horse and clean up the appalling state of their own backyards.</div>
