              <p><br> I once aquaplaned in heavy torrential rain at about 100km/h in Ulu
              Pandan Rd. (yes i know, i was young and foolish once. still am

              <p>Funnily enough I've done about 120mph in the rain on the
              motorway in UK, and done 135mph on a private estate in a Ferrari
              when it was sleeting, and never experienced aquaplaning.</p>

              <p><br>Normal road tyres when I aquaplaned. Normal road tyres for the 120mph on the motorway too. Whatever's fitted to a Ferrari 550M for the private estate blast I guess. But tyres were all in good condition. I do believe it was really raining heavily when I aquaplaned, more so than the other times I didn't.</p>
