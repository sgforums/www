              <p>hmm.. may she who probably didn't know what happened find eternal peace.</p>
              <p>and especially to her best friend, stay strong, it's hard we know. Life can't be controlled. be grateful that you had been able to enjoyed her company. ç¼˜å°½ä»Šç”Ÿ,è¿˜æœ‰æ�¥ä¸–.</p>
              <p>side note a bit, as mentioned by the above post that the victim was witness to a bike accident. It could have been a sign. But then again, if its meant to come, it will come.</p>
              <p>as for the driver, no amount of words can bring her back to life. whatever's the truth, he will probably in one way or another return this mistake he've committed. Through him, or his loved ones, we would never know too.</p>
              <p>although I don't know them, but I believe the victim also don't wish to see her best friend being swallowed by anger and hate. Let the episode close and move on as fast as you can, help the others too.. Living well is the best blessing you can give to her so that she will not worry about you all in the next life and can move on too.</p>

              <p>mmm.. another case. I've seen too many already. This one reminds of a friend who just passed 2 months ago. RH big boss's grand daughter.</p>
              <p>Speculations aside. mmm.. too young to die, regardless. When it happend, it was already too late.</p>
              <p>On a side note, i know guys who cant take rejection or relationship problems and just go loco on the wheel. So yeah.</p>
              <p>Flung out ? 100% no seatbelt. Simple. But well, at least there was a survivor. He is gonna wish he was dead. Maybe its good that he is still alive. He aint gonna forget this incident till the day he die. And only he knows what realkly happened. Let God judge him when his time is up.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/sorry.png" alt="sorry.png"></p>

              <p>the driver really knn, y so defensive when hes the cause of the girl's death..worst also kana jailed and license suspended for life..at least wont feel so guilty after serving jail and ppl might forgave you also..but his attitude now is like is non of his problem.</p>
              <p>i also wonder y she gone out with him since she noe hes trying to be 3rd part in their r/s. After reading her blog, can see she got a near perfect life till her death. Admirable.</p>
