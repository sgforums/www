              <p><br>Assuming an impact at 60km/h, lets do the math.</p>
              <p>60km/h is 16.67 m/s</p>
              <p>assuming deceleration is over 1 second, the deceleration = (16.67-0)/1</p>
              <p>=16.67 m/s^2</p>
              <p>We all know earth's gravitational pull is about 9.81m/s^2</p>
              <p>so a deceleration experienced in a crash at 60km/h would be 16.67/9.81 = approx 1.7 times more than earth's gravity. Does it hurt when you fall down? If you have a pane of glass, and you fell onto it from a meter above, what are the odds that you WILL break and pass thru the glass at 1 standard gravity? Pretty high right? Imagine falling onto the glass at almost TWO times standard gravity... and thats only at a low speed of 60km/h!</p>
              <p>So no, impact doesn't have to be massive for people to be flung out of cars. 50km/h impacts are actually deadlier than you think, it's just that cars have gotten so safe nowadays and seat belt laws are so strict that people survive 50km/h crashes thinking "thats a small impact". The truth is, no, its not.</p>

              <p>My personal experience is that I may be as safe as I can, but I cannot stop other people from been reckless. I can only exercise road-awareness.</p>
              <p>I was riding my motorcycle on CTE and there was this car wanted to filter into my lane, he didn't check his blind spot, so I guess he forgot the 'look over shoulder', I saw his wing mirror coming in and I tried my best to evade, I still got hit, but I was fortunate enough not to have fell off from that impact.</p>

              <p>Orh! speaking of that, last night I almost got run over by a cab! I was crossing the road, and was on the divider bit where its marked by chevrons, and this bloody cab wanted to cut across the chevrons. Worse still I was in my black CQB overalls which were meant to make me hard to see and I'm damn lucky he saw me at the last minute and managed to slow down and avoid me. I was not quite sure which way to jump since he served one way then the other. Geez. He choing the corner so fast and want to cut road divider somemore. &gt;=(</p>

              <p>Orh! speaking of that, last night I almost got run over by a cab! I was crossing the road, and was on the divider bit where its marked by chevrons, and this bloody cab wanted to cut across the chevrons. Worse still I was in my black CQB overalls which were meant to make me hard to see and I'm damn lucky he saw me at the last minute and managed to slow down and avoid me. I was not quite sure which way to jump since he served one way then the other. Geez. He choing the corner so fast and want to cut road divider somemore. &gt;=(</p>

              <p>I wasn't afraid of crashing the Ferrari because I was in control. When I aquaplaned in the renault, the moment it aquaplaned, I wasn't in control till the tyres gripped again, I just didn't panic that's all.</p>
