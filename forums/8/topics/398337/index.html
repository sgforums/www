              <p>I am an Chinese speaking Chinese Singaporean.
                   I have been
                                          reading this forum and seeing some 
                  Singaporeans (duh) and I
                                          just can't understand why some Singaporeans of 
                  Chinese say
                                          things such as  "MRT should not display Chinese signboards, because we are not going to acomodate the PRCs", "English is our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. Although I am Singaporean, not Chinese from China. I have 
                  never been to
                                          China. However my race on my birth certificate (BC / NRIC) is 
                  Chinese. Anyone who has
                                          Chinese in the BC race column will know that your surname is what, and it is the same from the people from China.</p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in 
                  school with English as
                                          our first language. However, I only use Chinese at home, and even many times at work (School) since one of the
                                          Singapore's four official language is Chinese. Many of our laws, 
                  newspapers and everything
                                          else are all also available in Chinese (Malay and Tamil also got, however, to a slightly less extent when compared to Chinese, probably due to the population's porportion). How many people have actually passed their English with flying colours / A star distinction compared to their own mother tongue?</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an 
                  environment, some people
                                          still reject the use of their own mother tongue and speak English.</p>
              <p>3. English IS NOT Singapore's language. Some 
                  Singaporeans reject
                                          English as a "foreign language", the language of
                   the British and
                                          Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we 
                  should speak Mandarin,
                                          our ancestral language, our "roots". This is fact. Dont forget that our national anthem is sing in Malay, and our pledge are also available in 4 languages (Malay, Chinese and Tamil as well). Guess what, in early days (1960s ~ 70s), if anyone has their parents who is studying in Chinese Medium school (å�Žæ ¡) will know what I meant. (But I am not from that generation)</p>
              <p>English is still a foreign language to 
                  Singaporeans  because your surname most likely got a chinese background, or malay or tamil family names.</p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that 
                  they are
                                          Singaporeans where apart of the Malays, they have ancestors (Grandparents or Great Grandparents) who are probably once a Chinese citizens, or Indian citizen. Even for the Malays, they are likely to have their ancestors to be once a Malaysian citizens.... so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say while Singlish is ok and unique Singaporeans, but that is not going to be acceptable for work / official purpose. Most likely it is same for the "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English" as well, in this aspect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5. Despite Mandarin is not even my ancestral language
                   if you want to be
                                          anal about it and Mandarin is the dialect of 
                  Beijing and my
                                          forefathers were probably from Fujian, but does our environment allows us to learn on our own respective dialects such as Hokkien and Teochew? Even in PRC, the authorities are also encourage the use of Mandarin.</p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? Of course! Lets not forget that the rise of China and the fall of the European / US makes it possible. Just like Latin used to be useful and not now, unless one is researching on bible / holy stuffs.</p>
              <p>The second largest and expected to take over to be the first largest economy by 2050 in the world, China, 
                  uses Chinese.
                                          Many Europeans and Americans started to learn &amp; speak Chinese these days in order to keep up trend.</p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget the reason why our "forefathers" ran away from China / India etc took up "Singapore 
                  citizenship"
                                          for a reason. That was because their country was used to be in extreme poverty / war strucken homeland. Singapore, on the other hand, used to practice free immigration policy. So it is not really taking up a Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak English (a foregin language) in
                                          Singapore (an Multi-racial society).</p>
              <p>8: I do reject the use of English PC nowadays. All my software, 
              Windows, Office, Visual Studio (I am a programmer in my IT course) are 
              all in Chinese, and uses of English software is only exclusively when 
              the essential software does not have a Chinese version.</p>
              <p>9: Many of the senoir citizens, especially from the older 
              estates, still uses their dialect such as Hokkien, not even Mandarin. It
               can never be English and these are the people requesting the 
              authorities to set up more chinese signboard / announcements etc in MRT 
              stations.</p>
              <p>If you can't speak your own mother tongue  in Singapore, I 
                  suggest
                                          you hang your head in shame, for you have truly 
                  "lost your
                                          roots".</p>

              <p>I want to ask the english speaking and english educated baba Harry Lee Kuan Yew, why is it that chinese is about 75% of population in Singapore, a clear majority but he chose to destroy chinese schools of higher learning and impose an alien language - english - upon the population.</p>
              <p>Why didn't he choose the most obvious, the most logical language, mandarin as the dominant language of Singapore?</p>
              <p>Why did he use an alien, colonial language that majority of people in Singapore cannot understand as dominant language?</p>

              <p>Harry Lee didn't choose english because he wanted to "destroy communist'. Harry Lee also didn't choose english because he wanted to make things "fair" for the minorites. </p>

              <div>
              <p>I am an Chinese speaking Chinese Singaporean. I have been reading this forum and seeing some Singaporeans (duh) and I just can't understand why some Singaporeans of Chinese say things such as  "MRT should not display Chinese signboards, because we are not going to acomodate the PRCs", "English is our language" etc. </p>
              <p>Let me make some points clear.</p>
              <p>1. Although I am Singaporean, not Chinese from China. I have never been to China. However my race on my birth certificate (BC / NRIC) is Chinese. Anyone who has Chinese in the BC race column will know that your surname is what, and it is the same from the people from China.</p>
              <p><em><strong>My surname is not the same as those from China. It is quite obvious that Singaporean names and Chinese names are very different. You need to grow a brain.</strong> </em></p>
              <p>2. I, like all Singaporeans, grew up in school with English as our first language. However, I only use Chinese at home, and even many times at work (School) since one of the Singapore's four official language is Chinese. Many of our laws, newspapers and everything else are all also available in Chinese (Malay and Tamil also got, however, to a slightly less extent when compared to Chinese, probably due to the population's porportion). How many people have actually passed their English with flying colours / A star distinction compared to their own mother tongue?</p>
              <p>I don't understand why under such an environment, some people still reject the use of their own mother tongue and speak English.</p>
              <p><em><strong>How do you "only use" Chinese at school and work when 1/4 of Singaporeans are not Chinese and the language of education and work is English? Care to elaborate? Many Singaporean Chinese are not even proficient in Chinese.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>In fact, you are typing in English now.</strong></em></p>
              <p>3. English IS NOT Singapore's language. Some Singaporeans reject English as a "foreign language", the language of the British and Americans etc and say that as "Chinese" we should speak Mandarin, our ancestral language, our "roots". This is fact. Dont forget that our national anthem is sing in Malay, and our pledge are also available in 4 languages (Malay, Chinese and Tamil as well). Guess what, in early days (1960s ~ 70s), if anyone has their parents who is studying in Chinese Medium school (å�Žæ ¡) will know what I meant. (But I am not from that generation)</p>
              <p>English is still a foreign language to Singaporeans  because your surname most likely got a chinese background, or malay or tamil family names.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Most Americans still have German and Irish etc surnames. Likewise for the Scottish, Welsh etc they have scottish names etc and they all speak English. Your surname has nothing to do with the language you speak.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Barrack hussein Obama is a Kenyan surname, going by your logic he should speak Kenyan because he has a kenyan background?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Singaporeans have never been to China. They definitely do not have a Chinese background but a Singaporean background. Take a trip to China and see what China is like, you will see the massive differences from Singapore, it is like day and night.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Singaporeans say their pledges in English, dont be retarded. I haven't said my pledge in Chinese before for my entire life.</strong></em></p>
              <p>4. I think Singaporeans should be clear that they are Singaporeans where apart of the Malays, they have ancestors (Grandparents or Great Grandparents) who are probably once a Chinese citizens, or Indian citizen. Even for the Malays, they are likely to have their ancestors to be once a Malaysian citizens.... so on and so forth. </p>
              <p>I say while Singlish is ok and unique Singaporeans, but that is not going to be acceptable for work / official purpose. Most likely it is same for the "Geordie" or "Scottish English" or even "Welsh English" as well, in this aspect.</p>
              <p><em><strong>All human kind descended from Africa. Do you want to "find your roots" back to Africa? We descended from monkeys as well, can you peel a Banana?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Do you want to wear a Chinese qipao and walk around or start fire by using stones?</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>The problem with this "finding your roots" thing is how far back do you want to go? The link has long been cut. You are Singaporean, not Chinese citizen. If you love China so much move there and speak Mandarin/Dialects all day long, don't let the door hit your butt on the way out.</strong></em></p>
              <p>5. Despite Mandarin is not even my ancestral language if you want to be anal about it and Mandarin is the dialect of Beijing and my forefathers were probably from Fujian, but does our environment allows us to learn on our own respective dialects such as Hokkien and Teochew? Even in PRC, the authorities are also encourage the use of Mandarin.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Of course the Singapore environment does not allow one to use Chinese dialects much. It is an English speaking society.</strong></em></p>
              <p>6. Mandarin is useful? Of course! Lets not forget that the rise of China and the fall of the European / US makes it possible. Just like Latin used to be useful and not now, unless one is researching on bible / holy stuffs.</p>
              <p>The second largest and expected to take over to be the first largest economy by 2050 in the world, China, uses Chinese. Many Europeans and Americans started to learn &amp; speak Chinese these days in order to keep up trend.</p>
              <p><strong>Europe and US are not "falling". Read my "I don't understand the rise of China" thread in this forum. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>China has a big economy only because it has 1/4 of the world's population, 1.4 billion people. If you put Europe and North America to form 1.4 billion people, their economy is 200 times China's and they win 200 times more olympic medals and their standard of living is 20 times China's.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>China's economy is only 4 trillion. the USA's is 15 trillion. Even if China overtakes the USA as the biggest economy, the economies of English speaking countries will ALWAYS be at least 100 times those of Chinese speaking ones.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Only 3 countries in the world use Chinese-  Singapore, Taiwan, China. 55 Countries use English - Canada, Australia, Ireland, UK, Ghana, Jamaica, Fiji, India..and so on.</strong></p>
              <p>7.  Lets not forget the reason why our "forefathers" ran away from China / India etc took up "Singapore citizenship" for a reason. That was because their country was used to be in extreme poverty / war strucken homeland. Singapore, on the other hand, used to practice free immigration policy. So it is not really taking up a Singapore citizenship.</p>
              <p>So don't tell me to speak English (a foregin language) in Singapore (an Multi-racial society).</p>
              <p><em><strong>It is precisely Singapore is multi racial hence English is used as our first language, everyone is on equal footing and everyone can communicate.</strong></em></p>
              <p><strong>English has been used in Singapore for the past 2 centuries as a British colony. It is definitely not foreign. Your forefathers spoke English as a lingua franca.</strong></p>
              <p><em><strong>What is "not really taking up Singapore citizenship"? Why did your forefathers not go back to China or India etc? Why did they take up Singapore citizenship? Because they DON"T WANT TO GO BACK. THEY DISLIKE CHINA. THEY WERE STARVING TO DEATH IN CHINA UNDER THE 1920 FAMINES.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>You are really retarded.</strong></em></p>
              <p>8: I do reject the use of English PC nowadays. All my software, Windows, Office, Visual Studio (I am a programmer in my IT course) are all in Chinese, and uses of English software is only exclusively when the essential software does not have a Chinese version.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Yeah yeah, go type your computer programs in Chinese and speak Chinese to everyone you retard.</strong></em></p>
              <p>9: Many of the senoir citizens, especially from the older estates, still uses their dialect such as Hokkien, not even Mandarin. It can never be English and these are the people requesting the authorities to set up more chinese signboard / announcements etc in MRT stations.</p>
              <p><em><strong>Yeah and the only reason they don't speak English is because they are illiterate and never even finished PSLE. They work for 800 SGD /mth at the hawker center taking drinks orders and cleaning tables.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>If they speak English, they could get an education, a better job etc, but they don't, hence they wipe the floors you and I step on.</strong></em></p>
              <p><em><strong>Funny how you like to talk about poor, illiterate low wage workers and set them as your standards. You idolise them like gods. Story of your life isn't it?</strong></em></p>
              <p>If you can't speak your own mother tongue  in Singapore, I suggest you hang your head in shame, for you have truly "lost your roots".</p>
              <em><strong>Indeed. You stupid retard.</strong></em><br></div>

              <p>There is only one reason and one reason only why Harry Lee chose to destroy chinese schools and reformed the education system so as to impose english as the dominant language of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The MAJORITY of people in Singapore didn't know a single word of english.</p>
              <p>Only a small minority who mostly served as the elite in colonial british Singapore knew english.</p>
              <p>Harry Lee is from that group.</p>
              <p>Harry Lee didn't choose english because he wanted to "destroy communist'. Harry Lee also didn't choose english because he wanted to make things "fair" for the minorites. </p>
              <p>The only reason why Harry Lee pick and chose english as the dominant language was to serve his interests and the interests of his own elite english speaking group.</p>
              <p>That is the only reason why english is dominant language of Singapore today.</p>
