              <p>Wow! Ranson, your skin is really thick - comparable to elephants! Not
               only you're totally unabashed to flaunt your narrow-mindedness when it 
              comes to the Chinese language, you have the audacity to bulldoze others,
               calling others "idiot", and the like, where the very same adjectives 
              would have suited impeccably on yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Let's
               see. Have you been struggling with Chinese since young? Have you been 
              ridiculed by your Chinese teacher and your peers? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Got
               so exasperated with Chinese that you desperately needed to vent your 
              frustration by making a senseless tirade to make it seemed like - oh, my
               Chinese is bad but (because I want to save face),  I want it to be 
              lousy intentionally. Never mind. You can continue trumpeting your own 
              warped ideologies on this virtual space; any person of some intellect 
              (not you perhaps) would be able to dismiss your whole chunk of tirade as
               a whining post by some loser. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I shan't even do a point-by-point refutation because I know you are so devoid of any thought process. Poor thing..</p>
              <p>Swallow
               this statement down your stinky and grubby throat - your English is mediocre at best; coupled
               with presumably, your wonderful Chinese, I think you'd better STFU lest
               you corrupt others with your waffle.</p>

              <p>Think Samuel  Lee made a good point about English not being Singapore's language; it is the international language that we adopted to survive. English is the dominant language because of the pre-eminence of the west, led initially by England which started the industrial revolution. Western culture (led by USA) thus dominated the world.</p>
              <p>At the same period, over centuries, the Chinese were massacred by the Manchus, then by the Japanese and bullied by the west. The sufferings and spiritual torment endured by the Chinese people, the scale and intensity of which the west, USA and Europe, have probably never experienced. Only the Jews have ever endured sufferings on this massive scale. Those repeated invasions and massacres (including destruction of literature etc) wiped out progress in many areas the Chinese made over thousands of years.</p>
              <p>Chinese, no matter what passports they hold, are still "hua xia min zu". The westerners will never see a Chinese (even if he speaks Queen's English) as one of them. In their eyes, a Chinese will always be a Chink, even if he kisses the American ass everyday.</p>
              <p>I remember,after so many years, what my primary school Chinese teacher once said to us in class (that was when China was still relatively backward):- "the whole world may look down on the Chinese, but you can't, because you too are Chinese."</p>

              <p>For that, they should stick their mother tongue like Malay or Tamil. In the case that they are truly PR / Citizens from US / UK, then they are ought to love English. You did not read my full post correctly!!!</p>

              <p>for once i hold my speech.</p>
              <p>becos i thought knowledge come with grey hair and wisdom with old age.</p>
              <p>but until all people had say their want, i too will tell you what i think in this open forum.</p>
              <p>i consider myself a singaporean FIRST, then a chinese. not becos im loyal to sg. but becos i live in this country.</p>
              <p>1. Why we must speak the fucking mandarin. we should speak our own dialect to be truly ourself, not influence by other language. Mandarin is derived from the north china speech. and our ancestor dun usually come from there yes? mine is not btw.</p>
              <p>2. i prefer english only. becos that is what make singapore work right now, i dun live in the past and think about what if PAP did not reign, mandarin is made the sole official langauge in sg something like that..</p>
              <p>3. like someone say, where you wanna trace your root? you can trace it all the way to Adam( the first man) or monkey if you wanted. spare me the crap.</p>
              <p>4. talk about in the 1800 1900 years, many country bullied china. yes. that is the harsh true. it is political game among the country. so when all these country look down on chinese on the whole, please know that that is their problem. not the chinese problem.as a person, u need to live up to your own conviction, not becos of you skin color can bring your any advantage in life or not. but if you think your skin color inherit certain superiority against the other race, it is your thinking and choice. but we all know that skin color dun mean a thing dun we?</p>

              <p>for once i hold my speech.</p>
              <p>becos i thought knowledge come with grey hair and wisdom
              with old age.</p>
              <p>but until all people had say their want, i too will tell you
              what i think in this open forum.</p>
              <p>i consider myself a singaporean FIRST, then a chinese. not becos
              im loyal to sg. but becos i live in this country.</p>
              <p>1. Why we must speak the fucking mandarin. we should
              speak our own dialect to be truly ourself, not influence by
              other language. Mandarin is derived from the north china speech.
              and our ancestor dun usually come from there yes? mine is not
              btw.</p>
              <p>2. i prefer english only. becos that is what make singapore work
              right now, i dun live in the past and think about what if PAP did
              not reign, mandarin is made the sole official langauge in sg
              something like that..</p>
              <p>3. like someone say, where you wanna trace your root? you can
              trace it all the way to Adam( the first man) or monkey if you
              wanted. spare me the crap.</p>
              <p>4. talk about in the 1800 1900 years, many country bullied
              china. yes. that is the harsh true. it is political game among the
              country. so when all these country look down on chinese on the
              whole, please know that that is their problem. not the chinese
              problem.as a person, u need to live up to your own conviction, not
              becos of you skin color can bring your any advantage in life or
              not. but if you think your skin color inherit certain superiority
              against the other race, it is your thinking and choice. but we all
              know that skin color dun mean a thing dun we?</p>

              <p>Hello there.</p>
              <p>I understand your points and where you are coming from but I was thinking from another perspective and I hope you do hear me out.</p>
              <p>It is perfectly fine to push for the preservation of the culture and lifestyle of an ethnic background. Absolutely nothing wrong with acknowledging one's historical roots and embracing it. To each his own. Nevertheless, how do we go forward from now? The modern society is getting more homogeneous in terms of the ethnic composition of its community. Globalization. A pre-requisite to the progression of the country, economy and its people relative to rest of the world. Can you deny it? Do you not want it? Do anyone not want it? A system of mutual consensus, tolerance and understanding is much needed to avoid conflicts arising from the differences of each ethnics/race/religion. The world is indeed not in its equilibrium state yet but mankind is still trying, or at least I do hope so.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a perfect example of the modern society. Indeed, the Chinese race makes up the majority of its population. But does that mean a single dominant race, regardless of what race, is the catalyst to a state of equilibrium? Will it be efficient and effective in the long run?</p>
              <p>What is the basis of language? Communication. The world would not mind, if they can understand Mandarin/chinese langauge as you communicate it. But the world is not Chinese. Singapore is not Chinese. For all your heart's content, embrace your language, and I applaud your passion for that, but do not impose it onto the world outside yourself. As much as you hate it, the world has settled for English to be the dominant language. Singapore, very much wanting to be part of the global set up, would have to follow suit. It is the only way forward. However, it is important to note that dominance here do not equal diminishing of the other languages. So for all the Chinese that one would want to speak, English has to be the dominant language in his/her life, else, it will be difficult for them to progress. On another note, living in a multi-racial country, despite the non-equal ethnic proportion, how do one live harmoniously with his/her neighbour who is of a different ethnicity  without a common and mutual basis of communication?</p>
              <p>In every type of relationship, communication is an important factor that has to be established. You are one person, living in a complex society connected to everyone else by relationships of any nature. How do you establish an efficient state of equilibrium for yourself?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regards.</p>
