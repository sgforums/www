Sports shoes, I also use insoles. I tend to buy shoes a little tighter so that my feet don't rub so much and get blister. I make the shoe grip my feet instead. I have what I call - lazy feet syndrome.<br>I think its not because I have slim feet. I just have small feet. Nowadays the common size is 7. I am about 5.5. its not easy to find shoes that my a size 5 feet look good. The sad thing is I am 1.64m tall. So the small feet has to support quite a bit of weight, plus I had sprained my knees and ankle and so I really need good and steady shoes.<br><br></div>

I tend to buy shoes a little tighter so that my feet don't rub so much and get blister. I make the shoe grip my feet instead. I have what I call - lazy feet syndrome.<br>I think its not because I have slim feet. I just have small feet. Nowadays the common size is 7. I am about 5.5. its not easy to find shoes that my a size 5 feet look good. The sad thing is I am 1.64m tall. So the small feet has to support quite a bit of weight, plus I had sprained my knees and ankle and so I really need good and steady shoes.<br><br></div></blockquote>nah.. the insole that i m referring is not for sport soles.. are for open toe shoes..<br><br>actually ur size &amp; height is abt same as me.. sometimes i wore size 4 to size 6 shoes.. varies between brands..</div>

I can get into size 4 for certain brand. Need size 6 for other brands. Mostly get size 5 and hope it works.<br>Can go crazy when buying shoes cause the sales person not too happy to bring so many pairs and only want to buy 1 pair.. but the size varies so much...<br></div>
