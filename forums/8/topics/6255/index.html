            <div class='col-md body'>Proof that Santa don't exist<br><br>There are approximately two billion children (persons under 1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> in the world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million (according to the population reference bureau). At an average (census) rate of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, presuming there is at least one good child in each. Santa has about 31 hours of Christmas to work with, thanks to the different time zones and the rotation of the earth, assuming east to west (which seems logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per second. This is to say that for each Christian household with a good child, Santa has around 1/1000th of a second to park the sleigh, hop out, jump down the chimney, fill the stockings, distribute the remaining presents under the tree, eat whatever snacks have been left for him, get back up the chimney, jump into the sleigh and get onto the next house. Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed around the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will accept for the purposes of our calculations), we are not talking about 0.78 miles per household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting bathroom stops or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per second--3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the fastest man made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles per hour. The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. Assuming that each child gets nothing more than a medium sized LEGO set (two pounds), the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not counting Santa himself. On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even granting that "flying reindeer can pull 10 times the normal amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them---Santa would need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the weight of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch). A mass of nearly 600,000 tons travelling at 650 miles per second creates enormous air resistance - this would heat up the reindeer in the same fashion as a spacecraft re-entering the earth's atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer would absorb 14.3 quintillion joules of energy per second each. In short, they would burst into flames almost instantaneously, exposing the reindeer behind them and creating deafening sonic booms in their wake. The entire reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of a second, or right about the time Santa reaches the fifth house on his trip. Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating from a dead stop to 650 m.p.s. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to acceleration forces of 17,000 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems ludicrously slim considering all the high calorie snacks he must have consumed over the years) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing him to a quivering blob of pink goo. Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now.<br>MERRY CHISTMAS!!!<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Three Little Pigs<br><br>Politically Correct Three Little Pigs<br><br>Once there were 3 little pigs who lived together<br>in mutual respect and in harmony with their<br>environment. Using materials that were indigenous<br>to the area they each built a beautiful house. One<br>pig built a house of straw, one a house of sticks,<br>and one a house of dung, clay and creeper vines<br>shaped into bricks and baked in a small kiln. When<br>they were finished, the pigs were satisfied with<br>their work and settled back to live in peace and<br>self-determination. But their idyll was soon<br>shattered. One day, along came a big, bad wolf<br>with expansionist ideas. He saw the pigs and grew<br>very hungry in both a physical and ideological<br>sense. When the pigs saw the wolf, they ran into<br>the house of straw. The wolf ran up to the house<br>and banged on the door, shouting, 'Little pigs,<br>little pigs, let me in!'<br>The pigs shouted back, 'Your gunboat tactics hold<br>no fear for pigs defending their homes and<br>culture.'<br>But the wolf wasn't to be denied what he thought<br>was his manifest destiny. So he huffed and puffed<br>and blew down thehouse of straw. The frightened<br>pigs ran to the house of sticks, with the wolf in<br>hot pursuit. Where the house had stood, other<br>wolves bought up the land and started a banana<br>plantation. At the house of sticks, the wolf<br>again banged on the door and shouted, 'Little,<br>pigs, little pigs, let me in!'<br>The pigs shouted back, 'Go to hell, you<br>carnivorous, imperialistic oppressor!'<br>At this the wolf huffed and puffed and blew down<br>the house of sticks. The pigs ran to the house of<br>bricks, with the wolf close at their heels. Where<br>the house of sticks hadstood, other wolves built a<br>time-share condo resort complex for vacationing<br>wolves, with each unit a fibreglass reconstruction<br>of the house of sticks, as well as native curio<br>shops, snorkelling and dolphin shows. At the<br>house of bricks, the wolf again banged on the door<br>and shouted, 'Little pigs, little pigs, let me<br>in!'<br>This time in response, the pigs sang songs of<br>solidarity and wrote letters of protest to the<br>United Nations. By now the wolf was getting angry<br>at the pigs' refusal to see the situation from the<br>carnivore's point of view. So he huffed and<br>puffed, and huffed and puffed, then grabbed his<br>chest and fell over dead from a massive heart<br>attack brought on from eating too many fatty<br>foods. The three little pigs rejoiced that<br>justice had triumphed and did a little dance<br>around the corpse of the wolf. Their next step was<br>to liberate their homeland. They gathered together<br>a band of other pigs who had been forced off their<br>lands. This new brigade of porcinistas attacked<br>the resort complex with machine-guns and rocket<br>launchers and slaughtered the cruel wolf<br>oppressors, sending a clear signal to the rest of<br>the hemisphere not to meddle in their internal<br>affairs. Then the pigs set up a model socialist<br>democracy with free education, universal health<br>care and affordable housing for everyone.<br>{My note: well it is a fairy tale after all.}<br><br>Please note: The wolf in this story was a<br>metaphorical construct. No actual wolves were<br>harmed in the writing of the story.<br><br>------------------<br>To luf someone is nothing, to be luf by someone is something, to be luf by the one you luf is everything.....</div>
