            <div class='col-md body'>Chatline companies may be hiring women to befriend callers and keep them on the line<br><br><blockquote>By Joann Tan and Deborah Koh</blockquote>THAT friendly female speaking to you on a telephone chatline may not be a fellow user looking for a friend, but a woman hired to chat you up.<br><br>Three chatline companies appear to be employing staff to do this, The Straits Times has discovered.<br><br>These 'telephone operators' have been told to pretend to befriend the caller and keep him on the line for as long as they can.<br><br>Depending on the company, a caller can be charged from 50 to 90 cents for each minute he chats. Some users of the lines have monthly bills that run into hundreds of dollars.<br><br>This is how it works: A caller uses the line to get in touch with someone, generally of the opposite sex. He leaves a voice message giving some information about himself, such as his name, age and hobbies.<br><br>A hired telephone operator who uses the line keys in her user identification number, given by the company, to listen to the messages left by male callers.<br><br>After selecting a man to chat with, she engages in a conversation via voice messages. Both are on the line at the same time, but they are not allowed to speak directly to each other.<br><br>The operators earn about eight to 10 cents for each message the man leaves.<br><br>Three companies have been advertising for female telephone operators in the newspapers over the last two weeks.<br><br>When The Straits Times contacted them, it got through to only one, Voice Response Technology, and it denied it was hiring female operators and declined to comment further.<br><br>A director of several chatline companies, who wanted to be known only as Mr Lee, said that some companies hire operators due to the shortage of female callers.<br><br>'Male callers usually outnumber female callers,' he said. 'So to cope, the companies hire women to chat with the men.'<br><br>Several chatline companies said that they are aware of the situation, but declined to provide more details.<br><br>The president of the Audiotex Service Providers Association (Aspa), Mr Samuel Lim, said there is no rule prohibiting chatline companies from hiring female operators.<br><br>The association was set up to regulate the industry and enforce guidelines, censoring lewd and sexually suggestive messages and determining callers are at least 18 years old.<br><br>But only four companies in the industry of about 10 players belong to the association.<br><br>The three regulatory bodies - Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), Media Development Authority (MDA) and SingTel, each of which has a hand in overseeing various aspects of the audiotex service - also said there are no clear regulations on the hiring of female operators.<br><br>IDA only issues licences that regulate the 'technical aspects' of such services, while SingTel is the billing agent for the companies which provide the 1900 telephone services.<br><br>MDA regulates the content of chatlines. It disallows offensive material and people offering sexual services, among other things.<br><br>In an e-mail response, the executive director of the Consumers Association of Singapore (Case), Mr Seah Seng Choon, advised chatline users to 'exercise caution' when making use of such a service.<br><br>Last year, Case received 14 complaints about companies offering 1900 services. Most involved information presented in a misleading manner in their advertisements. The majority were made against chatline services.<br><br>Technician Peter Kong, 21, who spends up to $900 a month on chatlines, was disappointed to learn he may be chatting up a phone operator.<br><br>'I don't want someone who is paid to talk to me,' he said. 'I'm looking for real friends.'</div>
