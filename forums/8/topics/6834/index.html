            <div class='col-md body'>Grace:<br><br>Actually, I think that most of the replies that you are going to get would be that they dun mind. For to me, I never thought of such criterias in a marriage, it is not so possible to guage, but I rather marry because I love her, rather than because she is more capable or less capable than me. If that was the case, would we not be like looking for a business partner in life? Meaning it is either that you dominate the business because the partner is not as capable, or you rely on the partner because he/she is more capable? Such is not the same in love and marriage. What would you choose then?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>why do you bother about marrying "up" or "down"?<br><br>or let me put it in another way: would it bother you?<br><br>i'm no great romantic, but methinks if it bothers you whether you are marrying "up" or "down", you should be seriously considering whether you want to use a helicopter as a wedding vehicle..<br><br>to put the jest aside, if you really love the one whom you are going to marry, you shouldn't worry about status or abilities. What you should think about though, is whether she will mind the tags that others put on the relationship (e.g. she's marrying someone with a better status or she's marrying someone with a lower status). at the same time, if you don't mind what the gossips and the kaypohs say, i think you should not be worried about this issue.<br><br>if you do mind, but there seems to be no way you can escape the tags in our local society, try going overseas.<br><br>archer<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>thks guys/gals for your responses.<br><br>personally i don't believe that love is the only thing that matters in a relationship.<br><br>one can't live on love alone. for those who say if u love somebody u would accept anything abt that person....right...but can you accept what society has to say abt that?<br><br>you can profess your 100% love but can your love withstand the daily battering by family,friends, colleagues, biz associates, accquantances (whether well meaning or not?)<br><br>[further, if u really love a person, would u put her/him in such a unpleasant situation? of being snobbed for not being rich/intelligent etc ?]<br><br></div>
