Am not going to face those again.</div></blockquote>I believe it was because some dude started sticking up our MRT that the government moved in on gum chewing.<br><br>Logical solution? Prehaps, but it speaks a lot into the mentality of our system and how we refuse to take personal responsibility and instead hand these responsibilities over to the system to do whatever it wants to solve it.<br><br>The reason why we can now buy gum in pharmacies is because the Yanks made a big deal about it and civil liberities while we were trying to make the FTA with them, the selling of gum in pharmacies was an attempt to applease the Yanks by following the idea of allowing gum in letter, but not in law.<br><br>But if you look at the whole issue, I think giving up even such a little right to have gum sold and chewed here is disturbing, the way it could simply be implemented and the way the populace simply took it lying down. Sure it's just gum now, but does it set the standard for how to deal with more important things in the future?<br><br>Or prehaps when the next time we complain that Singapore is too boring or controlled, maybe we have to realize that the attitude of "hey i don't like this/ we got a problem let's choose the simplest way out of it by letting the system take care of it" is a large part of it.<br><br>And of course, it was a ham-fisted way of dealing with the gum issue. I for one find it ridiculus- yes our streets are cleaner but at what cost? The mentality of the people who do such inconsiderate acts have not changed, just the means of doing so have.</div>
