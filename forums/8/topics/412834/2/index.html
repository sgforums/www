              <p>  Aiyah drink water before and after you jog lar . When jogging don't drink water will die meh ? How you survive your ns ? Wait untill you have to walk or run 8km without any water to drink during the run then you know . And if you really don't drink water while jogging will die , then jog near or around area with petrol kiosk lor . Then when thirsty you can buy water from inside to drink , throw then continue to jog .</p>
              <p>   Buy hydration belt might as well wear the army sbo with 2 full water bottle . Got cheap altenative don't want , want to waste money . Simple problem , complicated answer .</p>

              <p>I seriously don't understand this thread.</p>
              <p>What is seriously so frustrating about running with an empty water bottle? I would think that most runners would be happy to run without having to hold a 1kg weight in the hand that sloshes around in the bottle.</p>
              <p>I'm a regular runner, and personally, 1 liter is a lot. I run with my hydration belt (about 500ml only) only for runs over 10 km. Even for 21km runs, I usually end up not finishing my water during the run. Perhaps the fact that I do water parade 30 minutes before the run has something to do with it.</p>
              <p>If you somehow find that 1 liter is not enough, find ways to resupply. One fella I know locks his water bottle in his post box, and rehydrates there every 8km he runs.</p>
              <p>In fact you can just bring a $2 note with you in your pants pocket, and buy a bottle of mineral water at a petrol station if your water is not enough. If you want to save the earth.... use the tap in the petrol station toilet! If you've been in the army, you should no longer be squemish about drinking tap water from a toilet.</p>
              <p>Shucks man, there are 1001 things to be frustrated about when it comes to running, and running with a finished water bottle is somewhere on the bottom of the list.</p>

              <p>looks like none of the people here feels the same way haha..</p>
              <p>fudgester.. i am impressed by your "dry" 21km runs.. i know of older friends who drink like mad throughout a marathon... guess they can adopt your method..</p>
              <p>it is not just running.. i find it irritating to carry a volume of air in my school bag too</p>

              <p>It is not considered a 'dry' run if you are already well-hydrated to begin with.</p>
              <p>Just water parade about 30-45 minutes before an extended run, and you'll find that you can last a long time without further rehydration. When you're running, control your water intake to small, regular amounts (say, one mouthful every few minutes). Simply put, your body can absorb small, regular doses of water much better than a whole torrent at one go. </p>
              <p>I'm not telling you to ration your water; I'm telling you to use it more efficiently.</p>
              <p>And seriously, I still find it very difficult to understand why it is easier for you to carry one liter of water than one liter of air. I can imagine that that the water in that bottle of yours will slosh around uncontrollably as you run - how is that any easier than running with an empty bottle?</p>
              <p>And as for your backpack..... just get a backpack with compression straps.</p>
              <p>There. Just think simply, and your problems become really trivial.</p>

              <p>Maybe.. its about aerodynamics ? lol</p>
              <p>How the empty bottle flaps around .. the sudden realisation that the weight ratio is no longer balanced as it is now empty.. which makes turning at fast speed with an empty bottle with drag potentially dangerous and catastrophic ah.</p>
