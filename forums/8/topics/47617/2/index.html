            <div class='col-md body'>The green tree snake is totally harmelss... though there's another gree viper that looks a lot like it... that can kill u... dunno if got here a not..<br><br>For the green crested lizard, I used to hunt them in the old days of 1997-1998 with my catapult... I and my friend killed so many until the local park population took months to recover... I remember there were so many that in one single day we captured or killed over 8 of them within 3 hours.<br><br>We have several types of ammo we used to hunt them which we fired from our catapults.<br><br>"Stun" ammo, which consist of very small rocks or nuts when you want to stun the lizard and not kill it (I managed to knock one out cold with a nut from below by firing through a leaf, hitting the jaw and it survived).<br><br>"Standard" ammo which is the one most commonly used and consist of medium sized stones.<br><br>"Penetrator" stones which are very sharp that we use when we are in close range and want to disable the lizard with a single shot causing internal damage.<br><br>"Crush" extra-sized ammo which has a lesser chance of penetration but causes horrific wounds over a large area that can only be used at almost point blank range as they are heavy to shoot.<br><br>And finally, "Match-grade" ammo, the rarest of stones you find which are just of the right weight and are round, meaning that you get the most accucrate shots with them, best for sniping them down. Damage caused is medium.<br><br>They are also remarkably resilent... unless you score a critical hit them on the head or neck, they will be able to survive powerful stone impacts and can even run after you have knocked them 40 feet off a tree. I remember blasting one off a bush from a range of five feet with sharp penetrator rock ammo. The stone penetrated it's gut through and through and blasted out the other side to splatter the floor behind. Instead of being killed outright like any other animal you pop with this kind of damage, the lizard fell off, recovered, and proceeded to run away from us with a good portion of it's guts trailing behind from a gaping wound. And it didn't show any sign of slowing down or pain, even up to half-an hour after the apparent mortal wound.<br><br>The ends of their tails tend to come off if you grip them and handle them roughly... and most of them are kinda tame when you grab them, though they are kinda spindy and I have been bitten by one before, though not hard enuff the break the skin.<br><br>Needless to say, the hunting season soon came to an end when the lizards got scarcer after losing nearly 30 of their number, and smarter. Yes, children can be really cruel when they are young, they have a need to go out to physically interact with their subjects instead of observing them.<br><br>So much for my war stories.</div>

Being cold blooded does not mean their blood is cold, it simply means that unlike us endotherms, they have an inability to control their body temperature. They aren't any more colder then your ambient air temperture, and if you grab them on a hot day while they are basking, you'll find them pretty warm. Their level of activity is depedent on their body temperature, which is regulated via shading or basking in the sun. Hence they are easier to catch in the morning because they are sluggish, and in the afternoon, it makes for a more challanging but exciting hunt.</div>
