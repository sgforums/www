            <div class='col-md body'><br>I noticed that those who solicit donations on behalf of this organisation tend to approach people who are eating. They claim that they are a charity and ask for a donation of $10 but they will finish their talk with "any amount also can".<br><br>Today in sch, I saw a grp of them soliciting donations from the students. One of them asked me for $10 and I politely decline as I have donated to them 3 weeks ago. She curtly replied "donating once means nothing. Donate again." She refused to go away untill I repeated myself 3 times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Just to ask you guys out there, has anybody from the above organisation approached you for donations?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Reminds me of an incident I experienced some time ago.<br><br>Once I was waiting for a friend of mine at an MRT station to pass him something. A girl came up to me to buy several donation tickets worth a total of $10 for some charity which I had never heard of.<br><br>I told her politely that I was a still studying, and that I didn't have $10 to spare, though I could spare $2 for a single ticket. She retorted sarcastically, 'Eh hello... why are you so selfish? You have clothes to wear, food to eat... you can't even spare $10 for charity....'<br><br>At this juncture I got so pissed off that I blasted at her: 'Eh hello... what is your blardy problem?!?!?! I have $25,000 in loans... you want to pay all that for me?!?!?! I have to work part-time to pay off my basic needs.... you want to buy lunch for me?!?! Can you be freakin' glad that I'm at least buying a freakin' donation ticket from you?!?!?!'<br><br>She was so scared that she was shaking very badly when she took my $2 and gave me a donation ticket. I gave her the hardest glare I could muster and walked away from her.<br><br>Part of me felt sorry for that girl... but hell, you want to urge others to be charitable, the least you can do is to not insult them.</div>
