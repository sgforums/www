            <div class='col-md body'>A female friend once told me that one reason why those loose women go for married men is because of their huge egos..<br><br>You see, women have even bigger egos than men.. Their ego depend on their looks and their level of attractiveness.. That's why women are so desperate to get men to pay attention to them.. Their ego depend on male attention..<br><br>Their egos are stroked each time they get a man to look at them.. therefore, their excuses of having a wardrobe full of clothes and dozen shoes justify just that.. If they can attract a MARRIED man to pay attention to them, it's seen as a HUGE boost to their little egos.. They think, "wah, I'm so attractive that even a MARRIED man can forget his wife and pay attention to me instead.. Yay, I am so "good"<br><br>So there, you've got the reason.. She's only interested in boosting her own fragile ego.. Women like to have what they cannot have.. If a man is already taken, then they will try extra hard to get him.. That's how stupid those women are..<br><br>Of course, when caught and trapped like a rat, most of these home-wreckers like to play the innocent little girl who didn't do anything wrong and push the entire blame on the man..

            <div class='col-md body'>Caramon, I must say your posts have been keeping me entertained.  You've obviously got plenty of issues with the world around you, particularly women-issues, and I'm glad you have the guts to voice them out.  Your approach does not appear to be gaining you points on the popularity poll in this forum though, but I guess popularity is not on your agenda - another good thing in my opinion.<br><br>I think what you're trying to say in this post is that women are vain (huge ego being more commonly associated with men).  They like to feel desirable, and they're all the more desirable when it is with off-limits men.  Assuming that to be the gospel truth, how does that piece into the reverse phenomenon of married men keeping mistresses?  Do men not have a propensity to keep mistresses?  Or are you saying that it is the women who seduce these hapless men?  Are the 2 phenomena linked?  Which came first - the chicken or the egg?</div>
