I didnt blame any men for my problem. and i had admitted the problem lies on me ALONE. my fear, my insecurity. I never find fault in men. if you are offended by it and intend to hurt me with your post, just because i said i lost trust in man ( which i actually mean HUMAN BEING) go ahead.

I am not saying to you to be totally free and dwell in carefree abandon. Yes, you have thie nagging doubts at the back of your head. Everyone has such doubts about relationships, be it past trauma, troubles etc..<br><br>the only way is to learn.. the way to learn, i hope for you to find someone who can really show you that not all men are 'like wat u said'. there will be a time when you will learn that yes, someone out there will cherish you and love you very much.<br><br>you will gain that love someday.<br><br>don't be afraid to look for it..</div>
