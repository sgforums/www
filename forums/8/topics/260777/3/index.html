            <div class='col-md body'>My friend always say that Sg girls is "Gua Qi Lai Mai". Which I find sorta true.<br><br>Whenever I travel to countries like China, Vietnam or even Malaysia, I find the girls there more approachable and possess more "wifey" qualities.  Sure, they don't earn nearly as much but then if I wanted to find a partner becoz of their pay-cheque then a gay partner would be better.<br><br>In SG, the girls are " Don't approach me unless you are here to give me a LV bag and driving me home in that big car of yours." and/or "I don't cook for you, wash your clothes or look after you coz I am so busy earning my $$$."<br><br>Well, being independent and financially stable is all well and great for me but some having "wifey" qualities is even better.<br><br>I am not saying Sg women are totally lousy wives but then if you do travel abit around the region you know what I am saying when I make the comparison.<br><br>Still, I do hope to find a Sg gal as my wife in future.</div>

Dont mean that...<br>It is just that I have a mentality on not to be so serious in chit chat...<br>Ok serious now :<br>To me, writing one's opinion in these thread is a waste of time. Coz, there is no right and wrong. It just depends on which side you are in.<br>But however, I can tell u that I have many guy friends that are approaching 30 and most of them are not in relationship. Most of them are waiting for poissom love. I do not know the future but as time pass and they are very unlucky, they may probably result in foreign... So, the main reason is not Singapore girls are too picky or too career minded.<br>But for me, there are many other things to achieve in life other than love. If there is one that I really treasure, I will treasure it. But if there is no, then never mind lor... I have other things in life to love... &gt;&lt; But probably, in future, I may feel that without a kid will be a regret for me... But I can confirm to myself that with a life partner that lost love with each other will be a sure regret for me...<br></div>

A 21 year old "xiao di di" is not suitable to join this forum on discussing whether Singapore women too picky or too career-minded because he is too young and do not understand and know such important "once in a lifetime" kind of issue.  I am 8 years old older than a 21 year old who does not  even give respect to an "elder sister".   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   Why have such a wicked sense of humour especially to older spinisters in Singapore like me?<br><br>People who are too much younger have their own social circle in school, not necessary to befriend friends much older with another agenda in mind , thinking that it is funny to create a joke out an issue which the older adults have attached importance due to age.  Time flies, age and youth just lose its radiance after some time.  It seems that people when younger do not understand till they are older themselves.  Using other situations to make fun- is this how some people in this world like to behave and then just laugh out of it on other fellow humans' situations?<br><br></div></blockquote>I can't agree more with you. That's why I don't treat the kid's comments seriously.
