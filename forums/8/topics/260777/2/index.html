            <div class='col-md body'>Young boys who sound "childish and immature" should stop sprouting rubbish and concentrate on their studies and/or how to enhance their future.  A 21 year old "xiao di di" is not suitable to join this forum on discussing whether Singapore women too picky or too career-minded because he is too young and do not understand and know such important "once in a lifetime" kind of issue.  I am 8 years old older than a 21 year old who does not  even give respect to an "elder sister".   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">   Why have such a wicked sense of humour especially to older spinisters in Singapore like me?<br><br>People who are too much younger have their own social circle in school, not necessary to befriend friends much older with another agenda in mind , thinking that it is funny to create a joke out an issue which the older adults have attached importance due to age.  Time flies, age and youth just lose its radiance after some time.  It seems that people when younger do not understand till they are older themselves.  Using other situations to make fun- is this how some people in this world like to behave and then just laugh out of it on other fellow humans' situations?<br><br></div>
