Which I find sorta true.<br><br>Whenever I travel to countries like China, Vietnam or even Malaysia, I find the girls there more approachable and possess more "wifey" qualities.  Sure, they don't earn nearly as much but then if I wanted to find a partner becoz of their pay-cheque then a gay partner would be better.<br><br>In SG, the girls are " Don't approach me unless you are here to give me a LV bag and driving me home in that big car of yours." and/or "I don't cook for you, wash your clothes or look after you coz I am so busy earning my $$$."<br><br>Well, being independent and financially stable is all well and great for me but some having "wifey" qualities is even better.<br><br>I am not saying Sg women are totally lousy wives but then if you do travel abit around the region you know what I am saying when I make the comparison.<br><br>Still, I do hope to find a Sg gal as my wife in future.</div></blockquote>Yes - you want the subservient ones?<br><br>As for me - it ain't about LV bags - it is all about can you match my assets - if not , you are a liability. Why should I end up losing half of my hard work to a guy who has nothing?<br><br>That goes for all guys - be it ang moh or sg guys.<br><br></div>

This is a sweeping statement.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShutterBug:</div><div class="quote_body">And whether the parents lives with them or not, is a matter of 'asking', or wanting them to. IF they ask or insists, the parents will gladly do so. Problem is, I see that most young couples want to prove something - whether they can make it on their own...<br><br>It's good if they can, but will be hell for the children when they cannot and get screwed up financially and professionally..<br><br>Hokkien says; "Kiang chu ho... mai kay-kiang.."<br>Translation: If you are smart, good for you. But if you pretend to be, good luck.<br><br></div></blockquote>It is not easy to live with in-laws. Not all in-laws want to live with kids. It all depends.<br>Grandparents look after kids but don't mean they will want to teach the kids.<br><br>Even if they teach, does not mean they are teaching things that you wish the kids to learn.<br><br>Even if they are willing to take care of the kids, while they are staying on their own or with another of their children home, it does not mean that the other children or their spouse want to put up with your kids.<br><br>And people who ask their parents or in-law to take care of their kids, should know how to be grateful to all the people and their sacrifice made just to accommodate their kids.<br><br>Its not so easy my friend.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.  OK here's my take.<br><br>Many SG guys I know want to act and spend like rich men, a, even if they are not rich or capable.  They crave status and recognition from their peers/family, are typically arrogant and their material goals outnumber their non-material goals.  Their views on the roles of male and female tend to be very rigid and old-fashioned.  They can be very shallow, and overly concerned about how their partner's appearance / status will affect their own image.  These sorts of men want their girl to look good at all times, yet they themselves don't bother to dress up, and their all-whine-no-action tendencies make them very unattractive.  They can also get picky about a girl's body size and shape.. they enjoy passing judgement and trading bitchy tidbits on how this girl or that girl looks, even if they aren't very good looking themselves!  It's almost a hobby for them.  Face and body-wise, they like the typical "kawaii xiao mei mei" types (so cute) as opposed to the womanly type (their usual comment : ee-yer / dunno leh).  They are slow to grow up and indecisive.  They may even have lower libido than their girl because of their work stress.  As a fellow forumer said here, they make good husbands, bad lovers.<br><br>Yet on the other end, many young SG girls I know want to act like princesses, and be wooed, lavished upon with gifts their bfs can't afford, and demand princess treatment, even if they themselves don't actually have much to show for.  They are pampered, think they're very smart (regardless of whether they really are or not) and their goals can be shockingly material based even though they claim otherwise.  They want the best of both worlds - rich boyfriend who can provide for them, make time for them in their busy schedule, but must also be sensitive, caring, funny, tall (not necessarily handsome), popular, charming, witty, intelligent, atheletic............ u get the picture.  They are a big mystery - one moment they dream of being taitais and be "taken care of" by their man, the next moment they want to be strong career women types and decide that that nice unsuspecting guy opening the door for them is trying to be a chauvanistic b*stard.  The poor guy who's trying to woo them is left confused, angry and eventually gives up because he thinks she's too hard to please.  The thing is she can't decide what she wants and doesn't understand that she has to be clear-cut with guys.  Good wives eventually, but bad girlfriends to start with.<br><br>Of course there are many expections to the above, too, but alas they often slip past the radar because many people tend to look in the wrong places for love...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
