            <div class='col-md body'>ya, after many years it can get tough. no need many yrs, some ppl after a few mths onli very sian. think human beings aren't meant to just stick to one person all their lives. they have certain needs that have to be fulfilled. they crave the sparks and the attention and the rush and the excitement all over again. they feel if they settle down and get married then they will be imprisoned forever. they wonder if this is the right person for them. they have roving eyes because they are attracted to different ppl and feel good if these ppl are attracted to them.<br><br>from what i've learnt, even the best of r'ships can break up this way, due to the sparks not being there anymore. but the thing is, even if these ppl take a break from each other, they usu end up together again. there's something abt all the years they've been thru that makes them either guilty abt breaking up (their r'ship is like a hard habit to break cos they've gotten so used to each other) or makes them think they've gone thru too much with each other to just break up "for no really good reason". they're too comfortable with one another and going with someone else, tho exciting, is also full of uncertainty and some ppl will not want to risk that kind of uncertainty even for a new r'ship with more sparks in it.<br><br>maybe it all comes down to the character of the person. do you value security over excitement? you do know of course that sparks will likely end with the new person as well. that's why some ppl never settle down. they just want the thrill of a new love. but for others, they value stability over much else. my fren told me something that i thot was quite true. now he said this so long ago i dun really recall his exact words anymore. but he said that we have to make ourselves believe in the importance of certain principles. and the longevity of the r'ship will depend on how much you come to hold on to these principles.<br><br>take for example, the quality of "faithfulness". now if you really believe in the importance of this principle, if you think it defines the kind of person you are or you've thought long and hard and you know it's an important trait for you, or maybe you've been hurt before and you know how important it is being true to your partner, then belief in such a principle is what will carry you thru the r'ship. maybe it's a psychological thing. i don't know. but believing in something, holding on to certain principles is often a way of counter-acting certain natural tendencies or inclinations you may have (e.g. the natural disposition to want to feel attractive to other ppl and so to flirt with other ppl, or the tendency of some ppl to want to sleep around). now only if you tell yourself that you value not sleeping ard, will that act as a means of preventing yourself from doing it even if the opportunity arises. you have to, in a word, be in love with your own ideals.<br>so if you value stability in a r'ship, you may well find yourself actually liking what you have now and cherishing it even tho you have inclinations to the contrary. it may be a "reason" vs "nature" kind of battle, where having (and actually being proud of having) the "right" principles triumphs over our baser, natural instinct to stray. and to the extent that you are able to internalise that sense of pride in holding on to certain principles, it then becomes almost second nature (and maybe even instinctual) to choose the principles over your natural desires. we almost have to effect a certain kind of deception (self-deception?) that certain things mean more to us than others. and we have to grow or learn to really believe that. dunno if i make any sense. it's quite late now and the right words are escaping me. but no doubt the urge to have a fling and all that is very real, esp if your current r'ship isn't going too well. a lot of ppl say you should talk things over, but the truth of the matter is, if you've never been that great communicators in the r'ship in the first place, the two of you will not know how to handle this. and so you won't know HOW to talk abt it. even ppl who communicate fine with each other have difficulties. how do you tell your partner after 5-6 yrs that she doesn't turn you on anymore? or that she doesn't do this or that quite the way you wish she would? the pattern of self-reflection and introspection in the r'ship has to be there from the very start and also the willingness to communicate. all that i say tho may be pointless to some. it is like trying to rationalise matters of the heart. and that won't do. but sometimes what rationalising can do is that it can tell you what you're going thru right now, and make you see that having a fling or finding someone else may only be a short term solution.<br><br>and that's why sparks are called "sparks". they aren't supposed to last very long! now if those self-same sparks could ignite a roaring fire, then we've got ourselves something else. someone we can feel warm and snug and cozy with all the days of our lives. but start with the right material, the right kind of wood, the right kind of lighter fluid maybe, the right kind of breeze. and once the sparks are gone, learn to tend the flames. a slow burning fire may be much more satisfying than all the sparks and fireworks in the world. well at least we have to learn to believe in that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm....<br><br>I think when the sparke is gone, it not such a bad thing for some people.<br><br>If you dated someone for a long time, say...3 years like I once did, the spakes is gone by the 2nd year, but then we have then reach a "mature state" where it might be boring but you guys know each other so well already, he will know what I am thinking and I will know what he is thinking.   Which in some state is not a bad thing.  I guess it all depends on what you are looking for in the relationship.  If you are looking for excitement and the sparke is gone, then get out of it.  But if you are looking for a wife that you can share the rest of your life with then it's better to reach that "mature" state.  Of coz it will be great to have both worlds, like my parents.  But think abt your parents...don't you think at times they are boring also? Same thing everyday etc?! But they manage to stay together... =D<br><br>I think the most important thing one must need to know before they enter a relationship is..."why do I want from it?!"<br><br>Just a thot!<br><br>------------------<br>Float like a butterfly...Sting like a bee...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woe betide me. i'm a die-hard romantic and still subscribe to the happy-ever after sunset. i think 'sparks' is too fickle and ambiguous a word. all too often its used as an excuse for bailing out head first of a relationship.<br><br>better to decide who you want to mess around with and who you want to go the full nine yards with. i believe love is something you roll up your sleeves and work at, not some flighty chemistry that comes and goes.<br><br>hmmm?</div>
