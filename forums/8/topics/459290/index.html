              <p>
              </p><p>Dear Michelle,</p>
              <p>There're some things I really want to say to you, to express to you. Aside from simply coming up to you and saying them, there really is no way to tell you how I feel. So I won't. My ideas, due to the poor means of communication words provide, might be misunderstood and cause our relationship to become uncomfortable. So I've decided not to tell you. And I'll compose and publish my letter here.</p>
              <p>I love you. Not in a friendly way, although I think we're great friends. And not in a misplaced affection, puppy-dog way, although I'm sure that's what you'll call it. And it isn't because you're unattainable. I love you, very simple, very truly. You've always been such a wonderful, protective and supportive person to me, you've been with me and been there for me ever since I met you, be it through love, pain or confusion. For that, I'm eternally grateful. I know you think of me as just a friend, and crossing the line's the furthest thing from an option you've ever considered. But with you, I feel that there're emotional things that'll not change, even if our two seperate lives do change on their own. I'm feel a special comfort when I'm with you, I could curl up next to you and fall asleep quite easily. Your faults and unattractive behaviours, they're spicy and real and they make up part of who you are. I love them.</p>
              <p>I know if you see this, it will probably queer our friendship but I can't take this anymore. I couldn't allow another day to go by without getting it out there, because I've never felt this way before, and I like who I'm because of it. If you ever ever see this, and if bringing this to light means we can't hang out anymore, then that hurts me. But I know, I know some part of you is hesitating for a moment, and if there's this moment of hesitation, that means you feel something too. And all I ask is that you not dismiss that, at least not for ten seconds and try to dwell in it.</p>
              <p>Michelle, there're all kinds of love out there, but this is my one and only life. You have no idea how much you've changed it forever and moved me. Without you, I wouldn't even be a fraction of the man I'm today. I would risk this friendship for the chance to take it to the next plateau. Because it's there between you and me, you can't deny that.</p>
              <p>I want to tell you these things. Perhaps someday I'll tell you. Perhaps someday you'll see this, and I'll never know. Regardless of what happens, I want you to know that I love you and I'll be there for you above any other person. I count myself among the luckiest souls in the universe for meeting you.</p>
              <p>Love, </p>
              <p>Ian</p>

              <p>Love is love without regret and pain. But please do not harm other female as your love only to Michelle. Please stay single until Michelle accepted you. Anyway, there are so many Michelle around that are equally loveable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Another option of poem for contemplation</p>
              <pre>I awake each day with a smile
              And greet it with a laugh;
              The world is a treasure to me
              Because of you.
              
              Every time I think of something sad,
              I replace the thought- with you!
              My mind is instantly changed
              And my heart is filled with gladness.
              
              Every breath I take is meant for you,
              I live this life surrounded in joy
              And I bathe in the promise of your love,
              My soul belongs to you.
              
              Each time I see something beautiful
              I want to take it and bring it to you;
              My life has so much meaning now
              All because of you.</pre>

              <p>Good luck bro no offence I can tell you exactly what she will be telling you.</p>
              <p>
              </p><p>First she will reject you by telling you that you're her best friend (obviously trying to brush you away asap) and hope that you will forever be her best friend (pls disappear from my life forever).</p>
              <p>Secondly, she will start to keep a distance away from you (u will soon realise), the gap will become further and further away till no longer contacting each other. If she happens to see you on the streets, she will run before you can even see her.</p>
              <p>I know it harsh but you have successfully landed yourself in the MR NICE GUY category.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p>Once you're in the friend zone aka MR NICE GUY (loser zone) with a girl, there is no chance of getting out of that circle. You think by lending her a crying shoulder, listening to her sorrows, cry with her blah blah blah will eventually make you the one she loves?</p>
              <p>The answer is a straight no. You will only end up in the friend zone and you'll keep wondering and comparing yourself with the guy she eventually ends up with is actually more inferior than you (because the guy knows the diff between friend zone &amp; fvck zone).. he will do whatever it takes not to land into the friend zone but the fvck zone.</p>
              <p>PS: If a girl loves you, it is not even necessary to do anything ie: write this kinda goose bumps school essay love letter, etc.... if she loves you (extremely highly unlikely), you don't even need to ask her to be your girlfriend.. she will be the one trying to hold your hand (lotsa hinting asking u to be the BF) instead of you trying to grab hold of her hand.</p>
              <p>If she does not love you, even if you send her flowers everyday, it'll end up in the trash bin and you will end up on her stalker's list.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              a <a title="Platonic relationship" rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_relationship">platonic relationship</a> where one person
              wishes to enter into a relationship, while the other does not. It
              is generally considered to be an undesirable situation by the
              lovelorn person.
              Once the friend zone is established, it is said to be difficult to
              move beyond that point in a relationship.</p>

              <p>Good luck bro no offence I can tell you exactly what she will be telling you.</p>
              <p>First she will reject you by telling you that you're her best friend (obviously trying to brush you away asap) and hope that you will forever be her best friend (pls disappear from my life forever).</p>
              <p>Secondly, she will start to keep a distance away from you (u will soon realise), the gap will become further and further away till no longer contacting each other. If she happens to see you on the streets, she will run before you can even see her.</p>
              <p>I know it harsh but you have successfully landed yourself in the MR NICE GUY category.</p>
              <p>Once you're in the friend zone aka MR NICE GUY (loser zone) with a girl, there is no chance of getting out of that circle. You think by lending her a crying shoulder, listening to her sorrows, cry with her blah blah blah will eventually make you the one she loves?</p>
              <p>The answer is a straight no. You will only end up in the friend zone and you'll keep wondering and comparing yourself with the guy she eventually ends up with is actually more inferior than you (because the guy knows the diff between friend zone &amp; fvck zone).. he will do whatever it takes not to land into the friend zone but the fvck zone.</p>
              <p>PS: If a girl loves you, it is not even necessary to do anything ie: write this kinda goose bumps school essay love letter, etc.... if she loves you (extremely highly unlikely), you don't even need to ask her to be your girlfriend.. she will be the one trying to hold your hand (lotsa hinting asking u to be the BF) instead of you trying to grab hold of her hand.</p>
              <p>If she does not love you, even if you send her flowers everyday, it'll end up in the trash bin and you will end up on her stalker's list.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>
