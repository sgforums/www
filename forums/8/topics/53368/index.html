            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by abterror:<br>[b]1. Tests have shown that women rate 3% higher in general intelligence than men although their brain size is smaller. Most women act dumb to make their mates look good.</blockquote>Bull.  Spearman's g (general intelligence) is a concept that nobody has been able to satisfactorily measure since 1911.  This 3% figure therefore has no meaning.<br><br><blockquote>2. Women are walking radar detectors, that is why men have difficulty lying to women. Their brains have the ability to integrate and decipher verbal,visual and other signals of body language.</blockquote>Possibly true.  Brain activity is spread more evenly across both cerebral hemispheres in women than in men, so they might process a wider range of information more effectively than men.  Then again, it has been a long time since a woman caught me lying.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>3. Women want lots of sex with the man she loves. Men just want lots of sex.</blockquote>Guys, if you're not getting laid, you're a real loser because nobody loves you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Seriously, sociobiological theories in support of this abound, the most popular of which is that because of the time lag that comes with pregnancy, females are off the scene for much longer than males, and males run about trying to expand the population and perpetuate the species.<br><br>Then again, what with all these touchy-feely New Age sensitive guys about, this claim may not be accurate and all.<br><br><blockquote>4. When men flirt, they will lower their pitch of voice. Women will raise theirs.</blockquote>Oh, squeak to me, baby!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I have absolutely no opinion on this one.  Hmm - this may explain why some of my friends think that I am thick as a brick for having missed it completely when some girl has been trying to flirt with me at the pub.<br><br><blockquote>5. Women talk and think aloud while men do them silently. As a result,men think women talk too much and are nags.</blockquote>Given that women on average tend to have a higher level of verbal ability than men, the first part seems feasible.  The second part can occur for a wide variety of reasons, not least of which being that they are in fact being nagged at.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>6. Women talk about their problems as a way of relieving stress. She wants to be heard, not fixed being offered advice and solutions.</blockquote>True - that is one of the most effective ways of getting women whom I do not like to go away.<br><br><blockquote>7. Speech and words are not a specific brain skill for men. They find it hard to express themselves. That's why they often choose greeting cards with plenty of words inside. That way, there's less space for them to write.</blockquote>Feasible.  See point 5.<br><br><blockquote>8. Women leave men, not because they are unhappy with what he can provide, but because they are emotionally unfulfilled.</blockquote>If I were the sort to name names, I could quite easily dispute this claim.<br><br><blockquote>9. Women uses an average of 20,000 communication words, sounds, and gestures a day. Men only use about 7,000.</blockquote>Again, see point 5.  I take it that grunts do not count.<br><br><blockquote>10. So if a woman is talking to you a lot, she likes you. But if she's not talking, you're in trouble.</blockquote>Probably true.  Then again, point 6 applies here, so being in trouble is really a subjective issue.<br><br><blockquote>11. Men are more thick-skined than women. Literally.Which explains why women have more wrinkles than men. Boys lose<br>their sensitivity to touch by the time they reach puberty. So where does all that sensitivity go? It all goes to just one area.</blockquote>Not entirely true - men and women have different erogenous zones.  Again, since I do not name names, I will not go into detail here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><blockquote>12. If a woman is unhappy in her relationship, she can't concentrate on her work. If a man is unhappy at work, he can't focus on his relationship.</blockquote>Then again, there are women who cannot focus on work under the best of circumstances, and likewise for men and relationships.  Heck, it applies vice versa as well.<br><br><blockquote>13. Men can only do one thing at a time. When they stop their car to read a street directory, they have to turn down the radio.Women's brains are configured for multi-tasking performance. They can talk on the phone,watch the TV and cook at the same time.</blockquote>Yes - unfortunately, women choose to drive, do their makeup and talk on the phone at the same time.<br><br><blockquote>14. Most men get a brain hemorrhage after 20 minutes of clothes shopping.</blockquote>Absolutely true.  The validity of this must never be questioned.<br><br><blockquote>15. When it comes to sex, women need a reason; men need a place.</blockquote>See points 8 and 11.<br><br><blockquote>16. 15% to 20% of men have feminised brains. About 10% of women have masculinised brains. So there are more gays than lesbians in the world.</blockquote>Femininity and masculinity are not necessarily related to sexual orientation.  However, this does explain the increasing pervasiveness of the touchy-feely men described in point 3.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Reguarding to what you type on the forum, well i would say that some are true and some are not. Not all men cannot multi task. Not all men have problems going shopping with their women after 20 mintues. When people say that women lose out in a relationship... they are just referring to her losing her chasity to some dude. But if she was in a serious relationship, women don't lose out much but its their men who suffer a whole lot more.</div>
