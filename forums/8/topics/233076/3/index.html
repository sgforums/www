You say u read those articles, etc. but u dun believe it. So you are saying all the scientist in the world are either corrupted or incompetent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Even Channel Newsasia and TODAY is mentioning about the climate...<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>2007 could be hottest year ever</strong><br>By Sheralyn Tay, TODAY | Posted: 22 January 2007 1527 hrs<br><br>Just when you think the freakish weather has rained itself out, after a hot and sunny weekend, it's time to bring out the raincoats again - with the weatherman predicting thunderstorms for the first part of the week.<br><br>Have the skies gone mad? No, it's just a change in the air pressure over Siberia which - according to Associate Professor Dr David Higgitt from the National University of Singapore - "is driving surges of particularly violent rainstorms" towards Singapore.<br><br>The culprit? It's a toss up between global warming and the El Nino effect - the exact cause is too complicated to pinpoint, said Prof Higgett. But what is certain is, both phenomena will be shaping the world's weather in the year ahead, for better or - mostly - for worse.<br><br>While 2006 was the world's sixth warmest year on record, according to Climate Change Organisation director of Alliances and Operations, Mr Dan Lai, 2007 could be the worst yet.<br><br>"British climate scientists have said that the resurgent El Nino climate trend, combined with higher levels of greenhouse gases, could touch off a fresh round of ecological disasters and make 2007 the world's hottest year on record," Mr Lai said.<br><br>For Singaporeans, it means that when the wet weather finally clears, it could get very hot and very dry. Think 1997, the island's hottest year on record, when an extended dry bout caused water stocks to fall to two-thirds of total reservoir capacity.<br><br>Elsewhere, the new year has already seen ice-storms in California following a snow-less Christmas in New York, Australia's worst drought ever, and floods in Britain.<br><br>Yesterday, Britons learnt from naturalist Sir David Attenborough that their country's murderous heatwaves of 2003 would constitute a normal summer by 2050, and might even seem cool by 2080 - according to the findings of the most detailed climate projection ever undertaken.<br><br>This came just days after scientist Professor Stephen Hawking described climate change as a greater threat to the planet than terrorism, and scientists pushed the hand of the Doomsday Clock - a symbol of the risk of atomic cataclysm and of climate change - closer to midnight.<br><br>"We are learning how human activities and technologies are affecting climate systems in ways that may forever change life on Earth," said Prof Hawking.<br><br>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report, slated for release on Feb 2, is likely to underscore this fact.<br><br>According to the New York Times, leaked drafts state that it is "more than 90 per cent likely" that global warming has been driven by the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases - a truism that has never been conclusively proven.<br><br>The economic impact of such climate change could be enormous - beside which the estimated US$50-million losses for Singapore from last year's haze would seem a pittance.<br><br>In October, former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern called for one per cent of global GDP to be spent immediately on tackling climate change - predicting that the failure to do so could shrink the world economy by 20 per cent by 2050.<br><br>Already, the economic backlash is sinking in with insurance companies in the US, which are - according to the latest issue of Newsweek --- doubling premiums, refusing to take new policies or even discontinuing existing ones for customers along the Eastern seaboard, including New York City. The reason? The increase in "extreme weather events" that are racking up huge property damages.<br><br>In the meantime, Singapore is gearing up just to deal with the next few months in the grip of El Nino, which is expected to dissipate by June. Given the big strides made in the last 10 years towards self-sufficiency in water resources, a shortage like 1997's is unlikely should the dry spell catch hold.<br><br>But if the heavy rains unexpectedly drag on instead, agencies told TODAY they are prepared. The Land Transport Authority, for example, will pay greater attention to infrastructure such as slopes. Measures in flood-prone areas are already underway by the Public Utilities Board, such as $12.8m project to enlarge the canal at Tanglin Halt.<br><br>Yet even if climatic anomalies do not hit Singapore directly, Mr Lai warned: "One must not forget the potential of indirect effect of climate change to Singapore -- especially when this tiny red dot depends on the resources of many countries around the world." - TODAY/st</div>

Â“They live between 600 and 1,000 meters under the water, which is deeper than humans can go.Â”<br><br>Â“We think it may have come close to the surface because it was sick, or else it was weakened because it was in shallow waters,Â” the official said.<br><br>The shark died a few hours after being caught.<br><br>Frilled sharks, which feed on other sharks and sea creatures, are sometimes caught in the nets of trawlers but are rarely seen alive.</blockquote>could this be due to the melting of southpole...the warm current thaw the ice and bring the animal back to life<br></div>

You say u read those articles, etc. but u dun believe it. So you are saying all the scientist in the world are either corrupted or incompetent. Even a renowned crippled genius like Stephen Hawking is possibly incompetent and corrupted and is stupid enough to believe that global warming is the current greatest threat to humanity? Because he was one of the scientist who agreed on the movement of the clock  by two minutes towards doomsday.<br><br>What they are writing is not real and not happening when news around the world reports unprecedented disasters??<br><br>I really think u are so wrong about human behaviour and how u perceive things.</div></blockquote>Hello Apples, I mean you no disrespect and welcome the debate.<br><br>What I'm saying is that the climate was warmer in the middle ages.  But that climate change advocates have erased this from their graphs and arguments.<br><br>I also believe that 'climate change' is a way for the people, the public servants we elect to run our services (some might suggest they believe they rule over us), to force us to feel guilty about how we lead our lives, and tax us. In Europe thay call them 'sin taxes'. Tax cigarettes a lot because they are bad as we all know, and raise lots of tax (but don't ban them). Tax alcohol a lot because that is bad (but don't ban it). Of course we all feel so guilty we amost yearn to pay these taxes.<br><br>Tax cars a lots, and anything else that be vaguely called non-green, or anything else that might cause global warming. That Japanese shark... it is global warming I tell you... obvious isn't it! lol<br><br>Stephen Hawking, all those scientists, the rest... all have careers, egos, mortgages, vanities. Each of them want more of our money to build their empires. I just regret that the people so easily flock to help them do so.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think i<strong>may have the chance </strong> to save the world though because i am quiet a intelligent person. probably i will join some already existing intelligence think tank who is in charge of doing nothing but churning ideas and creative ways of seeing the problems we have in the world.<br><br>then through creative process comes creative solutions to solve any problems. hopefully, then i can save the world by being a triggering factor.<br><br>anyone wants to join my think tank committee? perhaps we can start off staying in contact in msn. this think tank is focus on few grounding principles. first, we must be ideapreneur, only a few people cannot do much. the most we can do is to come off with good ideas and pass them to bigger organisation. the second thing we do will mainly be learning new knowledge in any sources so that we can do innovation.<br><br>please message me if you want to be this type of ideapreneur on solving all kinds of problems in the world, big or small, natural disaster or terrorism. dun worry, we can just try it out and you choose to have sex rather than discussing these things if you want to anytime.</div>
