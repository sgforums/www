They blah blah and then the locals think they are fu.ck rich or whatever like their $$ bigger. Actually most white trash pigment deficient morons are worse then local and chinese but they just act high class or rich. Most are really bas.tards and bi.tches with no manners. Just that people don't want to offend them cause they make very loud complains as well.<br>Deal with them enough and you'll know what sort of trash and rubbish dumps they come from.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>so many threads on supremist.... anyway...<br><br>actually hor, i feel many of us fellow singaporeans have the tendency to be friendlier when talking to white people. i've come into frequently contact with americans and australians because my family have business dealings with them, and what i noticed is attitude by singaporeans towards these white people are indeed more warm and friendly.<br><br>also want to add, the americans and australians i've met are very nice people, please do not attack their race just because of this supremist guy, by doing so you're no different from the him.</div>
