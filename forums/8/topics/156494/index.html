            <div class='col-md body'>That sounds very sad... I feel for your dog...<br><br>Small dogs average life span is between 12-15 years. I guess being at 16 years and having been abused, I really don't know why there are some people who still do this.<br><br>I can't help you with anything, but the barking thing during sleep and waking up to pee, I believe he is having nightmares (we humans have it, and we call it post-traumatic stress disorders) and flashbacks of it's past.<br><br>I may not be quite knowledgeable of veterinerean medicine, but I take pity...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm. u can try feeding ur doggy cat food. a lot of dogs like the 'smell' of cat food cos more protein... maybe dilute it a bit...<br><br>Hmmm... my dog died a few months ago from old age... we brought him to the vet and think the vet put him on a drip and we brought him home... think it really helped to make him feel more 'comfortable' for his last few weeks.... that was when he could no longer eat also... very old liao...<br><br>alternatively, you can check out if a vet can visit your house... can be quite expensive though... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

A dog is a dog, at least it doesn't know how to con people.  it is more faithful than stupid human But alas we can only  do so much for a dog. There is a reason why he born dog. To teach us human about loyalty. His work  is done.<br><br>It is time for the dog to be recalled by GOD. everybdy's time will come. We cant do anything.

            <div class='col-md body'>Reminds me of my ex-dog. It was like that for years, and I kept refusing my father's suggestion to put it away.<br><br>It was until one day when I really had no choice. I avoided the scene so bad, I tried to sleep my way through when my mother was giving him his last shower that faithful morning.<br><br>When I heard the doorbell, I knew that was it. Despite how much I didn't want to witness that scene, I dashed out of my bed and took a last look at him from my room... He was already blind, but somehow I felt that he too, gave me a last "glance" towards my direction. That was when my mother and sister noticed I was acually behind them, waving at him, for the last time.<br><br>My mother asked that guy, so what would be done to him? He replied in a "I've-done-it-so-many-times-I-don't-feel-a-thing-anymore" tone, that he would be put to death. I knew that that was a fact, but still it really pained my heart.<br><br>That day was actually one of the worst days in my life. I knew I had to let him go, I've already held on to him for years when he should already be in a better place, given his condition.<br><br>That's the thing bout keeping pets. Even till today, I still keep his picture in my wallet, and it still pains me whenever I thought of the last moment before he was taken away. I wept my blanket wet man.</div>
