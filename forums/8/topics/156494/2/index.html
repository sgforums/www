            <div class='col-md body'>16 years is quite a long time for dogs. Dogs years is different from human years. Im not sure of the ratio..2:1? 3:1? 4:1?<br><br>anyway, dogs that age will eat lesser and lesser. They will be nothing much then a pack of bones. They start losing their sense of taste n probably their appetite. Nothing much u can do, except shower it with tlc.<br><br>Btw, try feeding it Bak Gua.. see if it respond. If it does, then its probably due to the choice of food.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Wind:</div><div class="quote_body">Reminds me of my ex-dog. It was like that for years, and I kept refusing my father's suggestion to put it away.<br><br>It was until one day when I really had no choice. I avoided the scene so bad, I tried to sleep my way through when my mother was giving him his last shower that faithful morning.<br><br>When I heard the doorbell, I knew that was it. Despite how much I didn't want to witness that scene, I dashed out of my bed and took a last look at him from my room... He was already blind, but somehow I felt that he too, gave me a last "glance" towards my direction. That was when my mother and sister noticed I was acually behind them, waving at him, for the last time.<br><br>My mother asked that guy, so what would be done to him? He replied in a "I've-done-it-so-many-times-I-don't-feel-a-thing-anymore" tone, that he would be put to death. I knew that that was a fact, but still it really pained my heart.<br><br>That day was actually one of the worst days in my life. I knew I had to let him go, I've already held on to him for years when he should already be in a better place, given his condition.<br><br>That's the thing bout keeping pets. Even till today, I still keep his picture in my wallet, and it still pains me whenever I thought of the last moment before he was taken away. I wept my blanket wet man.</div></blockquote>The exact reason why I did not enter vet... Sigh... I just can't put a hand into putting them to sleep... The way you describe his last day and last shower is very very depressing and sad. I can even live in that day you have been through. Animals, not only dogs are creatures sent by God to bring out our love and sensual part which most of us have lost towards other fellow human being.<br><br>With that, we grow attached towards it, we don't want to let them go, we feel for them no matter where we are, we keep thinking of them and we will cling and hold on to them no matter what happens. They take away our fear, they take away our pain, they take away our worry and our sadness so many times we can't even keep track.<br><br>As some of the forumites have said, they are sent to teach us about loyalty, and yes, it is so very true, that dogs will always remain man's best friend, no matter what.... Look at how our feelings change when we are about to lose them. We ought to learn more from them...<br><br>To funniegal: You have a kind heart to shelter the poor dog, I believe you will always be in his heart no matter where he goes after-life...<br><br>To wind: Thank you for sharing your sad yet touching story with us... if anyone can feel like you do, I believe you are so much a great dog-lover with no comparison...<br><br>PS: I can't believe why are there people who still abuses dogs...</div>
