One of the reason I can't bear to quit was the good pay I fear to lose.<br><br>I think I will apply for a transfer to another department.

I have read the good reports he had previously put up for me.

I requested to work alone with my suppliers overseas and i am cofident of doing it. This boss also refused to do so said that i am incapable but always ask me to feed him info. since i started keeping quiet, he quickly go hire another engineer (alas same character) and got nothing to report to his boss. the reason given is when ppl ask him he cannot answer so he need me to tell him or email him what i am doing. sometimes i do but who knows behind my back always go tell other ppl this and that and cocks up my work. sometime even when i am busy doing things he want to deviate me from my current work wen the other new guy is so free. what think is that the new guy should go and he should do more. so what if those lower educated ppl holding high post great? eat salt more than we eat rice? i suldome eat salt, i only work hard. if u are young and use your brain wen you work, wen u grow older u can proudly tell the younger geneerations that you eat rice more that you eat salt, cause you work with your brain and not your butt!<br><br>as for this case, request for transfer or wen your bond is up, leave and go work elsewhere. for me, the company need me so much that they requie 2 month's notiifcationprior to my resignation...see how important i am...what a big joke! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
