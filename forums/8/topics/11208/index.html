            <div class='col-md body'>nah dont go 4 them!! they're just plain $$ suckers - they're "commodity companies" actually. White house, tanjong pagar, pr4m4, "consultancies", etc etc...<br><br>U can go there if u want 4 the experience - but rem - do NOT invest!! You will never see ur $$ again.....<br><br>Learn 2 recognize these companies - and then stay clear of them.<br><br>The following will help you "sniff out"/detect these cheats before you waste your time with them.<br><br>"Give-away" characteristics<br>===========================<br><br>i) Contact no. is given with an extension<br><br>frequently u may even see the same number pop up in a different ad (but still same concept advert) - although with a different extension. DEAD GIVE-AWAY !!<br><br>ii) Noisy background/environment when taking the call (you can hear other phones ringing, other people REPEATING the exact same message to other pp over the phone!)<br><br>If you've ever been inside there - it's like a telephone exchange in there. It's just mainly rows and rows of long desks fitted with many phones, and people tending these phones. Nothing else!<br><br>It's not like a regular office at all. They exist to take in a lot of calls, and pump in customers to become investors (and suck $$ off them). Each company will normally put out a lot of ads everyday, with each trader/manager putting out his/her own ads. Hence the high volume of calls and phones. If no new people come in to get hooked, they will die. Hence advertising/phones are very impt. to them.<br><br>Have you ever seen any company devote almost all of their office space to empty desks - and phones? Just how do they do their business anyway? They get paid by answering phone calls?? Think.<br><br>iii) inability/unwillingness to reveal nature of job/exact salary over the phone.<br><br>They will basically repeat the same things they say in the ads - "oh just do some simple calculations, plus filing, and some paperwork". yeah rite - and expect to be paid that high?? bullshit!!<br><br>iv) "May I know how old are you?"<br><br>that's the first question they ask - the first thing they wanna know. Do you have enough $$ to give them?<br><br>Concluding words: there are legitimate "home-based" businesses out there all right - but most of them are internet-based. Either that - or you'll have to do direct marketing/mail marketing...<br><br>Just beware...</div>
