            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>hmmm.. not really.. those guys i like are those mysterious type..maybe i am those curious type.. that is why i have this urge to find out bout them more..  </strong></blockquote>You are a rarity among the female rabble here. Good for you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>wats mysterious?<br>wear black coat and shades at nite?<br>always disappear w/o anyone knowing and re-appears w/o anyone knowing too?</strong></blockquote>I'm like that, but not because i'm a wannabe, but because I have always been like that. So often to the extent its freaky to people probably, i mean to you people, the way I speak would be freaky to you nes pa?<br><br><blockquote><strong>huh?? mysterious?? those give me the impression that they are trying to act cool (pretentious)....</strong></blockquote>I suppose that's the feeling i evoke from people then,,, though not on purpose.<br><br><blockquote><strong>turn on.<br><br>only those who keep toking abt sex and disgustting topics are the turn offs. totally unglam, uncool.</strong></blockquote>HA! I seriously doubt that. Then why do girls hang around more with guys who snort, laugh loudly, curse, talk about sex and make weird noises and silly falic jokes? Why if girls here find it a turn off? I don't believe you.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I know a guy who is fun yet would not say about his real feelings or show it. The only expression (verbal or physical) he shows without consideration is happiness i.e. smiles, laugh heartily etc. All other expressions would have to go through his mind to ponder and consider before showing it or saying it<br><br>When it comes to issues that he doesn't like to deal with, he would give a blank expression on purpose. No angry face or upset face or anything. Just a blank look + a little smile and no further talk on that topic. Half of the time it's exasperating to try to figure out if I have said the wrong thing or is he alright with it. </strong></blockquote>Sounds like me. I fear what i say or how i behave is considered heathen and weird to you people, which is why i think twice before answering or acknowledging. It does not help when people here don't communicate with eye contact and more conversation on the topic, in order to break ice, it always takes 2. And when I try to break the ice it usually doesn't break, so i may as well sit down and shut up.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I hate this sort of 'mysterious' guy. Hard to understand and frustrating. I would usually deliver the same attitude back when I encounter. No mercy!</strong></blockquote>You are the common person that forms the bulk of the local female population.<br><br><blockquote><strong>it's almost hardwired into men...<br><br>never involve anyone else in problems.. problems must be solved by himself..<br><br>other than that, try never to burden anyone else with personal problems.. and happiness, whenever possible, share  </strong></blockquote>Some of us are raised to be open and candid in all things, so as to faciliate communication, which in itself aids solving of problems. But if no one asks after you or even talks to you, why would you want to talk to them about your own problems? Since they will think it awkard that you tell them of all people about your problems. Ergo, sometimes it does not pay to share, or there is no possibiltity TO SHARE in the 1st place.<br><br><blockquote><strong>hmm... prefer them to be more upright and frank. best is they are willing to let us into their lives.</strong></blockquote>Some of us open our radar dish and keep transmitting, but there is often no reception. The door to our lives is open, but no one wants to walk in, so why leave it open? When there are other doors more attractive than yours.  I don't believe you prefer them to be upright and frank, for such traits are considered weird, rude, disrespectful or "thin-faced" over here.<br><br>My question to all of you: WHAt does MYSTERIOUS mean?<br><br></div>
