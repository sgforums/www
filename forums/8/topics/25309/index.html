I find the whole idea of migration a very personal issue. It's simply about choosing the lifestyle you wanted. What I do'nt like is the labelling of people who choose to migrate as "fair weather friend". As I said, be it in good times or bad times, people has been migrating out of singapore since the 80's.

Everyone has the right to make a better living for themselves. When people looses their job, who's gonna pity them and would anyone offer a heping hand? Yet when one chooses to lead a better life abroad, some people would brand them as "fair weather friend". It's like being a sore loser.</div></blockquote>Agree with you. You've your own rights to decide to live your own lives.<br><br>So as to be seen as not a fairweather person, we should work to death in the company we are currently working in, in order not to show that we are fairweather? Majiam they will not kick you out first. Same thing, show the same kind of loyalty to the country, you think they'll consider you first? Think again.<br><br>The influx of foreign "talent", are you sure you are not looked over because of them? Many jobs can be done by locals too. Many locals are as well-travelled as the foreigners, and have experience working in overseas. But due to the "colour inferiority", the locals lose out.<br><br>See who are the fairweather ones. Once the company does not perform well, the first to run are the foreign "talents", bringing with them the obscene amount of dough they earned in their stint here. So why are these people not lambasted? They spend our money, create a mess for us to clear up, whilst they happily bag the money and leave the country.</div>
