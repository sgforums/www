            <div class='col-md body'>Fact of the matter is, we are all in the process of evolution. Everyday, we are evolving in one way or another. We learnt that the earth rotates around the sun when Copernicus enlightened us with his theory. The introduction of cellphone itself is revolutionary to the world. God did not grant us with religion. Religion is conceived by us mankind and so is God Himself. We have evolved and thus we created God along with religion. Yet we believe that God blew life to us when we are His parents.</div>
