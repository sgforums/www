            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Bible, evolutionary science called perfectly compatible</strong><br>By John Thavis<br><br>18 Nov 2005<br><br>ROME (CNS) -- Properly understood, the Bible and evolutionary science are perfectly compatible, said an influential Jesuit magazine noting that to use religious arguments against evolution shows ignorance of the nature of the Bible.<br><br>On the other hand, science cannot pretend to exclude a divine role behind the creation of the world and man, the magazine, La Civilta Cattolica, said in its Nov. 19 issue.<br><br>The magazine's contents are reviewed prior to publication by the Vatican's Secretariat of State, and its views are thought to reflect Vatican opinion.<br><br>In response to its own question -- Is there really an opposition between the widely accepted theory of evolution and the account of creation in Scripture? -- the magazine said: "The answer is no. And the reason is that the Bible is a book that does not try to give a scientific teaching, but a religious teaching.<br><br>"In other words, it doesn't try to teach 'how' man appeared historically," it said. Instead, the Bible teaches who man is in relation to God and the world, what is man's spiritual condition, and what is man's destiny, it said.<br><br>The article said that when it comes to creation scientists and believers should be careful not to invade each other's fields of competence.<br><br>Scientists should not presume to exclude God as the first cause of all creation and, more specifically, as the creator of man, it said. Science cannot say that man was not created by God and is simply the result of chance.<br><br>When evolution is presented correctly, however, there is no contradiction with Scripture, it said.<br><br>"These are two visions of the origin of man that not only do not contradict each other but complete each other, on the condition that the scientist does not try to exclude any intervention of God in the formation of man and the believer does not try to find in science a confirmation of the biblical account," it said.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Evolution is both FACT and THEORY</strong><br><br>Words from 2 eminent scientists on evolution.<br><strong>Taken from http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html</strong><br><br>"Well evolution is a theory. It is also a fact. And facts and theories are different things, not rungs in a hierarchy of increasing certainty. Facts are the world's data. Theories are structures of ideas that explain and interpret facts. Facts don't go away when scientists debate rival theories to explain them. Einstein's theory of gravitation replaced Newton's in this century, but apples didn't suspend themselves in midair, pending the outcome. And humans evolved from ape-like ancestors whether they did so by Darwin's proposed mechanism or by some other yet to be discovered.<br><br>Moreover, "fact" doesn't mean "absolute certainty"; there ain't no such animal in an exciting and complex world. The final proofs of logic and mathematics flow deductively from stated premises and achieve certainty only because they are not about the empirical world. Evolutionists make no claim for perpetual truth, though creationists often do (and then attack us falsely for a style of argument that they themselves favor). In science "fact" can only mean "confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional consent." I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.<br><br>Evolutionists have been very clear about this distinction of fact and theory from the very beginning, if only because we have always acknowledged how far we are from completely understanding the mechanisms (theory) by which evolution (fact) occurred. Darwin continually emphasized the difference between his two great and separate accomplishments: establishing the fact of evolution, and proposing a theory--natural selection--to explain the mechanism of evolution."<br><br><strong>- Stephen J. Gould, " Evolution as Fact and Theory"; Discover, May 1981</strong><br><br>"Let me try to make crystal clear what is established beyond reasonable doubt, and what needs further study, about evolution. Evolution as a process that has always gone on in the history of the earth can be doubted only by those who are ignorant of the evidence or are resistant to evidence, owing to emotional blocks or to plain bigotry. By contrast, the mechanisms that bring evolution about certainly need study and clarification. There are no alternatives to evolution as history that can withstand critical examination. Yet we are constantly learning new and important facts about evolutionary mechanisms."<br><br><strong>- Theodosius Dobzhansky "Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution", American Biology Teacher vol. 35 (March 1973) reprinted in Evolution versus Creationism, J. Peter Zetterberg ed., ORYX Press, Phoenix AZ 1983</strong><br><br></div>

Richard Veras, chairman of Stepinac's religion department, said he would hope that Catholic schools would teach evolution just as public schools do.<br><br>"Science tells us about material, empirical facts, about fossils and evolution," he said. "We have no problem teaching what science has found. It is obvious to us that there is intelligence behind it, but it can't be proven by science. I can't prove that my mother loves me scientifically Â— but I know it's true."<br><br>Veras said if the physical record shows that man evolved from other species, so be it.<br><br>"We believe the human soul is created by God," he said. "<strong>God may have evolved matter </strong>until he got it to <strong>the point to house the human soul</strong>."<br><br></div>
