Go take GP sure kenna circle red red one. What the hell ..

Why must Christians be Muslims? Christians  are defined as followers of Christ. Muslims do not believe Christ Jesus is God. So why will Christians be Muslims?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>By the way, you are miscontruing the facts. It is not the case the later you are, the more books you have. Muslims view the Book of Moses, David and the Gospel of Jesus with great respect. However, their view is that those books, in their uncorrupted form, were lost! Even Muslims don't have it. They respect the books only in their original form. They respect the Biblical version "in name only".<br><br>Come on .. will Muslims accept that it was Isaac and not Ishmael who was given the birthright?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote>if they believed in the word of god and the bible, why is it when a new book is passed down, they choose to reject it?Do christians think that its a multiple choice,whichever one they one they just choose?</blockquote>The Holy Quran was passed down a different way. The 'Holy' title is most deserving. The Prophet Mohammed (PBUH), supposedly an illiterate, wrote the book with the angel Gabriel dictating to him in a cave. None of the biblical books were written this way.<br><br><blockquote>So why did they believe Jesus when he start telling ppl that he brought the word of god,yet neglect Prophet Mohamed?</blockquote>'cos the Prophet never admitted Jesus is God in the Trinity. If you believe the Prophet, then you have to reject the biblical version. Take your pick.<br><br><blockquote>The Quran has many of the things the bible has but is most "up to date"..so im bewildered?Like, would you read today's newspaper to find out whats happening or would you read 30 years ago one?pretty weird ah?And if you say that the Quran is not true, than similarly, what is there to prove that the Bible is true?</blockquote>You have Jews and Christians reading the same books. (in the OT) Then you have Muslims who say those books are corrupted. No way we can test it. Neither can Muslims prove their version is most uncorrupted.<br><br><blockquote>Then, Christians, Protestants,Catholic all these and that ah..all also believe in Jesus and Bible all this...but why is it that they are all not one religion, how did they start to split..God's word is one, right?Well..how did it end up having several different factions all this, it just goes to show the human input into "God's" word</blockquote>You have to thank God for that. Imagine the whole world Christians very united one big family. They will surely affect govt. and politics. They will lobby like siao. Maybe they will ban evolution. Maybe they will ban condoms. Too scary liao.</div>
