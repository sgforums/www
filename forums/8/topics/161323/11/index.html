Her<br>own. as in she gave birth la(issac). yea..<br>and haggah fought with sarah later on too. that ishmael(the son of haggah and abraham) was her son. and not Sarah's. so Sarah sent haggah on her seperate ways. and ishmael became the father of the muslims, because they are his descendents.<br>if Sarah had obeyed God, there wouldnt be any of this..<br>and issit God's will that Sarah disobeyed? so that there could be muslims? nope. thats not the way God operates, it isnt in his nature to go against his word. yup..</div>

I dun believe the ark contains the physical 2 animals. So if we humans turn bad it is becuz aliens is not the best they are also defective. Only G*d is the best and in this theory G*d make no mistake in creating aliens.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Depends on what kind of evolution la. Darwinism abit out date liao.</blockquote>i would beg to differ. unlike the creationism theory, science isn't constrained by verses in the bible and ecclesiastical doctrines. if you have read the economist recently, there is an article touching upon the legal tussle by human rights group in America to sanction the teaching of creationism theory, albeit under the guise of intelligent design.<br><br>and for your information there is no "what kind of evolution". being unconstrained by any form of third party control, research have been shown sometimes to be contridictory to general thought of evolution. hence breakaway/newer scientific readmendments to darwin's theory of evolution. instead of taking Darwinism, you should instead approach the topic of just Evolution. Darwin merely sparked off a new area of research and do not dictate the ending. Bear in mind that unlike the creationism theory where we already have all the accumulative evidence in the form of the gospels and the Bible, science change with technological advancement.<br><br>just as we do not blame early scientists for claiming the earth is in the centre of the universe, we should not fault darwin for any mistake. if any, we thank these scientists for being the purveyors of truth.<br><br>if there's anything to go by, the Church has always been stagnating the progress of Science. i need not remind you about the incarceration of Gaileo who eventually turned out to be correct. so is the bible 100% accurate? i again, beg to differ</div>
