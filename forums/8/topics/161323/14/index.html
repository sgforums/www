Being sad little bible huggers, there is a huge tendency that you have a strong bias towards the Bible, and it becomes purely impossible for you to have a proper evaluation of the situation.<br><br>To give an analogy of what is happening here, imagine there is slice of cake on a table. You leave it for a while..and when you come back the cake is gone. You have no idea how it happened. Your friend who was in the room told you two stories. It could be that someone took it and ate it..and this hypothesis is backed by maybe the presence of some crumbs and fingerprints, and also because your friend has like bits of cake in his teeth.. But he also mentions a second hypothesis that Spongebob and Patrick came from the bikini bottom down there and jumped out of the sea to take your cake. Since, you were not there you cannot tell..So do you believe the hypothesis based on scientific proofs or do you just base it what you friend tells you?<br><br>Thats the same as Christianity,you have a book,you have a few priests and you have a pope..and they tell you..hey got a god ah..and you must pray and go church ah..and then you go heaven ah..then the pagans all would die go to hell ah...and you say..yes sir yes sir three fucking bags full..and nod your head like a damn goondu and listen...<br><br>Or, you could actually use your brains, and see that well life came about..and well..at present evolution best explains it with physical proof...not some mumbo jumbo rubbish about miracles...which is simply the placebo effect..well...even if evolution may not answer everything yet..it offers a more stable substantiated perspective in comparison to Christianity...<br><br>So..stop all the hubris about how christians good lah what not lah..for goodness sake...the proliferation of the religion is based on bloodshed during the crusades and all..are you telling me that having war upon those who do not share you believes and forcing it upon them , and by sheer scale, the religion spreads, and becomes believed, that it becomes true? Like that we are like typical Singaporeans ah, gahmen say we have the freedom of press is a good thing, we also nod head..yes sir yes sir three fucking bags full of shit...<br><br>Bloody annoying...of all religions...only the christians are so bloody pushy about their religion..with the ceaseless evangelism and all..does the religion not teach christians to live with the differences?must make people be like them than happy?many people are not interested..so if you are lost in your obsession with your religion, keep it to yourself...<br><br>P.S. feeling damn annoyed reading all the rubbish from girlnextdoor all this...fuming ah..sorry if i rub any of you people the wrong way...its is an open forum..not my fault that its displayed in a non bible hugger exclusive thread..</div></blockquote>to put it simple, christians are self-righteous and having the inability or obstinate to review their thinking.</div>

What are the statistics?<br><br>Did the religion proliferate, like you said, based on bloodshed? I have some rudimentary knowledge of history and I knew the Inquisition and Crusade were largely unsuccessful at converting the Jews.<br><br>The religion also proliferated by peaceful evangelism. True the colonists made it possible for evangelism to happen, but people converted not 'cos they were forced upon. Evangelism is still happening today and there is minimal bloodshed. In fact I argue the evangelist's blood is more often shed than their targets.<br><br><blockquote>Like that we are like typical Singaporeans ah, gahmen say we have the freedom of press is a good thing, we also nod head..yes sir yes sir three fucking bags full of shit...</blockquote>Compared to Myammar(?) we are way better.
