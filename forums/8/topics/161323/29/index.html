            <div class='col-md body'>This question always pop up.  IF God was so good, why is there death, suffering, birdflu, earth quake, wars etc.<br><br>Well, reason is according Christian belief, is due to Adam &amp; eve's sin, earth was condemned to death.  Admit it, most of the things that happen are becos of Man's own work.  We choose to fight wars, we choose not to see reason in each other.  How on earth did Aids spread to humans when it was only supposedly present in monkeys?  Why do ppl get infected by HIV infected needles? Why is there so much injustice around?<br><br>Reason is, as it has always been since genesis chapter 1.  Man has sinned and are doomed to death.  Now, Im not trying to convert anyone here.  Im' sharing with u what the bible and christianity is REALLY about.  It is because, we are all dying, the world is dying, and but there is still a God, and a salvation. And thats what christians embrace, salvation.  Not salvation of our earthly bodies, but our souls.  Most importantly, the salvation of others.  Our friends n family.<br><br>Bad things happens to everyone.  Christian or not... But tho the body can be rotting in the grave, as long as the souls are saved.<br><br>Why do Christians reject darwin's theory of evolution.  Theologically, if we really evolved from other creatures, then Adam's sin/fall perhaps DIDN't happen.  And if there was no ADAM to sin with,  then the humans aren't doomed to eternal condemnation, and there wouldn't be a need for a man named Jesus to die on the cross.<br><br>The fact that the whole macro-evolution theory has not been proven to date, leaves us to the DEFAULT explanation to the origin of man/species/life.  The default explanation that has been passed from generation to generation, according to each religions individual belief.  That we indeed were made by a being that is much greater in power than ourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if we evolved from single celled organisms, and not created by a Godly standard, who is there to "sin" against?<br><br>According to ur 2nd post, then no one earth deserves to live.  Well technically, that is true.  Cos in the bible it states, cos we have all sinned, and fallen short of the Glory of God.  The God of the bible is SO perfect, so holy, that even if we have sinned just in the most minute amount, we would be judged.<br><br>A way of understanding would be like a piece of white paper.   Even if there is just one small drop of ink on it, the white piece of paper will no longer be purely white.<br><br>Now, I would like to state why I am taking time to reply to all these posts, since some readers feel that there is no need to discuss over such matters.<br><br>I will stand and fight for something that I believe in.  Some of the biblical quotes which I have seen here were used out of context, and sometimes the words when used out of context would have its meaning distorted.  And from there, theories which really did not represent the christian faith ended up being misrepresented.  Though I am in no way an authority in biblical studies, I felt that there is a need to point out if there was any misrepresentation.    In Revelations, the author understood that words out of the scripture if used out of context would be misrepresented, and therefore clearly stated, "Let no words be added or taken away from the scriptures."<br><br>What I do not understand is this.  Why are there people who want to argue, and fight for something they do NOT believe in?  Singapore's a society that practices religious freedom.  If u do not believe in the teachings of that faith, then u are not obliged to align urself in its belief.  So why go all out to discredit that faith's ideas and teachings?<br><br>Of course, if its just questions that u have, then u're perfectly welcomed to ask.  I'm sure Christians would be more than glad to help u answer the question.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, as promised, i checked out with my cell leader.<br><br>Well i was almost fully correct on why God was so merciful with humans.<br><br>One thing established is that God is holy, his perfect standard cannot condone sin.  But the characteristic of his love of man is demonstrated by him, allowing humans to remain whenever he can find a way out, and around the sin.<br><br>In the banishment of Adam and Eve from the garden of eden, the punishment was already served and Adam n eve knew their mistake.  Hence they were spared.  But, they no longer had the provisions they once had from Eden.  Importantly, man was spared.<br><br>In the times of noah, evil n sin was everywhere.  And again, by His perfect standard, he had to judge man for their evil.  Fortunately, Noah's family remained because Noah's family had feared God.  The rest simply did not.  In the passage, it stated that God was grieved by what man had become, and had no choice but to do so.  We know from there, that God too has emotions.<br><br>In short, we see a characteristic of God in the Bible where he would exercise his mercy wherever he could.<br><br>Well, on the issues of Satan, I also dunno.   But one thing we know, is that Satan is defeated when Jesus Christ died on the Cross.  His existence is perhaps part of God's plan to defeat him once and for all.<br><br>My friend, God did not create disease, and death to plague man.  If Adam had not eaten of the tree, there would be no sin, thus no death nor disease.  In fact, Adam and eve were pretty much vegetarians in the beginning since God said he gave to them every fruit bearing tree as food (except for the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil).  The giving of animals as food later, after sin.<br><br>These diseases are simply the product of our sinful ways.<br><br>Life is unfair.  I admit it, but one truth is, God never promised life to be fair.  In fact, God never promised life to be easy for Christians either.  For Christians, life is very often facing persecution.  Look at how many of the apostles came to unnatural ends for preaching the gospel?  If they weren't decapitated, they were hung upside down on the cross.<br><br>Life is not all there is.  God uses life on earth, to prepare us to mold us for eternity.  Men was never made to die.  That is why many of us seek to find ways to leave a legacy.  Life is a trial, a test that shapes our character.<br><br>Like I said, the issue of macro evolution, evolution of species to species, can never be proven.  It will forever remain as what it is, theory upon theory.  If it was already proven why are scientist still looking for evidence to "prove" it further?  If a convict was already guilty of crime worthy of death, would prosecuting him further make him guiltier?  It hasn't been proven, ppl just refuse to believe it, and I don't blame them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend, true enough, every little sin in our lives would probably convict us terribly in the sight of God.  But God has also provided a way out, for us, and that is thru Jesus Christ.<br><br>It is because the gravity of our wrong doings is so severe, that forgiveness is imperative.  If we do not forgive others of their wrong doings to us, God won't forgive us for our wrong doings.  If we are able to forgive others, and accept the forgiveness of others, don't u think the world would be in a lot less trouble today?  The problem was never with God, but with us.<br><br>I believe that is a teaching of many religions and I think that is Great!<br><br>Look, Christians aren't perfect people.  Though we try to be the best as we can be, many times we fail too.  But, because Christians have accepted the forgiveness that is freely given to all who ask, there is a freedom from guilt.  In place of that, is a heart that seeks to obey the rules, the laws of the scriptures, and forgive others in return.<br><br>From the scriptures, we understand that for God to destroy people hurts Him as well.  His spirit grieves that he had to judge man for what man does. Which is why the scripture emphasises on forgiveness, as God himself finds ways to spare humanity.  Before Sodom was levelled, or nuked as I sometimes like to think of it, God agreed to multiple plea attempts to spare the city from Abraham.  Until Abraham pleaded for 10.  Out of a whole city, Abraham couldn't find 10..  Fortunately for those he found, were spared.  But city itself was levelled.  What does that tell us? God is always willing to show mercy where he can.<br><br>Where is God to clarify this matter?  All the clarification has been printed in the Bible already.  Of course, if u want God to sms u himself, or talk to u himself, I also pray that that happens. =)<br><br>Look, I am doing this because there have been certain misconceptions, which I find unfounded that have been claimed.  I only seek to clarify this as much as I can.<br><br>Again I ask, why do you fight for something you do not believe in?  If you choose not to believe in Christianity, or any other religion, please do not distort it, or attempt discredit it.  U have your religious freedom, and I respect that.  But if you try to discredit another person religion, then u are not respecting that person or his religion.   I hope this has been an informative experience, but lets not continue this discussion anymore if it is only going to lead to further discredit the beliefs of other faith.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a bit unrelated, but if you guys were born into an atheist family, or perhaps born in the middle east into a muslim extremist family,would you end up being such devout christians still?<br><br>Is religion really what is true in this world, or is religion merely what your parents and environment impose on you?And given this exposure, and your believe in any of these concepts, over time, they merely reinforce the ideas and you become totally convinced.Because, we can clearly see those pagan tribes all around which are not so called civilized yet, they still believe in spirits and all those stuff..what difference is a christian from those pagans whom sacrifice water buffalos to appease gods, the faith is unwavering in either case, who is to say one is more correct than the other?<br><br>And try doing a thought experiment, if the world was created the way atheist tend to push..with no God and merely guided by the rules of science..would the concept of god have eventually developed?We can see that obscure tribes have developed the concept of Gods independently, so is only those who have books considered correct, and the rest treated with disdain?</div>
