            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, let me say, I do not claim that u are wrong.  So please do not use statements like "You are wrong."  This topic is up for discussion, and we discuss.  On my part, i will refrain from doing that too.<br><br>Back to point<br><br>In your own words. <strong>The NAS defines a fact as "an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'"</strong><br><br>Evolution is a theory that has not been observed at all, and not been repeatedly confirm.  Hence it is a very fallible theory. And still a theory.<br><br>What do fossils tell us?  Fossils really just tell us, these creatures have existed, and died.  Thru carbon dating methods, they supposedly tell us when they existed.  But the carbon dating methods themselves have been fallible, since the rate of decay C14 may actually differ.<br><br>An example is a "fossilised" miner's hat, that was carbon dated to be a couple of thousands of years old.<br><br>Fossils just tell, animals of that species once existed.<br><br>Next point.  Again, u are making a theory BASED on a theory.  First theory of assumption is that the earth is indeed millions and millions of years old.  And u base the next theory species takes millions of years to "evolve." U get what i mean?  An unproven theory based on a previous unproven theory.<br><br>Heres an article from wiki links my prev two points.<br><blockquote>Calibration<br><br>The raw BP date cannot be used directly as a calendar date, because the assumption that the level of 14C absorption remains constant does not hold true in practice. The level is maintained by high energy particles interacting with the earth's upper atmosphere, which may be affected by changes in the earth's magnetic field or in the cosmic ray background, e.g. variations caused by solar storms. In addition there are substantial reservoirs of carbon in organic matter, the ocean, ocean sediments (see methane hydrate), and sedimentary rocks; and changing climate can sometimes disrupt the carbon flow between these reservoirs and the atmosphere. The level has also been affected by human activities -- it was almost doubled for a short period due to atomic bomb tests in the 1950s and 1960s and has been reduced by the release of large amounts of CO2 from ancient organic sources where 14C is not present -- the fossil fuels used in industry and transportation.<br><br>The BP dates are therefore calibrated to give calendar dates. Standard calibration curves are available, based on comparison of radiocarbon dates with other methods such as examination of tree growth rings (dendrochronology), ice cores, deep ocean sediment cores, lake sediment varves, coral samples, and speleothems (cave deposits).<br><br>The difference between the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar can be ignored, because it's insignificant compared to the measurement uncertainty.<br><br>The calibration curves can vary significantly from a straight line, so comparison of uncalibrated radiocarbon dates (e.g., plotting them on a graph or subtracting dates to give elapsed time) is likely to give misleading results. There are also significant plateaus in the curves, such as the one from 11000 to 10000 radiocarbon years BP, which is believed to be associated with changing ocean circulation during the Younger Dryas period. The accuracy of radiocarbon dating is lower for samples originating from such plateau periods.<br><br>It has been noted that the plateau itself can be used as a time marker when it appears in a time series.</blockquote>Now, first of all, we do not really know what other factors scientist could have used to arrive at the age of objects carbon dated.  Already seen from the articles, the age that carbon dating produces are shall I say, "moderated" to give dates that Fall in line with "theory of evolution."<br><br><strong>Its like a charlie brown cartoon i once saw, where charlie brown shoots an arrow, then runs to where the arrow lands to draw a bullseye.</strong><br><br>3rd point.  U rather believe man's mathematical prowess in the past to be mythical than the creation of life itself?  Why?<br><br>4th point.  Again, there have been variations in dna, but no new dna was found that could cause an inter-species evolution.  Of course ur answer would be, it takes millions of years for species to evolve and etc.  I will refer u back to my first point on Theories based on theories.<br><br>Cheers, please do not be offended, nor annoyed.  I just like to argue the case for creation.  In fact, I really find a lot of ur posts to be very educating! =D<br></div>

And still a theory. </blockquote><a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/evolution-fact.html</a><br><br><strong>Biologists consider the existence of biological evolution to be a fact. [b]It can be demonstrated today and the historical evidence for its occurrence in the past is overwhelming.</strong> [/b]<br><br>Simply put, it is a FACT tat evolution had occured. The theory which u r debating is only the mechanism on how EVOLUTION had occur.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is a fact, not theory, and that what is at issue within biology are questions of details of the process and the relative importance of different mechanisms of evolution. It is a fact that the earth with liquid water, is more than 3.6 billion years old. It is a fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period and that organized multicellular life is at least 800 million years old. It is a fact that major life forms now on earth were not at all represented in the past. There were no birds or mammals 250 million years ago. It is a fact that major life forms of the past are no longer living. There used to be dinosaurs and Pithecanthropus, and there are none now. It is a fact that all living forms come from previous living forms. Therefore, all present forms of life arose from ancestral forms that were different. Birds arose from nonbirds and humans from nonhumans. No person who pretends to any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts any more than she or he can deny that the earth is round, rotates on its axis, and revolves around the sun.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A few words need to be said about the "theory of evolution," which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors. In everyday speech, "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution, just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena. <strong>In contrast, the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun. Like the heliocentric solar system, evolution began as a hypothesis, and achieved "facthood" as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality. No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled "New evidence for evolution;" it simply has not been an issue for a century</strong>. </span><br><br>Evolution is a FACT.

As said in your attached website, it is found to be accurate if it was matched with calibrated data. In fact it is foudn to be accurate within the 58,000 and 62,000 years, which was already far longer than the bible 6000 years. It is an accurate method of assessing age and it is the absolute chosen method in he field of archeology.<br><br>And another point is, u have underestimate the knowledge tat can be gathered from fossils. The fossils found, according to their age, it can portray, lets say, the evolution sequence of the cat. It can be seen tat after the years the fossils found become more and more, lets say like the cat u see. If however, the fossil of a modern cat is found in older years , then it will debunk the whole theory of evolution. Tentatively no such evidence was found. I mean, u rather believe tat there used to be a few thousand more variation of the cat tat suddenly extinct in the times or tat the cat is evolving  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>Now, first of all, we do not really know what other factors scientist could have used to arrive at the age of objects carbon dated.

Please substantiate your claim. I think tis is really a wild accusation.

Why should dna have to be completely "brand new" ? Then "brand new" dna was found tat was completely different from the other species of animal, then it is an evidence for creation, not evolution.<br><br></div>

[b]It can be demonstrated today and the historical evidence for its occurrence in the past is overwhelming.</strong> [/b]<br><br>Simply put, it is a FACT tat evolution had occured. The theory which u r debating is only the mechanism on how EVOLUTION had occur.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It is time for students of the evolutionary process, especially those who have been misquoted and used by the creationists, to state clearly that evolution is a fact, not theory, and that what is at issue within biology are questions of details of the process and the relative importance of different mechanisms of evolution. It is a fact that the earth with liquid water, is more than 3.6 billion years old. It is a fact that cellular life has been around for at least half of that period and that organized multicellular life is at least 800 million years old. It is a fact that major life forms now on earth were not at all represented in the past. There were no birds or mammals 250 million years ago. It is a fact that major life forms of the past are no longer living. There used to be dinosaurs and Pithecanthropus, and there are none now. It is a fact that all living forms come from previous living forms. Therefore, all present forms of life arose from ancestral forms that were different. Birds arose from nonbirds and humans from nonhumans. No person who pretends to any understanding of the natural world can deny these facts any more than she or he can deny that the earth is round, rotates on its axis, and revolves around the sun.</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Today, nearly all biologists acknowledge that evolution is a fact. The term theory is no longer appropriate except when referring to the various models that attempt to explain how life evolves... it is important to understand that the current questions about how life evolves in no way implies any disagreement over the fact of evolution</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">A few words need to be said about the "theory of evolution," which most people take to mean the proposition that organisms have evolved from common ancestors. In everyday speech, "theory" often means a hypothesis or even a mere speculation. But in science, "theory" means "a statement of what are held to be the general laws, principles, or causes of something known or observed." as the Oxford English Dictionary defines it. The theory of evolution is a body of interconnected statements about natural selection and the other processes that are thought to cause evolution, just as the atomic theory of chemistry and the Newtonian theory of mechanics are bodies of statements that describe causes of chemical and physical phenomena. <strong>In contrast, the statement that organisms have descended with modifications from common ancestors--the historical reality of evolution--is not a theory. It is a fact, as fully as the fact of the earth's revolution about the sun. Like the heliocentric solar system, evolution began as a hypothesis, and achieved "facthood" as the evidence in its favor became so strong that no knowledgeable and unbiased person could deny its reality. No biologist today would think of submitting a paper entitled "New evidence for evolution;" it simply has not been an issue for a century</strong>. </span><br><br>Evolution is a FACT. If u think tat most biologist and all their studies r wrong. Fine.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>I sense a conclusion to this discussion.<br><br>Well think about, how can evolution be a proven fact, when it has to be observed and repeatedly confirmed?  No scientist was present 250 million years ago.  No human witnessed the ocean 3.6 billion years ago.<br><br>The evolution theory we have today are based on theories upon theories which majority has remained as theory.  True, theories are supposed to be based on some laws.  But in the case of the evolution theory, all the theories developed were developed based on the original evolution theory, or another sub-theory.  Hence, evolution itself has gotten lost in its own theory.<br><br>Ask a few different evolutionist scientist on their theory of evolution, and u will be likely to hear a few different explanations.  The evolution theory itself has so many school of thoughts that there are constantly different theories that debunks the previous theory.  So how can we call evolution a fact?<br><br>And yes, perhaps many biologists today are really mislead by this whole evolution thing.<br><br>However, the evolution theory, is perhaps the only way to explain how life on earth, and how earth came about, without the existence of a being of Supreme Intellect and powers.<br><br>About whether its God's 1 day or man's 1 day.   It is definitely man's 1 day.  The word was originally passed to man to record.  And then handed down by word of mouth until a time there were scribes to record.<br><br>Any theologists here can confirm this?</div>
