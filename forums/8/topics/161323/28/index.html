Sorry man, men was created after the sun was created. So all the while they have the sun and it really make it easier for men to mark the time. So your question is not valid </div></blockquote>Light made in first day doesnt mean it is light from the sun. The ancients know there are many sources of light and the sun is just one.<br><br>You argue it is human time, that's why my question is valid and your point that what men were created after sun was created is not valid.

Why don't u read back the 2 points u have written ? Why isn't the tallest peak the tallest in the world ?  WHy isn't 6 days just meant as 6 "human days" (No one ever states tat there exist a god version of day). Obviously the ball is in your court to prove otherwise because literally speaking, the tallest peak is the tallest peak in the world and days just meant as days </blockquote>Picture this. If you're the Hebrew nomand reading this or listening to this account during Moses' time, then what's the mental picture in your head?

If it is simply written by people in mesopotamia, then it is not god inspired and there will be tons and tons of errors inside the bible such as not even knowing there r other parts of the world </blockquote>Ah .. it is 'cos of this kind of mentality that's why science is not progressing. Galileo was almost killed. With your mentality, the bible can be a science  textbook as well. Woe be to us human.<br><br><blockquote>I read at the passage and see the many website he use from christian sites and simply offering his opinion without much evidence really make me wonder how seriously should it be taken. If there r serious loopholes in evolution, I expect it to be publish in scientific journals instead of getting it stuck in bible sites. </blockquote>He said many scientists are turning againt evolution.

Why is your question valid while mine is not ? As said he already clearly stated wat is a day and night. And the definition never changes after the fourth day when the sun was created. He even stated wat is the intention of the sun is to mark out the time for easier reference. However the day is the same day as in the firts day. For your case, u never presented anything tat support your argument. There is nothing in the bible tat tell us god use a different "day" as men. U just say wat u think and ask othet to prove u wrong.

If you're the Hebrew nomand reading this or listening to this account during Moses' time, then what's the mental picture in your head?

So u saying it can only be used in the past and now considered obsolete ? Since it says world, it is really the world. Otherwise surely people can escape the flood easily by climbing up the mountains and therefore god becomes wrong in noah ark where noah is the only family left.<br><br>Second, , if the flood can cover till the tallest of the peak, lets say by your preposition of only a localise region, by gravity the flood will flow over to the other side of the mountain and it will never be able to cover till the tallest mountain as well. The only way to really cover water till the mountain top is only by making sure the whole world is cover by water in the flood.<br><br><blockquote>Ah .. it is 'cos of this kind of mentality that's why science is not progressing.

If u twist it to make it advance evolution then some other people might twist it to advance their objective of giving their life savings to the leader. Even if u manage to twist the scripture completely to accept evolution, there r many many areas which it is still wrong.
