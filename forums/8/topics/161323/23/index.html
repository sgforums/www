Furthermore, recognizing a new species during a formative stage can be difficult, because biologists sometimes disagree about how best to define a species. The most widely used definition, Mayr's Biological Species Concept, recognizes a species as a distinct community of reproductively isolated populations--sets of organisms that normally do not or cannot breed outside their community. In practice, this standard can be difficult to apply to organisms isolated by distance or terrain or to plants (and, of course, fossils do not breed). Biologists therefore usually use organisms' physical and behavioral traits as clues to their species membership.<br><br>Nevertheless, the scientific literature does contain reports of apparent speciation events in plants, insects and worms. In most of these experiments, researchers subjected organisms to various types of selection -- for anatomical differences, mating behaviors, habitat preferences and other traits -- and found that they had created populations of organisms that did not breed with outsiders. For example, William R. Rice of the University of New Mexico and George W. Salt of the University of California at Davis demonstrated that if they sorted a group of fruit flies by their preference for certain environments and bred those flies separately over 35 generations, the resulting flies would refuse to breed with those from a very different environment.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I've not been around the witness the creation of man or the universe, though I wish i have been.<br><br>But I've seen the creation of other stuff.  Man's creation of Artificial intelligence, modern structures, sky scrapers.  Artificial intelligence such as robots, computers didn evolve from single celled organisms, that I am sure.<br><br>Yet, I've not seen any signs of evolution. On the contrary, I've seen signs of genetic mutations, more and more diseases, cancer.  According to the theory of evolution, shouldn't any changes to a species be for the "better" and survival of the species?  I've not seen humans become resistant to cancer etc etc.<br><br>I really used to believe in evolution when I was in my sec school days. I believed in that the earth was billions of years old.  It wasn't until my friend pointed me at the right perspective to look at things then I realised that the evolution theory is very flawed.  In fact, after reading up more about this, that i realised that most scientific evidence proves creation rather than evolution.<br><br>After asking around, emailing a couple of people.  I finally found out why.  Evolution was never proven.  It has been what has always been, a collection of theories that seem to fit.  And only the ones that fit, would belong in the evolution theory.<br><br>One of them was the evolution of creatures.  An example, the sea cucumber.  According to evolution beliefs, the sea cucumber evolved a defense mechanism that allowed it to turn itself inside out for predators to eat some of its insides, so that the entire sea  cucumber itself would survive the attack.  They believed that was evolved.  If the process to evolve such a defense took millions of years, sea-cucumbers would be extinct, cos most would have died in the process of trying to develop such an ability.<br><br>Another thing that evolution cannot answer is, where does the DNA to improve or evolve a creature come from?  In order for a species to change and develop new capabilities, eg from monkey to man, there must be changes in the DNA.  And yet, there has been no observation of variations in DNA towards the improvement of a species, not even in the tiniest step.  All the research that has been done so far, required man's intervention to change and variate the dna.<br><br>(For those who are not sure of the implication of DNA.  DNA are basically the building blocks of any living object.  Its like a programming code containing the instructions for a creature's specification.  Eg, black hair, blue eyes, lungs or gills etc.)<br><br>Because of all the above mentioned, i couldn't no longer bring myself to believe that things around us evolve or are evolving.  I've only seen things mutate, and for the worse.  Not for the better.</div>

But, the fruit flies remained to be fruit flies don't they?  They didn't become fireflies, unlike what evolution suggests.  That that single celled organisms became fish which then came on land, some became apes and some eventually man.  The species dont' change.<br><br>A dogs continue to remain as dogs, crocs as crocs, cats as cats.  There maybe variations in their color, size, breeding habits, but no changes that could be even considered a step to becoming another species.  No new dna was introduced.  Those changes in size, breeding habits and etc, happened cos their DNA allowed for it.<br><br>We cannot say that probably after 3500 generations the fruitflies would become fireflies or smth else.  We mustn't forget that in science, we need to be able to prove something by recording observations of the process.  Science is not coming up with theories that seem to fit.  Its is a study, a record, and observation and experimentation.</div>

They believed that was evolved.  [b]If the process to evolve such a defense took millions of years, sea-cucumbers would be extinct, cos most would have died in the process of trying to develop such an ability.</strong><br><br>Another thing that evolution cannot answer is, where does the DNA to improve or evolve a creature come from?  In order for a species to change and develop new capabilities, eg from monkey to man, there must be changes in the DNA.  <strong>And yet, there has been no observation of variations in DNA towards the improvement of a species, not even in the tiniest step</strong>.  All the research that has been done so far, required man's intervention to change and variate the dna.<br><br>Because of all the above mentioned,<strong> i couldn't no longer bring myself to believe that things around us evolve or are evolving</strong>.  I've only seen things mutate, and for the worse.  Not for the better.[/b]</blockquote>Firstly, on your example on sea cucumber, evolution is not about changes in the characteristic of a single organism. Sea cucumber CANNOT JUST evolved a defense mechanism that allowed it to turn itself inside out for predators to eat some of its insides. Evolution is about the accumulated changes of HERITABLE traits found in the population. The traits which you have described is a naturally occuring trait that is found in small numbers in the entire population. Possible causes of this trait is due to genetic variation within the population. It can be due to random mutation, independent assortment during meiosis one, or meiosis two, random fertilisation etc.<br><br>The trait become common in sea cucumber due to directional selection. Predation acts as a selection pressure and those sea cucumbers with the ability you have mentioned are at a selective advantage. They are more likely to survive and pass on their genetic traits to the next generation. This leads to increase in allele frequency of the ability you mention.<br><br>And please, for some who say that no one has ever seen evolution taking place, therefore evolution is flawed, that is such a slippery slope argument. WE ARE PART OF THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION, once we die, only a small process of evolution has completed. We will need to die many times and have be able to retain our memory in order to observe evolution. And some say that for many years, human have not evolved.. and that's for a very very simple fact. HUMANS ARE UNDERGOING STABILISING SELECTION! There is only evolution if the population is undergoing directional selection. Evolution is not taken for granted to happen just because a long time has passed.<br><br>And shotgun, you mentioned that there's no observation of variation in DNA towards improvement of a species.. I frankly do not know where you get that from, perhaps from secondary school textbook, but there is variation due to natural selection. The 3% difference of our human DNA with that of APE's resulted in the two distinct population.<br><br>And for one thing, you are damn right to say that things around us are not evolving. Because of one simple fact, you don't live long enough to see things evolve. And for the human population, if there is no selection pressure, even after you wait for one godzillion years, you will not see evolution.</div>
