I know you will play with words like say he doesn't speak like blah blah to protect. You say I miss out that well but I basically scrutinise each and every verse in Genesis currently. So fill me in on what I missed out?<br><br>Btw, refer to my posting why G*d need to called out Where are you? He should be powerful enuff to detect Adam n Eve hiding among the trees rite?

One day, in 11th Century, the Eastern Europe side broke away and has been known as the Eastern Orthodox Church.<br><br>Then in 15th Century, a few groups broke away from the Roman Catholic Church and they are known as the Protestants.  But they always prefer to be called Christians rather than Protestants while the Catholics prefer to be called Catholics for the word means Universal.<br><br>To summarise the whole thing... here's the equation....<br><br>Protestant + Catholic + Eastern Orthodox = Christianity.<br><br>End of presentation.  Thankyou. </div></blockquote>ok sorry sorry sorry sorry.. but i just had to say something.<br>no we are not all equal to christianity.<br>we all believe in Jesus. yes.<br>but. protestants are not all the christians ya know!! haah. theres still the apostolics, presbytherians and all that.<br>but ok. what im trying to say is.. pple break away from the doctrine they think is wrong thats why theres so many different denominations.<br>but Catholics believe in worshipping Mary AND Jesus. thats why there are people who dont believe we should worship Mary. hence the protestants.she is an ordinary vessel after all used by God to bring Jesus into the world.<br><br>so u would think. then why dont we just trace back to what the doctrince was in the very first place? like what Jesus has taught his apostles(disciples)? wont they know the most?<br>hence, apostolic. it is the oneness truth of God. most people interpret that God is The father, the son, and the holy spirit.<br>but Jesus IS the father, He is the son and his spirit IS the holy spirit.<br>(if you're like:what rubbish doesnt make sense) PR me. i have the explanation. not mine. the bible's..k?)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>which brings us to who's right?! Jews or christians?/<br>well. know why the jews just dont get the christians? and vise versa?coz they think that we believe that God is 3. and they're fumbled. because the whole of Jerusalem is brought u to know that ''Hear O Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord''. but they dont know... that out there.. there is still yet. the apostolic christians. thats why.. the apostolic truth is out there. its changing the world whether u know it or not. all christians are not protestants.<br>and pleasee.. if ur gonna say. aiya. protestant! apostolic!catholic! all believe in God so all the same la!

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe the link is unaccessible but I copied out the phrases below. Kindly explain the plurality in it?<br><br>And God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, after Our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'" Genesis 1:26<br><br>"The LORD God said, 'Behold, the man has become like one of US, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever'" Genesis 3:22<br><br>"Come, let US go down and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech." Genesis 11:7<br><br>For ppl keen to know why there are so many languages it is not supposed to happen look at below<br><br>"And the LORD said: They are one (echad) people, and they have all one language." Genesis 11:6<br><br>So the only reason is like Genesis 11:7 about the Tower of Baal and hence got a lot of language and a lot of different color skin ppl after that.<br><br>For ppl who wanna ask Christain question I have learned smart I study their verses and ask them comment on it cuz it is a more direct way  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
