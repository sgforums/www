Another sign of de-evolution rather than evolution.  I believe that the people of the past were definitely much smarter than us today.  They still hold the key to many secrets that we are still guessing.  How was the pyramid built? How much mathematical knowledge do the ancient egyptians really have access to?<br><br>If <strong>according to the theory of evolution, shouldn't the ability to understand these mathematical mysteries have been encoded into our genes somewhat already</strong>?  Why have they been forgotten?<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>to stupidissmart, i really admire you for your patience in arguing your case. They are convincing and logical to me, because i know that for what you have argued, you have evidences for them.<br><br>I stopped reading his post when i reach the part when he says <strong>shouldnt the ability to understand these mathematical mysteries have been encoded into our genes somewhat already?</strong><br><br>Firstly, the ability to build pyramids and to be able to understand mathematical equations does not equate that the population is smarter than us. Hey come on,i would agree that some of them are indeed smarter than us, but do all those workers who help in building those pyramids understand mathematical theories? They were merely following instructions given by their pharoah. So because some genius came out with the plan to build pyramids u conclude that the whole population is smarter than us?<br><br>Secondly, <strong>even</strong> so if the whole population is smarter than us, you said according to the theory of evolution, future generations would retain this genetic trait also... (three drops of sweat drop down my fore head.) Hey this is more of the Medelian's law of genetic inheritance than theory of evolution. By saying that according to the theory of evolution, future generations would retain this genetic trait, you are assuming that only smart people can survive and dumb people don't. This is clearly wrong as dumb people can also earn their living, survive and reproduce. We will only evolve to be smarter if most dumb people cannot survive and cannot reproduce. So if dumb people are not at a selective disadvantage, why should the population now be smart or be able to understand their mathematical theories?? Our population consist of both smart and dumb people and that is in line with theory of evolution.<br><br>Conclusion: shotgun does not understand evolution well enough to argue against it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woah, I believe someone just suan me, saying I dun understand a thing about evolution.  Well, nevermind.  Let me say again, I was a stonge believe of the evolution theory, and once did argue that creationist theory was without any form of human logic.<br><br>But my perspective has changed.<br><br>Now, about the Light and Sun thing. That shows how limited our human capabilities to comprehend is.   How on earth was light created before  a source of light was created?  Its not logical right? Impossible right? Light cannot exist without a source.<br><br>Like i said, for this, we have to think like a programmer.  The concept of light was first created.  Then, later, the source of light was created to govern the light.  Which means, if the source is there, light is there.<br><br>I entered into this arguement knowing well that I would not be able to convince an evolutionist to jump over to the creationist side of the fence.  Reason is, that is what we were taught since young.  I was taught that a big bang happened, and a unbelievable coincidence of events followed that resulted in the planet Earth being formed.  And followed by another impossible coincidence that Earth's position in relation to the sun was just perfect for it to support life.  And then followed by another unbelievable coincidence of event, life began to evolve. And thru some strange coincidence, intelligence in life began to develop, and somehow only us humans became the supreme intellect being, that could architect its species into becoming a civilisation.<br><br>Be scientific about the probability of that happening?<br><br>Its like an explosion in printing house, causing all the ink paper and bindings to explode in multiple directions.  The ink all landing at precise spots on the paper, the paper falling in precise order one on top of the other, and bindings meticulously binding the papers, finally resulting in the latest edition of the Oxford Advanced Learner's dictionary.  That is much more likely.<br><br>The case of Sodom was simple.  That was in the genesis chapters of the bible.    Man was a fallen creation.  And the city of sodom was so full of sin that God's righteousness cannot allow its existence.  So where is the tender loving God of the bible that most Christians believe?<br><br>Well, first of all, the destruction of the city might have been to prevent the evil from that city from spreading.  Dooming all of humanity.  And at that time, Christ has yet to die on the cross to redeem their sin.  Prophets warned the city, yet, the city refused to believe.  There was not much option.<br><br>The God of the bible was not just a God of love, that could close 1 eye to allow such evil to continue.  He was also a God of Holiness, Righteousness and the judge.  If a Judge had to handle a case, where his own son was convicted off, he has handle the case with utmost professionalism.  If his son is convicted of murder, and proven so, he still has to sentence his son to hang, despite his love for his own flesh and blood.  U get what i mean?</div>

Light and Darkness, and set aside 12 hours to govern the day, and 12 the night.  That would make up a day.  And 7 days to a week.  In John 11:9, Jesus himself mentioned of a 12 hour day and 12 hour night?<br><br>I do believe that when Genesis said 6 days, it really meant 6, 24 hour days as we know.  God could have done so in 6 seconds, but i guess he chose 6 days for His own reason.<br><br>Now, I am not saying that you are wrong.  Since God is beyond time, and since time is relative, u could be right in a way.  What I am saying is that, God intended for us to understand it as 6 human days.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nov 15, 2005<br><strong>Man's evolution from monkey a proven scientific fact? No, it's not </strong><br><br>I watched the show 'A Species Odyssey' on Channel NewsAsia on November 6 and was very concerned with the way the highly debatable theory of human evolution was presented as a fact.<br><br>While micro-evolution, ie the process of mutation and natural selection, can be observed in nature and is a proven fact, macro-evolution - the theory that all the organisms we see today resulted from the micro-evolution of simpler pre-existing organisms, which ultimately came from non-living matter - is not a proven fact.<br><br>It is in fact contradicted by huge gaps in the fossil records as well as other theoretical considerations (see www.answersingenesis.org).<br><br>Because of the evidence and theoretical considerations, many scientists have now repudiated the theory of macro-evolution (see, for example www.discovery.org/articleFiles/PDFs/100ScientistsAd.pdf), and the number is increasing despite the 'persecutions' by scientific establishments wishing to maintian their unwarranted naturalistic philosophy. (See Dr Jonathan Well's The Icons of Evolution, chapter 12).<br><br>We must note carefully that micro-evolution does not necessarily imply macro-evolution. Micro-evolution only implies that given enough time, living things may change as they adapt to the environment. For example, given enough time, apes may change.<br><br>But micro-evolution does not necessarily imply that all the living organisms that we see today originates from pre-existing organisms. For example, to say that apes may change given enough time does not necessarily imply that man did come from apes. Above all, micro-evolution does not explain how the RNA/DNA comes about in the first place. (See www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/magazines/TJ/docs/tjv10n3_origin_life.pdf).<br><br>Paleontologists often construct the supposed intermediates between monkeys and humans with much imagination and subjectivity which resemble myth-writing. (See The Icons of Evolution, chapter 11). Many such constructions have in fact been proven false (eg the Piltdown man which deceived scientists from early 1900s to 1953), while the remaining ones are highly debatable (see www.answersingenesis.org).<br><br>People should not be given the idea that evolution from monkey to man is a proven fact of science when it is not and the media should not just present one side of the story without presenting the evidence and theoretical considerations that contradict it.<br><br>While many books showing the fallacy of macro-evolution can now be found in bookshops and the National Library in Singapore (eg Dr Michael Denton's Evolution, a theory in crisis, Dr Michael Behe's Darwin's Black box), documentaries showing the fallacy of macro-evolution should also be shown on TV to let the public know the truth about our origin.<br><br>Andrew Loke Ter Ern (Dr)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Again. Psalms are hymns that are written to praise the Greatness of God.

To describe that God is great and beyond time.<br><br>In anycase, the book of psalms was compiled during the time of David's reign.  Psalm 90 itself was attributed to the prayer of moses... which is still a long long time from creation.<br><br>However, like I have conceded, that God is supposed to be beyond time.  But, as the scriptures were intended for Man's understanding, when it said "Days" it really meant 6 human days.<br><br>It is like an author writing a story in a book.<br><br>He can take as long as he like to write about a man's trip to the loo.
