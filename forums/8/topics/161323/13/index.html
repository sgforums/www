But, the point here is that Chit Chat is not  the place to do so. If we were to engage in debating about this here, it will result in bible verses and theological arguments going back and forth.<br><br>Finally, it will disintergrate into statements such as "you are wrong","you've distorted salvation",etc.<br><br>Chit Chat, i believe is not the place for constructive debate on theological differences. Eh or the Catholic forum is a better place.<br><br>By what, you have posted it will create provoke negative responses from people on either side of the fence. So, once again go to EH or the Catholic forum.</div>
