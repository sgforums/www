            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>God's given us a free will--and we can choose what we want to believe in and what we don't</blockquote>Tat is true. While u r at it, try to use your free will and believe u r bill gate or george bush or even jesus christ yourself. Too bad for me I only believe in wat I preceive as the truth<br><br><blockquote>like, a big explosion and everything falling together to form earth and its organisms?<br>using the same logic--does that mean if i take the right amount of bricks, cement, glass and steel at blow it all up, after a few thousand years, with the right conditions, weather and temperature, it could all fall together to form something like the empire state building? </blockquote>Neh... the logic is probably under the given circumstances of our planet our type of life can form. Who knows maybe in some other planet somewhere their life requires a very high temperature which we will burn<br><br><blockquote>or maybe if i wanted a car i could just take some rubber, metal and leather [for the seats, of course] and shake them all up together and i could come up with a volks beetle.<br>cheap, and effective.</blockquote>If u got *infinite* people helping u to shake, with *infinite* material and each is capable of *infinite* "shake" per second, maybe u can form your volks beetle<br><br><blockquote>One thing established is that God is holy, his perfect standard cannot condone sin. But the characteristic of his love of man is demonstrated by him, allowing humans to remain whenever he can find a way out, and around the sin.<br></blockquote>If god really cannot condone sin, then no matter if u believe in christ or not he still cannot condone sin. Yet strangely just because christian believe in christ then sin doesn't matter anymore.<br><br><blockquote>In the banishment of Adam and Eve from the garden of eden, the punishment was already served and Adam n eve knew their mistake. Hence they were spared. But, they no longer had the provisions they once had from Eden. Importantly, man was spared. </blockquote>Man was spared from wat ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> He die, he had to work, he had to go through labour and all animals had to suffer the same fate and strangely all the world pop up evil things like diesease or virus etc and everything fall. All tis because 2 person eat a fruit. Sounds like over reacting ?<br><br><blockquote>In the times of noah, evil n sin was everywhere. And again, by His perfect standard, he had to judge man for their evil. Fortunately, Noah's family remained because Noah's family had feared God. The rest simply did not. In the passage, it stated that God was grieved by what man had become, and had no choice but to do so. We know from there, that God too has emotions. </blockquote>As said, simple things like eating too much in a buffet is considered as a sin according to some teachings. In fact preparing for an important exam and sort of neglect god is also a very great sin. He is really demanding a superhuman model of perfection which no normal man can fulfil. Tis is to achieve the effect of making the believer feels guilty and inadequate.<br><br><blockquote>In short, we see a characteristic of God in the Bible where he would exercise his mercy wherever he could</blockquote>Give me an example<br><br><blockquote>My friend, God did not create disease, and death to plague man. If Adam had not eaten of the tree, there would be no sin, thus no death nor disease. In fact, Adam and eve were pretty much vegetarians in the beginning since God said he gave to them every fruit bearing tree as food (except for the tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil). The giving of animals as food later, after sin. </blockquote>If u believe in creationist, then u have to believe some being created virus and bacteria, which r living beings as well. If u believe in bible, u have to believe tat the virus exist on the very day god created the animals or plants. Otherwise u r implying some other great being have the capability of creating new life. In your case u r implying men already has the power to create new life.<br><br><blockquote>Life is unfair. I admit it, but one truth is, God never promised life to be fair. In fact, God never promised life to be easy for Christians either. For Christians, life is very often facing persecution. Look at how many of the apostles came to unnatural ends for preaching the gospel? If they weren't decapitated, they were hung upside down on the cross. </blockquote>Yup, life isn't fair. If u weren't christian in the inquisition period, your life is probably ended by being burned on the stake. If they weren't burn, they will be tortured to death<br><br><blockquote>Life is not all there is. God uses life on earth, to prepare us to mold us for eternity. Men was never made to die. That is why many of us seek to find ways to leave a legacy. Life is a trial, a test that shapes our character. </blockquote>Where in the bible do u read tat ?<br><br><blockquote>Like I said, the issue of macro evolution, evolution of species to species, can never be proven. It will forever remain as what it is, theory upon theory. If it was already proven why are scientist still looking for evidence to "prove" it further? If a convict was already guilty of crime worthy of death, would prosecuting him further make him guiltier? It hasn't been proven, ppl just refuse to believe it, and I don't blame them. </blockquote>As mention in the previosu reply before, nobody is writing any journals paper etc to prove evolution. Tis is because in the scientific field it is already proven without a doubt. However no matter wat is said there will always be people who refuse to accept the facts.<br><br><blockquote>My friend, true enough, every little sin in our lives would probably convict us terribly in the sight of God. But God has also provided a way out, for us, and that is thru Jesus Christ. </blockquote>Don't u think tat is double standard ? He can forgive any sins just because u believe in christ yet he can't forgive sin if u don't believe. He is not serious about not condoning sin. He can forgives sin but he just don't want to<br><br><blockquote>It is because the gravity of our wrong doings is so severe, that forgiveness is imperative. If we do not forgive others of their wrong doings to us, God won't forgive us for our wrong doings. If we are able to forgive others, and accept the forgiveness of others, don't u think the world would be in a lot less trouble today? The problem was never with God, but with us. </blockquote>If god can forgives people no matter who they r first, then we wouldn't have to face so much religious issues now. The world will be in less trouble today.<br><br><blockquote>From the scriptures, we understand that for God to destroy people hurts Him as well. His spirit grieves that he had to judge man for what man does. Which is why the scripture emphasises on forgiveness, as God himself finds ways to spare humanity. Before Sodom was levelled, or nuked as I sometimes like to think of it, God agreed to multiple plea attempts to spare the city from Abraham. Until Abraham pleaded for 10. Out of a whole city, Abraham couldn't find 10.. Fortunately for those he found, were spared. But city itself was levelled. What does that tell us? God is always willing to show mercy where he can. </blockquote>Where in the scripture did u see grieving of god when he destroy cities and tribes ? He destroy the whole city of sodom and I see no grieving from god in there. And it is not abraham who can't find the peopel, it is god, and god ask for impossible supernatural type of perfection and no normal man fulfil it. When he kill the first born of egypt, did he show grieve ? When he kill almost all the people in the world during noah does he show grieve ? When he wipe out the tribe of midianites does he show any mercy ? Neh...<br><br></div>

Be it by books or whatsoever, what is the justification for accepting one religion being true over another?And if we can realise that those tribes with their pagan beliefs are definitely astray, why cannot you realise the same for Christianity? How much more reliable is a book vs songs and stories in the grand scale of things. Would writing a book about pagan beliefs make it anymore true?Therefore, we can see that religion is a reproducable entity which would develop in any human society even those not exposed to jesus and such..thus i cannot see how one can be so convinced Christianity is true since, it could very well be a man made ideology..why should we reject the pagan beliefs yet accept christianity?<br><br>You also failed to respond to what religion would you be holding onto now if you were born in different circumstances..would you still be going on and on about the bible and stuff, if you were taught from young to worship the moon or something?The problem with faith is that it would always have a blind element to it, you can never say for certain, god exist..let alone Jesus being god..when he breathed the same air as we, needed to eat as we and died at the hands of man..<br><br>by mere circumstance, Christianity has spread further and is more extensive, is it based on this mere fact, you can say that unrefutably christianity is correct?I beg to differ because if you were born a staunch buddhist, with buddhist friends, you won't be here going on and on basing arguments on a book to which its origin is cast in shadows..religion and the belief in it is a mere matter of circumstance and at the end of the day..when you die and see the darkness that enshrouds you,and you are all alone..maybe you will scream for jesus and he will not come,..and you would start thinking.."SHIT!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Adam &amp; eve was spared from the judgement of God, but they still had to suffer the consequences of their sin.  The consequences of Sin is inevitable.  Even though if someone forgives u for stealing stuff from his store, u will still suffer the consequences of your crime, be it a legal reprimand or being known as a thief.<br><br>Adam and eve didn eat ANY old fruit.  It was a fruit of the knowledge of good and evil.  It was something that God specifically COMMANDED them not to eat, but they ate.<br><br>U know, u are right that God demands a superhuman standard of righteousness, and perfection.  It is because He is God after all.<br><br>I disagree with your last sentence.  God doesn't want man to feel guilty and inadequate.  But it is because we are all sinners, that we are indeed guilty and inadequate.<br><br>Please open your eyes, and read before you reply.  I have given you 2 examples in the previous reply.<br><br>And no, virus and all the diseases came after the fall of man.  After the fall of man, a process called death and destruction began.  And I believe that is when the first diseases and sicknesses began.<br><br>The bible has made multiple references to life on earth as a race, as a trial.  Something that is not permanent, because God intended man for eternity.  We see some examples from James 1:12<br><br><blockquote>As mention in the previosu reply before, nobody is writing any journals paper etc to prove evolution. Tis is because in the scientific field it is already proven without a doubt. However no matter wat is said there will always be people who refuse to accept the facts.<br></blockquote>Again, let me say.  If its proven, why are they still trying to prove it.  Why isn't it called a "Fact" yet.  You keep saying that, its a theory that can be considered a fact, then why is it still called a theory.  You said I was narrow in my perception that I could not accept this theory as a fact.<br><br>Let me tell you why.   I call a dog, a "dog", a cat, a "cat".  A spoon, a "spoon", and a fork, a "fork."  I do not call a dog, a "cat", just that it meows, but it still has four legs, a tail, and cos of that, can also be considered a dog.    I do not call a fork a "spoon" just that it has slits in between, and can also be used to scoop stuff.<br><br>Theory is "theory,"  Fact is "FACT."  Do not blur the lines and say, "its a theory that can be considered as a fact."  There is no such thing.<br><br>Like I said before.  Despite God's grief, God also has a righteous anger against the wicked and the sinners.  And because of that, Sodom and Gamorrah was destroyed.  In Gen 6:7, it shows that God was grieved by his own creation.<br><br>Again, let me say specifically to you Stupidissmart. If you don't believe, you have your right to walk away.  Do not continue to slander the beliefs of another faith.  In Singapore, freedom of religious practice is very precious, and I believe our government will protect it in order to maintain religious harmony.  Do not make false claims of a faith that you do not believe in.<br><br><blockquote>As said, simple things like eating too much in a buffet is considered as a sin according to some teachings. In fact preparing for an important exam and sort of neglect god is also a very great sin. He is really demanding a superhuman model of perfection which no normal man can fulfil. Tis is to achieve the effect of making the believer feels guilty and inadequate.<br></blockquote>Your last sentence is an example.<br></div>
