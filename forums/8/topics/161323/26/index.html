            <div class='col-md body'>Ha8n, dun really understand what that meant.<br><br>I am arguing this as much as possible as neutral scientific pov as possible.  After understanding how evolution theory was first concieved, later added, and constantly shifting, I would not believe it even if I did not believe in God.  Scientifically, its has not been validated as a fact.<br><br>Just to supplement a bit on Charles Darwin's beliefs, the following is an excerpt of  his thoughts on his theory of evolution and God.<br><blockquote>Charles Darwin rejected both the positivistic outlook and the biblical literalism that were championed in his day. Although he is usually thought of as subversive to all creation theories, an examination of his personal writings and his major work, Origin of Species, shows this view to be incorrect. He related some themes of biblical theology to natural selection in a sophisticated manner. His formal education gave him excellent preparation for the religious aspects of this endeavor, since the only academic degree he ever earned was in theology, after a three-year course of study at Cambridge University. A main text in the curriculum was written by archdeacon William Paley. Decades later Darwin recalled: "I do not think I hardly ever admired a book more than PaleyÂ’s Natural Theology. I could almost formerly have said it by heart."</blockquote>He was initially to be a minister, hence his understanding in theology.  After drifting away from his theological beliefs, he wrote his book, Origin of Species, perhaps out of spite, adamantly leaving out all trace of God.<br><br>Unfortunately, what I feel is this.  Despite coming up with his theory, he still cannot explain what is "life."  He may have come up with evolution, but he hasn't come up with an explanation to what life is.  What is this "life" that seperates a live cell, and a dead cell.  Is "life" just this little electrical discharge or something?<br><br>Even if evolution can explain where species evolved from, even if it was true... what began it all?  What created the very first of everything?</div>

The previous reply u say tat whales have legs before then it suddenly don't have legs now. Isn't tat already a good sign of evolution ? U r still using the theory of evolution in tis<br><br><blockquote>U see, the entire evolution theory was thought of by a man who refused to believe in God.

It is evolution that has been presenting theories, hence it is evolution's side of the fence that has to constantly come up with supposed evidence and co-relation to its theory.

It has been stated many times tat evolution is a fact. On the other hand creationist r really "theories" since they come out with either terribly weak argument or naught.<br><br><blockquote>Its like a history of an event that is being constantly re-written. How can we call that history accurate if its always being re-written?</blockquote>When has evolution generally been constantly re-written ? The bible seems to be the one tat constantly re-write its policies ? (slavery, reading of bible, women rights, flat earth, sun revolves around earth, evolution)<br><br></div>

In the mid 1980s a French/Egyptian team investigated the Great Pyramid using ultrasound technology. Their efforts revealed that large cavities within the structure had been filled with pure sand. This is referred to as the "chamber method", and could have considerably increased the pace of work. In addition, we also know that the Great Pyramid utilized a rock outcropping as part of its core. These discoveries, as Miroslav Verner notes, made all the careful calculations and estimates concerning how many millions of stone blocks make up the Great Pyramid, and the associated speculations, useless.</span><br></div>
