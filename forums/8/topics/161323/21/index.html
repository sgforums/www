My almost entire point about anything in this....Is that the idea that the ____________(insert your version) version of the Bible is 100% the "word of God" and therefore the utmost truth...Is flawed. Everyone, including all different sects (cant recall the proper name - protestants, catholics, etc. the word of distinction) of Christianity have all agreed that the Bible has been editted and changed many times since its inception...

Go flip the Tanakh.

For a superficial understanding, see it in the Wiki at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh</a>. They list some basic differences, but a lot of the differences have to do with the specific content of the books, and the fact that they were mainly written in Aramaic, as was much of the old Bible.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>No .. thank God for that.

" Precisely 'cos God didn't that's why you have to thank Him mah.<br></strong></blockquote>Ah....But the ones who do understand it properly? Is that due to God? If so, then which is it - did he or did he not give them to his believers?<br>If not, and it were due to the hard spiritual and temporal work of man, then..I wonder how that can implicate other ideas...<br><br>And I'd appreciate laying off the "You People" thing....I am of no group, and have not grouped you generally either...<br>And I didn't say "why didnt God write Earth is round?" because God didn't "write" anything. Man did. Inspired, revelation, whatever, man's understanding at the time was not enough to do so.<br><br>I also didn't say "Why didn't Jesus appear in front of me?"<br></div>

Being sad little bible huggers, there is a huge tendency that you have a strong bias towards the Bible, and it becomes purely impossible for you to have a proper evaluation of the situation.<br><br>To give an analogy of what is happening here, imagine there is slice of cake on a table. You leave it for a while..and when you come back the cake is gone. You have no idea how it happened. Your friend who was in the room told you two stories. It could be that someone took it and ate it..and this hypothesis is backed by maybe the presence of some crumbs and fingerprints, and also because your friend has like bits of cake in his teeth.. But he also mentions a second hypothesis that Spongebob and Patrick came from the bikini bottom down there and jumped out of the sea to take your cake. Since, you were not there you cannot tell..So do you believe the hypothesis based on scientific proofs or do you just base it what you friend tells you?<br><br>Thats the same as Christianity,you have a book,you have a few priests and you have a pope..and they tell you..hey got a god ah..and you must pray and go church ah..and then you go heaven ah..then the pagans all would die go to hell ah...and you say..yes sir yes sir three fucking bags full..and nod your head like a damn goondu and listen...<br><br>Or, you could actually use your brains, and see that well life came about..and well..at present evolution best explains it with physical proof...not some mumbo jumbo rubbish about miracles...which is simply the placebo effect..well...even if evolution may not answer everything yet..it offers a more stable substantiated perspective in comparison to Christianity...<br><br>So..stop all the hubris about how christians good lah what not lah..for goodness sake...the proliferation of the religion is based on bloodshed during the crusades and all..are you telling me that having war upon those who do not share you believes and forcing it upon them , and by sheer scale, the religion spreads, and becomes believed, that it becomes true? Like that we are like typical Singaporeans ah, gahmen say we have the freedom of press is a good thing, we also nod head..yes sir yes sir three fucking bags full of shit...<br><br>Bloody annoying...of all religions...only the christians are so bloody pushy about their religion..with the ceaseless evangelism and all..does the religion not teach christians to live with the differences?must make people be like them than happy?many people are not interested..so if you are lost in your obsession with your religion, keep it to yourself...<br><br>P.S. feeling damn annoyed reading all the rubbish from girlnextdoor all this...fuming ah..sorry if i rub any of you people the wrong way...its is an open forum..not my fault that its displayed in a non bible hugger exclusive thread..</div></blockquote>sorry...  i mean.. u wouldnt really know this and its not your fault but its coz Jesus said that ''i am the way the truth and the light, and there is no other way except by me that any man might be saved''<br><br>yeah.. thats why we're the only ''religion''  if thats what u wanna call it.. that evangelise. i wont post anymore new posts about stuff.. ill only answer Qns k? coz. Christians do evangelise, see that is our purpose in the first place. to be fishers of man.<br>so please, sorry if i offended u in any way but i was just answering Qns that people kept questioning in a long chain.. so i couldnt find myself stopping... coz there was always something to reply to. hope u really understand and all.  i dont evangelise here. this isnt the right place to do it anyway.. i only answer questions pple ask me thats all... yup.<br><br></div>

I'm familiar with the Tanakh. I do have some basic knowledge of Jewish theology and their scriptural interpretation. I scanned the wiki. What's the majority in there not in the Bible? Don't shock me.

Authors were men - "illiterate", genius, madman or divine inspiration - they were men.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You said "And Jesus never said he was God either. The original translation was Light." So arent you trying to suggest Jesus wasnt God as claimed by the Christians?</strong></blockquote>Nope. I don't work that way.

He used other labels which were enough to implicate him in a blasphemy charge.</strong></blockquote>Does being charged with blasphemy equate one to "God"? Someone earlier said this whole thread was blasphemy...<br><br><blockquote><strong>I sniff a strawman. Who said the Bible is 100% the word of God and utmost truth?

I said "the idea" because that is the feeling that comes across from the evangelists. Utmost truth for what - for everything. Evangelists (I am using this term for the moment to describe Christians in general [<span style="font-style: italic;">but could be any religion</span>] that evangelicise their beliefs, to the point of pointing to the Bible as historical document, and as the ultimate and end-all answer to ANY question asked about spiritual topics, or those of depth. I am referring to answers that say "cuz the bible sez so", when in fact it either does not say so, or it is "translated that way" by their church, etc...<br><br><blockquote><strong>I may have missed the slip even though I'm a careful person. But you could be mistaken also. Show me the slip?</strong></blockquote>It was based on the fact that firstly this "cannonization" was not the only handling of the content of the books. That the English Bible we have today is very different from when the books were written. That to base answers around a book(s), knowing that the content has been skillfully editted, <strong>without</strong> finding out more about it's history, different version throughout history, etc etc etc, is ridiculous. But it is what the majority do.<br>My whole point, again....Is based on the idea of <strong>willful ignorance</strong>, my extreme distaste for it, and so most of my points will usually come from that idea - the encouragement of Christians to study more than just today's Bible, if they truly wish to know their religion.<br>For those who wish to have a "meaningful relationship with God," then it is a different matter, and a personal spiritual journey. Mixing the two "types" together without proper ammunition is obviously not the way to go.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Yea .. I'm familiar with the Tanakh.

Aside from that, we also have the Council of Nicea...<br><br>Written in Aramaic - what's the point? The point goes back to the idea of different languages being translated.
