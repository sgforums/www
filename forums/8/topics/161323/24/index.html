I have posted a reply on it on page 7 to answer icemoon but it seems tat nobody wanna comment on it. I guess I just reproduced them here<br><br>I find it quite strange tat people believe in microevolution and not macroevolution. U already believe species changes and evolved over time and these changes can be very great (comparing the chihuahua with the english mastiffs). The difference is only the scale of evolution, and is really microevolution over a greater time scale. A single small mutation is really the thing tat seperate between species...<br><br>http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/<br>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroevolution<br><br>On evidence u can find the above website to be useful.<br><br>Some abstract from it<br><br>Macroevolution is controversial only outside the scientific community, and aspects of it are disputed by many movements such as creationism and intelligent design.<br><br>Single small mutations are sometimes the main difference between one species and another. Scientists have discovered very important genes, such as the homeobox, which regulate the growth of animals in their embryonic state. Scientists have managed to create new species of fly by irradiating the homeobox gene, causing a radical mutation in the development of the segments of the body. The fly may grow an extra thorax, or grow legs out of its eyestalks, all due to a single base pair alteration. The additional information needed for these structures did not arise from the mutation, of course, but existed elsewhere in the animal's DNA and was replicated at the novel location. It has been proposed that centipedes and millipedes originated from insect precursors, but their homeobox gene mutated and they ended up growing dozens of body segments instead of just one. A very small change, and an entire species is formed.<br><br>Microevolution can easily be demonstrated in the laboratory to the satisfaction of most observers. Whilst speciation events have been demonstrated in the laboratory and observed in the field, really dramatic differences between species do not usually occur in directly observable timescales (it occurs too quickly for the process to be shown in the fossil record.) It is argued that, since macroevolution can not be confirmed by a controlled experiment, it cannot be considered to be part of a scientific theory. However, evolutionists counter that astronomy, geology, archaeology and the other historical sciences, like macroevolution, have to check hypotheses through natural experiments. They confirm hypotheses by finding out if they conform or fit with the physical or observational evidence and can make valid predictions. In this way, macroevolution is testable and falsifiable.<br></div>

According to the standard phylogenetic tree, whales are known to be the descendants of terrestrial mammals that had hindlimbs. Thus, we expect the possibility that rare mutant whales might occasionally develop atavistic hindlimbs. In fact, there are many cases where whales have been found with rudimentary atavistic hindlimbs in the wild (see Figure 2.2.1; for reviews see Berzin 1972, pp. 65-67 and Hall 1984, pp. 90-93). Hindlimbs have been found in baleen whales (Sleptsov 1939), humpback whales (Andrews 1921) and in many specimens of sperm whales (Abel 1908; Berzin 1972, p. 66; Nemoto 1963; Ogawa and Kamiya 1957; Zembskii and Berzin 1961). Most of these examples are of whales with femurs, tibia, and fibulae; however, some even include feet with complete digits.<br><br>For example, Figure 2.2.1 shows the bones from the atavistic legs of a humpback whale. These bones are the remnants of one of two symmetrical hind-limbs found protruding from the ventral side of a female humpback whale, captured by a whaling ship from the Kyuquot Station near the west coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, in July 1919. Two officials of the Consolidated Whaling Company were understandably impressed by this discovery, and they removed one of the legs and presented the skeletal remains to the Provincial Museum in Victoria, B.C. (The other leg was evidently taken as a "souvenir" by crew members of the whaling ship). The museum's director, Francis Kermode, presented the bones to Roy Chapman Andrews from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York. Andrews reported the findings, along with photographs of the whale from the whaling crew, in American Museum Novitates, the journal of the AMNH. Andrews identified in the remains a shrunken cartiliginous femur, tibia, tarsus, and metatarsal. Both legs initially were over four feet long and covered in normal blubber and skin. For comparison, an average adult female humpback is around 45 feet long. The femur, composed of unossified cartilage, had shrunken from 15 inches to 4.5 inches. When attached to the whale, the femur was completely inside the body cavity and attached to the pelvic rudiments (humpback whales have vestiges of a pelvis inside the abdominal wall). This extraordinary finding is unlikely to be repeated, as the International Whaling Commission gave humpback whales worldwide protection status in 1966, after sixty years of uncontrolled human predation had decimated the population.<br><br>In short, whales with legs have been found and documented. It is believed in the scientific comunity tat tis occurs because sometime in the whale evolution it is a creature with legs but had evolved back into wat it is now. Otherwise please explain a reason for tis phenomenon</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ray87:</div><div class="quote_body">Firstly, on your example on sea cucumber, evolution is not about changes in the characteristic of a single organism. Sea cucumber CANNOT JUST evolved a defense mechanism that allowed it to turn itself inside out for predators to eat some of its insides. Evolution is about the accumulated changes of HERITABLE traits found in the population. The traits which you have described is a naturally occuring trait that is found in small numbers in the entire population. Possible causes of this trait is due to genetic variation within the population. It can be due to random mutation, independent assortment during meiosis one, or meiosis two, random fertilisation etc.<br><br>The trait become common in sea cucumber due to directional selection. Predation acts as a selection pressure and those sea cucumbers with the ability you have mentioned are at a selective advantage. They are more likely to survive and pass on their genetic traits to the next generation. This leads to increase in allele frequency of the ability you mention.<br><br>And please, for some who say that no one has ever seen evolution taking place, therefore evolution is flawed, that is such a slippery slope argument. WE ARE PART OF THE PROCESS OF EVOLUTION, once we die, only a small process of evolution has completed. We will need to die many times and have be able to retain our memory in order to observe evolution. And some say that for many years, human have not evolved.. and that's for a very very simple fact. HUMANS ARE UNDERGOING STABILISING SELECTION! There is only evolution if the population is undergoing directional selection. Evolution is not taken for granted to happen just because a long time has passed.<br><br>And shotgun, you mentioned that there's no observation of variation in DNA towards improvement of a species.. I frankly do not know where you get that from, perhaps from secondary school textbook, but there is variation due to natural selection. The 3% difference of our human DNA with that of APE's resulted in the two distinct population.<br><br>And for one thing, you are damn right to say that things around us are not evolving. Because of one simple fact, you don't live long enough to see things evolve. And for the human population, if there is no selection pressure, even after you wait for one godzillion years, you will not see evolution.</div></blockquote>Well, personal opinion, I cannot believe in something which has by far been just a theory.  A theory needs to be proven, and it has yet to be proven because there has been no observed evolution in progress.<br><br>My question is this, why do u think the creatures have evolved to be what they are?  Why couldn't have they been the same in the first place?<br><br>In the perhaps about 7000 years of recorded human history, have humans changed much?  Have we evolved anything deemed useful, or anything that would be deemed to be an improvement of the human species?  All that has changed has been genetic mutations, children born with 2 heads, usually causing 1 child to die. Is that evolution?  More like de-evolution.<br><br>Another observed fact is that humans are no longer as smart as they were. Another sign of de-evolution rather than evolution.  I believe that the people of the past were definitely much smarter than us today.  They still hold the key to many secrets that we are still guessing.  How was the pyramid built? How much mathematical knowledge do the ancient egyptians really have access to?<br><br>If according to the theory of evolution, shouldn't the ability to understand these mathematical mysteries have been encoded into our genes somewhat already?  Why have they been forgotten?<br><br>For something to have evolved, some new DNA must have been "evolved."  Yet there was none.  I believe i've already conceded that there have been noted variations of DNA.  But up til today, there has been no discovery of a brand new DNA suddenly "evolving" from nothing.<br><br>If I may point out something that is perhaps more "in your face."  To perhaps to get my point across that evolution is an unproven theory, and still remains a theory and not fact.   That is, all the research going on now, is TRYING to prove evolution is true.  Do a google search and u will realise, that many of ur topics will be like "Something bolsters theory of evolution."  or "new research trying to prove blah blah aspects of evolution."<br><br>Fact is:  Evolution remains an unproven theory.<br>Despite broad research, only DNA variations were noted, no entirely   new DNA was found to have developed anywhere.<br>Current observations reflect more of de-evolution rather than evolution.<br><br>To believe in evolution is like reading a newspapers that has much of its text and words blanked or deleted away.  A large guessing game is going on to guess what word goes where.  And people are reading it are going, " i believe in the content of this newspaper to be true and factual."  It really doesn't make sense.<br><br>The only reason why evolution is "believed" is that this is the only theory that gives us a gauge for scientific studies.  A ruler to be measured against.<br></div>

Two officials of the Consolidated Whaling Company were understandably impressed by this discovery, and they removed one of the legs and presented the skeletal remains to the Provincial Museum in Victoria, B.C. (The other leg was evidently taken as a "souvenir" by crew members of the whaling ship). The museum's director, Francis Kermode, presented the bones to Roy Chapman Andrews from the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York. Andrews reported the findings, along with photographs of the whale from the whaling crew, in American Museum Novitates, the journal of the AMNH. Andrews identified in the remains a shrunken cartiliginous femur, tibia, tarsus, and metatarsal. Both legs initially were over four feet long and covered in normal blubber and skin. For comparison, an average adult female humpback is around 45 feet long. The femur, composed of unossified cartilage, had shrunken from 15 inches to 4.5 inches. When attached to the whale, the femur was completely inside the body cavity and attached to the pelvic rudiments (humpback whales have vestiges of a pelvis inside the abdominal wall). This extraordinary finding is unlikely to be repeated, as the International Whaling Commission gave humpback whales worldwide protection status in 1966, after sixty years of uncontrolled human predation had decimated the population.<br><br>In short, whales with legs have been found and documented. It is believed in the scientific comunity tat tis occurs because sometime in the whale evolution it is a creature with legs but had evolved back into wat it is now. Otherwise please explain a reason for tis phenomenon</div></blockquote>Because they were like that all along?  Those things believed to be legs.. were there all along?<br><br>I believe there were variations in the whales DNA that caused it to shrink.  Perhaps whales did indeed once walk on land.  But they were still whales none the less.  I leave that for the scientist to discover, for them to test the DNA, to observe if there were indeed new DNA in the species, or was it just a variation.<br><br>Now, on a discovery channel show about great white sharks i once saw.   It was once believed that Great White sharks in Australia wouldn't know how to hunt seals like the other Great Whites where seals are predominantly their main source of food.  (Spectactular stuff, great whites that hunt seal would swim under their target, and then Dash up for the surface and bite the prey from under.  That velocity carried them sometimes up to 2 meters into the air.  Fish in the air!)<br><br>It was believed that somehow due to micro-evolution the Aussie sharks have forgotten how to do that, since its prey are different.  So this team drags along a life like rubber seal, and tows it along a speed boat.  Initially, the aussie sharks had no reaction to the seal.  Perhaps not recognising as food.  Then they started to attack, swimming near it, checking it out... but seemingly not quite sure of how to attack this prey.  Finally, the money shot came.  The Aussie Great whites dove under, and made a rapid vertical ascent to bite prey, propelling itself into the air like how its cousins do.<br><br>Now, some of u might think.  But this doesnt prove anything.  It proves one thing, the theories of evolution CAN be wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Well, personal opinion, I cannot believe in something which has by far been just a theory. A theory needs to be proven, and it has yet to be proven because there has been no observed evolution in progress. </blockquote>The fact is, playing with the word "theory" is really a argument tat hold little water. The important point to note is how does the sceintific field view theory as, not how every day men view it as. Pay attention to the last sentence in bold in the first part of reply in bold. Tis seems to be similar to a question tat had been answered before in page 6.  I just cut and paste it here<br><br><strong>1. Evolution is only a theory. It is not a fact or a scientific law.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Many people learned in elementary school that a theory falls in the middle of a hierarchy of certainty -- above a mere hypothesis but below a law. Scientists do not use the terms that way, however. According to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), a scientific theory is "a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses." No amount of validation changes a theory into a law, which is a descriptive generalization about nature. So when scientists talk about the theory of evolution -- or the atomic theory or the theory of relativity, for that matter -- they are not expressing reservations about its truth.<br><br>In addition to the theory of evolution, meaning the idea of descent with modification, one may also speak of the fact of evolution. The NAS defines a fact as "an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as 'true.'" The fossil record and abundant other evidence testify that organisms have evolved through time. Although no one observed those transformations, the indirect evidence is clear, unambiguous and compelling.<br><br>All sciences frequently rely on indirect evidence. Physicists cannot see subatomic particles directly, for instance, so they verify their existence by watching for telltale tracks that the particles leave in cloud chambers. The absence of direct observation does not make physicists' conclusions less certain. </span><br><br>from page 6 too<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">According to biology, it is really much a scientific fact tat much of their studies is based on evolution. I just find it strange tat your only argument is tat evolution is named as "theory" and insist on your definition of "theory" instead of the definition made by the scientific field.<br><br>http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=theory<br><br><strong>A set of statements or principles devised to explain a group of facts or phenomena, especially one that has been repeatedly tested or is widely accepted and can be used to make predictions about natural phenomena. </strong></span><br><br><blockquote>My question is this, why do u think the creatures have evolved to be what they are? Why couldn't have they been the same in the first place? </blockquote>It is simply because the fossils and bones found etc tell us so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> There is evidence found tat suggests tis phenomenon. Let me ask u back... why do u believe tat all animals suddenly pop up within one day ? The day before eveything is void of life then suddenly within one day *poof* all the animals (or plants) suddenly appear. Doesn't tat sounds more ridiculous ? It sounds more like fairy tale than science<br><br><blockquote>In the perhaps about 7000 years of recorded human history, have humans changed much? Have we evolved anything deemed useful, or anything that would be deemed to be an improvement of the human species? All that has changed has been genetic mutations, children born with 2 heads, usually causing 1 child to die. Is that evolution? More like de-evolution. </blockquote>I think u get a few facts wrong in here. First evolution takes place in million of years. Comparing 7000 years to million of years of evolution is akin to comparing the physical changes of a growing boy only after a few hours.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> U don't see any physical change in the boy after a few hours, do u conclude he is not growing up ?<br><br>Another fact u got wrong is, mutated children, born with 2 heads causing one to die etc is more common now than in the past ? Please subtantiate your stand on why do u say tat in the past the percentage of population had lesser "children with 2 heads" compared with now<br><br><blockquote>Another observed fact is that humans are no longer as smart as they were. Another sign of de-evolution rather than evolution. I believe that the people of the past were definitely much smarter than us today. They still hold the key to many secrets that we are still guessing. How was the pyramid built? How much mathematical knowledge do the ancient egyptians really have access to? </blockquote>Tat is again another strange phenomenon which I do not agree. How do u know tat people in the past r wiser than people now ? The pyramid built and ancient knowledge of ancient egytian is really... well.. mythical at best. Men can easily build another pyramid now if they want to. They even build one made by glass in france or a 30 storey one in las vegas  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> If their mathematic knowledge is so good, better than recent men, then they probably be building spaceship like wat men had done now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> I don't see how u can conclude tat men is smarter in the past than now.<br><br><blockquote>For something to have evolved, some new DNA must have been "evolved." Yet there was none. I believe i've already conceded that there have been noted variations of DNA. But up til today, there has been no discovery of a brand new DNA suddenly "evolving" from nothing. </blockquote>There have been cases of nature showing animals who had evolved greatly with fundamental changes to their dna. I don't think "no discovery of a brand new dna" etc is scientifically sound. Did anyboday say tat evolution must come out with "brand new dna" ?<br><br></div>
