            <div class='col-md body'>Most of u women like to go after guys with cars and fat wallet for their convienience but the way Singapore standard of living is going, i doubt a guy can even own a car in 5-10 years time.so what does that mean.It means these women like u  have to go for that guys who are in the middle class range.At that time ,If u want a guy who has everything a car, wallet bungalow ect. he is a "poor man" cause he just dunked all his money into impressing women.He will srtuggle to pay to maintain his possessions. He is not Bill gates In the end they end up a marrying a poor man and worse on the verge of bankrupcy.So if u want a rich rich man, make sure he is Bill gates or somebody who will never go poor in his lifetime , has the capability to maintain what he has got which i think isnt possible cause there will be immense competition and there are really not many Bill gates around..if they are i am sure they will only want those actresses and models, equally successful as themselves and not some average girl staying in an HDB apartment.Well done the women just out done themselves and die an old single hag.Remember u women have limited time to land the golden goose.probably in your 20s is your chance..Let yrself wait , by the time u become old.....no man wants an old 35 year old hag, just like how u women dont want a poor man.In any case u landed one and will probably be happy about it for the rest of your life - Ask  yrself if u can live without the riches if u happen to lose them.Ask yrself if material possessions control u instead of u controlling them<br><br>in case any women reading this, this is the scenario for u. Change yrself or die...short and sweet...Greed is one of mankind's worst enemy<br><br><strong>what's worst is regret in life</strong><br><br>U women could have just enjoyed the simple pleasures life has to offer and be humble about it.A guy cant drive u around but he can send u home to yr doorstep. he cant treat u to a dinner at Shangri La but he can buy u food at Fast food...Remember its not what u have achieved in life, its what u learnt and experienced in life.life is about u and the relationships u have with the world.Not money or cars just remember this , dont waste yr life searching for the "holy grail" if  u have no guarantee of landing it.In the end u will end up missing all the life's expereinces which make the common average joe.He is truly the man "rich" in life expereinces. The real rich man</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Chewbacca:<br><strong>Most of u women like to go after guys with cars and fat wallet for their convienience but the way Singapore standard of living is going, i doubt a guy can even own a car in 5-10 years time.so what does that mean.It means these women like u  have to go for that guys who are in the middle class range.At that time ,If u want a guy who has everything a car, wallet bungalow ect. he is a "poor man" cause he just dunked all his money into impressing women.He will srtuggle to pay to maintain his possessions. He is not Bill gates In the end they end up a marrying a poor man and worse on the verge of bankrupcy.So if u want a rich rich man, make sure he is Bill gates or somebody who will never go poor in his lifetime , has the capability to maintain what he has got which i think isnt possible cause there will be immense competition and there are really not many Bill gates around..if they are i am sure they will only want those actresses and models, equally successful as themselves and not some average girl staying in an HDB apartment.Well done the women just out done themselves and die an old single hag.Remember u women have limited time to land the golden goose.probably in your 20s is your chance..Let yrself wait , by the time u become old.....no man wants an old 35 year old hag, just like how u women dont want a poor man.In any case u landed one and will probably be happy about it for the rest of your life - Ask  yrself if u can live without the riches if u happen to lose them.Ask yrself if material possessions control u instead of u controlling them<br><br>in case any women reading this, this is the scenario for u. Change yrself or die...short and sweet...Greed is one of mankind's worst enemy<br><br>[b]what's worst is regret in life</strong><br><br>U women could have just enjoyed the simple pleasures life has to offer and be humble about it.A guy cant drive u around but he can send u home to yr doorstep. he cant treat u to a dinner at Shangri La but he can buy u food at Fast food...Remember its not what u have achieved in life, its what u learnt and experienced in life.life is about u and the relationships u have with the world.Not money or cars just remember this , dont waste yr life searching for the "holy grail" if  u have no guarantee of landing it.In the end u will end up missing all the life's expereinces which make the common average joe.He is truly the man "rich" in life expereinces. The real rich man[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Trying to justify your own bleak future, my friend?
