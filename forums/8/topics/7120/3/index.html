If you cannot account for your own silly <strong>MISJUDGEMENT</strong>, then just apologise, I promise not to laugh. It takes guts to be a man, and not some sissy who can't even acknowledge his own [b]MISTAKE[/b}. Hmmm...wait I might be wrong, you might not be a man, hmmm....so tell me, are you a lady? If you are, I promise to give way, for I am a known buaya, I am sure you would not bend so low just to win would you? Well, even if you will, I would not know, for I too can't be sure that you are adam&amp;eve, you might be 1/2 adma$eve + 1/4 cyberahmad + 1/4 planster. Hmmm...the equation might not be right, I was told that I am damn bad at maths, but hey! who needs math here? A moron would have figure out this equation, but most would want to keep thier mouth shut so that they would at least look intelligent only to you, but no no no Callan prefers to be worst then a moron....for he see no value in being dumb and intelligent at the same time. (puns intented).<br><br>Actually to think of it your nick itself is a contradiction...so are you adam or are you eve? If you are Adam, then who is Eve? If you are Eve, pardon me my dearest...*smells Eve hair* who is Adam? Is the other half part of your imaginary life? Or is it what makes you whole, for you can't be complete without faking someone? Keep me posted of the juicy details, my yearning lips can't wait for some fiery action from yours.<br><br>Your dearest Flame de lover,<br>Callan Chua</div>
