            <div class='col-md body'>I really feel very sad that things have turned out like this. Although I am only a "virtual" identity and so are the rest of the forumites, I do feel something for those "regulars" like colette, Mayajade, Rinoa, Mr Hata-San, Sparkle, Tommy etc. I may not have really "communicated" with them before but I "see" them almost everyday in this forum. We may have conflicts in views sometimes, but that is not important since we are all here for some fun. At the end of the day, we may just sit back and laugh it off or perhaps gain something out of it.<br><br>And the way some forumites attack my "friends" in this forum truly made me very sad. Especially when they are picking on the girls. How can a person use such vulgarity on a lady ?<br><br>We are all faces behind a screen. Some of us may end up as friends or even lovers in real life, good. But the most of us will not even ever have the chance to really know each other. And perhaps that's why we are so irresponsible with each other's feelings. You can use all kinds of abusive languages on another forumite, it is so easy, because you cannot see the sad face of that forumite when he/she read your post.<br><br>If all you want is for me to leave this forum. I will. To me, this forum is not all that important. I am just here to kill time and share thoughts. If this forum becomes a place which my needs are no longer met, i hop to another forum. It is that easy for me and for any other forumites too.<br><br>But please, when anyone of you post something that is abusive, spare a thought for the receiving party's feelings. It is a flesh and blood behind the screen, it is not just a computer.<br><br>So long folks.</div>
