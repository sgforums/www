            <div class='col-md body'>Ponders: What makes you think that all the clauses in the US constitution are all guaranteed?<br>Another thing is everybody has a right to freedom of speech. He/She can exercise that right as long as it doesn't infringe on others right to exercise the same thing. Pokemon posted some topics in the forum. People who didn't like it could have not entered to join in the discussion, or for that matter, post a reply. But they chose to. That makes me wonder why. What do they hope to achieve? Do they hope to show that they are more literate than Pokemon, and of a higher standing? Well..that can only be answered by those people themselves. If any of you really hate the forums Pokemon posts, you can not reply to it.In the meantime, the only thing I can say to those people is Say La Vi.<br><br>------------------<br>Time is like sand in your hands.

            <div class='col-md body'>To ngkaihoe:<br><br>Nobody disagrees with your clause on freedom of expression/speech being revoked under certain situations. Nobody accused you that it must be upheld all the time.<br><br>The whole point of the issue is that he is responding with vulgarities when he could have just not done it and let the people flame him. I pointed out earlier that there is nothing to do with his education nor his language capabilities. Resorting to that kind of ad-hominems and semantic arguments would reflect poorly on those who used them on him.<br><br>"If you want to discuss something with another person, put him/her at equal standing, then discuss."<br><br>I will say nothing about that but be laughing at the irony of the statement. This statement which comes from you, seriously make me puke in front of the computer screen. That is not within the frame of what we are discussing here, before you will hurl accusations on me trying to judge your character, which I have no intention to.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No one here expects docility from Pokemon. In fact his colourful yet unimaginative retorts have been anything but! And going by the number of his on-going threads neither is his right to Â‘free speechÂ’ compromised in anyway. And if some Â‘educatedÂ’ people deem his remarks to be Â‘deviantÂ’ then the right to free speech umbrellas the right to come down on him hard. If he can defend his vulgarity convincingly, then hooray for civilised society. If he canÂ’t, and he hasnÂ’t, then the lessons that Â‘free speechÂ’ bring to fore not only the ability to say what you want but also to prepare prior to releasing verbal diarrhea substantiation. But really, some of the Â‘educatedÂ’ get tired of Â‘f**k yousÂ’ and Â‘suck my cocksÂ’, and surely these people, and the rest of the Â‘uneducatedÂ’ deserve better.<br><br>It is naÃ¯ve to assume equal-footing as starting points for debate when the initial remarks are offensive. The onus is on the progenitor to defend his views and make an audience see his point if he decides to post them in public. If he canÂ’t he must face the ramifications of his remarks. Unfortunately Pokemon either does not have clue how or desire to defend them so his views, lacking in substance, are flushed down the proverbial toilet. Pokemon cannot handle the responsibility Â‘free speechÂ’ entails.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Who cares about the educational level of Pokemon? He has the emotional maturity of a 5 year old! And this- not anything else- is what has riled people.<br><br>Swatch, it's 'C'est La Vie' btw. How do you avoid all those ugly topic headers in the first page? And I'm concerned for the younger more impressionable people in this forum, some of who are only 15 years old! We have a responsibility not to *corrupt* their minds. Pokemon's threads are more purient that anything else, unlike the thread 'To be or not to be a virgin'. If Pokemon is so curious, go get porno mags and video! They're not available to the 'xiao di dis' and 'xiao mei meis'.<br><br>Ngkaihoe, I'm sorry I've made a personal attack. I hadn't meant to. It's time Pokemon apologised too.<br><br></div>

You say we got freedom of speech... at same time us to stop expressing our thinkings.<br><br>SLB: We did treat him with respect... but u think for yourself.. Did he ever try to change himself? IF you look carefully.. Jackchen appeared together with GBM. And even after Jack Chen is banned. He shows no sign of regret. Only until recently then he started to be nice(chated with him on IRC).That's Y all the GBM flaming and scolding stopped.. So i guess you are determinded to walk him path and be the next gbm... when everyone realized that the real gbm is not as bad as slb who claims that he is cousin of gbm.<br><br>------------------<br>It takes a moment to have a crush on someone,an hour to like someone,and a day to love someone,but it takes a lifetime to forget her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..  it seems ppl just plagarise each other's thoughts.<br><br>Benjamin Franklin (?) also said, "your freedom stops where another's nose starts".<br><br>This is like what kaihoe just said not in exact words.<br><br>But I also know that a judge in a landmark case in US said what Franklin said in the same sense.<br><br>That aside,<br><br>Freedom of Speech, it's never absolute in Singapore. And the interpretation of "Freedom of Speech" varies from country to country. How this is interpreted is subjected to circumstances and context.<br><br>Just look at "No cruel and unusual punishment" (can't be found in Sg's const.), This clause has effectively repealed Canada's death penalty. But look to the south, and you can find US sentencing ppl to die when the exact clause is found in their constitution.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Freedom of Speech spell trouble. That's why PROC control its media. But without Freedom of Speech / Thoughts, who on earth do you think give birth to inventions such as a light bulb?<br><br>To make it simple.. Freedom give knowledge while no freedom give discipline.
