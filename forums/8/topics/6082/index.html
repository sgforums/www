            <div class='col-md body'>I have to remind all that the Singapore<br>Constitution grants all her citizens the<br>rights to Freedom of Speech, under Article<br>13 (?). This clause is only to be revoked<br>on extreme situations like a threat to social<br>security/stability. Which of course, there<br>is no such extreme situation here.<br><br>And as such, nobody has the rights to ask<br>Pokemon to stop expressing himself the way<br>he sees fit. That is unconstitutional and<br>anyone who wants to limit his expressive<br>capabilities is liable to be sued in a court<br>of law.<br><br>The audience, if they are made uneasy by his<br>messages, can choose not to read. You have<br>no legal rights to ask him not to post.<br><br>And also, stop all those self righteousness.<br>Stop all those illogical extrapolations from<br>Pokemon's posts to his personal<br>characteristics.<br><br>And also, those who have insult Pokemon's<br>educational level, here is one advice to you<br>all - Education is the ability to think on<br>your own feet, if you choose to deem an<br>opinion to be disgusting just because it is<br>a deviant opinion, you still have a lot of<br>education to go through.<br><br>Years of studies until degree perhaps only<br>makes you a literate. An educated man? You<br>are still far far away from it.<br><br>I am sure that Pokemon, by expressing his<br>opinions bravely and thinking independently,<br>displays more education that those who have<br>put him down.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that there should be freedom of speech in the forum and if we have something against a post, we can just choose to ignore it. The other thing which I agree is that we have no right to associate a person's post with his character educational level or his poor command of his language. I simply look down or spit on people who come up with stupid and illogical arguments, like 'I don't understand your arguments because of your "cheem" English or your "poor" English'. This kind of semantic arguments to me are all wank or rubbish.<br><br>However, I have to disagree that there is a line between saying something sensitive in a sensible way and saying something sensitive not in a sensible way. What it all voiced down to a common point, in the few posts which I have read, is that people are offended by the propriety demostrated by the poster which I failed to see any in him.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I find the citing of the Singapore Constitution to illustrate Â‘freedom of speechÂ’ very ironic and fraught with paradoxical unevenness. Is the Singapore version of free speech identical that of the American version? But never mind, lets assume we mean free speech in its purest sense.<br><br>If PokemonÂ’s posts are deemed silly and insulting by certain members of the forum then the Constitution also umbrellas the calls for him to stop, criticism and reactionary response. Freedom of speech does not only protect the progenitor of views but also the response these views generate.<br><br>The beauty and genius of the ideal of Freedom of speech is only illustrated when opposing opinions clash and fight in the public arena. It is only then when observers and progenitors of opposing views alike can see the integrity of these opinions. The Freedom of speech notion is not just saying anything you want but being able to engage in a mechanism that brings your opinions to test in the external world. True, Pokemon has a right to post his opinions, just as people have the right to question him, but in the process of engagement, Pokemon has resorted to vulgarities (which one assumes he also has a right to) but he has failed to defend his ideas.<br><br>As for the bravery of PokemonÂ’s expression of opinion and ability to think (and that is a keyword here) independently, I sincerely doubt bravery and ability to think were called into use with posts like Â‘Best Sex PositionsÂ’ and Â‘PeriodsÂ’. He has exercised his right to post them. Let others exercise their right to test out the integrity of his ideas.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>When I pointed out education as a distinction, I was pointing out a socio-political phenomenon of Singapore Â– and if that indirectly insulted Pokemon, IÂ’m not going to shed any tears.<br><br>It is a fact that Singapore is a society that favours education and the educated.<br>It is a fact that, in order to participate in the overarching ideologies of Singapore one must acquire the means for participation.<br>It is a fact that some have these means and some donÂ’t.<br>It is a fact that those who do not have these means for participation will seek articulation through perverse channels that do not require these means. (I mean perversion in the sociological sense where anything that goes against the grain of convention is socially deviant in view of its contrast to norms).<br>It was just a socio-political observation of Singapore and if Pokemon feels aggrieved by it, well he can tell me why my views are invalid. Unfortunately his typical response is,<br><br>Â“Shut up Dickhead .. and FUCK OFF<br>One thing : U SUX, BIG TIME !!! FYMCCBÂ”<br><br>It reinforces my point more than anything else.<br><br></div>

That is why people are speaking up against you.<br><br>I am inclined to believe that the pogenitor has a poor understanding what he meant by a freedom of speech. Invoking the constitution do not give you any moral highground to any people here. Freedom of speech is used when the person have the right level of understanding to things, and handles a sensitive issue with the right level of maturity. He or she knows what should be said  and how to say it properly without making abusive and offensive remarks to someone else.<br><br>What you fail to do is the following :<br>1)You posted sensitive issues and do not defend your stand when someone pointed out your mistakes. Face it, you are not even arguing properly and it is really questionable what your point of posting these issues : sexual depravity, making a impression and trying to be different.<br>2)If you are thinking that you can impress people with your kind of posts, similarly, the above quote from you also can turn people off from you.<br>3)Don't count on your support from people who cannot argue but allegedly in the same kind of frame of mind like you, for example, people who are supporting you this freedom of speech argument. It is totally ridiculous.  Freedom of Speech comes with the individual be able to handle its use. They are doing the same thing but demostrate no sensibility in their posts at all.<br>4)You can make statements like that, but when questioned and you respond badly, it is poor integrity on your part.<br><br></div>
