            <div class='col-md body'>Some thing about Nie Feng and Bu Zing Yun also...<br><br>I believe the ultimate no. 1 reason why bu Zing Yun come out is because... &lt;trrrrr drum roll&gt;<br><br>....its the 300 episode commerative issue. Ma Rong Chen wants to make it a hyped up one but ran out of ideas what to hype..<br><br>and the ultimate no. 1 reason why Nie Feng didn't wake up together with Bu Zing Yun is because.....<br><br>.....its to keep for emergency. Just in case sales go down again, or for another an commemerative issue... whichever happens first..<br><br>I predict the first will.

            <div class='col-md body'>i have been following "tian xia" for quite long (6 years). everytime, the only excitement ma rong chen can inject is the appearance of mysterious characters who are more powerful than you can ever imagine. what is most laughable was the portrayal of "wu ming" as an invincible character. eventually, he was made to look like a small fry when he fought with "di shi tian". still, i look forward every fortnight to that new issue of tian xia.<br><br>anyway, this mysterious character who is leading yi feng astray is highly probable to be "duan lang" judging from the efforts to mask the identity of yi feng's papa. then again, i was dreaming of it to be "wu ming" - might be fed up he's playing second fiddle to so many. or another mysterious guy who swallowed a missing piece of the "dragon energy" remember it was broken into a few pieces, 2 of which are still missing (1 of which is in the pool.) anyway, after wu ming's duel with wu bei, wu ming has been kicked out.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another ironic thing to take note is that wu ming should be a "senior citizen" by now. yet, he still looks so young. i didn't really take note of the timeline, but a rough estimate i made is as follows:<br><br>yi feng --&gt; 20 yr old<br>nie feng --&gt; 20 + 30 (when he had yi feng)<br>wu ming --&gt; 50 + 30(the age he took nie feng as a discipline)<br><br>damn it, wu ming should be at least 80 now. can use discounted farecard on sbs/tibs bus...but still looking like late 30s.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>totally nonsensical.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup... sesoned readers will realize that Ma Rong Cheng is trying to drag again..<br><br>In my opinion, many characters in Fen Yun are beginning to stink already.. The stinkest of course.. Wu Ming. Then followed by Bu Zing Yun and Nie Feng.. and whoever he decide to drag out because he ran out of story..<br><br>He could have finished the story long before the 3rd installment starts.. and give his story a clean slate...remember what happen after his departure from Zhong Hua Ying Xiong? His first story of Feng Yun was fantastic..<br><br>This seem to be a common disease in the Hong Kong comics scene.. you have authors trying to capitalize on their previous success... so much so that they don't even realize when their creation is actually beginning to stink.. Feng Yun is one good example, Long Hu Men is another(even bigger one) ... even recent great title like Hai Hu. Its third installment Wu Shen is getting rather sucky too.</div>
