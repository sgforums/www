            <div class='col-md body'>Cash-short girl, 14, asked boyfriend to get men for her<br><br>A 14-YEAR-OLD girl who needed money to pay her bills hit on a shocking solution: she asked her boyfriend if he had friends who would be willing to pay for her sexual services. Then, after she had slept with at least five of them, she reported them all, including her boyfriend, to the police.<br><br>The girl's boyfriend, a 19-year-old national serviceman, had invited each of them to pay to have sex with her.<br><br>Two months later, in September last year, she made a police report stating that she had had sex with several different men on different occasions. The boyfriend, now 20, and five others were later charged with having sex with an underage girl.<br><br>Yesterday, operations assistant Muhammad Taufiq Sahak, 21, became the fifth person convicted for having sex with her. He was jailed for two months.<br><br>Two others have been jailed, one for eight months, the other for three. Another was sent to a boys' home. The fourth was given probation.<br><br>The case of the boyfriend, who faces nine charges of having sex with her, is expected to be mentioned on Nov 21. Police investigations are ongoing to trace the rest.<br><br>A person convicted of having sex with an underage girl can be jailed for up to five years and fined up to $10,000.<br><br>It was not mentioned in court why the girl went to the police after having instigated the encounters.<br><br>Yesterday, a district court heard that, in July last year, the boyfriend had called Taufiq, then his NS camp mate, and told him that a girl was offering sex for $30. Taufiq said he was not interested.<br><br>He offered again on another occasion and, this time, Taufiq agreed. The boyfriend introduced the girl to him at a Woodlands coffee shop before taking them to his home at a nearby condominium.<br><br>Taufiq then had sex with the girl in one of the bedrooms, paid her $30 and left.<br><br>Pleading for leniency yesterday, Taufiq's lawyer S.S. Dhillon said that, at first, his client thought the girl, who was wearing a very short skirt and a body-hugging top, was at least 18 years old.<br><br>But just before they were about to have sex, his friend suddenly mentioned that she was under 16. Taufiq claimed he had 'little time to react'.<br><br>Taufiq went home and put the matter behind him, but in May this year, he was contacted by the Criminal Investigation Department's Serious Sexual Crime Branch.<br><br>He had been implicated by the girl's boyfriend, who was arrested on the same charge, Mr Dhillon said.<br><br>The lawyer noted that the act had been between two consenting individuals in the context of a prostitute-patron scenario. He stressed that his client was young and it was a one-off offence.<br><br>'Taufiq did not employ trickery. He did not coerce the girl either,' he said.<br><br>The girl, he noted, was far more 'street-smart' than his client, who was a virgin before he had sex with her.<br></div>

(losing her viginity is not counted as punishment)<br><br>I guess in most of such discussions, where everyone seems to flame the gal in question, its not so much of siding with the guys, rather the unfair treatment of both sexes by the law.<br><br>The disparity in response by the law in itself does not cause much dissentment, but rather, the manner in which certain gals use the law in their favour and a weapon, rather than a shield.<br><br>Someone i know mentioned that an uncle was in jail because of such an occurrance. The story goes like this:<br><br>The man reaches home and finds his wife in bed with another man. He slaps his wife. His wife goes to the police with the slap mark on her face claiming domestic violence. He goes to jail for being a "wife beater" and when he comes out, she will divorce him and take half of everything he owns, plus alimony.<br><br>As we can see, the man is being punished multiple times for his wife's unfaithfulness.</div>
