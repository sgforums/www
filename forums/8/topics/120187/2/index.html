It crashed and smashed my lunch to pieces.. Serves me damn right, I thought.. I was staring again..<br><br>I stood stock-still and looked down at the food.. Suddenly she got up and moved towards me.. I was shocked.. that wasn't my intention.. I wanted to know her, but... she picked up the crockery, put it on the tray and helped me to clean up the mess on the floor.. I felt blissed, she's not your usual girl.. she was more than just pretty, no words can used to describe her I am sure..<br><br>"Thank you." I muttered..<br><br>She shoved the tray to me and went back to her table..<br><br>I worked at a large publishing company and ate lunch in the canteen.. Many times, I had noticed her because of the way she carried herself.. full of grace and confident.. I know my stand, I know I will never stand a chance.. its not because of the lack of confident.. I know my stuff and was good at my work.. Im intellectually sound, but sadly appearance does make a different.. you see, I am weird-looking as my hair was badly cut and my clothes were ancient and dull; baggy at the knees and colour-less shirt, creased to the core..<br><br>Often I sat alone and just served out my lunch.. I am a loner with few friends and it has been going on for some time..<br><br>A few days after the crash, I mustered enough courage and stopped at the table she was sharing with her colleagues and asked if I might sit down.. she look at me suspiciously and said the seats were taken and continued eating..<br><br>I was brought down to earth.. actually no.. I've been expecting the same reply.. how can she ever took a liking in me? nonetheless, I apologised and took my tray off somewhere else..<br><br>"What's your problem, Elindra?" asked Mark, her colleague..<br>"No problem. It's just that I like to choose who I share my mealtimes with."<br><br>"A bit rough on the chap though."<br><br>It was Mark who told me more about her.. over the weeks, I had won over her friends.. Its despicable some will say, but I will try everything within my might if I can get the love of my life..<br><br>A week passed and still nothing happened.. It was the time of the year when there's many reports to write and proposals to summit.. however I am still waiting for that chance.. an opportunity so that I could break the ice..<br><br>"Hi, its .. coincidental that I see you again.. " I know its lame, but that's the only thing that cross my mind at that moment..<br><br>"May I sit down?" my voice was soft, almost to a plead..<br>What could she say? The tables were all pretty full so she nodded..<br><br>"Have you been there?" "Been where?" she was totally dazed..<br><br>"Australia" you resemble my ex-GF..<br><br>Since that day, we often sat together during lunch and discussed a lot of things together.. Its amazing how fast we became accustomed to each other.. those were the happiest days in my life.. I don't know how she feels about me, but I know that feeling.. its unmistakeable: its love..<br><br>"We definitely have things in common but that's not love..." she looked at me.<br><br>"I'm so sorry to disappoint you, Caramon.." I tried to smile..<br><br>"We're not together but we can be something else."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>"Friends." "Friends?" we are still friends.. she looked at me earnestly.. I.. yes, we are friends.. I turned away before she could see the tears rolling down..<br></div></blockquote>Elindra is married, you assclown!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There are so many rumours going around that she is a white chick and British child star lookalike. These serve only to pique my curiosity about her.</div>
