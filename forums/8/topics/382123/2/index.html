              <p>How dare you let a sensible question get in the way of a
              perfectly good bullshit theory!  Let the man continue!

              <p>Geek, it's easy to say you can "feel" something, but until you
              can quantify it, it doesn't exist - simple rules of logic.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>=) Haha.. Yah I know you can't quantify it. But look at it this way:</p>
              <p>Most of the time shareprices fluctuate because of what its investors FEEL about the company. Its still speculation. Yes you can quantify the company performance or things like that but one rumour is enough to destroy all that wonderful performance. Again, this is based on feelings.</p>
              <p>My point is, feelings play an important rule in everything. You just can't quantify certain things. And I wonder how you will begin to quantify racism.</p>
              <p>You can see the acts these buffoons commit on Indian students there. I personally know several stories. And I do have many friends studying in USA, London, China and even in Ukraine, but I've rarely and if not, never heard of any such horrible and disgusting racism stories coming from those lands.</p>
              <p>And it can easily be effected economically because the country depends quite heavily on education industry. If not the Australian PM would not have run to India to apologise and reassure them that Indians will be taken care of in their country.</p>
              <p>The fact is, it is a racist country.</p>
              <p>I am only guessing that you might have absolutely no idea about the Indian student's plight in that country.</p>

              <p>i lived in australia for 3 years and has not experienced any single incident. But i can say is things like the ind student attack dont happen without reason. These ind student sometimes like to talk as if they are kings, group together and talk in their own language, refuse to adopt to aussie. If u looked in singapore,its the same story, they look down on local indians as if some sort of inferior creatures to them. They want SG and OZ $$$ but yet dont want people.</p>
              <p>But the Oz govt has to blame too because they let in too many foreigners till the place is swarmed</p>

              <p>Here's the funniest thing.  Last week I attended my first Single Malt Scotch Society meeting at Southbank, and immediately a member asked me if I was Singaporean.  The irony in light of this conversation is that the member asking was an Indian PR with a very pronounced accent himself, and we spent the night having a jolly good time identifying various single-cask Scotches with a whole bunch of local blokes, and I ended up being invited to join a diving group by one of the members.</p>

              <p>Actually we are both generalising to a certain extent. For one thing, not everyone is racist. Its never the case anywhere =) But its just a higher percentage. I did go on a night of club hoping with 5 or 6 Australians and totally enjoyed it. I did have plenty of splendid experiences with some very good people down under.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure that my attitude is very far from being fucked up :) lol.. Even if your attitude is very good and your EQ is very high, you are still susceptible to racism. Because if the goons who show racism had so much knowledge as to recognise your high EQ and your great attitude, they won't be goons anymore and racism won't exist.</p>
              <p>It doesn't quite matter what kind of attitude you are having. What matters is what kind of attitude the other party is having and what kind of upbringing he has.</p>
              <p>Fucked up attitude will not alone warrant a racist attack on you.</p>

              <p>i think what u are saying is wrong. if there is a shortage of Engineers and IT ppl, they will sure to take u if u have the right qualifications and experience afterall Australia is still a capitalistic country.</p>
              <p>I dont know which part of australia u stayed but in Melbourne and Sydney, they need lots of engineers and IT people . U must be staying in those outback type of places with farms, horses? U cannot say its not a useful skill, as in Australia people do the things which rakes in the moolah even if its a fruit picker</p>

              <p>Actually we are both generalising to a certain extent. For one
              thing, not everyone is racist. Its never the case anywhere =) But
              its just a higher percentage. I did go on a night of club hoping
              with 5 or 6 Australians and totally enjoyed it. I did have plenty
              of splendid experiences with some very good people down under.</p>
              <p>I am quite sure that my attitude is very far from being fucked
              up :) lol.. Even if your attitude is very good and your EQ is very
              high, you are still susceptible to racism. Because if the goons who
              show racism had so much knowledge as to recognise your high EQ and
              your great attitude, they won't be goons anymore and racism won't
              exist.</p>
              <p>It doesn't quite matter what kind of attitude you are having.
              What matters is what kind of attitude the other party is having and
              what kind of upbringing he has.</p>
              <p>Fucked up attitude will not alone warrant a racist attack on
              you.</p>

              <p>Fair comment and poor phrasing on my part.  The point I had meant to make was that a fucked-up attitude doesn't help things - just take a look at Hitman and you'll see exactly what I mean.</p>
