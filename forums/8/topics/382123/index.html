              <p>Been attending a workshop course and a trainer who's educated in Aussie uni lamented to us about Australia racism...asians not being served in restaurants cause of their race.</p>
              <p>Brings me back to a point, it's been said the media been exaggerating the racist incidents in Australia but when you hear too many of this from singaporeans who rather not take up PR is Ozland though they are well qualified, you kind of get jaded about the whole Australian laid back friendly image.</p>
              <p>Somehow I think the asian students who are funding their universities will really need to think twice do they really want to go to a country who just want their money but not their asian presence?</p>

              <p>As far as I'm aware, the primary objective of the Asian students is to get and education and not to make their presence wanted, so what's your point?</p>

              <p>Exactly my point, she said its not that bad, which means she can feel it. In other countries you don't feel it. I never felt anything in France for that matter. Even if I was like one of the only few Indians walking around.. Neither in Belgium.. But Australia, you can feel it clearly..</p>

              <p>it could be possible that their criminal genetics may be a factor.its rather a defect in their thought process that may be transmitted to their offspring.these cant be erased scientifically as seen from their history till now in modern times.</p>

              <p>That's your problem right there.  You simply don't know how to work with people.  Doesn't matter if you're in Australia, the US or Botswana.</p>
              <p>If you find that everyone you meet is difficult to work with, it's plain common sense to start looking at the one common factor in all of the problems - you.</p>

              <p>yes kind of right, almost everywhere there will be people who are difficult to work with. and btw its not only asian who face such problems in australia, the local folks ( aussies) there face them too. many times u can hear them complaining about their own people. So u are no exception just because u r asian. the problem is as singaporean u did not face such things here in singapore before and when u went to oz, it came as a  shock.</p>
              <p>i know tons of singaporeans who migrated there and r happy.. i guess its all in yrself.</p>

              <p>yes,,,,,it depends on that person if they like u or not...mostly

              thing yet.they accept indians that perhaps resemble their european

              <p>but yes i hate to say it but there is rascism of some form from

              australia.oh well....at least thru those difficulties i have found
              alternate cheaper ways with more variety from overseas due to their

              <p>Knowing how to talk is one thing, but passing off as a local aussie born? You are actually supporting the statement that Aussies are racist with that. U mean that if we don't pass off as a local, we will no longer be treated as a King? :)</p>
