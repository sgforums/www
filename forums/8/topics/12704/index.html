            <div class='col-md body'>A joke, really :<br><br>A New York woman was at her hairdresser's on Park Avenue getting her hair styled prior to a trip to Rome with her boyfriend. She mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded, "Rome? Why would anyone want to go there? It's crowded &amp; dirty and full of Italians. You're crazy to go to Rome. So, how are you getting there?"<br><br>"We're taking Continental," was the reply. "We got a great rate!"<br><br>"Continental?" exclaimed the hairdresser. "That's a terrible airline. Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. So, where are you staying in Rome?"<br><br>"We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's left bank called Teste....."<br><br>"Don't go any further. I know that place. Everybody thinks its gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump, the worst hotel in the city! The rooms are small, the service is surly and they're overpriced. So, whatcha doing when you get there?"<br><br>"We're going to go to see the Vatican and we hope to see the Pope."<br><br>"That's rich," laughed the hairdresser. "You and a million other people trying to see him. He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it."<br><br>A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo.<br><br>The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome.<br><br>"It was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in one of Continental's brand new planes, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. The food and wine were wonderful, and I had a handsome 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot. And the hotel-it was great! They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!"<br><br>"Well," muttered the hairdresser, "That's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope."<br><br>"Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet me." Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand! I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me."<br><br>"Oh, really?" ...."What'd he say?"<br><br>He said, "Where'd you get the crappy hairdo?"<br><br>*****************************************************<br><br>Comments?<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another quite stupid joke :<br><br>Three dim witted friends decided to go out on an off-<br>road excursion through the desert in a sport utility<br>vehicle.  They hadn't planned the trip well enough and<br>eventually ran out of gas. The trio sat in the vehicle<br>for several hours pondering what they should do. Their<br>decision was to walk back to civilization, but with the<br>proviso that each person had to carry an item that<br>would be of use on their long and arduous journey back<br>home.<br><br>The smartest of the trio, quickly decided that he would<br>carry the water canteen for the trip and started the<br>trek back home. The second brightest friend sat and<br>pondered for several minutes, ultimately deciding he<br>would carry the flashlight and walked off to catch up<br>with his previously departed friend.<br><br>Several miles later into the sojourn, the first two<br>friends eventually caught up to one another and decided<br>to take a rest to let their third friend catch up with<br>them. An hour later the third dim witted friend<br>approached the other two dragging behind him one of the<br>doors from their vehicle.<br><br>The first friend said, "I brought the water canteen so<br>that we could have something to drink on our walk back<br>home." The second friend said, "And I brought the<br>flashlight for us to see in the dark, if we didn't get<br>home before sunset." The third friend not wanting to be<br>outdone by the other two, quickly said, " Well, I<br>brought this along in case it got too hot, we could<br>roll the window down."<br><br>------------------<br>Thomas Edison definition of genius :<br>"1% inspiration, 99% perspiration"</div>
