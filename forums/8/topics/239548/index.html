            <div class='col-md body'>My girlfriend and I just got together. Lately, her family brought her to see a fortune teller at golden mile complex. I have not seen this fortune teller before but from what I have gathered, it's on the second floor and his surname is "Guo".<br><br>Apparently, the fortune teller told my girlfriend and her family that she would not have a happy life with me. According to my girlfriend, this is what happened. It sounds a little dramatic but here goes:<br><br>1. The man invited a god to his body.<br>2. People take turns to see the man, with the god in his body.<br>3. My girlfriend's turn.<br>4. She knelt in front of him, without saying a word.<br>5. The man said she has 2 man in her life (one is her ex, and the other me)<br>6. The man said she like me.<br>7. The man said she would not have a happy life with me because I flirt around.<br>8. Another man, a devotee, brought her to a room and told her he had similar ecounter with the fortune teller and said he's right.<br>9. My girlfriend's family made her swear that she would no longer be with me.<br><br>Sounds absurd? Here's why I thought it's all a conspiracy. Her best friend had objected very strongly to us being together because she feels that I flirt around and she had been with her ex for 8 years and she should give up her previous relationship.<br><br>Best friend told her sister that I flirt around (and I do not), and her sister objected to us as well.<br><br>It appears that the whole thing sounds fishy to me as in everything just sounds so staged. Because my girlfriend knelt without saying anything, she thinks there' some element of truth.<br><br>Anyone knows who this fortune teller is? Any advice to how can I prove this whole thing is a conspiracy?<br><br>Thanks for the help.</div>
