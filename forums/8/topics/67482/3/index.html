Ridiculous! Someone who that size of tumour can still survive and post here?" How will that person feel, if she was really carrying one?! And yes, I am quoting the example of a recent news I saw on TV about this woman who really had an 80kg tumour, lived with it, and she had it removed recently.<br><br>i'm not flaming ok, just need to let out steam of what seems to be insensitive forumnites in our presence. just because something SOUNDS ridiculous doesn't mean it ISN'T TRUE. and if you only believe in evidence, tell me my dear friend, what evidence you want? I scan the cheque and post it here for everyone? In this exclusive situation we are talking about, it's confidential evidence (meaning, no way to get it publicly out...also meaning, I have no chance of proving to someone as rigid as you...only go by the book). If you don't believe in something, just say, "Wow, unbelievable!". I expect people to NOT believe me.<br><br>But don't ACCUSE people, it's like a grudge borne out of jealousy, haughtiness and pride, and for Pete's sake, I don't know u personally, which even rules out your accusation without solid evidence on your part that I am lying.<br><br>Just wish to say my piece.</div>

Ridiculous! Someone who that size of tumour can still survive and post here?" How will that person feel, if she was really carrying one?! And yes, I am quoting the example of a recent news I saw on TV about this woman who really had an 80kg tumour, lived with it, and she had it removed recently.<br><br>i'm not flaming ok, just need to let out steam of what seems to be insensitive forumnites in our presence. just because something SOUNDS ridiculous doesn't mean it ISN'T TRUE. and if you only believe in evidence, tell me my dear friend, what evidence you want? I scan the cheque and post it here for everyone? In this exclusive situation we are talking about, it's confidential evidence (meaning, no way to get it publicly out...also meaning, I have no chance of proving to someone as rigid as you...only go by the book). If you don't believe in something, just say, "Wow, unbelievable!". I expect people to NOT believe me.<br><br>But don't ACCUSE people, it's like a grudge borne out of jealousy, haughtiness and pride, and for Pete's sake, I don't know u personally, which even rules out your accusation without solid evidence on your part that I am lying.<br><br>Just wish to say my piece.</div></blockquote>*Applause*<span style="color: red;"></span><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>You're right gal!!!<br></div>
