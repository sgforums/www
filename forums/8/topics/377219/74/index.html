" longkang fish " , " Catfish " if really lucky, " Koi ", if really really really lucky " Eeel " Then a few uncles would offer to buy them for $$ depends on what type of fish and size. Good days i make $10++. It was pure heaven.. I could have buy all the ice creams i wanted. Buy all the chips from those " Stall " Homes and Ice Cream only cost 40cents!</p>
              <p>Another would be going to Jurong east would be like the biggest topic in my school since none of us even go there..People were alot simpler back in the days..i miss those uncles and aunties who give me free money whenever i board the bus...Dont ask me why they give..I also dont know..</p>

              <p>You ever seat at VIP room in the cinema before? I have!!! Due to circle seat fully occupied. And was escorted to 3 level vip room. Just like watching opera soap. I forgot the cinema name, it still exist, beside Plaza Singapura. The new cinema looks very grand.</p>
