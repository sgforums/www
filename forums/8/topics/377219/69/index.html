              <p>remembers the rubber trees along a bus stop near bedok area,,,,,,remembers malay food stall selling plenty of dishes from sambal cockles,sambal mussels,mutton rendang,beef rendang,fried potato patties,deep fried beef lungs,stewed spleens in curry,fried fish,sambal chilli,jackfruit sayur etc etc. and they were cheap too in those days!!how i wished i had bought more and ate till  my tummy burst!!!</p>
              <p>then there was the time where the bedok matsushita factory spewed chemicall fumes daily from the paintwork they were doing on compressors .everyday bedok mrt station smelt like part of the factory!remebers people from japan touring the plants and looking at machinery.all these important people coming all the way from japan just to look at compressor fridge production from start to end..from the metal stamping of sheet metal to curved compressor hemispherical assembly to electrical wiring windings by robots and assembling them into the compressor itself.i still rmeber the one called SQ compressor whicgh was longer than the average fridge compressor.</p>
              <p>i remebered the canteen looked like  some prison at the canteen and the food n curry were placed in beaten up aluminium pots.</p>
              <p>i remebered the gal from my cohort were placed in the office while the boys were placed in crummy places.i swear i wont wanna go back to those low tech enviroment again as a youth especially in japanese factories.</p>
