              <p>There was a time in the 80s when it was hard to find any
              homeless people in the streets of Singapore.Like Dog catchers there
              were people going around Singapore rounding up all destitutes and
              beggars putting them in a home.On one of our army educational
              visits  I was surprised to find some foreigners in
              there,spoke to an old man from Thailand who said he didnt have a
              passport or anyone and he wanted to go home but the caretakers told
              me he was insane....was he? He just couldnt speak a single word of
              English.</p>

              <p>By the 80s, most of the old Singapore were demolished or artificial.</p>
