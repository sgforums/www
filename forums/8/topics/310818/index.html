              <p>Anybody went to a recruitment agency before? I am very curious about how their system works because one bloody hao lian "recruitment consultant" in a well-known agency boast to me about how much she can earn in a month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Conversation went like this (during interview):</p>
              <p>Friend: We want to in a job like asking people to sign in credit card because the commission looks nice.</p>
              <p>Recruitment Consultant (RC): HA! You are wrong. Let me change your mindset before you think the wrong way in the future. Credit card is a very saturated industry. Recruitment agencies are better because everyday will have people looking for jobs!</p>
              <p>Note* -&gt; This point I agree, but I just cant stand her arrogant attitude.</p>
              <p>Me: Then how do you earn your commission? Because we came across an ad that says "Job offer: Recruitment consultant - $1,500 + commission + attractive bonus".</p>
              <p>RC: $1500?!! ARE YOU SURE WE EARN ONLY $1500?!!! You got to be kidding, I am a degree holder and I can tell you that I earn more than that! I tell you I earn 10k a month, you believe or not?</p>
              <p>RC: This job is the best. Unlike sales or insurance, people come and look for you! Not you look for people. And I look down on other recruitment agencies because I feel that its an insult to our agency!</p>
              <p>Friend: Then how you all calculate the pay that all of us get? Its up to you right?</p>
              <p>RC: No no no... The company pays the agency in a lump sum. Then we calculate. We count, we do your timesheet, we contact here and there.. Very troublesome..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Note** -&gt; In the end, I still feel that the pay that we get is just what they see fit? Because the figures are there for them to decide. So they can be like telling you $6 per hour because they choose to earn more instead of letting the people that work earn more? You get what I mean?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she even boast about how difficult her job is. We then tried to ask her if we can join this line since the pay can hit 10k per month. Guess what she said?</p>
              <p>RC: You only diploma. Everyone here is a degree holder or at the very least, doing part time degree. The reason being that the client (companies looking for employees who approach them) will feel better talking to a degree holder. And also, your namecard looks better!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At this point of time, we really feel like punching her because of her attiude and her ugly face. :P   Anyways, her job is so simple that I think a O lvl student can do it with a bit of training involved. Its just calling people and asking them whether they want a job or not? And calculation wise, O lvl maths will be sufficient????? Duh..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SO my point is that, from my conversation with her, I really feel very stressed about looking for a job through agencies because they can eat you if they want to. But the problem is that, most of the advertisement in for example, JobsDB dot com is filled with recruitment agencies!  Its so stupid. Seriously.</p>
              <p>The plus point about companies outsourcing for recruitment agencies is that its fast. And they get to sack you as and when they want to because there is no strings attached. And if you get injured or whatever, its the agency that is in charge of your medical fees or whatever.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soooo...... Any thoughts people? Or anyone working for them can clarify my doubts about how the system works? I also heard from some other agencies saying some agencies giving low rates to job-seekers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Summary of this post = There is a darker side to the recrutiment agencies industry.</p>

              all i can say is the recruitment consultant is such a big big liar. im working in a recruitment agency as well but am just a temp admin assisting my boss.
              
              the recruitment consultants basic pay is $1500 to $1800.every month they have a sales target to meet,which is set by the boss. e.g. sales target for March: $5000
              
              so lets say they hit $6000, they'll keep up to (50-70%) of the $1000 which exceeded their sales target.
              
              recruitment consultants who do local placements [placing ppl like you and i] rarely hit $5k at all ok.
              
              ppl like my boss who do international placements [placing china/india engineers at construction sites] earn lots. min. $15,000/mth. 
              
              so that RC is definitely lying. talk so much cock only, u shoulda slap/kick/slamdunk/smash/body/slam him/her.
              
              you dont need a degree pls. this is a sales line. the best ppl with the best EQ and peoples skills always win.
