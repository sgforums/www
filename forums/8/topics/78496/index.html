I used to stay there during my trip in Bangkok.<br>If you are adventurous enough, there is a THAI HOUSE INN in one of the alleys there. It hidden from the main road. But the thing shiok about it is, you will be able to find those internet cafes, as well as one-room karaoke which you pay with coins for one song! Thats really cool. Further down the alley, you will come across a open-air bar!<br>Hope you enjoy your trip! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

MBK is quite good.. if you would like to roam around in the city.. can stay in Pathumwan princess hotel.. it is linked to MBK.. and you can get good food at cheap prices there..<br><br>In Bangkok.. you must must eat at their Japanese restaurants.. They have very very good Japanese food.. even though they are restaurants.. but they are very cheap..can visit Siam Square or Oriental for shopping.. but the things there are not cheap.. coz mainly branded stuffs.. and for tourists...<br><br>But for cheap shopping.. you cannot miss the Cha Tu Chak.. it is weekend market.. and also Patpong.. though Patpong is not very clean... as there are many prostitutes and trans... and thai girl shows... but it's like pasar malam too.. you should be able to get some good bargains there.. but you must be very careful of your personal belongings... coz it's very crowded there.. and people tend to bump into you ... so you never know..<br><br>If you like Jim Thompson stuffs.. you can buy it in Bangkok as they have a very big shop with many varieties.. much better than Singapore...I bought many scarves and shawl as gifts for my mum and relatives..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Koh Samui? Not bad a place for relaxation. Most people would go to Chaweng for accomodations as its the most developed part of the island. The whole island is about one-third the size of Singapore, so u can actually tour the whole island in less than 3 hours. If u are willing to spend on accomodations, try going to Tong Sai. The beach and water there is beautiful. But very expensive too. Be sure to visit the Grandfather and Grandmother rock in Lamui. U will be in for a surprise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Bangkok is quite ok for a shopper. The night market, (Chatuchak) is about the size of 9 soccer fields (At least this is what the tour guide told me the last time I was there.....) but the variety tends to repeat once u go through a few rows of the shops.<br><br>Also, visit the river that's full of catfish. It's a rare sight when u throw bread into the murky waters and see all the catfish surfacing. Oh yes, don't miss the theatre that hosts transvetite shows as well. Some of them are very pretty and I did have some photo shots with a couple of them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
