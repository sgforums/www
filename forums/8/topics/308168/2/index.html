              <p>1)The teacher is definitely lack of professionalism.  Shouldnt post  students work online unless he has real good things to say - even so, he has to seek his students' permission - intellectual property. In this case, he has done BIG harm to student's pride.</p>
              <p>2)Stompers - a bunch of nothing to do, untrained, reporters wannabe.</p>

              <p>I am sorry you had to meet such a teacher that had to resort to this to make you learn. <br>However, there is a difference between laughing at your face</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and annoucing your mistakes to the world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure if he was trained to be a teacher - he was relief teaching and you don't need to be trained. But if in spite of all the training - he does not learn how to be sensitive to who he is teaching - then I tihnk his training is pointless.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">i think the teacher really too much already...</span></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">to a student, a teacher's words carry certain weight.  </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">till today, i remember my maths teacher told me in my face 'you are a failure!'.. when a student is not doing well at a subject, a teacher's job is to guide him and correct his mistakes instead of mocking at him.  </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ae3cee;">currently there are too many teachers who are really lacking in the passion/patience to teach...probably coz students nowadays aren't that easy to teach.  I believe we have all read too many news about teachers (the black sheeps), that i feel that MOE should be more stringent when it comes to recruiting teachers.  It seems that many of them do not have the right qualities/ethics to teach.</span>  </p>

              <p>He was probably in his 1st year of teaching as a relief or a contract teacher... so, not much harm done to his rice bowl. He just has to find himself another job.</p>

              <p>The teacher is mocking at the students for the sake of fun. It is as bad as laughing at someone who has just fallen down, made more despicable because of the age difference.</p>

              <p><br>If no action is taken towards the teacher, many will follow suit...Doesn't mean if the kids can take it, teachers should continue to laugh at their mistakes. They come to school not to be laughed at, but to learn. How to learn when the environment is not condusive?</p>

              <p>I am sad.</p>
              <p>I am sad because the relief teacher got sacked for something that is blown out of proportion.</p>
              <p>I am sad because the 'punishment' meted out is too harsh and not forgiving.</p>
              <p>I am NOT related to the relief teacher nor am I against anyone here...but here's mho.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine Jay was chatting to 'Lucas', his good fren, about his work in a kopitiam. Little did he know that some ramdom stranger who happened to be slacking at the same kopitiam was snooping around, overheard and recorded their conversation. The stranger then reported it to the mgt and Jay got sacked for breach of corp confidentiality. And all the while, Jay did not mention actual names.</p>
              <p>And then Jay case got aired in Stomp and some peeps in forums sayed Jay deserved it -  that he should have known better...that if Jay was professional, he should not be chatting to his good fren Lucas about his work in a public area like kopitiam...and imply Jay did not deserved his freedom of speech and expression....and Jay got sacked without a STRONG reason is actually reasonable....</p>
