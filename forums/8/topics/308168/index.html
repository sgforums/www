              <p>Stomp really went too far with this one... The teacher had a rough day and whine about it in his/her blog...</p>
              <p>We all do the same once in a while... I remember I got post long time ago about how I was having a bad day coz of a bitch of a project partner...</p>
              <p>But stomp went and twist the meaning to make the teacher look bad... Its like making my whinehouse post from "i'm having a bad day coz of a bitch of a project partner" scenero to a "I called my project partner a bitch" kind a scenerio...</p>
              <p>Stomp really is getting out of control... They got a lot of people thinking "police is not doing their job", "aunties ar rude on MRTS", "students are getting bullied by their teachers", etc...</p>
              <p>Most af their negative stories are very one sided... this closely resemble how american media keep showing about muslim terrorist and now a lot of americans hate muslims...</p>
              <p>Same thing with stomp... if they show enough one sided news about teachers being mean to students, parents are going to believe their children when they say "teacher bullied me" eventhough they are exagerating... i was a student once and I can remember there are more students bully teachers than the opposite...</p>
              <p>What's worse, stomp is making money out of this...</p>
              <p>They really make me sick to my stomache... <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/unhappy.png" alt="unhappy.png"></p>

              <p>Anyway, back to topic... I'm the type of guy that puts myself in other people's shoe... And I don't think he deserves it... He's a teacher, he instill knowlege... he helps the children to get smart... then one wrong move (which I still doubt to be a very wrong move to deserve to be fired), *poof* bye bye rice bowl... and once he's fired by MOE, he's never going to be a teacher in SIngapore anymore...</p>

              <p>Sure, he didn't think long and hard about the ramifications of posting those essays online.... well, I say that if his mouth goes faster than his brain, and he can't process the possibility that his words may hurt the kids under him, then he's not qualified to teach.</p>

              <p>he only lost his job. and if he does not possess the inherent patience required for being a teacher - then it is good that he realises it now.
