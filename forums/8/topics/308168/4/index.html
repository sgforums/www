              <p>the way the teacher did is wrong n uncalled for. but the way the moe sack her is really kinda harsh without hearing the explanation from the teacher n giving her a chance.</p>
              <p>tis is again so one sided n really teach us pple a lesson. nvr to catch in the act by those stompers or post out any of ur real life information which may be of harm to u on internet. cos some pple may blow until so big dat it may affect ur life.</p>

              <p>He deserved it, the punishment and the shaming in STOMP. This should teach a lesson to all who blog irresponsibly, thinking nobody will give a hoot to what you write, so you write all sorts of rubbish. I've seen so many blogs talking about stuff without even verifying what they say. And all it takes is a simple google.</p>
              <p>His attitude towards teaching is clearly a wrong one, so I don't think there is anything to his defence, at all. Venting frustration online is just an excuse.</p>

              <p>There are many good point of views here (as well as craps)...good thing everyone has an opinion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue for me is the extent of punishment:</p>
              <p>- Jon is silly enough to blog and associate himself with the school.</p>
              <p>- The school managed to 'track' him and take action</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The BIG question is, is the action taken against Jon justifiable?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not talking about whether Jon deserves it or not - we know he deserved to be punished, but how/what/when/why...</p>
              <p>We are not talking about shaming or mockery because this is not a valid point to begin with IMHO - no names were published.</p>
              <p>( no need those 'imagine your doctors' or 'your child's teacher'...these are hypothetical, and I'm not really a big fan of Samsung ads anyway...)</p>
              <p>We are not talking about whether Jon is good or bad teacher. At least for me, I cannot make that judgement call base on a silly blog. It's a blog for goodness sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, it's all about justice, being forgiving, and being able to laugh at life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justice - sacking of Jon with ambigous excuse and subcumbed to pressure is not just.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forgiving - I feel that the school was not forgiving...yes, a school is not a monastry. It is a institute of learning. And to me, I learn more through mistakes than rightness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Laughing at ourselves - To some forumites here, if you happened to be my doctor, and you think that my condition is funny enough to brighten your day, I hereby grant you my personal consent to joke about it. Do keep it anonymous like Jon (he does have THAT decency to...) and you may mention your clinic's name I dun give a damn.</p>
              <p>For those who managed to catch me prancing in my pokka dots undergarment, you may blog about it, I dun care either. But if you dare take one picture and feed it to hungry Stomp claiming that I am indecently dressed in MY house, in front of your eyes, and that you are worried that your hypothetical spastic neighbour's childen (not even your own) will be morally affected, and grow up to become an illogical bloke or blokette like you who does not have the guts to face up to issue personally AND directly, only to hit below the belt and take lousy composed pictures via your weak camera phone secretly like the same voyeur of your alter ego....well, frankly...there's nothing much I can do, can I? You are just so low.</p>

              <p>i believe that the teacher actually posted these on his blog basically to vent his anger and frustration when marking or teaching the primary school kids. i can see them in some of the teachers. its really tiring and it makes them feel better if they shout out loud or actually write their experience on their blog. it just makes their day better. well of course im not sure whether the teacher have no ill intentions of laughing at the kids but rather used his blog as a tool to vent his anger and solve his frustrations.</p>

              <p><br>It is not wrong for the teacher to vent his frustration after a hard day's work. It is the way he vent it that cause him to be sacked. He could have vent his frustration and let off some steam by punching a sand bag, going to the gym for a workout, confiding in a close friend over a drink etc. etc. but no, the teacher has to put these into his blog, which is in puiblic domain for all to see. But what strikes me as unforgivable above all, is that the blog entry smacks of malicious glee. I would even go on and say that this amounts to a breach of fiduciary relationship between a teacher and a student.</p>
              <p>The teacher fully deserved to be sacked. </p>

              <p>The teacher should be more constructive in his blog, particularly toward a Pri 3. Shouldn't he be more worried about the kid's work?</p>

              <p>There are many good point of views here (as well as
              craps)...good thing everyone has an opinion...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The issue for me is the extent of punishment:</p>
              <p>- Jon is silly enough to blog and associate himself with the
              school.</p>
              <p>- The school managed to 'track' him and take action</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The BIG question is, is the action taken against Jon
              justifiable?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We are not talking about whether Jon deserves it or not - we
              know he deserved to be punished, but how/what/when/why...</p>
              <p>We are not talking about shaming or mockery because this is not
              a valid point to begin with IMHO - no names were published.</p>
              <p>( no need those 'imagine your doctors' or 'your child's
              teacher'...these are hypothetical, and I'm not really a big fan of
              Samsung ads anyway...)</p>
              <p>We are not talking about whether Jon is good or bad teacher. At
              least for me, I cannot make that judgement call base on a silly
              blog. It's a blog for goodness sake.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me, it's all about justice, being forgiving, and being able
              to laugh at life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Justice - sacking of Jon with ambigous excuse and subcumbed to
              pressure is not just.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Forgiving - I feel that the school was not forgiving...yes, a
              school is not a monastry. It is a institute of learning. And to me,
              I learn more through mistakes than rightness.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Laughing at ourselves - To some forumites here, if you happened
              to be my doctor, and you think that my condition is funny enough to
              brighten your day, I hereby grant you my personal consent to joke
              about it. Do keep it anonymous like Jon (he does have THAT decency
              to...) and you may mention your clinic's name I dun give a
              damn.</p>

              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Cos he's no former relation to the student nor the school already.</p>
