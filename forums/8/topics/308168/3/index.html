              <p>I am sad.</p>
              <p>I am sad because the relief teacher got sacked for something that is blown out of proportion.</p>
              <p>I am sad because the 'punishment' meted out is too harsh and not forgiving.</p>
              <p>I am NOT related to the relief teacher nor am I against anyone here...but here's mho.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Imagine Jay was chatting to 'Lucas', his good fren, about his work in a kopitiam. Little did he know that some ramdom stranger who happened to be slacking at the same kopitiam was snooping around, overheard and recorded their conversation. The stranger then reported it to the mgt and Jay got sacked for breach of corp confidentiality. And all the while, Jay did not mention actual names.</p>
              <p>And then Jay case got aired in Stomp and some peeps in forums sayed Jay deserved it -  that he should have known better...that if Jay was professional, he should not be chatting to his good fren Lucas about his work in a public area like kopitiam...and imply Jay did not deserved his freedom of speech and expression....and Jay got sacked without a STRONG reason is actually reasonable....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sad...</p>

              <p><br>nehpyh, the kopitiam scene in your example is different from that of a blog.  As some of the other posters have pointed out, a blog is in a public domain and will be subject to scrutiny of others.  On the other hand, a conversation between Jay and Lucas (regardless of venue) should be considered made in confidence and not subject to public scrutiny.  On the other hand, one should always be careful when discussing such things in the public.  You never know whether the walls have ears. Surely as a professional or an employee, an employer would have, as part of its training, warned that person never to disclose work details or breach any confidential information in the public.  Freedom of speech doesn't mean you can blabber away confidential information without bearing any consequences.</p>
              <p>My area of work demands that I maintain strict confidentiality over what I do.  In that sense, I am not wholly sympathetic towards this guy.</p>

              <p>I understand what you mean, bro Lennon. My vague analogy is after all, an analogy - nothing better than the real case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jon's blog belongs to him. Anyone can read. Anyone can comment. If someone is dissatified, complaint to Jon directly. Flame him. Spam him. I dun think we care.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What I am unhappy is that most peeps chose to b*tch about issues in indirectly Stomp, Whinehouse, etc (ungly Singapoleans this, ugly Singapolean that)....and then pressure the cmi authority to act. And our tan-chak Stomp still pick up such tabloid and seek comments from MOE. The best part, 38 MOE sacked the relief teacher for mocking 'anonymous' students! Sigh...</p>
              <p>Jon didn't reveal the students name right? What shaming were they talking about?</p>
              <p>And to sack Jon under 'confidentiallity guidelines'?</p>
              <p>1. It's a guideline. Not law.</p>
              <p>2. What confidentiality was breached? Name of school? Compos of students? Why? Got copyright meh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact was Jon mocked his 'anonymous' students in a public channel. Punish him for mocking. Where is the breach of confidentiality?</p>
              <p>And to me, a public apology is good enough. Extent of punishment is open for  debate some other day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting a general comment I have gathered so far:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I may infer and add to the above:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher = lousy school = lousy MOE = lousy garment = lousy nation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Teachers, since you cannot whack your students anymore, just scold them and complain to their KS parents. But with the 'confidentiality guidelines', please refrain from scolding them too loudly cos their peers will laugh, and the tuckshop 38 aunties will write to Stomp. And Stomp will address to MOE. MOE will be blurred and launch an investigation. Then the principle will feel stressed and sacked the teacher. Then no enuff teacher. Then MOE will spend taxpayers money and adverstise on TV and cinemas, 'inspiring' us to 'make teaching come alive'!</p>

              <p>my 2 cents worth</p>
              <p>Indeed, the teacher's actions were inappropriate, but is being inappropriate sufficient enough to sack someone? Wouldn't a warning be sufficient?</p>
              <p>For those who defend the actions of sacking the teacher through the reason(excuse) of the kid feeling sorry for themselves (self-pity), I think its total crap.</p>
              <p>Already, the standards of our education are dropping (I am not talking about academic results, I am talking about our morals), and you have people like these forumers who continue to think that by protecting the kids, giving them safe harbour (kids are forever never wrong because they are young), they are doing the kids good. You are the exact people that will result in kids becoming less and less able to take care of themselves.</p>
              <p>For those who think the teacher should be sacked, let's see what you say about yourself when one day you get sacked because of a small matter (like taking home a pencil for example).</p>
              <p>Oh ya, STOMP is rubbish and should be shut down.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the sacking is not a case of the kids feeling sori for themselves, I believe the kids dun even care what is going on except going home bells and when is holidays coming.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is the public outcry of poor professionalism and unethical manner of a teacher that totally destroy the intergrity and dignity of teaching professional as a whole that lead to no other choice for the school and MOE in concern to decide to remove him. And in employment act, hiring and firing is the perogative of the employer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Not that today pples are  protecting their childrens, it is because today parents are on par with teachers or even better in knowledge and able to understand the issue better rather than our last generation parents who for some, can't even read nor write. And accompanied with knowledge and education themselves, parents today can voice out their dissatisfaction thru various channel of communications.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And as for moral, the society itself protray an academic pay rather than base on moral, therefore the responsibility to behave morally is very much belong to the society where govts, parents and all of us play a role, but if u say that if 7 A is going to get a high pay, who cares about moral. The childrens cannot be blame of being no moral, it is the society as a whole that must change. And that include u and me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The blog is a public blog, he should know that, nobody is sacking him, he is sacking himself thru his unethical act and he should be feeling regret about it, learn from it, and carry on with his life better and brighter for the republic of Singapore moral.</p>

              <p>What I am unhappy is that most peeps chose to b*tch about issues in indirectly Stomp, Whinehouse, etc (ungly Singapoleans this, ugly Singapolean that)....and then pressure the cmi authority to act. And our tan-chak Stomp still pick up such tabloid and seek comments from MOE. The best part, 38 MOE sacked the relief teacher for mocking 'anonymous' students! Sigh...</p>
              <p>Jon didn't reveal the students name right? What shaming were they talking about?</p>
              <p>And to sack Jon under 'confidentiallity guidelines'?</p>
              <p>1. It's a guideline. Not law.</p>
              <p>2. What confidentiality was breached? Name of school? Compos of students? Why? Got copyright meh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The fact was Jon mocked his 'anonymous' students in a public channel. Punish him for mocking. Where is the breach of confidentiality?</p>
              <p>And to me, a public apology is good enough. Extent of punishment is open for  debate some other day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting a general comment I have gathered so far:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I may infer and add to the above:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher = lousy school = lousy MOE = lousy garment = lousy nation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Teachers, since you cannot whack your students anymore, just scold them and complain to their KS parents. But with the 'confidentiality guidelines', please refrain from scolding them too loudly cos their peers will laugh, and the tuckshop 38 aunties will write to Stomp. And Stomp will address to MOE. MOE will be blurred and launch an investigation. Then the principle will feel stressed and sacked the teacher. Then no enuff teacher. Then MOE will spend taxpayers money and adverstise on TV and cinemas, 'inspiring' us to 'make teaching come alive'!</p>

              <p>Anyway, back to topic... I'm the type of guy that puts myself in other people's shoe... And I don't think he deserves it... He's a teacher, he instill knowlege... he helps the children to get smart... then one wrong move (which I still doubt to be a very wrong move to deserve to be fired), *poof* bye bye rice bowl... and once he's fired by MOE, he's never going to be a teacher in SIngapore anymore...</p>
              <p>Pretty heave price to pay for something so small huh...</p>
              <p>I would understand if he's habitual and openly humiliates the students personally, but this is nonsense... plus no one was hurt by the teacher's action...</p>
              <p>I bet if this was never posted on STOMP, this probably would just be a complaint to MOE and the teacher would be warned to take down the post... no one had to get hurt, but becase of stomp the teacher got hurt...</p>

              <p>There's another article from stomp (I can't remember where), the army driver accidently knocked down a fence... but the damage was superficial and he fut the fence back up like nothing has happened... but an idiot stomper post it on the net and now he kena DB... no one had to get hurt, but because of stome, someone got hurt...</p>

              <p>I understand what you mean, bro Lennon. My vague analogy is
              after all, an analogy - nothing better than the real case.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My point is this:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jon's blog belongs to him. Anyone can read. Anyone can comment.
              If someone is dissatified, complaint to Jon directly. Flame him.
              Spam him. I dun think we care.</p>
              <p><em>If he complains about himself, don't think anyone would care either. But he is complaining about his students, who trust him to teach them, not to laugh at their mistakes.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jon didn't reveal the students name right? What shaming were
              they talking about?</p>
              <p><em>Although the names are not revealed, the school name is. It reflects badly on the school if nothing is being done to the teacher and soon teachers all over Singapore will be doing the same thing, posting up students' mistakes online just for the sake of fun. Don't be surprised one day you find your own essays here and have tonnes of people laughing at all your errors.</em></p>
              <p>And to sack Jon under 'confidentiallity guidelines'?</p>
              <p>1. It's a guideline. Not law.</p>
              <p>2. What confidentiality was breached? Name of school? Compos of
              students? Why? Got copyright meh?</p>
              <p><em>Every individual's work belongs to that person. Without his or her permission, you cannot just reveal their work to everyone in the whole wide world.</em></p>
              <p>The fact was Jon mocked his 'anonymous' students in a public
              channel. Punish him for mocking. Where is the breach of
              confidentiality?</p>
              <p>And to me, a public apology is good enough. Extent of punishment
              is open for  debate some other day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Quoting a general comment I have gathered so far:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I may infer and add to the above:</p>
              <p>lousy student = lousy teacher = lousy school = lousy MOE = lousy
              garment = lousy nation</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>P.S. Teachers, since you cannot whack your students anymore,
              just scold them and complain to their KS parents. But with the
              'confidentiality guidelines', please refrain from scolding them too
              loudly cos their peers will laugh, and the tuckshop 38 aunties will
              write to Stomp. And Stomp will address to MOE. MOE will be blurred
              and launch an investigation. Then the principle will feel stressed
              and sacked the teacher. Then no enuff teacher. Then MOE will spend
              taxpayers money and adverstise on TV and cinemas, 'inspiring' us to
              'make teaching come alive'!</p>
