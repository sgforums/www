            <div class='col-md body'>Genetically females aren't as well programmed as males to drive. Males in pre historic days were hunters and needed to gauge distances and angles better. That explains a better parallel parking ability for males.<br>For females they needed to guard the nest, and thus needed a wider field of vision. This explains why a man can be searching in the refrigerator for a soda, have it right in front of him and still can't see it but the woman can locate the soda can from 3 meters away.<br><br>------------------<br>Honesty is the Worst policy when taking an exam in CME</div>
