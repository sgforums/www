US??<br><br>Anyway, I am still enjoying myself here, and so are your friends (look at the amount of posts they have in my thread...).<br><br>So all I can say is, this is still a free forum (I hope!), where people can come in here and have freedom of speech and more importantly, freedom to reply to a post...<br><br>So if you think we are a waste of time, just dun bother about us...cos we will not get into your way...we dun need to. we are just happy being ourselves...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>WWWWAAAAASSSSUUUUUPPPPP!!!!!!!!</div>
