            <div class='col-md body'>Converted, when I was young (between 5 to 9) &amp; living in a kampong, there's this church along the main road that conducted classes for children (I guess it's Sunday school or regular pre-school, anyway, too young to remember) and long long time ago ~ air-con very expensive &amp; not readily available, so the windows of the classes were always open and I can see into the classes &amp; hear the teachers talking, so that's how I got to know about God &amp; Jesus Christ. Have never attended those classes 'coz my parents aren't Christians, thank God that He made them tolerant of my faith &amp; allowed me to go the church and listened in from outside the classroom even then &amp; they've never interfered although they did try to discourage me when I was in my teens {their query: what if our 'gods' fight? hee hee ... Luckily I was stubborn even then &amp; I wouldn't listen to them}. And when we were re-settled in a housing estate when I was 10, I remembered young adults coming to the void decks and telling us stories of Jesus Christ, they were not overly zealous, so accepting Christ was not that much of an issue. Nowadays, sometimes I find some Christians' evangelistic efforts are overly zealous &amp; quite off-putting.<br><br>Professed Christian for donkey years but got this warp twisted idea that going to church regularly isn't necessary due to various reasons such as some Christians are quite hypocritical &amp; have 'holier than thou' attitudes, anyway, got straightened on this issue &amp; have been going to church on a regular basis for the past two years &amp;  my faith is stronger now because of regular bible reading - my aim is to finish reading all the 66 books of the bible by this year, I have never completed reading the whole bible before or tried reading it for that matter &amp; in the last few years, that begin to bother me greatly &amp; in late 1998, I started on the quest to start reading the bible regularly. Am I a slow reader or what?<br><br>While growing up, I dared not disbelieve about other religions' deities [reason: none of their deities preach about doing bad stuff &amp; they preach only doing good, so they can't be wrong &amp; that bad, right? Well, I know better now.] but Christ is always no. 1 in my choice of God although I back-slided several times by not attending church regularly.<br><br>A bible recommendation here:<br><br>For those new to bible reading:<br>THE STUDENT BIBLE (NIV version by Zondervan Publishing) is quite good with lots of interesting articles that explains the culture &amp; customs of biblical times.<br><br>THE QUEST STUDY BIBLE (NIV version by Zondervan), again lots of explanatory terms &amp; notes &amp; articles.<br><br>For more in-depth understanding of the bible:<br>LIFE APPLICATION BIBLE (NKJV version by Tyndale, NKJV is quite difficult to find, usually available in Living Translation or NIV), the notes are great - sometimes even longer than the bible verses itself. Tend to skip those really controversial verses but good enough.<br><br>Oh, just bear with me a little while more, I would like to recommend a Christian author - Frederick Buechner, I have 3 of his books which I find very interesting &amp; very useful to understanding the bible. These are "Peculiar Treasures - a biblical who's who", "Whistling in the Dark - a doubter's dictionary" &amp; "Wishful thinking - a seeker's abc". For these three books, Buechner is observant, very humourous &amp; he's not beyond sarcasm either. Borders has a good selection of Christian books and no I don't work there, wish I did though, then I can get staff discounts.<br><br>Wishing all a great weekend!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi oakley &amp; Ah_BLuR,<br><br>Go get a study bible, it was the same for me. I had several ordinary bibles and tried reading them a few times before getting study bibles in 1998 but I had to give up because I couldn't understand it, I read the words, but the words don't mean a thing to me. Perhaps it wasn't time for me yet or maybe I did get smarter as I grew older, but since I got The Student Bible &amp; the Life Application Bible, the bible now makes sense to me and as I read it daily, I begin to love God &amp; it more. You should try reading these study bibles, you don't have to buy them yet, just go to the Christianity section in Borders, they have a good selection of study bibles.<br><br>Okay, so you may not be christians, but what's the harm in reading the bible, as it has been said, it's the greatest book in the whole wide world, been in circulation or publication for at least the past 2000 years, which other book can lay claim to that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> If your friend had recommended you the latest best-seller, wouldn't you want to read it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chinese<br><br>My parents are taoists. Though religion can be inherited, not believes.<br><br>Started to question the existance of a supernatural being at a late age of 18. I was from a Catholic School and I did attend Sunday services when in China. Read Bible when I am on holiday. Say prayer when frightened (especially when I was in the Catholic School). Say prayers for my Christian frens who are troubled/suffering.<br><br>I could not decide on my religion. I dunno wat to choose cos I think I don't know ENOUGH to make a wise decision. Started to read books on Buddhism, Taoism, Hinduism, Sai Ba Ba (!?)<br><br>Finally, I decided to choose Buddhism. Buddhists do not believe in the existance of a supernatural being (unlike Taoists). Buddhists do not believe in a Creator. Buddhism is A WAY OF LIFE. As simple as that.<br><br>I find Buddha's teaching very enlightening. It instills peace in me. It helps me understand the things that are happening around me. It helps me to achieve a state of equilibrium with my surroundings.<br><br>So am I a Buddhist ? err ... not important. In Buddhism, everything is dynamic, including a person's believe. I don't "belong" to a religion. I just absorb all the wisdom in different religions and hope to be a better person.<br><br>I believe in practical work. I do social work, almost went India. I think helping those who are suffering now is more practical than spending our precious time trying to find out who created us. Our past cannot be changed, but our future can, so i work on my future not my past.<br><br>I always thought it would be nice if Sunday Services can be converted to social work.
