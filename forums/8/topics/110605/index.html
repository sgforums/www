            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>US Officials detected Quake but there was no alert<br>system ................. Do you also think so<br>................... Is it essential to have some<br>mechanized system ........... to save few lives if not<br>all<br><br>Just read this ..............abstracts of article<br>appeared in Economic Times .....dated 28th Dec 04 may<br>be we would know what US is .............<br><br>"US Officials who detected a massive earthquake off<br>Asia's Coast on Saturday tried frantically to warn the<br>deadly wall of water was coming, the head of the<br>Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said on Sunday. But<br>there was no official alert system in the region<br>because such catastrophes only happen there about once<br>every 700 years, said Charles McCreery, director of<br>the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's<br>center in Honolulu.<br><br>Now just read the important part of the<br>article........<br><br>"We tried to do what we could" McCreery said, "we<br>don't have contacts in our address book for anybody in<br>that part of the world" ...........do you think in a<br>country of 100 + crores populations one needs address<br>book ........... don't we have a Prime Minister, Who<br>could have been informed...........don't we have our<br>embassy in US......<br><br>"We actually issued a bulletin about the quake but it<br>only went to the countries in the pacific ....that<br>subscribe .... And that would include Australia and<br>Indonesia"<br><br>...........Just think thru..........after advancement<br>of Civilisation from stone age to present<br>Revolutionary Communication Age......... do Mankind<br>have to wait for some subscription to save<br>lives............. Just because US has invested in<br>these monitoring  systems ......US felt it not<br>necessary to save lives of Indians and Sri-lankans who<br>have been worstly effected ..........so many mothers<br>lost children and many children lost their parents<br>isn't it a sheer poor mindset that US carries .....<br><br>"they were unable to reach the thousands in the<br>countries most severely affected including India,<br>Thailand and Sri Lanka because none had tsunami<br>warning mechanism or tidal gauges to alert people, he<br>said ...............................just think thru<br>again ..... do we need such mechanized version<br>to save lives .........we have live incident of<br>GANESHA DRINKING MILK ........ and this news was<br>spread across India in just half hour<br>.................. Tsunami had given around 1.5 hr<br>...........don't you think we had enough time for<br>saving many lives ..........think of those Children,<br>Old age people and not the least our Air force<br>personnel's who lost their lives ................<br><br>Now just read the last note .............this will<br>shatter you .................<br><br>"A warning center such as those used around the<br>pacific could have saved thousands of lives, Waverly<br>person of the US Geological Survey's National<br>Earthquake information Center, said most of those<br>people could have been saved if they had a tsunami<br>warning system in place or tide gauges......he said<br>......and I think this will be a lesson to them.."<br><br>Just try to find out Answer..............<br>1) Had US tried to inform Indian Admin, how many lives<br>could have been saved from 8000+ till now...<br>2) Is technology a monopoly to save someone<br>lives..............<br>3) What lesson is US trying to teach us and that too<br>at cost of so many lives....<br>4) Is US trying sell these mechanized products to us<br>by not saving lives........and boosting its economy<br>5) Are we dependent on others to save our<br>countrymen......<br>6) At this point we are trying to provide aid to<br>srilanka and others inspite of fact that India too is<br>suffering and ................US could not inform us<br>as their address book was empty????<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I prefer the United States to have given the warning and get slamed if there is no real tsunami than half-hearted efforts to report the possiblity of tsunamis - lives were at stake and they did it for their own 911 and now they were slow again (ok, perhaps the bueracracies of the various Asian governments are too blame too).<br><br>As for the donation and help effort, I think it will be pouring in fast and strong for Aceh area, esp from US, Japan and other developed countries. Reason being Aceh is oil rich!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding the tsunami disaster, I think the US response is so-so. It can be better. The US is the richest country in the world and has a lot of military assets like ships, planes, etc. However, they didnt go all out with all their money or assets to help the countries. They did give some help, but to me, since the disaster is so big, and also since the US is the richest country with big military assets, the help should be more.<br><br>On the other hand, we must remember that US is not really affected. This is not like 911 where they were affected directly and woke up their entire nation. This disaster happened so far away from them. So, it really isnt a matter of national self-interest for them to help. More of a humanitarian reason, and maybe PR reason, to build good image and goodwill.<br><br>But we must remember, a help is supposed to be appreciated, no matter how small. You cant DEMAND a help. It's up to each country to decide how they want to help.<br><br>So, under the circumstances, it's hard for me to "blame" a country who has lent a help, although not much, coz a help no matter how small should be appreciated, and also hard for me to have a good impression of the US too, coz they are not all-out in helping.<br><br>What I admire more, are the NGOs and public and individuals from all over the world, including some from US, who have shown alot of compassion and help.<br><br>I just read something beautiful. Every action has reaction. The waves of destruction has brought the waves of compassion. Isnt that beautiful?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I agree with an earlier post when someone said they should be happy getting anything.  If someone gave you $100 for your birthday would you say "why only $100, why didn't you give me $1000?".  See it is quite rude to say something like that.  I think the US is being very generous giving $350 million plus the use of their naval ships, helicopters, aircraft, etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now that the disater has struck, it's up to any country to say anything, all the press would be trying to dig more stories... so at the end of the day, do we know what is really said? All are "hear- say".<br><br>What has happened is already a fact. Rather than to sit here and start pointing fingers saying about what other countries could have done to prevented this disater, why not think how much more can you contribute to help the ppl who lost their homes, family and loved ones?<br><br>No matter who blame who now... it's already too late. It's one precious lesson we learn on the expense on others. So be happy that you're still alive and do something to help. So wat USA is for war and not help ppl? There are also locals who is saying "heng ah... not s'pore"... I even heard ppl saying that those who died in the disater must have done really bad deeds to deserve it. So you tell me... what is what??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Li Ka Shing:</div><div class="quote_body">Regarding the tsunami disaster, I think the US response is so-so. It can be better. The US is the richest country in the world and has a lot of military assets like ships, planes, etc. However, they didnt go all out with all their money or assets to help the countries. They did give some help, but to me, since the disaster is so big, and also since the US is the richest country with big military assets, the help should be more.</div></blockquote>Are you sure they are the richest? Last I know, they owe IMF so much money that they need a few generations to repay.<br><br>So what if they are rich, the money is theirs, not for anyone else to dictate if they should part with it.<br><br>eg. if you have $1001 and i have $11, and someone dictate that everyone should donate till left $1 in the pocket.<br>Will you KPKB?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>well, there is NO OIL in India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and other affected places... So you know the answer - its not in their national interest to assist.  Same for kosovo war. They didn't lift a finger but were so eager to bulldoze iraq based on some false claims. So now, some big shot is coming down to asia and is saying that US will help and coordinate aids efforts (ie instruct us asian morons how to run thw show), after 1 long week of the tsunami. The current aid workers all over the world having put up and chipped in and worked their way around and solved the logistics issues. So isn't it nice when big brother comes around and takes credit for all that other people have done...    Haven't we seen that before... or is it dejavu<br><br></div>
