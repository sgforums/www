All are "hear- say".<br><br>What has happened is already a fact. Rather than to sit here and start pointing fingers saying about what other countries could have done to prevented this disater, why not think how much more can you contribute to help the ppl who lost their homes, family and loved ones?<br><br>No matter who blame who now... it's already too late. It's one precious lesson we learn on the expense on others. So be happy that you're still alive and do something to help. So wat USA is for war and not help ppl? There are also locals who is saying "heng ah... not s'pore"... I even heard ppl saying that those who died in the disater must have done really bad deeds to deserve it. So you tell me... what is what??<br><br></div></blockquote>I think people (human race) have not  woke up to the fact that how easily they can be wiped out from the face of the earth by earth itself.<br><br>End of the day, people will be born, become sick, turn old and die. It's just how and when it happens.<br><br>In terms of financial contribution, one will never compensate a loss of homes, family and loved ones. If you think contributing money will make you feel better, then its very ignorant and sad. Thats just you trying to feel less guilty.<br>Because back before the big waves where everything is fine and dandy, no one actually cared about the orphans and homeless people.<br><br>Ask yourself why is it such a tragedy that you have to 'contribute' NOW? and not before? is it because the media tugging at your conscience?<br><br>Sigh..... i find it very sad that it always have to take a large scale tragedy before humans are moved to become compassionate.

NO point arguing about wat could have been done before the disater, which country is saying what. BUT... to contribute in every way we can, within our limits.<br><br>Contributing $$ to feel less guilty??? Wat's the guilt about? NO DOUBT no amt of $$ can take away the pain of those who lost their homes and loved ones, so if we all think that by giving that bit of $$ won't help, we all don't contribute, would it make things better?<br><br>Now that the disaster has already struck, damage has been done. Everyone who are concerned, are already doing their little bit of part to make things better, why not say the media is using all these stories to hit their sales target and attract more readers to buy their junkie (not all though) magazines?<br><br>We all learn from mistakes and once in a while, we need some really "BIG" happenings to remind us that we are just tiny little creatures in this world and we are just as vurnerable. Yes, my heart goes out to those who suffered in the disaster, we learnt a lesson on the expense on many other innocents, so besides contributing whatever we can, is there anything else we can do?<br><br>We can go on arguing why USA did not send out the warnings, why the European countries ain't contributing as much... SO WHAT? It won't reverse the damage.</div>
