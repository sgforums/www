But I assure you your problems are not because they have poor service standards. For the record, Starhub's call centre is just as hard to get through sometimes, especially during weekends. This could be due to several factors:<br>a) High call volume due to new promos.<br>b) Ratio of customers to call centre staff is roughly 1000:1.<br>c) Network problems causing most people to call in.<br><br>Your problem with your password not being able to reset is the first time I heard of such thing. And your router problem may not be a router issue, suspect that your comp's specs doesn't meet the requirements for the router that they provided. The fact that your Linksys router works doesn't matter cos it wasn't meant for ADSL connection.<br><br>The billing problem may be due to the fact that they have just upgraded their billing system. They have effectively shifted the billing cycle, thus you are getting billed for 2 mths instead of the normal 1 mth. This affects all SNBB customers, so you're not the only one looking at 3-figure bills this month.<br><br>Kinda surprised that you signed up for their most expensive plan (25Mbps right?) without getting any premium. Even the 1.5Mbps plan is giving out a Sony PSP, didn't you check the other plans before you signed up? Or did you sign up for a no-frills plan, in which case you would be getting a lower subscription rate than normal?<br><br>I myself have just upgraded to the 10M plan during the Sitex promo, free LCD tv, yippee! Just goes to show how good Singnet is to provide the best value for money deals for its customers.</div>

Or any other multiplayer online game? They will always have a scheduled down-time to do maintenance, so that users like you and me can continue to use the service without problems. I believe the disconnecting with Singnet is due to similar reasons, because it normally happens after midnight when the traffic volume is lower. This is inevitable with all service providers, even Starhub.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am also a singnet BB for almost 3 yrs... so far... i can say tat unless they are doing maintenance, most of the time, their connection is ok.. but... the horrible part is their hotline... i once waited for half an hr and they still have not picked up... I called them regarding the stupid billing system... since I am so fed up waiting for them to pick up, I emailed them instead with the heading " COMPLAINT"...  and insists on them calling my hp.. finally... 2 days later... they called me back... As one of the forumite mentioned earlier.. got any probs, better solve it yurself than calling singnet... Yes.. I agree... Starhub customer service should be better... I heard from my maxonline friends...</div>

U've been calling the wrong number, that's why they ignore u or treat u like shit, i dun know. Furthermore, why u want to find "<strong>sales</strong> manager" when you have<strong> technical </strong>problems? U may had sent e-mails to the wrong department also, anoying people who are not cut to be service staff, and therefore the rude remarks, i guess. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I ussually call 1800-848-6933. Go double check which number u should call by checking the letter which they mail to you when u 1st signed up. For what i know, there is a different number to call for Jetpack users.<br><br>So far i had called the singnet tech support hotline a lot of times already, i swear they dun suck at all.<br>[/b]</blockquote>FYI,I called the Technical Helpdesk the 1st day i encounter my problem.Becos as a starhub mobile user,i cant call "1610" and i do not complain without checking properly and is to my advantage. I might be really very suay to have encounter such sh!t,but i am sure that the service provide by the Techical helpdesk is really not up to standard.I only wanted to solve my password problem and 4 different ppl that i spoke to gave me all different answer. I only can say i'm really suay and thinking of terminating the contract since so much problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I understand all of us is human being,but if it have to takes them 5 days to correct the error on the password issue,i see no reason why should i tolerate such lousy service,when free email provider like "yahoo" &amp; "Gmail" can allows to me change my pasword instantly. And not like Singnet Technical help desk asked me to wait 24 hrs before i can use my new password.Even i waited for 24 hrs,the password that i change to still not "recognise". So now,after complaining to the Sales dept,they asked to me wait for 7 more days.So all they can do is keep asking me to wait. You must understand while i'am waiting,i am still "PAYING" for their service. So,why should i be smiling to them when i'm the one that having such a bad time and still have to pay for all those nonsense? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br></div>
