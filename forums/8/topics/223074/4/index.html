            <div class='col-md body'>Reply to Threadstarter:<br><br>Starhub also got this issue. They billed me $500 cos they accused me of breaching my maxonline contract. BUT I WASn't on contract at all.<br><br>Afterwards, i called customer service 10000 times and demand them not to bill me. Finally, they apologized and said it was their "honest" mistake and told me to let the amount be deducted first. Then they'll rebate me.<br><br>I went to Dolby Ghaut and was given 6 months of free mobile subscription (i'm also a starhub mobile subscriber) with free called ID.<br><br>Of coz i made lots of noise.</div>

I might be really very suay to have encounter such sh!t,but i am sure that the service provide by the Techical helpdesk is really not up to standard.I only wanted to solve my password problem and 4 different ppl that i spoke to gave me all different answer. I only can say i'm really suay and thinking of terminating the contract since so much problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Actually I agree with u.. I myself changed my pwd and there was an error.. called both technical and sales side but they were both unable to resolve my problem giving me excuses like "you have to wait for a few hrs before trying again" or "maybe u entered the wrong pwd" or "Did u put it on caps?".. seriously if that were the case wouldn't it have been solved during the first call..? But instead crappy excuses were given and they pretended to ignore me and kept insisting on resetting it to my default pwd whereas for the tech side, they insisted that I waited for 2 hrs and if I was still unable to login to call 1610 again to reset it to the default as they were UNABLE to do so.. wtf? It ain't easy to get through their line either.</div>
