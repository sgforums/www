Oh yah sorry i am sorry i forgot that u are too dumb to know the right way back.... As for water, yes we are creating water so that we can be self sufficient... It is your government who are farsighted to create this new water so that in the case of a drought (even though it might not happen) we will have safe water to drink and won't die of thirst... We can recycle our water and this is also helping the eco system in case your puny little brain can't comprehend that.... If u are interested to know how we are helping the eco system why dun go read a book? Itz not worth my time explaining something so profound to a dumb bee with no directional sense.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some people really talk childish. When Msia knows Singapore can "recreate" its own water, then taunt S'pore by saying things like "why wait? end now lah!". Just like kids saying "what's the big deal? you buay song you don't play lah!"<br><br>When people are talking about S'poreans not being gracious, I'm glad to see that there are worse examples out there. Didn't you realise the many times when our dear neighbours shoot and taunt us, our side always keep quiet? Well, you can say is we bo ji reply, but I think in "international" terms, it is graciousness which teaches one never to retort childish remarks.<br><br>I think the reason why they gave these remarks was because they thought they can kah Spore $ by charging us 100times the original amount we are paying now, and thinking that we have no choice but to accept coz we don't have our own water supply. But now that they realise this doesn't work, they got sorta pissed off coz they stand to lose a huge revenue stream, hence the childish remarks.<br><br>Why talk about China selling water to HK at lower price? HK is part of China, Spore is not part of Msia, how to compare??? Say what we sell back to them at higher price. Please, you think we treat water no need money? You sell us raw water, we sell back treated water, and you expect us to sell at cost price when the treatment plants cost so much? Don't they understand the logic? You mean they expect that when they sell people raw timber for $x, people should sell them back the wooden furniture at the same price of $x? Even a kid can tell you it's ridiculous.<br><br>Anyway, laugh at us for drinking our own pee. As long as we don't have to pay astronomic prices to our dear neighbours, say as much as you want.</div>

The Americans invented it and have been using it for years. But has he warned Malaysians about being careful about drinking reclaimed water when they visit the United States?<br><br>Rather than take every opportunity to run his neighbour down, he may do well to consider Newater for Malaysian neighbour states such as water-starved Malacca, which could do with Johor's help.<br><br><strong>In fact, the joke may well be on him and other Malaysians who mock Newater, for there may come a day when their wells run dry and they may have to resort to using reclaimed water.<br><br>If that day comes, I am confident that our leaders will do the responsible thing and try our best to help our neighbours sensibly, instead of making rude jokes.</strong><br><br>R.

            <div class='col-md body'>AUG 12, 2002 MON<br>TRADE and Industry Minister George Yeo yesterday brushed aside comment by a Malaysian minister that Singaporeans would be drinking water recycled from bathrooms, saying that this is common response to the problem of over-population and urbanisation.<br><br>Referring to Singapore's super-clean Newater, Brigadier-General (NS) Yeo said: 'There is a water shortage worldwide because of population growth and urbanisation. And this technology will not be used only in Singapore and a few other places, but...in many places.<br><br>He was replying to questions from reporters who asked him to comment on what Johor Mentri Besar Abdul Ghani Othman had said during an interview on a Malaysian talk show last Friday.<br><br>On the talk show, he had said: 'We from Malaysia should know that when we go to Singapore one day and drink coffee, the water comes from behind their kitchens or washrooms.'<br><br>BG Yeo pointed out that far from being a new phenomenon, water is recycled constantly and naturally by the earth's ecosystem. Water recycling is also used by astronauts when enduring long stays in space.<br><br>Speaking after a 2-km walk during an active-lifestyle day organised by Kembangan-Punggol grassroots organisations, he added: 'Over this National Day period, we've all got drunk on Newater. I think the response has been wonderful.<br><br>'There's a sense that this technological breakthrough enables us to be self-sufficient, if we have to be - not that we want to be, but if we have to.'<br><br>He felt that Newater 'would relax' the relationship between Singapore and Malaysia.<br><br>'As long as the Malaysians think that we can't do without their water, they'll always feel that we're being undercharged,' he said. 'So once we have this supply of Newater, the relationship can be based more on the costs that are involved.<br><br>'We're just doing something that we have to do in our own national interest. It's our responsibility to ourselves and to future generations,' he said.<br><br>Separately, BG Yeo greeted Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong's upbeat comments on the economy during his National Day message with full support.<br><br>But with many external forces still likely to have an impact on Singapore's economic performance, he singled out Singapore's government and the relationship with its people as a focal point that should remain stable in uncertain times.<br><br>Quoting a Chinese saying, he said: 'To manage 10,000 changes, there must be a point which doesn't change.'<br><br></div>

It can stop even now, no need to wait until 2011,' he said when asked to comment on reports that the Republic indicated it would let one of the agreements lapse.<br><br>Advertisement<br><br>Malaysia did not want to sell water to Singapore, he said, adding that it was a losing proposition for his country.<br><br>Domestic Trade and Consumer Affairs Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, speaking to Malaysian reporters on Monday, said Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong told him the Republic planned to allow the agreement ending in 2011 to lapse, as it would have the means to produce sufficient water by then.<br><br>The minister, who was on a two-day working visit to Singapore, said the Republic had decided to reduce dependency on imported water to about 20 per cent of its total consumption over a 20- to 30-year period.<br><br>'They have said they will not ask for a renewal or extension because they are looking at new and alternative sources of water such as Newater and desalinated water,' Tan Sri Muhyiddin said.<br><br>He quoted Mr Goh as saying that Singapore would be prepared to continue buying water in the long term to maintain good relations with its neighbour but the price must be right.<br><br>What constitutes the right price has been debated hotly on both sides of the Causeway.<br><br>Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar told Parliament last month that the price of any treated water bought from Malaysia after the current agreements expire must be pegged to a percentage of the Newater's cost.<br><br>Under two agreements signed in the early 1960s, Singapore pays Malaysia three sen (1.4 Singapore cents) per 1,000 gallons of raw water.<br><br>Malaysia has proposed raising the price to 60 sen per thousand gallons between 2002 and 2007. From 2007 to 2011, Malaysia is asking for RM3 per thousand gallons.<br><br>Singapore has offered to pay 45 sen per 1,000 gallons when the first agreement expires in 2011 and 60 sen after the second one runs out in 2061, with adjustments every five years.<br><br>Dr Mahathir said yesterday that it did not make sense 'that the price has remained unchanged for 75 years'.<br><br>'We do not want to sell water to them. We are losing money selling to them. We do not depend on them as sources of income to finance the government. Even if we raise the price, by comparison to our national income, it is a very minute fraction,' he said.<br><br>He added that his government preferred to sell its water to other states in the country, saying that Malacca, for instance, was prepared to pay between 30 sen and 40 sen per 1,000 gallons.<br><br>In July, officials from both sides met to discuss a new water agreement and other unresolved issues. The talks ended in a stalemate and both sides are to meet again in Singapore next month.<br><br>Singapore has said it wants to reduce dependency on water from Malaysia. It plans to do so by increasing its catchment areas, desalination and through Newater, which is produced by passing water flowing from the kitchen and bathroom through a series of membranes with microscopic pores.<br></div>
