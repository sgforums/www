              <p>The researchers have also examined the students' cultural expressions, whether it is in art, drama, dance or literature and found them to be socially engaged, and grappling with the question of who they were as a people. The cultural explorations of that period have been forgotten or repudiated.  It is revealing just how this amnesia and silence has become so set.<br><br>It is also impossible to imagine the demands that the age had put on this generation of youths.</p>

              <p>It you really want to remove English, then other races in Singapore 
                      like Malays and Indian would also said that Malay and Tamil should be 
                      their nation language.Let see if you got 9 lives if you try to implement
                       your dialect to them and see what happen.The only worst case scenario 
                      are they riot and loot your house for discriminate just like the recent 
                      UK riot due to people use their "ball" to do thing .(If the malay and 
                      indian from SAF also joined them as a result of your dialect implement, 
                      good luck to you as well) That why I say Naruto must be ban because 
                      there are too many retard people in this country and garbage like this 
                      only deteriorate and make Singaporean a shit.</p>
              <p>And you want to talk
                       about Singapore history ??? Do you know that Singapore in past was rule
                       by an Malay chief from Patani who was appointed by Siam (modern day 
                      Thailand) until he was killed by Parameswara who rule Singapore for a 
                      short perod of time before escape again from Siam force and later he 
                      become the founder of Malacca, later the Sultanate of Johor took over 
                      and rule Singapore until Raffles arrived and the British take charge. In
                       short according to history fact, Singapore should be either 
                      Indonesia,Thailand or Malaysia terrority, chinese are not even BORN here
                       until the British came. Please do your homework before present your 
                      nonsense view here.</p>
              <p>Finally the only complain of the government 
                      are that meritocracy are slowing "disappearing", e.g mediocre like Tin 
                      Pei Ling are appointed in the government, Minister pass remark that they
                       must higher-salaries so that they didn't "lose face" when meeting with 
                      business leader etc etc.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span><span style="color: #333333;"> -</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Much has been talked about the riots in Singapore’s history. In schools, we learned that these riots were race based. In particular, the Malay race was portrayed as the antagonist. I have always felt that the there was a tinge of racism, perhaps even “Malay-phobia” that is embedded as subtle message in those “historical facts” taught in schools.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">As time went by, I realised that there were as many “Chinese instigated” riots, if not more, as “Malay instigated” ones. So it really isn’t an understatement that citizens have gone through brainwashing.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Why must we always perpetually be reminded of the “race riots” (read as “instigated by the Malays around us” - according to LKY and his PAPpy followers), so that we will always fear our Malay neighbours surrounding us?</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Or is this just a figment of imagination in LKY's racist mind, so he could keep playing the race card on us till today?</span></span></strong></span><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>List of Riots in Singapore</strong></span><span style="color: #333333;"> -</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Let's take a look at the riots that occurred in Singapore. Here they are, in chronological order.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">1. 1950 - Maria Hertogh Riots</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">2. 1954 - National Service Riots</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">3. 1955 - Hock Lee Bus Riots</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">4. 1956 - Chinese Middle School Riots</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">5. 1964 - 1964 Race Riots</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">6. 1969 - 1969 Race Riots</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">I am not putting up links because there are different versions of what happened, how they happened and why they happened. As such, I do not wish to show favour for one particular version over another. I would instead put up the central dispute of the issue and the parties involved in the rioting.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. Maria Hertogh Riots</span><span style="color: #333333;"> -</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Dispute</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - The court in Singapore ruled that Maria Hertogh be returned to her Catholic biological parents, after she was raised a Muslim girl.</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Parties who rioted</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Muslims (mainly Malays and some Indians) against the government and the Catholic/Christian/European community.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. 1954 - National Service Riots</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Dispute</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Brit govt makes it compulsory to serve NS for those aged 18 to 20. Young Singaporeans were not willing to serve a foreign govt.</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Parties who rioted</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Chinese school students against the British govt.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. 1955 - Hock Lee Bus Riots</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Dispute</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - This was a labour riot. Workers rioted against poor working conditions set by bus companies. It is also recorded by many that the Hock Lee Bus riot was politically motivated against the pro-Brit government.</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Parties who rioted</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Bus workers, joined by Chinese school students against bus companies.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">4. 1956 - Chinese Middle School Riots</span><span style="color: #333333;"> -</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">This is actually not just one riot, but a series of riots.</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Dispute</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Lim Yew Hock, Chief Minister, de-registered and banned two pro-communist organisations.</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Parties who rioted</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - Chinese students against the pro-Brit govt of Singapore. The students gathered and assembled at Chung Cheng High School and Chinese High School.</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">5. 1964 - 1964 Race Riots</span><br><strong style="color: #333333;">Dispute</strong><span style="color: #333333;"> - A breakaway group from the main (Muslim) procession was told by the police to rejoin the main party.

The Northerners have their own version. They claim it was instigated internally to pressure Tunku to repeal the Bumi Policy.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">In a documentary aired by Discovery Channel a few years ago, we have another view to this incident. Singapore was then part of Malaysia. Malaysia was seen as a threat to Indonesia and Philippines due to their "expansionist plan" when they merged Sabah, Sawarak and Singapore into their Federation.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Because of the merger, Indonesia and Malaysia were at loggerheads. Singapore, being part of Malaysia, was also targetted by Indonesia.</span><br><br><strong style="color: #333333;">This was the Confrontation Period. The dispute was between one Malay country (Indonesia) against another Malay country (Malaysia).<br><br>However, due to the racist mindset of LKY, he rewrote history and this period of tension of what should be seen as a dispute between two Malay countries, evolved to something that was not even an issue to start with - ie "a sea of Malays around us, against us".</strong><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">As such, it even seems doubtful that the 1964 race riots was strictly a race riot where we had Malays and Chinese fighting each other. It could have been:</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">1. An internally instigated riot (by a govt agent), to pressure Tunku to repeal the Bumi Policy.</span><br><span style="color: #333333;">2. A riot instigated by agents from the South, to teach the North a lesson, for what it claims the North had an "expansionist plan".</span><br><br><strong style="color: #333333;">That about leaves only one riot in Singapore that is truly based on race - The 1969 Race Riots. And that too, the only confirmed race-based riot did not originate from Singapore!</strong><br><br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span><span style="color: #333333;"> -</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">LKY has long been a racist and has always played the race card. He knows of no other way.<br></span></span></strong><br><span style="color: #333333;">It is sad that he keeps harping that "the Malays in the north and south are out to get us", when what we should really look at is the peace and harmony we have worked for ourselves.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The consistent play of race, in particular the "race riots" which tends to have the implication on Malays, have always been part of the school history's syllabus.</span></span></strong><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">But as you can see for yourselves, there are more "Chinese" riots than "Malay" ones. It looks like the Malays are taking all the flak, when the Chinese are the more "guilty" ones.</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">Putting it crudely and candidly, when LKY farts, you Malays have to smell it. Sorry for that crude joke, but that is really what this Race Riot Issue conjured by Old Man is all about, isn't it? It stinks, doesn't it?</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">In view of his latest statement on the Malays/Muslims that they have to be "less strict" in their religion, I feel that LKY is only trying to revive the "good old days", where he was PM and used the race card to rule.</span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singaporeans should stop believing his lies before he dies.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew's tactic is to set one group after another; play off chinese against malays, so that he can take advantage of both.</p>
              <p>Destroy chinese schools while at the same time replacing malay as common language while at the same time maneuvering his own mother tongue english to become dominant.</p>
              <p>Play chinese chauvinist card to mobilise the malays to deal with the dialect chinese; if the malays make trouble, play malay racial riots card to mobilise the dialect chinese to deal with the malays.</p>
              <p>In the end, both malay and chinese influence weakened, while his peranakan faction gains.</p>
              <p>Don't be naive enough to fall for Harry Lee Kuan Yew's oldest trick in the book.</p>

              <p>Lol Mandarin is the most spoken language in the world. Yet, it is not dominant and is FAR from being dominant as it is one of the least <strong>widely</strong> spoken lanuguages. Just because a majority speaks that shit does not mean it is useful dude. </p>

              <p>You all people have missed his point.</p>
              <p>Neither does Dalforce want Mandarin as the only dominant language. He just wants English out of the scene. He wants the native languages preserved by the original speakers and let Bazaar Malay to continue develop itself until today as the lingua franca, if not for the hiatus caused by the imposition of English as the common language by the PAP government.</p>
              <p>Since when does he mandate that Mandarin should be enforced the population like what PAP enforce English on the population?</p>
              <p>Rub the eyes of you all clearly please.</p>
              <p>In short, what Dalforce vision is to let language evolution by itself.  Let not government policies be imposed on the natural path.</p>
