              <p>Is Mariani raging mad or is this another spin piece by our dearly beloved CNA?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh ok CAAS's Changi is way better than that hellhole that is Charles de Gaulle Aéroport, that I agree.<br><br>But you compare Singapore's MRT system with Paris or even Lyon's Réseau Express Régional (RER)'s Metro systems... That's just retarded. Paris' RER, Transilien, and Métro is WAY better than the MRT. Or LRT. Efficient? Has he seen Hong Kong, Tokyo, or Seoul yet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Transport on rail? HELLO France is home to the Train a Grande Vitesse (TGV), and he's here to talk about suburban rail? Wth man. Talk about buses, even Paris' bus lines by the Régie Autonome des Transports Parisiens is so SO much better than SG's SMRT buses and SBST buses. Hello Paris is like how many times the size of SG but survives on one government regulated company.<br><br><br>So much for deregulation. </p>

              <p>But tbh the best suburban lines are from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland with their S-Bahns. Though France's (and Suisse Romande's) RER is not far in 2nd place...</p>

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: French Secretary of State for Transport
              Thierry Mariani says he is impressed by Singapore's efficient
              transportation system.<br> <br> He said this during a two-day official visit here which started on
              Saturday.<br> <br> "It is indeed one of the most modern systems in the region and
              reflects Singapore's clear and forward-looking transport policies.
              I look forward to the continued valuable co-operation, exchange of
              views and ideas between France and Singapore in the area of
              transportation," he said.<br> <br> Singapore's Ministry of Transport said Mr Mariani's visit was a
              good opportunity for both countries to exchange views on transport
              issues and to explore further areas of co-operation.<br> <br> During his visit, Mr Mariani called on Minister in the Prime
              Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and Transport,
              Mrs Lim Hwee Hua.<br> <br> They exchanged views on transport developments and on enhancing
              bilateral transport cooperation such as in expanding aviation
              links.<br> <br> Mr Mariani visited the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore, the
              Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore and toured the Singapore
              Changi Airport and PSA Pasir Panjang Container Terminal.<br> <br> He also visited the Kim Chuan Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Depot where
              he was briefed on Singapore's MRT system.<br> <br> - CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>I am impressed by the preparations made by the Government. Obviously, they avoid Monday 8-8.30am trip from one of our most amazing transit on the north-south line change to east-west line (e.g. from Woodlands to Jurong East, cross platform switch to east-west line to Buona Vista).</p>
              <p>It wouldn't be nice to lose sight of Mr Thierry Mariani during the spartans clash.</p>
              <p>I applause the homework made.</p>

              <p>Bus system is pretty subjective to how the roads and towns are planned. Just like how come it's possible for many semi express buses to be seen in HK.</p>
              <p>MRT is pretty fixed in terms of comfort, freq and so on.</p>
