              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FTs are rude!</span></p>
              <p>Hello, please wake up! Some Singaporeans 
              have physically and mentally abused them. If they are rude, some 
              Singaporeans deserved to be classifed as 'criminals'. Just within 
              Sgforums, there are countless of illogical, unfounded prejudice and 
              discrimination against foreigners. The prerequisite for courteous 
              behaviour reciprocal respect. Have some Singaporean manifest any?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FTs are different from Singaporeans!</span></p>
              <p>Obviously, 
              foreigners are and should be different from the general native 
              Singaporeans; they came from a diversified and heterogeneous background.
               You cannot approve a difference in culture? Are you conceding that some
               Singaporeans are narrow-minded?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FTs should worship Singaporeans, we provide them jobs!</span></p>
              <p>They
               are to work and study, not sold as slaves. We don't deserve to be 
              worshipped. Please treat them like fellow human beings. You are not 
              aristocrat; stop deluding. Singaporeans have the choice to work or study
               overseas too.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I agree there are too many FTs</span></p>
              <p>But that is not a justification to disrespect anyone. Stop <span>contaminating the reputation of Singapore. These FTs have the capability to disseminate adverse stories to their homeland.</span></p>
              <p>Lastly, based on my own observation, FTs more prone to be 'bullied' by uncultured, less educated and uncivilised people. Do you want to be identified as one of them?</p>

              rude!</span></p>
              <p>Hello, please wake up! Some Singaporeans have physically and
              mentally abused them. If they are rude, some Singaporeans deserved
              to be classifed as 'criminals'. Just within Sgforums, there are
              countless of illogical, unfounded prejudice and discrimination
              against foreigners. The prerequisite for courteous behaviour
              reciprocal respect. Have some Singaporean manifest any?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FTs are different from
              Singaporeans!</span></p>
              <p>Obviously, foreigners are and should be different from the
              general native Singaporeans; they came from a diversified and
              heterogeneous background. You cannot approve a difference in
              culture? Are you conceding that some Singaporeans are
              narrow-minded?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">FTs should worship
              Singaporeans, we provide them jobs!</span></p>
              <p>They are to work and study, not sold as slaves. We don't deserve
              to be worshipped. Please treat them like fellow human beings. You
              are not aristocrat; stop deluding. Singaporeans have the choice to
              work or study overseas too.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I agree there are too
              many FTs</span></p>
              <p>But that is not a justification to disrespect anyone. Stop
              <span>contaminating the reputation of Singapore. These FTs have the
              capability to disseminate adverse stories to their
              homeland.</span></p>
              <p>Lastly, based on my own observation, FTs more prone to be
              'bullied' by uncultured, less educated and uncivilised people. Do
              you want to be identified as one of them?</p>

              <p>Look at how Australians or Canadians treat Chinese immigrants.</p>
