ISPs say no <br>They object to Govt's proposal, arguing many factors affect Net speeds <br>By Jessica Lim <br><br>THE three major Internet service providers (ISPs) here have objected to the Government's proposal to get them to disclose average surfing speeds to market their broadband. <br><br>StarHub, SingTel and M1 currently market their plans based on their rarely achievable maximum speeds. <br><br>In response to the Government's proposal, all three argue that multiple factors affect Internet speeds, making it impossible for them to define an average speed. Any attempts to do so would be inaccurate and misleading, they say. <br><br>The proposal came in a consultation paper published last month, which invited public feedback. <br><br>In it, the Infocomm Development Authority (IDA) said ISPs here have historically sold their fixed and mobile broadband plans by advertising their top speeds, which are not usually achievable under normal Internet conditions. <br><br>By 5pm yesterday, the deadline for submissions, the technology sector regulator had attracted 18 views. <br><br>The bulk of respondents were ISPs including the three major players, but there was also a smattering of Internet companies such as Google, ESPN Star Sports, and Skype, as well as two individuals. <br><br>In a 20-page statement, SingTel pointed out that average Internet speeds experienced by users vary depending on how many are using the network at any given time. Speeds are also dependent on radio signal quality which can be affected by external interference, it said. <br><br>M1 aired similar views. In its response, it said it strongly objects to the proposal for ISPs to state average Internet access speeds as 'there is basically no sound, objective and equitable basis to do so considering the many variables involved'. <br><br>It said computer processing speed and power supply would also affect Internet connection, as would the type of operating system used. Instead, it urged the IDA to improve public education on broadband Internet services. <br><br>In its response, StarHub said 'requiring operators to disclose expected average Internet access speeds would serve to create even more confusion and disputes with end-users'. <br><br>However, players such as Skype applauded the IDA's move to 'improve transparency', provided the information disclosed would help users make an informed choice. <br><br>They also agreed with the other point the IDA raised in its consultation paper - that ISPs should not unilaterally block legitimate online content or services. Rules against this are already in place. <br><br>For example, an ISP cannot limit the bandwidth for Skype telephone calls to avoid losing out on fixed-line revenues. <br><br>The telcos say they agree with the IDA's current policy on this matter. <br><br>Mr Foong King Yew, research director with technology research firm Gartner, agreed that there are many factors affecting Internet speeds. However, he said ISPs can do more. <br><br>'The companies should still be able to come up with a better gauge of Internet speeds. Providing the maximum speed is vague and it does not give any indication of what paying customers can expect.' <br><br>He added that it was predictable that ISPs would be against the proposals because they make it 'easier for consumers to make comparisons'. <br><br>The IDA said the responses have generally been positive. It added that it will review the feedback and decide whether its current position is appropriate, and if regulations need to be enhanced or relaxed. <br><br>Individuals who submitted feedback, including a Mr Khong Heng Poh, support the average surfing speeds proposal. 'If ISPs are indeed providing the actual speeds as advertised, why not disclose them?' he asked. 'What's there to hide?' <br><br></span><a href="mailto:limjess@sph.com.sg"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #006699;">limjess@sph.com.sg</span></span></a></span></p></div>

              <p>This is hilarious.</p>
              <p>While there may be difficulty defining an average speed, that definition should come from IDA so why would they (the telcos) find it difficult to define the average speed?</p>
              <p>The current system of never reached or even reached maximum speeds ARE inaccurate and misleading already. If anything, this proposal seems to give a more accurate view.</p>

              <p>the problem now is not just the speed but how much they have been charging for that particular speed they advertised.  its obvious they cant deliver anywhere closed enough. </p>
              <p>why are they charging us so high?  in 2 yrs we will have optics cables.  they'll charge us even higher.</p>

              <p>perhaps they feel average speeds is like a benchmark, ppl can use it to argue if they got 'cheated' by the isp, or if they took shortchanged the isp by getting a faster avg speed than what was posted.  the max speed way creates a huge guess zone isps can use to thier advantage</p>

              There can be fixed standards and criterias to perform the test, for example, a lab in Singapore with the same computer to ping test for a million times on each connection/plan at different time/days. It may not be accurate but come on lah, the current max speed is 100% NOT ACCURATE already. They complain inaccurate but right now I used their plans, never for 1 second have I manage to hit even 25% of their maximum speed (dun even talk about half or near their max speed) and my computer is at the very high end type, so their current advertisement speed is 100% NOT ACCURATE. At least with the other alternative, it's definitely MORE ACCURATE than the current marketed speed.
              
              Their marketing tactics power lah, can bluff consumers. Alot of people non-IT savvy see word for word, oh max speed is 10mbps so can at least get 8mbps lah, my foot ah, hit 1mbps happy like fuck ler.
