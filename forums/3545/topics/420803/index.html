              <div class="kicker"><br></div>
              <div class="kicker">CALLS for even more pro-baby handouts to persuade couples to have 
              children, by arguing that other First World countries with a similar 
              problem offer them, should be taken with a huge pinch of salt 
              ('Fertility figures hit all-time low'; Tuesday).
              <p>Singapore should not slide into welfarism and the state should not take over parental responsibilities.</p>
              <p>Ramping up pro-baby handouts to reverse a falling birth rate may result in throwing good money after bad.</p>
              <p>Falling birth rates are a global trend and not exclusive to Singapore.</p>
              <p>Despite resentment from some quarters, we should continue to
               open our doors to immigrants, selecting those who are not here to milk 
              the system but ones who are self-reliant and ready and willing to 
              contribute to Singapore's growth.</p>
              <p>The present incentives for parents are sufficient, have cost
               taxpayers billions of dollars and should not be seen as an unending 
              stream. There are much better ways to spend public revenue.</p>

              <p>The word "talent" is a misnomer, an anomaly, n it was couched by the incumbents to hoodwink the population and most importantly those foreigners who come here.</p>
              <p>Labelling them as talent is a pyschological placebo that the incumbents (knew) and know that it will work. Hence, the labelling! It is being exploited (cos of ignorance and weaknesses within one) and one must be intelligent to see thru the bluff.</p>
              <p>Excepting a few with specialized skills most of them are here for low wages and woefully undignifying working conditions.<br>It ("foregin talent" policy) epitomizes the incumbents stance and that is of avarice and venality!</p>
              <p>It is shameful and disdainful that the incumbents brag about being a first world nation but the reality is the surreptitious stance of straw-clutching policies (lax immigration and requirements for PR/citizenship).It was and is all for political expediency and lest one forgets – GDP $$$!</p>
              <p>Off late, no one from the incumbents uses the word ‘talent". Is this not telling of what these self-serving type(s) are?<br>Singaporeans are paying a very high price (economics,social etc etc) for bleating away like sheep and on the altar of the real ( as opposed to hypnotic apathy and blind allegiance which sadly is so ingrained in the Singaporean psyche) it will all sooner or later collapse like a house made of cards.</p>
              <p>PS – 82 Mps n … are not talents but simply yes-man/woman who simply parrot/regurgitate … Yes, I may be construed as a cynic. However it does not detract from what is true. Two jarring egs would suffice – why not even one from the ruling party favoured the minimum wage n not one of them ever spoke or queried about the actual costs of a HDB unit? It is stupidity to assume or equate academic acheivements with that of intelligence or talent One does not have to be a scientist to analyze/ derive at an answer/conclusion.</p>
              <p>The incumbents know and the fear that the "good" times for themselves (inclusive of harvests in terms of $$$) would all grind to a halt with the inexorable political awakening (slow though it is) and now they are desperate to cling to power at any cost(s) and still benefit in the short-run.</p>
              <p>Lest it be forgotten – they got away and the likelihood of them getting away is still possible as long as the system (inclusive of voters attitudes) is such that perpetuates/favours a one-party rule. The political landscape needs transformation and not simply window-dressed changes (NMPS is the most stupid and useless and it is mere political device that favours the incumbents.)</p>
              <p>What is urgently needed is for a multi-party or two-party system and it is not a question of whehter one candidate can perform or whether is perceived as capable. Perception is real only in one’s head. The icing on the cake is not the cake. The real cake is the tasting (aka delivery).</p>
              <p>Can one assume/consider that the incumbents delivery has been equitable, transparent, accountable, responsible. Intuitively, it does not feel so. Also, the one-party rule is inherently flawed in so many ways. We do not have an Ombudsmen, independent bodies/institutions,/independent media n ….add on.</p>
              <p>These self-serving incumbents are pawning Singaporeans future away fro short term gains with policies/??? that simply cannot be sustained for long and even if they are, it is to the detriment of each native Singaporean. It simply does not augur well for the future.</p>
              <p>Hope Singaporeans can see what is as it is and not be lulled into seeing, interpreting .. with clouded lens of the past or allow bigotry/prejudices to distort understanding!</p>
