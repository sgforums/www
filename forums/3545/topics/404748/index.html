              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The man behind the branding that boosted Singapore's 
              tourist draw through the "Uniquely Singapore" and the latest 
              "YourSingapore" campaigns died suddenly on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> Mr Ken Low, 45, assistant chief executive of the Singapore Tourism Board
               (STB), was a bachelor. His body was cremated on Thursday. 
              <br> <br> "The entire Singapore Tourism Board is shocked and deeply saddened by 
              the news of Ken's sudden passing," said STB's chief executive, Ms Aw Kah
               Peng. 
              <br> <br> Mr Low was a man who wore many hats, including overseeing the Singapore 
              Pavilions at the Aichi World Expo in 2005 and the Shanghai World Expo 
              this year.
              <br> <br> He also served as a Board member of the National Heritage Board and the 
              Singapore Film Commission. 
              <br> <br> The multi-million-dollar revamped tagline "YourSingapore" which was 
              introduced in March drew flak from the public, which had perhaps, grown 
              accustomed to the long-established "Uniquely Singapore" image. 
              <br> <br> But Mr Low stood by the revamp and remained unfazed by the criticisms.
              <br> <br> Mr Low is believed to have succumbed to complications related to a 
              lung-related illness. 
              <br> <br> Besides fronting the tourism campaign for Singapore, Mr Low's creative 
              drive included composing several songs for the popular musical Chang and
               Eng.
              <br> <br> He is also reported to have played an active role in local drama group 
              Action Theatre. 
              <br> <br> Mr Low joined STB in 2003 as director of Brand Management and assumed 
              his current position in 2006.
              <br> <br> Ms Aw said that at work, Mr Low "inspired us with his creativity and 
              galvanised everyone in the most challenging of projects. He will be 
              deeply missed by all his colleagues and friends at the Board."

              <p><br>That's what happen when people focus too much in their pursue of ambition, power, wealth, status.</p>
              <p>When they die eventually, they expect people that they have neglected and hardly know them to respect and honour them in the wake of their death.</p>
              <p>I do not know him personally and I do not act like a hypocrite and pretend to cry crocodile tears for someone I don't even know or even know me.</p>
              <p>So I do not encourage such anonymous compassion, but I would encourage the people who knew him to mourn for him during the wake of his death.</p>
              <p>People who knew him are probably too busy pursuing their own selfish agenda of power, wealth, ambition and status. And they imagined that "Aiyah, there will be many other people to mourn him on my behalf, I will just mourn him deep inside my heart."</p>
              <p>But I do not mind if people want to do that, I hope they all go Heaven. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

One day, when someone said something about your family member or close friends, then you will know how it feels to be hurt in this way.</p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Secondly, for those of you who said you never heard of him, I think you are the shallow bunch of people who know nothing but your own little world. Ken was the brainchild of "Uniquely Singapore", he was in the newspaper and on TV, launching the campaign for STB. Is that not enough!  Your ignorance does not equate to somebody's accomplishment for Singapore.  Ken was not somebody who loved to boast about his success, but he enjoyed seeing the fruit of his success on the tourism front of Singapore. Therefore he deserves more credits than most people think.</p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Thirdly, Ken contributed so much of his energy in launching “Your Singapore”, it may not be everybody’s cup of tea, but it receives huge recognition globally, outside Singapore. Just because some of you did not like it, it does not mean it is bad, thank God STB do not employ you!</p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">Ken is a talented and passionate professional in the tourism, marketing and arts scene.  He is well respected by his business associates, his colleagues, his bosses, his friends and fan.  </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">It is time reflect how your negative remarks would impact, hurt and upset people who were close to, adore and knew Ken well. It is time to grow up for the immature and ignorant bunch of idiots!</p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">I believe in retribution, you will get yours one day sooner than you think, and you can start laughing at yourself.</p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"> </p>
              <p style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">May your rest in peace, Ken!</p>

              <p>I know STB puts in a lot of effort putting SG on the world map, and I give them the due credit for that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ken did a DAMNED GOOD JOB with the Uniquely Singapore tagline two to three yrs ago, and that, given time, could have done Singapore a great service. Many people ask, what is unique about Singapore? HK is culturally like SG, East meet West. Zoo? Other countries have it. What is unique about SG? It is the people, and you can't find us in OUR culture, out of SG. Export you may, but it will never be the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thus I do not understand why in just a few short years, with the campaign nearing its maturation, why STB switched the campaign. A lot of work and $$$ have been put in flames due to that. All those pamphlets, files, and items with the "Uniquely Singapore" tagline would have to be replaced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In fact, I just hosted a seminar regarding MICE(talking about that industry in SG and how STB affects that industry) and the two speakers told me that given a few more years STB would have a solid branding for itself. That is the problem, continously changing the branding would not give a lasting impact on the target audience.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since now they want to stick to their "Your Singapore" tagline, I hope STB stays with it for the next 10 or so years. Better than losing your branding and positioning statement just like that. I guess the change about that "Uniquely Singapore" branding was due to the fact that any city can be termed "Unique", albeit in different meanings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ken has undoubtably put in great effort, and I give him the credit for doing so. RIP Ken.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>

              <p>By 
              																				Cara  Van Miriah</p>
              <p>MORE than 200 friends, family and colleagues bade farewell to the late
               Ken Low on Wednesday night at Action Theatre in Waterloo Street where 
              the memorial was held.</p>
              <p>A few people shed tears, but it was a joyous occasion that 
              celebrated his life and works.</p>
              <p>Low was the composer of the hit musical Chang &amp; Eng, 
              which tells the story of the famous Siamese twins in the 19th century. 
              It was first performed in 1997.</p>
              <p>The 49-year-old died last Wednesday of complications from 
              pneumonia. He was cremated the next day upon his family's instructions.</p>
              <p>The bachelor, who was Singapore Tourism Board's (STB) 
              assistant chief executive (marketing), was responsible for much of the 
              international marketing of Singapore as a world-class destination. He 
              was also well-known in the arts and creative circles for his support of 
              local arts and theatre.</p>
              <p>The two-hour tribute, which was held at the 100-plus-seat 
              theatre on the second floor, was screened at Action Theatre's garden 
              bistro on the ground floor.</p>

              <p><br>You can try and stop me from posting my honest comments in this public forum by asking me politely. But you can never take away my freedom to share my honest opinion!</p>
              <p>If the intention of creating this topic is to gather crocodile sympathy and tears for this guy with the same first name as the guy in the street fighter game, then I believed you have already achieved your objective but I can tell you the truth is that WE DON'T REALLY FEEL FOR HIM. How many of the people here will actually go and attend his funeral?? You're just too dumb and naive and equally blinded by your false values into thinking that just because this person is "famous", he should be honoured and worship upon his death. Please wake up, this is reality ... if you go and hire a bunch of bangalahs to honour him, at least those bangalahs will truly feel for him when they think about the amount of payout they will be getting after shedding tears for him. So go and do that ok?</p>
              <p>It's so retarded of you to say people are shallow because we have never heard of him, the fact is that there are more people in this world who have never heard of him, so most people in the world are clueless and you're not? I can live with that, but you are still one big fat idiot who will die alone thinking that you would be honoured upon your death, be it accidental or intentional. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Stop talking about he have done this and that for Singapore, I would like to bring out one important point and highlight to your face. WAS HE WELL-REASONABLY PAID FOR DOING HIS JOB? If no, I can agree with you. If yes, then please shut the fuck up because he did get REWARDED for doing his job. IF he were noble, he would've done all those things for FREE~! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Nobody cares if he's respected by his friends of work colleagues, that clear fact is that HE WASN'T LOVED BY THEM! Prove me wrong by sharing with me his love deeds from his friends/colleagues/himself. Don't share his sexual exploits because we do not want to sniff other people's dirty laundry.</p>
              <p>I can understand that you felt that you weren't as talented as him, but I can tell you that everybody is talented in one way or another and we all just need to find out own talents. Just yourself, you're extremely talented in becoming a follower and arse-licker of the talented. One look at your post can already tell the extreme amount of potential you had hidden under your cowardice clone nick. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I hope you did not get banned after making this one post, if you have, then I can tell you that's probably the karma that you deserves to have since your....first post. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
