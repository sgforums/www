              <div id="articlePage0" class="bodyText" style="width: 100%; display: inline; visibility: visible; font-size: 0.75em;">SINGAPORE - For eight years he waited anxiously for news of the whereabouts of his dementia-stricken father.<br><br>When the police called on Dec 1 last year, Michael (not his real name), 52, got the news that he had been bracing for: His father, 70, had died from a chest infection in hospital.<br><br>But he was anguished to learn that he could have been reunited with his father only months after he had lodged a police report in 2002 - if not for lapses by Government agencies. <br><br>Said Michael, who works in the construction industry: "I want to know what went wrong these eight years. They should have been able to establish his identity easily when they found him, so why did it take them so long to contact us?" <br><br>In response to MediaCorp's queries, police spokesperson Lau Kian Keong said the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS) had picked up Michael's father in May 2002 and found him disoriented. <br><br>Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Lau said: "He was later diagnosed to be suffering from dementia and MCYS' attempts to establish his identity were also unsuccessful."<br><br>DSP Lau added that a Police Gazette was issued but MediaCorp understands that the name of Michael's father was misspelled in it.<br><br>It was only six years later, in 2008, that the authorities managed to establish the identity of Michael's father, DSP Lau said. He did not explain the delay nor how they finally established his identity.<br><br>In December the following year, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) also issued him a new identity card - believed to be because Michael's father needed to be admitted to hospital.<br><br>The card bore his original IC number but lists the Lions Home for the Elders at Toa Payoh Rise address as his address.<br><br>When contacted, the home declined to comment, citing confidentiality reasons.<br><br>Yet, the authorities never contacted Michael all this while, until his father died in Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Nov 30 last year.<br><br>Said DSP Lau: "Regrettably, due to a lapse in communication, his missing person status was only discovered when he passed away in hospital last year. We regret the lapse and the failure to inform the family earlier when his identity was established. Police are studying how to strengthen the current processes to avoid such a lapse in the future."<br><br>When asked what went wrong in this case, an MCYS spokesperson would only say it has "an established system and works in coordination with other Government agencies to trace identities of persons picked up and also find out their reasons for vagrancy".<br><br>Homes which MediaCorp spoke to said they do not have the authority to run checks on the identities and backgrounds of destitute persons. MCYS social workers are responsible for establishing these persons' identities and contacting their families, they added.<br><br>Under the Destitute Persons Act, an inquiry may also be ordered on people picked up by MCYS. Their fingerprints and photographs may also be taken.<br><br>Adventist Home for the Elders chairman Wan Kwong Weng told MediaCorp that he had not heard of such cases before.<br><br>"Usually, you find that these destitute persons are estranged from their families," said Mr Wan. He noted that more could be done to help families find their missing loved ones. For example, there could be a shared database for the relevant agencies to share information, he said.<br><br>For Michael and his family, such a system could have made a difference. <br><br>

              <p>ideally the police could have posted his pictures in the major newspapers so the masses could help with identify the old man.  but then i believe they are cost conscious. </p>
              <p>is it against the law for the police to post the photo of the old man in this forum and ask if anyone knows him? not just this forum but others as well.</p>
              <p>thats generally speaking.  not just specifically referring to the above case.</p>
