              <p><strong>Community building still an important task: PM Lee</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 03 July 2010 1929 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said that
               community building is still an important and continuing task.
              <br> <br> Speaking at the People's Association's (PA) 50th anniversary 
              celebrations on Saturday, Mr Lee said the country's racial and religious
               harmony is strong, but it will always be work in progress.
              <br> <br> So the PA has for the first time developed five-year workplans for all 
              of Singapore's 84 constituencies.
              <br> <br> Singapore's social context has vastly changed, said Prime Minister Lee, 
              who is also the chairman of the PA.
              <br> <br> With a prospering economy, standards of living have gone up and so have 
              residents' expectations. And so the PA too has to adapt to this changing
               environment.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said: "Yet, this has not reduced the importance of building 
              cohesive communities, where neighbours know and help one another, 
              organise themselves to get things done, and work with the government to 
              improve their lives.
              <br> <br> "Last year, PA undertook a systematic workplan exercise to look beyond 
              the current programmes and think about what we want to be five years 
              from now. The exercise struck a chord with the constituencies which have
               all come abroad."
              <br> <br> That is where the five-year Community 2015 workplans aim to make 
              Singapore a great home and a caring community.
              <br> <br> Dr Chua Ee Chek, Marine Parade GRC Grassroots Leader, said: "One of the 
              key highlights is what we are going to do to reach out to the elderly 
              residents in Marine Parade. As you know, in Marine Parade we have a very
               high population of elderly, probably one in six is above 65 years old. 
              <br> <br> "What we want to do is to have a comprehensive plan; besides looking 
              after their wellness...we also consider about their well being in terms 
              of health, and the needy elderly residents."
              <br> <br> Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Deputy Chairman of the PA, 
              Lim Boon Heng, said: "This is an aspirational Vision. It belongs to the 
              whole community, and not PA alone. 
              <br> <br> "We need to bring the Vision to the community, and engage the community 
              to discuss and think about the statement. Only with residents' active 
              participation and ownership can the Vision be realised."
              <br> <br> Besides the individual constituency plans, seven Group Representation 
              Constituencies (GRCs) have decided to develop their own five-year 
              workplans on a group basis.
              <br> <br> Formulating the constituency workplans also involved several feedback 
              sessions, and in GRCs like Bishan-Toa Payoh, the youths were also 
              involved in interviewing their family members, relatives and friends on 
              the plans they would like to see in their constituency for the next five
               years.
              <br> <br> Josephine Teo, MP, Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, said: "What the residents hope 
              to do was to contribute a greater sense of 'kampong', they wanted to 
              reach out those who are needy in the community. The residents also felt 
              it was important to do their part to keep the township clean and green."
               
              <br> <br> Prime Minister Lee said now that the plans have been worked out, they 
              must be implemented with conviction and energy to deliver the desired 
              results. - CNA/ms </span></p>
