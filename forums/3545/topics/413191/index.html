              change its name</strong><br> <span class="update">By Satish Cheney | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 15 October 2010 2144 hrs</span></p>
              <p class="header"><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Investment firm Temasek Holdings said it wanted alternative political 
              news website "Temasek Review" to change its name.<br><br>Previously 
              known as The Wayang Party, the website is reported to have changed its 
              name to "Temasek Review" in 2009.<br><br>But investment firm Temasek 
              Holdings said it had also been using "Temasek Review" for its annual 
              performance review reports since 2004. <br><br>This was according to 
              Temasek Holding's senior managing director and head of Strategic 
              Relation Goh Yong Siang. <br><br>In a letter addressed to a Dr Joseph 
              Ong Chor Teck, who is believed to be the website's founder, Temasek 
              Holdings said it had no qualms about the website's mission.<br><br>But 
              it added it appeared the website had been capitalising on the goodwill 
              and reputation of investment firm Temasek Holding's name.<br><br>A 
              lawyer who spoke to Channel NewsAsia said a lot would depend on if and 
              when both parties acquired trade mark rights in the name "Temasek 
              Review".<br><br>The lawyer, who requested anonymity, said: "Although 
              Temasek Holdings (TH) used the name 'Temasek Review' for its annual 
              performance reports since 2004, it did not register this name as a trade
               mark until November 9, 2009. <br><br>"In other words, between 2004 and 
              November 9, 2009, TH has common law rights in the name "Temasek Review" 
              but it is only with effect from November 9, 2009 that it acquired trade 
              mark rights in the name 'Temasek Review'. <br><br>"The Wayang Party 
              changed its name to 'Temasek Review' in 2009. The question is whether it
               changed its name before or after November 9, 2009."<br><br>The lawyer 
              added: "If Wayang Party changed its name before November 9, 2009, TH 
              would have to proceed on a claim for passing off. <br><br>"In other 
              words, TH has to prove to the court that it has a reputation in the name
               'Temasek Review'; that (website) Temasek Review has misrepresented to 
              the public that its on-line publication originated from or is associated
               with TH; and as a result of the misrepresentation, TH has suffered 
              damages".<br><br>In relation to registering a company with the name 
              "Temasek" in it, Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Singapore
               (ACRA), in its website, advised that the following is not allowed: <br><br>1.
                   Undesirable names <br>2.     Names which are identical to a 
              sole-proprietorship / partnership name or to that of any other company, 
              corporation, limited liability partnership or limited partnership<br>3. 
                  Names which are identical to a name being reserved under the 
              Business Registration Act, the Companies Act, the Limited Liability 
              Partnerships Act or Limited Partnerships Act <br>4.     Names which the 
              Minister has directed the Registrar not to accept for registration, eg 
              Temasek<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>I think they just want to change Temasek Review because it has the same name as their annual report. So I guess TR can change to something like Temasek Times or Temasek Daily.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">TR asked to change name</h1>
              <p>by Rachel Chang</p>
              <p>TEMASEK Holdings has written to the alleged founder of socio-political
               website Temasek Review asking him to change its name.</p>
              <p>The investment company said the term Temasek Review is 
              'indisputably associated' with it and the website's use of the same name
               was a bid to 'capitalise on the goodwill and reputation' associated 
              with it.</p>
              <p>In a letter to Dr Joseph Ong released to the media 
              yesterday, Temasek head of strategic relations Goh Yong Siang noted that
               the website's original name was 'The Wayang Party', and it was only 
              sometime last year that it was renamed Temasek Review.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh pointed out that Temasek Review had been the name of 
              Temasek Holdings' annual report since 2004 and was 'well-known and 
              indisputably associated with Temasek'.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that Temasek had wanted to ask
               the website to change its name since last year, but there was nobody it
               could write to because everyone associated with it has been anonymous.</p>
              <p>Earlier this year, the company renamed its annual report 
              Temasek Report, but denied that it had anything to do with the website.</p>

              <h2 class="posttitle">TOC Latest: TR accedes to Temasek Holdings’ demand</h2>
              <p><em>Netizens see broader political significance in TH’s demand</em></p>
              <p>Citing a desire not to waste the Singaporean tax payers’ money in legal wrangling, website Temasek Review (TR) has complied with Sovereign Wealth Fund Temasek Holdings’ (TH) demand that it change its’ name.</p>
              <p>In the statement, one of TR’s editors who uses the pseudonym “Amanda Tan”, stood by what “she” felt were the legal strengths of their case. It noted that the website had started using the name “The Temasek Review” since July 2009, whereas TH had only registered the same name for trademark rights in November 2009.</p>
              <p>Despite citing these strengths, TR claimed that it was not keen to go to court to defend its’ case as “to contest the case even in a fair court in the USA will expose the identity of our editorial team which we are not prepared to do so for the time being”.</p>
              <p>The editorial team of TR claims to be completely based overseas, under the leadership of a Panama based personality using the pseudonym<a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Joseph-Ong-TNP.jpg"></a>“Molina Han”.</p>
              <p>TR also said that the name change was an act of respect for Singaporeans. It explained: “By “backing off”, we are actually respecting the rights of Singaporeans and not Temasek Holdings which incidentally also belongs to Singaporeans although the ruling party will deny otherwise.”</p>
              <p>TR was also careful to qualify that the move was not because of what it called “no balls and guts”</p>
              <p><strong>Temasek Holdings’ move sparks speculation</strong></p>
              <p>In Temasek’s <a href="../2010/10/temasek-holdings-letter-to-temasek-review/"><span style="color: #16387c;">letter to the press earlier on Saturday</span></a>, Mr Goh Yong Siang (Head, Strategic Relations) stated that the term “Temasek Review” had been used to title TH’s performance reviews since 2004.</p>
              <p>The move by Singapore’s Sovereign Wealth Fund has sparked speculation of a non-financial variety.</p>
              <p>Netizens of popular local political discussion platform Sammyboy forum saw a broader political significance to the move by TH. One commentator noted that: “They are just trying to flush out TR. Its (Temasek Holdings) an arm of the Govt.” Another commentator on The Online Citizen was more direct, claiming “this reeks of an orchestrated political gesture by Temasek Holdings in the run-up to the elections”.</p>
              <p>Indeed, the letter by Mr Goh contained statements that one would be unlikely to find in letters by a purely commercial entity:</p>
              <p>“Temasek has no issue with the desire to foster and facilitate serious debate and discourse and to provide news of socio-political affairs of Singapore. That is the right of every Singaporean.”</p>
              <p>TH’s name change request was made through the press earlier on the same day (Saturday, 16 October) in the form of a publicly available letter to Dr Joseph Ong, the man who claims to be Temasek Review’s founder.  A New Paper report on 10 October stated that Dr Ong admitted to police to being the person behind the Temasek Review and its’ predecessor, The Wayang Party.</p>
              <p>The current editors of TR have attempted to dissociate themselves from Dr Ong in their response to TH by claiming that he “is not a member of our editorial team past or present” and that “He is not in a position to receive any notices or communication on our behalf”.</p>

              <h2 class="art-PostHeader"><a title="Permanent Link to Temasek Review agrees “in principle” to a name change" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/10/16/temasek-review-agrees-in-principal-to-a-name-change/"><span style="color: #3366ff;">Temasek Review agrees “in principle” to a name change</span></a></h2>
              <p>We refer to the numerous reports in the local main stream media regarding Temasek Holdings  “request” for our ”The Temasek Review” to change its name.</p>
              <p><strong>We wish to state the following for the record:</strong></p>
              <p>1. The ”request  for name change” was delivered to one Dr. Joseph Ong who is not a member of our editorial team past or present. He is not in a position to receive any notices or communication on our behalf. Our <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/contact-us/"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">webform</span></a> is the only acceptable means of communication with us. </p>
              <p>2. We did not receive the said “request”  directly from Temasek Holdings. We were only forwarded copies of the said “request” by various journalists from the MSM requesting a follow up. Hence technically, we were not formally informed of the said request and unless we receive a formal “request” directed to us, we will treat this matter as “hearsay”.</p>
              <p>3. The name “The Temasek Review” is already in use since <strong>July 2009</strong> while Temasek Holdings only registered for trademark rights <strong>November 9, 2009</strong> in Singapore.</p>
              <p>4. Temasek Holdings also registered trademark for the following names at the United States Patent and Trademark Office:</p>
              <p>“TEMASEK” and “THE TEMASEK REPORT” respectively in October 3, 2006 and May 11, 2010. The name “THE TEMASEK REVIEW” is NOT registered.</p>
              <p>5. We note that Temasek Holdings said it had no qualms about the website’s mission.</p>
              <p>6. Our agreeing to the name change is NOT an admission of our infringement, inferred or otherwise but merely offered out of goodwill subject to acceptance of conditions agreed upon between Temasek Holdings and Temasek Review, if any.</p>
              <p>Although we have received information from our confidential sources to the contrary, “conspiracy theories” aside, we are willing to believe that the “concern” expressed by SMD Goh Yong Siang of Temasek Holdings is “geniune”.</p>
              <p><strong>After delibrating on the matter, our editorial team are agreeable “in principle” (<em>without prejudice</em>) to a name change if we can confirm and verify the following from Temasek Holdings ONLY:</strong></p>
              <p>1. That Temasek Holdings is genuinely wanting to request for a name change from us for reason(s) stated in the MSM and not just a ploy to discredit and smear Dr. Joseph Ong further, by contacting us DIRECTLY via our webform or through our official email address with a formal “request”.</p>
              <p>2. Clarify if Temasek Holdings is claiming exclusive rights to the word “Temasek” around the world and any other name we decide to change to should not have the word “Temasek” in it. Example: Temasek Gossip Corner, Temasek CoffeeShop, Temasek Lounge, Temasek Sweat Shop, etc. We are not asking for “opinion”, we are asking for “confirmation” on their claims to rights. This will help us in choosing a suitable name for our new revamped site.</p>
              <p>3. Clarify if Temasek Holdings is taking issue only with our site name or both our site name and domain name and if so is Temasek Holdings intending to acquire it from us (since it is related to their “annual review”) or are they merely intending to use underhand means to “rob” it from us.</p>
              <p>4. That this is the ONLY issue (name of the site) Temasek Holdings have with us and upon the name change, the issue is resolved with no further emcumbrances whatsoever. If there further issues, to list and state them for the record.</p>
              <p>Once we have received a formal “request” from Temasek Holdings and a satisfactory reply to the above point 2,3 and 4 raised, we will proceed with the name change soonest possible.</p>
              <p><strong>Lastly, we wish to clarify our decision with our readers:</strong></p>
              <p>1. Our editorial team decided to “accede” to the request of Temasek Holdings not because of “no balls and guts”. It is pointless to venture on this insinuations because we all know better why the sudden interest of the local MSM and TH on our site.</p>
              <p>2. We are not interested getting into a legal tussle with Temasek Holdings on our site name and waste precious time and money (ours and Singapore tax payers) which should be put to better use. Additionally, to contest the case even in a fair court in the USA will expose the identity of our editorial team which we are not prepared to do so for the time being.</p>
              <p>3. The word “Temasek” actually refers to the old Singapura and is not coined by Temasek Holdings. By “backing off”, we are actually respecting the rights of Singaporeans and not Temasek Holdings which incidentally also belongs to Singaporeans although the ruling party will deny otherwise. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temasek</span></a>)</p>
              <p>As a site for Singaporeans, we deem it an appropriate move to make. If our “backing off” can be considered a “defeat”, then we were “defeated” by Singaporeans, certainly NOT Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>We believe that whatever name we change our site to, it will not lessen our site’s impact and/or our commitment to our readers. We trust that our readers will continue to support us.</p>
              <p>This is the position of our editorial team and our official reply to Temasek Holdings.</p>
              <p>We will keep our readers updated on any latest developement.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
