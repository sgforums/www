              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              results of a National Youth Survey released recently have raised 
              concerns over youths spending too much time online. Experts have said 
              that if not monitored, the habit may lead to addiction.<br><br>When it 
              comes to internet usage, the latest "State of the Youths in Singapore" 
              report revealed that nearly 8 in 10 youths "strongly agree" or "agree" 
              that they spend their time online for entertainment purposes.<br><br>It 
              might not be much of a tell tale sign of a growing social problem but 
              the TOUCH Cyber wellness centre has already begun to see an increase in 
              cases of gaming addiction.<br><br>The number of counselling cases went up by 40 per cent last year, to 71 cases, compared to 2009.<br><br>Anthony
               Yeong, programme executive with TOUCH Cyber Wellness &amp; Sports, 
              said: "There are some who play because it is an act of achievement for 
              them, they play just for a competitive nature for the fact of satisfying
               their personal ego. There is also a lot of personal reason that they 
              are playing because of peers who are playing, and in that sense it's a 
              group activity that they must indulge in.<br><br>"Then of course there 
              are also people who are escaping from their real world. They don't like 
              who they are, they prefer to go into the online world. So there are 
              varying reasons why people will get addicted...these are generally the 
              trends that we have noticed."<br><br>The good news is that about 7 in 10
               of those seen at the centre, attain their counselling goals. However, 
              those who are getting addicted are also much younger.<br><br>Ray Chua, 
              assistant manager of TOUCH Cyber Wellness &amp; Sports, said: "Our 
              clients are typically about the age of 14-15, so early teenage years, 
              but we are also seeing cases where they are in the upper primary so 
              11-12 years old, where parents come to us and say their kids gaming 
              habits are becoming out of control and ask us to help them."<br><br>Dr 
              Tan Hwee Sim, a consultant with the Addiction Medicine Department at the
               Institute of Mental Health, said that the amount of time spent on a 
              computer is not an obvious sign of addiction.<br><br>"The actual hours 
              is not a tell-tale sign whether it is an addiction.They will skip school
               so they can stay home, so they play the game or whether they will play 
              computer games over night. So it's more of whether you are spending the 
              time that you can afford or not, rather than the actual hours," said Dr 
              Tan.<br><br>Experts have said that the popularity of social networking sites like Facebook may also add to the problem.<br><br>Cases of youths addicted to games on such sites are already starting to crop up.<br><br>Mr
               Chua elaborates: "Besides just gaming, we also notice and are observing
               a lot more people getting into social media, of course instances like 
              Facebook, games such as Mafia wars, Mouse Hunt are all on the rise. To 
              date these are just observations that we have made, there are awareness 
              of this platform, we are still observing.<br><br>"But we expect it to go
               grow and we are expecting that it may get big. For the gaming cases, we
               actually get kids dropping out of school or failing their exams, not so
               much for social networks as yet, it's an area that we are observing."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              I agree with you. Obssession with IT may not be a bad thing. But I don't agree with you that Singapore can't have the next Zuckerberg, in fact, I don't even want to be associated with Zuckerberg because I think having success after betraying his friends is not the way I want my success to be. I prefer more of Google founders where the best friends together come to build a better world and become successful together. Google is more meaningful because they really help people locate information better and for people like me who loves to understand how things work etc, it is the next best thing to a bible. I think Singapore can have the next game changer, but the chances are low because of cultural upbringing (risk adverse thinking) and also the low population.
