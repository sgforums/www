I know it is now 5am as the lights have just switched on and I can hear my neighbor showering. I have now slowly adapted to the prison’s life.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Although I know today will be another long meaningless day for me, I am still looking forward to meet new inmates and learnt more about the meaning of life. I want to make used and promise myself to be useful to the society again after my release. I have done many stupid things and due to my selfishness, I have made people near me suffered as well. Although I know myself I am not a professional legal trained.. I really hope whatever I reveal in my story can help and change people’s life.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After my breakfast, I was being notified to attend a interview regarding PPP program (Home detention scheme). Beside me, there are a few other inmates from other dayrooms as well. We were being escorted to the interview room within the same building and we were all being briefed by a highly ranked prison officer in the interview room.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He told that based on our records and backgrounds, we were selected and he will recommend us for PPP Program (Home Detention scheme). However, he told us that it is still not confirm as there are requirement, terms &amp; conditions for us to fulfill and we are to undergo a second interview 1 week later if we wish to take up the PPP program. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He briefed us on our estimated home detention duration and other important requirement for PPP program:</span><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">- Require a normal ‘Singtel’ Telephone line for home detention more than 7 days</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">- No smoking/ drinking/ gambling (buying of 4D/ TOTO) during detention program</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">- Inmates are only allowed to leave our house from 12pm – 3pm daily (Different timing for special occasions).</span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: small;">- We are to be 24 hours for spot checks and be prepared to recall back to CPC for urine check at all time.</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We’ll have the option to reject the home detention scheme and don’t be surprised that there are a few inmates who actually rejected the home detention scheme on the spot.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">They claimed that they don’t have family support ( either homeless or staying alone), some felt that the duration of the program is too short and some thought it is too troublesome so they rather choose to stay in prison to complete their sentences.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is Home Detention Scheme: </span></strong></span><br><br></p>

They drove to Lim Chu Kang cemetery, tied him up and bash him up. The foreign worker plead to stop and offered them all his money in his pocket (about $10000). The group agreed and left quickly after taking the foreign worker’s money. </strong></em></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em><strong>The group was arrested by the police within 1 week after the robbery.</strong></em></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><em><strong>From what he told me, I thought he was helping out a friend, out for revenge and to teach the foreign worker a lesson.

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">.</span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: x-small;">Soon the cellroom door opened and my name was being called by the cookie. I do not know where I am transfering. I farewell to my roommates and exchange contacts before I step out from my cell room.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">While assumble outside of dayroom 3, I can see there are<span> </span>others about 20 inmates including from other dayrooms beside me. We were being briefed to bring along our belongings and we will be transfer to HU1 ( HU1 consists of level 1 and 2 in B4) We were later being escort to the level 1 ( HU1) by a prison officer. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Another prison officer from level 1 took over and we were escorted to Dayroom 1 in HU1. The cookies and the prison officers from there carefully inspect our belongings. Then a briefing and orientation about HU1 house rules and regulations was conducted by a prison officer. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Most rules remain the same but somehow to me, HU1 tends to be much stricter. The only difference is our yardtime and dayroom activities are 2 hours.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">We headed directly to our assigned cellroom after the briefing. Together with me, there are other 3 inmates from HU3 heading to the same cell room, 208. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #ffffff;">.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I was nervous, I don’t know what type of my new roommates will be and what is coming in this new envoirment. The cellroom door open and I can see there are another 4 inmates inside. It seems that I am the youngest among all.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Remain calm and quiet, I put my belonging on the assigned area told by one of the inmate from the room. After I settle down, </span></span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I self-introduce myself and ask the roommates about their own house rules.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">After spending some time talking and listening to their conversation, I found out that the reason on why I have been transferred to HU1. HU1 is normally the last station for inmates who are releasing soon. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: x-small;">.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">One more interesting thing I was being told; Room 209 and 210 which were just next to our cellroom, those inmates being locked up in the 2 cell rooms are the ones which we have alsobeen warned by the prison officers not to get near and communicate with anyone of them. Bei</span></span><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">ng caught by the officers will be punished. At first I thought those inmates are the ‘GRADE A’ prisoners (commit serious offences and was isolated) but I was wrong, they were somehow special than us…</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: #ffffff;"><span>.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For respect, we do not address them as ‘brothers’, instead we address them as ‘Sisters’................</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: small;">.</span></p>
