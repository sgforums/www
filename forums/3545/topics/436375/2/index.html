              <p><br>by Teo Soh Lung <br><br>Dr Ang Swee Chai, a prominent surgeon and author of From Beirut to Jerusalem has now written about her arrest and detention without trial under the ISA in 1977. <strong>She was one of at least 28 people, mostly professionals, who were arrested and labelled as Euro Communists by the PAP government. </strong><br><br>Dr Ang was arrested on 15 March 1977, one month after Tan Jing Quee was arrested. At the time of her arrest, her husband of two weeks, Francis Khoo, a lawyer had escaped to London after many of their friends were arrested and imprisoned. Both she and her husband now live as exiles in London. The documents and photographs seized have not been returned to them. <br><br><a style="color: #e1771e; " href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ARju-_pZWgg/TkdXnUzzRDI/AAAAAAAAA7U/jynXRR0I6sE/s1600/dr_ang.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5640573391417328690" style="border-top-width: 1px; border-right-width: 1px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-left-width: 1px; padding-top: 4px; padding-right: 4px; padding-bottom: 4px; padding-left: 4px; border-top-style: solid; border-right-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid; border-left-style: solid; border-top-color: #cccccc; border-right-color: #cccccc; border-bottom-color: #cccccc; border-left-color: #cccccc; float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 0px; cursor: pointer; width: 193px; height: 243px; " src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ARju-_pZWgg/TkdXnUzzRDI/AAAAAAAAA7U/jynXRR0I6sE/s400/dr_ang.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px; ">"On the morning of my arrest, I was operating, when one of my colleagues came to tell me that a number of plain clothes policemen were looking for me. I told him that I got to finish operating on my patient before I could see them. They waited outside the operating theatre, maybe about 10 of them altogether, since we left in 2 cars. One of them wanted to hand-cuff me, but I told them I was not going to run away, and could not anyway. <strong>Furthermore they should not lead me with hand cuffs through the crowded hospital corridors for everyone to see, since some of the people sitting along the corridor were my patients. </strong><br><br>They took me first to our own flat. We were married 2 weeks prior to this and had just moved into this flat. They started going through all our things, taking a whole lot of documents and books away, and helped themselves to our wedding photos. Then they went to Francis' mother's house and took away Francis's things. Next they went to my parents's house to search. It was in the late afternoon when I was finally taken to Whitley Detention Centre. I was made to change into canvas/linen prisoner's clothes, and all my own clothes - including my bra and watch were taken away. I was thumb-printed and had photographs taken with my prison number which was 116. From there I was taken straight to interrogation. It was hard to know how long I was interrogated, since there was no clock, and my own watch was taken away. But since there was about 9-12 change of shifts I must have been questioned initially for at least 72 hours. The interrogation was conducted by about 6 male officers with one female officer watching in each shift. <br><br>There was initial banging of tables and threat that they would throw the key away for ever, and no one can get me out. They accused me of being a communist and a terrorist! The room was cold and I was shivering. I was then given strong tea with sugar and no milk, which coupled with all the threats sent my heart rate thumping. <br><br>After what I thought must be the first 72 hours of continuous interrogation, I was taken to a small cell, no mattress, and the door shut. Lights were on. There was a small window in the door which was shut. As I sat on the cement floor, a Gurkha brought me rice wrapped in brown paper. There was one tiny fish, and I just could not eat anything. I was then taken to the toilet, but not allowed to close the door. By this time I was well and truly constipated. I just could not use the toilet with Gurkha soldiers standing guard at an open door. After that I was taken to an enclosed field and told to exercise for about 10 minutes. <br><br>Then I was taken back for interrogation by yet a new set of officers. I was given lots of blank paper and questioned about Francis. I must have spent a couple of days being questioned, and writing and re-writing pages on Francis - most of what I wrote I remember was trivial initially. But later it was clear that what they were after was for me to implicate Francis as a terrorist. This I refused to do, as I know Francis was not. Then they put it to me that Francis had been lying and hiding things from me. They told me they had evidence to support their allegations, but could not show me. <br><br>After about another 48 hours I was taken back to my cell. This time I was given fried Hor Fun by my case officer, who told me that my boss, Mr J E Choo, the Head of Outram Road General Hospital had rung the head of the ISD asking what they wanted with me. Apparently he had recently operated on the head of the ISD. The late Mr J E Choo was Senior State Surgeon and extremely well respected. This phone call I suspect had improved my deal. <br><br>I was also given a mattress on the floor of my cell this time and told I was to sleep for two hours. Once the door shut I burst into tears, but then stopped since I thought I could be watched, and it was stupid to cry. After this time when I was again taken out for interrogation, the officers seemed friendly and polite, and advised me that in order to save my marriage I should go to Europe and persuade Francis to come back. They emphasized that apart from the shock of being suddenly picked up, I was treated well, and since I was able to go through with this, I should challenge Francis to go through this as well. I think they call it "coming clean". Of the pages and pages I have written, I signed some of them. <strong>The officers explained that I was a reasonable middle class professional (division one officer) and they could talk to me without resorting to using force, and it was easy to work with me. But with labourers and workers they usually had to beat them up to get co-operation. </strong>They gave me the impression that I was sensible, co-operative, not a terrorist but misled by my husband, and they wanted to help Francis correct his "deviant" ways before he get into very deep waters! They also told me not to worry about the hospital since it was also part of the civil service as the ISD was, and they had applied for me to have a fortnight's leave, so nobody would query where I went, and as few people should know that I have been "picked up" by the ISD as possible. I somehow never challenged them about my doctor colleagues, who saw me being taken away in broad daylight from the hospital. <br><br>When I was released a week later, it was surreal to see the metal gates of the detention centre closed behind me and getting into a taxi to go home! I knew that Francis had escaped to either Holland or London, and I had promised the ISD that I would go to Europe to talk to him. Despite all their assurances, I had made up my mind that I would not want Francis to come back to be interrogated, as I suspected he would be badly treated. The ISD officers laughed when I became defensive at one point and told me that I should not worry since they would not beat me up - Francis would see the bruises and make an issue of them, they told me. <br><br>So this is my brief account of an encounter with ISD. Apart from getting some information about Francis, this arbitrary detention was not only unpleasant for me personally but a criminal waste of police resources and taxpayers' money. Through this incident, I realised that despite being a division one civil servant, I could be put behind bars without charge, with no access to the outside world and could have disappeared with no one knowing. I was fortunate to be arrested in the hospital during working hours, and my colleagues who saw the arrest had told Mr Choo, my boss and he chose to intervene. If I was arrested in the middle of the night from my home, and there were no witnesses, then I could have been locked up forever as the ISD threatened. Even now I frequently ask myself, what kind of society is this who treat her citizens in this way." <br><br>Ang Swee Chai <br>5 August 2011 <br>London</blockquote><blockquote style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px; "><a href="http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2011/08/prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-should.html">http://singaporerebel.blogspot.com/2011/08/prime-minister-lee-hsien-loong-should.html</a></blockquote></div>

              <p>There are readers after reading through chapter 3.2, asking questions on why masterbuting in cellroom is a offence. And how can the officer can caught those inmates on doing it.

              <p>Hi readers, I am a ex-convict whom have served my jail term
              from July 2011- Augest 2011. Lockup in CPC (Changi Prison
              Complex) for a month, then served the remaining of my sentence
              under PPP (Home Detention Program).
              Throughout my  'short' 2 months lock-up behind bars
              and at home. I have came across and met numbers of ex-convicts whom
              have commited all types of offences. They share with me
              their backgrounds, personal stories which have taught me
              alot and understand the meaning of happiness in life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Inspiration from those people whom have supported and helped me
              get through and start afresh, I decided to create this
              website aiming to bring those with an interest in the prisoner
              support community a forum in which their issues and concerns may be
              addressed by others in similar circumstances and beliefs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Although I am still struggling with debts after my release,
              I am no longer in depression. I'll finally found and
              understand the real meaning of life and regain back my
              strength and confidence to face the reality again, all
              thanks to my lock-up experiences and those inmates/ officers I
              met in CPC.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I sincerely hope and be glad if my life story here can
              actually helpout any of you readers or people around
              you. Think again before you commiting a crime and do get
              prepare on what you will face after you commit a crime!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">&lt; Before I begin, I apologise
              if there are spelling and grammer mistakes in my blog
              &gt;</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffff00; font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 1.1:  What I have
              done</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I stay with my parents and I can say I have a warm beloved
              family. I have  my own stable decent business which I
              have been spenting years building up. For the past 28
              years I'll have been living in a decent lifestyle.</p>
              <p>Like most of the readers here, I always told myself
              and anyone around me that I will not commit anything
              which is illegal. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But my life was destroyed by myself soon after the opening of
              Casino in MBS (MarinaBay Sands) (MBS). Due to my greed, I have
              lost everything (my savings, my company, my
              lifestyle) within months  in MBS. Neverless to
              say, I end up commiting a crime soon later due to financial.</p>
              <p>I never hide nor trying to escape after I commited the crime. I
              thought I was already mentally prepared and faced the consequences.
              I turned myself in the next day after I commited the crime.</p>
              <p>I was being summoned to Subordinate Court by my IO from
              Cantonment Police Station after 1 month from the
               day of my interview and providing my statement to
              him. My case was very direct as I decided to plead guilty without
              hiring lawyer and appeal. I want get my punishment as
              soon as possible so I can end it all once and for all. </p>
              <p> </p>

              Subordinate Court</span></strong></span></p>
              <p>I turned up with my family members to Subordinate Court, Court
              26 (as ordered by my IO), 9am sharp for my mention. I
              entered court room 26 at 9am sharp and it was already full of
              people and the trial had just started.  Turn by turn, my whole
              waiting and hearing process took about 2 hours. I am not
              alone. There are at least about 40+ others including the

              hearing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was ordered by the judge to attend court 10, 2.30pm
              (same day) for my sentences after I've  plead guility to
              the judge during my mention.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Like anyone whom are attending court for their first
              time in their life, it is a very tense, stressful, full of
              worries and nervous moment for me. But something that have
              touched my heart is the accompany and support from my familes till
              that very last moment!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I enter my court room 26 at 9am sharp and it was already full of
              people. My whole waiting and hearing process took me about 2 hours.
              I am not alone. There are at least about 40+ others just like me,
              turn by turn waiting for their hearing.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ffff00; font-size: medium;">Advice &amp;
              Information </span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">1. If you are prepared
              to plead guility on the same day that you attend court, you
              will be sent to jail on the same day itself.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">2. If you plead guilty on the same
              day that you attend court, try not to bring cash amount more than
              $300. As prison will only refund you back in cheque upon your
              release if your money declared exceed $300</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">3. Get yourself a full back
              plastic-made frame spectacle if you wear spectacle as prison do not
              allow you to wear other type of material-made spectacle frame. (You
              are only allowed to wear for the first 3 weeks of your
              lock-up)</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">4. Make sure you have a heavy
              lunch before you attend your final sentence as you will mostly
              be sent and reach CPC (Changi Prison Complex) in the late
              evening. Prison will only served  breads for dinner at
              night.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As orderd, I arrived Court 10 at 2.30pm sharp for my final
              sentence. I was not alone, there were other 3 persons seating down
              at the waiting area, awaiting for their sentences.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Upon the arrival of the judge (Female/ Chinese/ Mid-Thirties).
              Everyone in the court stood up and make a bow then sat down
              again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">My offence commited is CBT
              (Criminal Beach Of Trust)  was charged under section
              408.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I plead guilty to the judge and was sentence 1 month
              jail term + $8000 fine (in default 4 weeks jail term) jail
              term, my total sentence is 1 month 4 weeks jail term as I
              couldn't payout the fine. But I still feel relieve as I
              was expecting 3months - 5months jail term.  Soon I was
              being handcruffed by the officer, the first time in my whole
              life! </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mind is totally blank at that moment when I got
              handcruffed at that moment. I can strongly feel someone
              have feel hurt and tears dropping from their eyes at that
              very moment - My family members whom I
              have hurt and make them suffer!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ffcc99;">Please think
              again before you commit a crime! In singapore, you can run but
              you cannot hide forever. When you commit a crimet, you are not
              only destroying and hurting yourself but you are also hurting all
              those whom have always shown love and concern to you even deeper!
              They are the ones suffering the most when you get caught and
              sentence in jail!</span></p>

              Subordinate Court</span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Once the court are dismiss, I was escorted by the police
              officers to a side exit.  I can only turn my head to my
              family to have my last look and goodbye through our eyes
              contact as I am not allow to communicate with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being escorted, walking through a narrow passage then staircase,
              I came to the  basement where the lock-up cell rooms
              are located. Walking in, I was bought to a room which
              there are others like me, being handcruffed and turn by turn,
              we surrender our belongings, checking height
              &amp; weight,  thumb-print (no signature allowed)
              some documents. I was later bought to one of the lock-up
              cell after done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The lightings in the cellroom are dime and the walls are full of
              fingerprint markings. Its not stuffy as there are
              air-con. There was a toilet attached within the cell room but
              was doorless.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was not alone in that cell room! There are about 20 other
              people (all ages, races include foreigners, some wearing
              normal clothes while some in remand prisoner's clothes = white
              t-shirt and brown long pants with transport jelly slippers) with me
              in that cell (about 350 sqf). </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My mind was lost and nervous. i can feel there
              are eyes watching  at me. I don't know what's coming
              next . I can only stand alone at one corner quietly
              observing the surronding. There are others who are like me. looking
              lost and nervous from their expression. Some Sitting down
              quietly on the floor while some chat with each other happily.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Soon I was approach by one of the cell mate (age about mid 40s,
              skinny, with tatoo on his right arm) and we start chatting. Hes a
              repeat convict (3rd timer) and I can say he is the one whom have
              relief me. He told me what will be coming and other
              infomation/ advices which I thought it is very
              useful to me when I reach CPC (Changi Prison
              Complex). He is being charged on drugs case. I was really
              surpised that the first offender i ever spoke to, is such a easy
              going and friendly guy which i have never expected to be!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Time pass slowly and soon one officer came and ordered
              us to get in-line of 2 rows. We did as what was being told.
              Thereafter, we were being escorted to another large empty
              room to have our legs shackled. With our hands cruffed
              and legs shackled, we were then being escorted to
              the carkpark and enter a prison vehicle. It can contained about 40
              prisoners per vehicle. Interior are fully sealed, no
              windows! We sat down in orderly manner and I know we are
              on our way to the prison now!</p>

Great Singapore sales event, school holiday and overseas holiday trips. But to me, this was the month that had changed my ‘normal’ life and make me suffered! <br><br><strong>Marina Bay Sands (MBS), opened in April 2010, the casino-resort’s revenue about US737.6 million (from opening till july2011), was the 1st casino I’ve ever been to. My first visit to MBS was due to my boredom , curiosity and sightseeing. </strong><br><br>I have won some money and I returned to the casino again the next day within my 24 hours entry permit as it was my off day. Luck was more my side, I won a total profit of 11k within 2days. Soon I visited both MBS and RWS (Resort World Sentosa) mostly everyday throughout the month of June, and in the end I lost a total amount of about $130k back to the casinos. I have lost my hard-earned savings, my company, my lifestyle and making myself in debts, all thanks to the hunger of my greed! <br><br>I ended my business soon after. I felt regretted, depress, anger, sad, stress, hopeless in life to the stage that I thought of ending my life and had locked myself up in my room for days, trying to end my life by drinking dentol, swallowing pills and cutting my pulse <a rel="nofollow" href="http://prisonstories.webs.com/apps/blog/show/8155956-my-life-in-changi-prison-chapter-3-"><span style="color: #3388dd;">(click here to view my scar)</span></a> . After 2 attempts of commit suicide, I was still alive but had only made my life even worse, making my family members sad, hurt and cried for my doings! <br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">For your information, commit suicide in Singapore is a serious offence. </span><br><br><br>Legal gambling may not be a offence, but make sure you must have your limit. Cases like me are very common in Singapore nowadays. If you choose to exceed your limit, make sure you are ready to face the consequences!<br><br>For those who have not been to casino but intending to go, I would advise you to stop visiting after your first visit. <br><br>For those who have visited regularly to pass time, those as ‘part-time’ / ‘full-time’ gamblers and those whom have already ‘donated’ a huge sum of your hard-earned money to the casinos, my advice to you is to stop and wake up to your sense while it is still not too late. <br><br>I apologise if I have offended some of you. You may disagree and negative thoughts on my comments. Although I know myself very clear that I am nobody and have no rightes to tell you what to do and what is best for you, but I really hope readers who are gamblers, please spend 5 minutes to think about what I have wrote! I had went through the gambling experience and suffering moments personally, I can totally understand your feeling of winning and losing. Please spend your free time read through past newspaper and don’t be surprise that almost every day, there were reports on all sorts of people from different backgrounds end up bankrupt, divorce, borrowing loan sharks, ran away leaving debts to their family, commit suicide and crimes because of gambling (The Number 1 killer). <br><br><strong>Still not convincing enough? I hope my Q&amp;A theory below can convince you!</strong><br><br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">What will you do if you lost $500 to casino?</span><br>You will withdrawn money from atm and gamble, hoping just to win back whatever you lost. (This is how you will fall into the trap of anger, panic and greed)<br><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">What will you do if you won $500 from casino?</span><br>You may stay longer or leave immediately, but very high percentage in returning to casino again due to the lure of easy money. (This is how you will fall into the trap of greed)<br><br>What happen next is unexplainable and I will not to comment more on it. You may be the lucky one or end up like me. The choice is yours and blame no one on the path you choose. <br><br>Spending months living in the worse moment of my life and owning a sum of outstanding debts to banks and companies after the incident, I tried to be strong and spend most of my time working hard in taking up 2-3 jobs. While trying hard and find ways to settle my debts as soon as possible, I worked from one company to another that provides better income. <br><br>In April 2011, I returned to the MNC company which I had used to work with after my national service. I thought my burden will be lesser as the salary offered upon confirmation after the 2 months probation is sufficient for my daily living expenses and paying off debts. But soon after I started work, ‘something’ happened unexpectedly which required me a sum money to settle it urgently. Under the stress and depression, with other resource in gathering the funds I needed, I secretly use company’s funds to settle my problem. I know what I am doing is a crime. But at that moment, I would rather choose to end up in jail than get involved with loan sharks to settle the problem. I turned myself in to the company soon after my crime and I was summoned to Cantonment Police Station soon after! <br><br><strong><em>I kept asking myself and heaven why the world is so unfair to me? Why is my life in a mess since young? I want to change but why there are no choices for me? I need ANSWERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </em></strong><br><br>I assumed that it would be the end of my life after going to prison. But I was wrong, I had found my answers in prison! In prison, I am convince and positive in what I see , hear, experienced it personally! Now I am happy that I am lucky enough not to get myself killed! I am lucky enough to have my hands, legs, eyes, ears, etc.. with me properly function while there are people whom don’t. I may be poor and still in bad financial status now but not as poor as people from third-war countries who have to fought for food for survival! I am not suffering alone, there are others who are facing the same fate and other’s even worse till we can never imagine! I will never blame on others for the things I do. I am the one whom have destroyed myself and I will be the one who will going to fix it back!<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Chapter 3.6: Criminal Breach Of Trust</span></span></strong><br><span style="color: #0000ff;">To Be Continued </span></p></div>

He earned about $1600 per month, was divorced with his wife and had a 5 years old daughter under the care of him. Due to his addiction of gambling of illegal soccer betting, his monthly salary was never enough to pay for his loses. Till one day, he got no chance but to loan from licensed money lenders and loan sharks to settle his debts. He ended up in deeper debts due to the high interest rates of both money lenders and loan sharks. Feeling lost and unable to undertake the mental stress, he choose to settle his debts using company funds. He turned himself shortly after he commit the crime.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Just like me, gambling had ruined 6xx1’s life. I hope he had learn his lesson and take care her daughter well after his release from CPC.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">6xx3, age about mid 30s, is a soft spoken decent guy. He was requested by his ‘sworn’ brother to act as guarantor for loans. He agreed due to their years of friendship and his trust to him. 6xx3 never expected his ‘sworn’ brother went missing shortly after he got the loans. Betrayal by his ‘sworn’ brother caused him in debts. Weeks of feeling regretted, anger, depress and stress that caused him to settle the debts using the company funds secretly. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">He somehow managed to repay back the funds he stole from the company without being caught in weeks later. Thinking nothing will happened to him. Till the day of company’s internal audit check, his doing was found out by the auditor and he was reported to the police by the company thereafter.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>A advice for readers: Friends may be important, but be careful in how you help them. Sometimes even your nearest one will be the one hurting you most and destroy your life. </strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>You can still be charged for CBT even if you had returned the sum of money which you had took from your employer for personal uses.</strong> </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">I received a email from a reader recently and here’s what he wrote:</span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">“Hi Bro<br><br>I have a wife and 2 sons which are still very young. 3.5yrs old and 1.5 yrs old. I am currently working ok with a ok salary. <br><br>I have been to the casino also hoping to win some money to make ends meet.<br>I did not lose much and got worried when I lose coz I have kids to feed and pampers to buy. I end up borrowing from legal money lenders to make ends meet again and currently trying to stay afloat. I hope I can clear them all by this month end. <br><br>My wife doesn’t know about this lending though and I know she will be very angry if she got to know about me borrowing monies.<br><br>There are days before I get my salary I buy a loft of bread and kaya and have them as my meal for a few days. When she ask if I have eaten, I always say yes. I try to think that I am just fasting…. Sigh…<br><br>Bro, sorry to brood to you my story too. Just wanted to talk to someone who been to hell and back. Your story have encouraged me somewhat and made me more aware not to do anything illegal just to fulfill my needs. There are times when I am so tempted to do so. But thinking of my sons and my wife, I refrain. My only worry now is my credit cards debts which I have not been able to pay for a long time… there are suicidal times as well for me but only reason why i am alive is becoz of my 2 sons. <br><br></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Anyway, thanks a lot for your story. I hope to be able to make things right again.”</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">From what he wrote, I am happy that my story did actually encouraged him and had prevented him from committing a crime. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Advice: Please spare a thought for your loved ones before you intend to commit a crime! </strong></span><br><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4: 'Yard' Time</span></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">----To Be Continued---</span></strong> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chapter 4.1: 'Yard' Time<br><br></span></span><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">“A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life, and how things were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it, and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved a new one arose. </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water. In the first pot, she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs and the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil without saying a word. In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl. </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what do you see?" "Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied. She brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and noted that they got soft. She then asked her to take the egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, she asked her to smell and sip the coffee. The daughter smiled, as she smelled and tasted its rich aroma. The daughter then asked, "What's the point, mother?" </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity- boiling water-but each reacted differently. The carrot went in strong, hard and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak. The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior. But, after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened. The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling water they had changed the water. </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Which are you?" she asked her daughter. "When trials and adversity knock on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?" </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Think of this: Which am I? </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain and adversity, do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength? </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Am I the egg that starts with a passive heart, but changes with the heat? Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside, am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and a hardened heart? </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Or, am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the fragrance and flavour. If you are like the bean, when things are at their worst, you become better and change the situation around you. </span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">When the hours are the darkest and trials are their greatest do you elevate to another level? </span></em></strong><br><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">So readers, how do you handle adversity? </span></em></strong><br><strong><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Like the CARROT, the EGG, OR the COFFEE BEAN?”</span></em></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">A new day begins in B4, dayroom 3, cell room 629. The morale between me and all my roommates had been established well. As we are all in the same ‘communication channel’, there are no agreement and conflicts between us for the past 1 day lock-up. And this is a day which we are waiting for as there is a 1 hour ‘yard’ activity for all inmates in dayroom 3. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The ’Yard’ room, which is located on the same storey shared by the 3 dayrooms. Inmates from each dayroom will rotate and take turns for ‘yard’ activity. 1st batch will normally start immediately after breakfast. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Announcement had been made through our cell room’s intelcom informing us to get ready for our ‘Yard’ soon after our 9am muster check. The cell room’s door opened 5 minutes later and all the inmates (except those who have reported sick) in dayroom 3 were gathered and headcount by the cookies. One of the house rules is that inmates are not allowed to wear their shirts during ‘Yard’ activity and we are to proceed to the Yardroom without our shirt on. I can see all sorts of scars and tattoos on the inmate’s bodies! Within 5 minutes, we’ve reach the entrance of the Yard room and as usual, we striped ourselves for checking before we enter the Yard room. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Yard room is about the size of 2 basketball courts (More description on Yard room can be found on chapter 2.3). In Yard room, there are one basketball court and a sipat tecok court. Slip-on shoes for exercise, Water cooler and toilets are also available in the Yard room.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Once all inmates (about 120 inmates) are ready and had assembled in the Yard room, we will need to do body stretching led by a cookie first. Once stretching are completed and permission to proceed are given by the prison officer, inmates who are required to shave will proceed to the shaving area while inmates who want to exercise will proceed to collect the socks and shoes at the shelving near the entrance. Hair cutting, fingernails cutter and newspaper are also available for the inmates. House rule for ball games: inmates are only allowed to play basketball with the duration of 30 minutes and another 30 minutes is for sipat tecok. Both courts are not allowed for games at the same time.</span><br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">What is Sepak Takraw?</span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Sepak takraw,or known as kick volleyball, is a </span></strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>sport</strong></span></a><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> native to the </span></strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malay_Peninsula"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Malay-Thai Peninsula</strong></span></a><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">. Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of </span></strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>volleyball</strong></span></a><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> in its use of a </span></strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattan"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>rattan</strong></span></a><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest and head to touch the ball.</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I spent my first day of Yard walking and observing around. I can see inmates jogging around the courts, inmates doing push-up and sit-up, inmates reading newspapers and inmates from all races and ages playing ball games together.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I can also see inmates sitting at corners, chatting with each others. Unlike the past, inmates nowadays no longer challenged each other using their secret society backgrounds. Most of the inmates will just approach to each other for chatting without minding each other background. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I walked to the notice board which is also located in the Yard room as well. I can see all the house rules and regulations in hardcopy attached within. There are also posters informing inmates about upcoming events and the ones coming soon is a cooking contest and a art design’s contest among the inmates which is organized by Yellow Ribbons and sponsored by other communities. The most important for all inmates for references is the P.S List on the notice board. This P.S list will state all inmate’s ID Number and which prison officer are their P.S. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Note: P.S is inmate’s officer-in-charge. Inmates are to approach their P.S for personal issues and assistances.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">After done reading through all the notices on the notice board, I walked to the wall near the toilet and try to view the outside world through those tiny holes on that wall. I can only manage to see some blocks of ‘condominium’ just opposite B4 and nothing much. I was curious as I thought it is impossible to have residents staying nearby CPC. So I approached some LT inmates for information.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Later then I found out that the residents staying in those blocks of ‘Condominium’ are actually the <strong>‘Prison Officers’</strong>........</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4.2: The Prison Officers</span></strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>--To Be Continued-- </strong></span></p></div>
