One of them told me that he</span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> used to serve his national service in the Prison Department. He said if anyone wish to sign on as a prison officer during their national service, they will be schedule on a attachment to various institutions. They will on attachment for months for training and need to attend another 28 weeks courses in HTA after the attachment. They will then be posted to institutions that are assigned to them after their graduation and will start out as Personal Supervisors (PS) whereby a group of inmates will be under their care. There are other duties required such as reporting muster checks that they are account for, escort duties, etc… </span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>(Please note the information may not be 100% accurate as the inmate told me that is many years ago).</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Another inmate told me that the blocks of condominium beside B4 are one of the welfare for the prison officers, which allows their family members to stay together as well. </span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Now I have done a research for all of us get to understand more about Prison Officer’s job:</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Prison Officers are committed and driven individuals who aspire to be an integral partner in the Criminal Justice System, and protect society through the safe custody of offenders, as well as the rehabilitation of inmates. </strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>• They are seen as our 'Captains of Lives', and are part of a highly trained and motivated team which plays a pivotal role in steering and helping inmates re-integrate into society.</strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Prison Officers are responsible for helping offenders make right their errant ways and restore their self-respect and confidence. One such role is that of a Personal Supervisor. The Personal Supervisor works with the Housing Unit Officer to maintain good order and discipline among the inmates in the prisons and drug rehabilitation centres. The Personal Supervisor is assigned to oversee a group of inmates. He is required to manage the inmates by engaging them in purposeful and meaningful interactions. This is a foundational posting all Prison Officers go through. </strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Depending on their aptitude and potential, Prison Officers can be rotated to other job functions (e.g. Intelligence Officer, Programme Support Officer, Security &amp; Provost Officer etc) after their foundational posting. Such job functions will hone the officers’ development and prepare them to assume positions of higher responsibility. </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Senior Prison Officers serve a leadership function within the service and are involved in planning and charting the direction of many aspects of the Singapore Prisons Service. They are also expected to take on various roles during their careers, exposing them to the many challenges that the service has to offer. </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Depending on their aptitude and potential, Senior Prison Officers can be rotated to other job functions (e.g. Staff Officer, Intelligence Officer, Security &amp; Provost Officer, Counsellor etc) after their foundational posting. Such job functions will hone the officers’ development and prepare them to assume positions of higher responsibility. </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Benefits include: </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Special allowance and Retention Payment Scheme for Prison Officer </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Retirement Fund Scheme </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Membership to Prisons Sports &amp; Recreation Club </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Membership to Prisons Multi-purpose Co-operative Society </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• 13 months’ salary and variable bonuses </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• 14 to 18 days annual leave </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Home renovation, vehicle and computer loans at special rates </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Medical and dental treatment at subsidised rates </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Group Term Insurance Scheme </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Cash vouchers on special occasions </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">• Access to affordable holiday bungalows, both local and overseas </span></strong><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Applicants with 4 GCE "O" Level or NITEC (formerly NTC-2) would be considered on a case-by-case basis and would be appointed on 3-year contract if shortlisted for the position. </strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Newly appointed Senior Prison Officers and Prison Officers have to go through 37 &amp; 32 weeks of residential Basic Officer Course at the Home Team Academy, respectively. This will be followed by on-the-job training for 8 weeks. Prison officers will undergo structured professional training with career advancement into operational/ specialised/ staff positions. </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">The rank structure is: </span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Corporal → Sergeant → Staff Sergeant → Chief Warder 1 → Chief Warder 2 → Senior Chief Warder Officer 1 → Senior Chief Warder 2 </strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">A Senior Prison Officer must have a degree from a recognised University (any discipline). </span></strong><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">The rank structure is: </span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Rehabilitation Officer 1 → Rehabilitation Officer 2 → Asst Superintendent 1 → Asst Superintendent 2 → Deputy Superintendent 1 → Deputy Superintendent 2 → Superintendent → Asst Director → Deputy Director → Director of Prisons</strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Prison Officers and Senior Prison Officers are committed and driven individuals who aspire to be an integral partner in the Criminal Justice System. They contribute to a safe and secure Singapore by protecting society through the safe custody of offenders, as well as the rehabilitation of inmates. </strong></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">As a Senior Prison Officer, you will be involved in the planning and charting of direction of the many aspects of the Singapore Prison Service. Their role as a Housing Unit Officer is to maintain discipline and order among the inmates under your charge and help inmates re-integrate into society. They should possess leadership qualities, good communications and analytical skills to be able to motivate and lead your team under your charge. </span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="font-family: Arial;">Prison Officers work closely with Senior Prison Officers to assist them in many of the vital functions of the Department. They are required to manage the inmates by engaging them in purposeful and meaningful interactions and ensuring good order and discipline of inmates. This requires one to possess good interpersonal skills, integrity, being firm and assertive, fairness and flexibility in discharging their duties. </span></strong><br><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">It seems to be a very good prospect joining SPS to work as prison officers, but not to some of the inmates and some of the ex-prison officer’s mindset. They thought prison officer’s life style are not much differences comparing the inmates, as prison officers work, eat and sleep in the prison most of their time. Mentality must be strong for anyone who takes up this job! </span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;"><strong>Just a advice for anyone who are expected to go prison soon. Please obey your prison officer’s orders and followed the house rules and regulations. Learn and ask from the seniors (inmates whom are 2nd timer or had lock-up for quite some time) when you are in the prison on what to do and which prison officers you should beware of. </strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Prison officers are working for a living and many are just following orders, which you are only serving your jail term to get back your freedom as soon as possible. So just don’t create any trouble and get yourself into unnecessary punishments by the prison officers.</span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">It is useless to question and challenge the prison rules and regulations. Behave yourself and learn from the ‘seniors’. Prison officers are just following the SOP (Standard Of Operation) set by SPS. Every procedures and prison’s welfare provided to the inmates, there must be various reasons behind. So don’t waste your time on complaining and comparing CPC with other country’s prisons.<br></span><br><span style="font-size: x-small;">Please note the my intention are not promoting for SPS and I do not have any relationship with them. I just hope for those readers who are going in soon, to understand the prison officer's job scropes, to behave yourself and don't get yourself get 'tumba' (extra jail term punishment) which is totally not worth it! And also always bear in mind that you are not going there for ‘holiday’ and it is not a ‘chatlet’ which you expect will have everything you need! </span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><em>"People come into your life for a reason, a season or a lifetime. When you know which one it is, you will know what to do for that person.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #333333;"><strong><em>When someone is in your life for a REASON, it is usually to meet a need you have expressed. They have come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally or spiritually." </em></strong></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #333333;">While I am sitting down with the malay inmates and listening to their conversations, one of them suddenly mentioned about RTC and start telling us about his life experience in RTC years back.............<br><br><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next Chapter 4.3: Reformative Training Centre (RTC)</span></strong><br><strong>To Be Continued </strong></span></p></div>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4.3: Reformative Training Center (RTC)<br><br></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">“They may seem like a godsend and they are. They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrongdoing on your part or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand. What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered and now it is time to move on.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow or learn. They bring you an experience of peace or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. Believe it, it is real. But only for a season.... </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons, things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.” </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">What is Reformative Training Center (RTC)? Franking speaking, I do not even know what does RTC stand for and anything about RTC before I wa</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">s sentenced to prison! Till the malay inmates told me stories about their past in RTC. For your information: </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Under the Young Offenders Section (YOS), the Court can order residents of Boys’ Home to serve the remaining of their term in Reformative Training Centre (RTC) as YOS, if they had breached the Home’s rules. Alternatively, the Court can order the boys to serve six months in RTC and then complete their term in the Boys’ Home. Also under this section, the Juvenile Court can order a young offender to serve a term in RTC as YOS for a period. </em></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><em>The RTC houses young male offenders between 14 - 21 years of age who have been sentenced by the Court to undergo reformative training. It is recognised that the key to success in the rehabilitation of the Reformative Trainees (RTs) is a highly individualised form of institutional training and treatment followed by a period of closed supervision after their discharge.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><em>The training consists of two phases. In the first phase, the residential phase, the trainees have to undergo counselling and compulsory academic and vocational training. This phase can last between 18 - 36 months, subject to the conduct and progress of the trainees. The programmes during this phase include counselling, education, vocational training and religious activities. These programmes are conducted based on the Housing Unit Management System, which ensures that each trainee has a Personal Supervisor who serves as a role model to the trainee under his charge. The Personal Supervisor looks after the trainee like a big brother or sister providing both guidance and leadership. The Personal Supervisor will also monitor the trainees’ welfare and behaviour closely and provide individualised attention to each trainee. </em></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><em>RTs who are keen to pursue academic education are transferred to </em></strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.nygr.org.sg/Pdf%20links/Kaki%20Bukit%20Info_H.pdf"><strong><em>Kaki Bukit Centre</em></strong></a><strong><em> (Prison School). The school provides a conducive learning environment for trainees to rehabilitate themselves through learning of skills and knowledge that will prepare them to re-integrate into the society. The school offers academic courses in BEST (Basic Education for Skills Training), WISE (Worker Improvement through Secondary Education), GCE “N”, “O” and “A” Levels and vocational training in electronics at NITEC (National Institute of Technical Education Certificate) Intermediate Level. The trainees in Prison School also undergo the Lifeskills Programme, Specialised Treatment Programme, Family Involvement Programme and Community Re-integration Programme.</em></strong></span><span style="color: #000000;"><br><br><strong><em>After the residential phase, the trainees will be released under supervision. At this stage, the aim is to provide the trainees with supervised aftercare so as to facilitate their re-integration into society. The trainees will be expected to work or study and perform community work while under the care and supervision of Prisons Aftercare Officers.</em></strong><br><br><strong><em>The Changi Women Prison/DRC houses all categories for female prisoners and drug addicts, including female Reformative Trainees. It is the only female institution in Singapore. Inmates are allowed to attend religious classes, education and vocation training. Some courses conducted include IT training, hairdressing and embroidery. There are also parenting workshops, group and individual counselling and a Play and Wait programme catered for the children of female inmates.</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Reformative training routine:</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong><em>AFTER the first month, reformative trainees settle into a daily routine that looks something like this: </em></strong></span><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">6am:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Day starts.</span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">Morning:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> After breakfast, they attend programmes tailored to their needs that include studies, art therapy and religious counselling.</span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">Noon to 1pm:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Lunch</span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">Afternoon:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Counselling, studies and yard time.</span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">Before 6pm:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Dinner</span></em></strong><br><br><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">9pm:</span><span style="color: #000000;"> Lights out</span></em></strong><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Since last October, reformative training has gone one step further in rigour: All newcomers now have to spend their first two weeks in solitude so that they can think about where they went wrong.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>This reflection is done in a cell about the size of two ping-pong tables. Trainees are let out only for morning foot drills in an indoor yard and interviews with psychologists and reform centre supervisors.</em></strong></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Up until the change, three or four new inmates would be housed in a cell from Day 1.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The impact of the change remains to be seen.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The two-week isolation period can be seen as a form of early conditioning for the regimented life that lies ahead for youths who fall afoul of the law.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The court considers reformative training for those between 14 and 21 after weighing factors that include the youth's character, past conduct, home environment and the circumstances under which the offence was committed.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>A youth who lacks self-discipline, has no regard for law and authority and is beyond his parents' control may be considered more suitable for reformative training than probation.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>A handful of wayward girls were on the reformative training programme at the Changi Women's Prison, while others were on it at the prison school in Kaki Bukit, where they were working towards their O- or A-level examinations.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The offences these trainees commit while undergoing reformative training have jumped 35 per cent in the past three years, estimated that new trainees were the culprits in six out of 10 offences at the RTC. Absolute figures were unavailable.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>While fights and assaults have taken place, the infringements are often minor. They include a persistent failure to keep their hands behind their backs while talking to officers and straying from a single file while on the move within the RTC.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>The two weeks in solitary confinement are expected to improve discipline.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>It seems to have worked for at least one RTC inmate. The 20-year-old final-year polytechnic student, who was sent there last December for smoking cannabis, found himself hunkering down to some serious thinking in his cell.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>He said: 'It took me a few days, but I literally sat in a corner and started thinking.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>'I felt all kinds of emotions, but I realised there was no one to be angry at but myself.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>'My conclusion so far: I have hurt my family by coming in here. I should keep on the right track and not do anything that only benefits myself.'</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>Although he is now determined to make the best of his time at the RTC, life there was tough in the first few days.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><em>'Outside, I had everything I wanted. Family, bed, air-conditioning. Here, it is just four walls,' he said.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Here’s another real life story from one of my readers <strong>(no editing had been done):</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">“Hi!</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Thanks for sharing your post. Prison life is not cool at all.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I was charged in the juvenile court just before I was 16, for possession of firecrackers, which was meant to be sold for extra money. A friend of mine released one and some one complained, the police came to do a spot check and I was taken in after they found a "thunderclap" in my possession.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">My story is nothing compared to what you and many of the inmates went through, but then for a 15 year old, the night in the police station lockup at Ang Mo Kio police station, was a night to remember for me. There's a small wooden plank for you to lie on, and there were 4 persons including me inside the lockup. I remembered it being a little stuffy in there and the cell was lighted by fluorescent tube. Like what happened in your story, the few of us shared about what caused us to end up being there. I can only remember one of thee suspect's story, he was actually looking through a pile of discarded items and actually picked up a plank when the police came, there was an attempted robbery in the nearby area and he was immediately a suspect. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I remember the police officer who tried to take my thumb print, an indian lady, who was very rough in handling me, i tensed up, she noticed then said, relax and stopped handing me like i'm a convict.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The i/o was a funny man, big, burly sized, speaks in english with a mixture of hokkien, took my statement, then said, "this one is nothing la, you at the most kenna ps for 1 year only"</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I still remembered the day when I was sent to the court, I shared the van with a man who was about 40 years old and handcuffed, poor guy was like tossing around when the van has sudden movements, hard braking and sprint from red lights, and I had to hold on to him to support him. I wasn't handcuffed as the police sees me as a harmless teenager? The interesting thing about the lockup inside the subordinate court is that it is air conditioned there was an indian national whose offence was not known as he's not able to communicate in english and a 22 year old chinese guy sharing the cell with me, the chinese guy's offence was attacking his mother's employer for the unfair treatment given to his mother the guy was a triad member. In the lockup, interestingly, every triad member are 1, like brothers in arms, scribbled in the walls of the holding room are words left by former triad members wishing their "brothers" good luck in getting out.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">That's basically what I remembered about my experience being held in the court holding area before the hearing and I remembered also, the courtroom, when I stepped in, there was a lot of eyes looking at me, the hearing was fast, less than 10 mins and I was whisked away back to the holding room. 24 years has passed by, and I've never shared this with anyone in this forum.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">I did end up at the boys home, or get the probation as recommended by the i/o, instead my parents was slapped with a fine for my offense, which was totally unexpected, my parents didn't have the money to pay and my dad went out to borrow the money to pay, even the i/o recommended a 2 years maximum probation for me.</span><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">After reading your post, make me recalled back how much i had hurt my parents and they still show care n concern till now even though I very rude to them and rather spend more time with friends than with them when i was still a teenager. Y am i so stubborn and so stupid that time. If I had not listened to my friend, all this will never happened. I so regret what I had did to my parents when i was young. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">By reading your story had influences me and because of you, I decided to share my past now, hopefully to prevent the young readers not to followed my footstep.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Thank you!” </span><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Although I myself had never been to RTC, I have learnt so much about the life in RTC through inmates, readers, and online. All I can say to the young brothers whom are reading my story now: “ Better don’t try anything funny that can end you up in RTC as life in RTC is much more tougher than in Prison!”</span><br><span style="color: #000000;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">We proceed back to our cell room after yard and we were being locked up in the our cell room till next day... It’s the day which we will have our ‘DAYROOM’ activity in the morning!</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>Chapter 4.4: The 'AWOL' inmate I known at ‘DAYROOM’</strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><strong>To be Continued </strong></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 4.4: The ‘AWOL’ inmate at ‘Dayroom’<br><br></span></strong>It was my first day of ‘DAYROOM’ activity. I am curious on how inmates spent their time throughout the 1 hour ‘DAYROOM’ activity. So I observed around, there is a ‘42’ inch plasma TV available for the inmates to watch recorded ‘old’ movies and documentaries. There are copies of chinese (Zhao Bao) and English (Straits Times) newspapers available for reading. Sadly to say that topics regarding politics, crimes, sex and women are all censored from the newspapers and the copies available are always 1 week back-dated. There are also board games and chess games available for the inmates. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">There were about 120 inmates in dayroom 3 sharing only a few copies of newspapers and a few sets of chess/ board games. So as expected, most of the inmates spend time gathering around and chatting with each other while others will just sat at corners quietly waiting for the time to pass. </span><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">For me, I approached to one of my roommates who sat quietly at one corner and spent my time chatting with him alone throughout the 1 hour activity:</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">He is 6xx8, a young malay guy who aged only about 20 years old. He is the only one of my roommates whom are always quiet and seldom communicate to any of us in our cell room. He was sentenced to jail due to ‘AWOL’ ( Absent Without Official Leave) from his national service.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Now, I believe most of the readers may be wondering and thought that military offences should sentence to detention barrack (DB) instead. But do you know that for AWOL case:</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">If a person is absent for less than 14 days, it is considered AWOL case and it deal with DB which has no criminal record, but if a person is absent for 28 days or more, the person is considered a DESERTER and the person will have to serve time in CPC and there will be a criminal record </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">To be frank, I thought 6xx8 is just another brainless young teen when I get to know the ‘surface’ of his AWOL case during our first day lockup in cell room 629. But after he revealed to me more details about this case, I feel pity and sorry for him instead!</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">6xx8 stay with his mum and his younger sister who are still studying primary school. He come from a broken poor family and was dropped of school during secondary school. He also had a elder brother who are also currently serving his sentences in jail. He do not have much friends nor relatives. His mum, who is the sole breadwinner of the family, was sentenced to jail due to certain reasons while he served his remaining 3 months of national service. Leaving only him with his younger sister, he thought he got no other choices but to AWOL from National Service in order to work to earn more money to support themselves.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">I actually have doubts in what he told me about his story in the beginning. But after I think again for a while, it may be the truth as I don’t think he is stupid enough to take the risk of AWOL, even at the last 3 months of his remaining national service. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>Through this encounter, my concern is that while there are a lot of helpdesks and assistances from organizations/ communities which can assist him in solving his problems, but why he do not seem to know and approach any of it? Why did he choose to AWOL while he already know the consequences of doing it? Is he trying to get himself into jail purposely just to run away from his problems?</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">There are people including me whom choose to be quiet and bear the burdens all by themselves. </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">Trust me, I have learn my lesson! Open up your mind. Don’t feel embarrass! Try to share and ask advices from those whom are near to you. You may find answers and somehow enlighten your burdens in a different way!</span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 5: Prison’s Food Menu</span></strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>To be continued</strong></span> </p></div>

              I think the hardest part of a prisoner is integration back into the society. Sometimes this can be a harsher punishment for them than being in prison.
              
              As for those rapists and molesters, I think those are rumors don't think it happens in Singapore prison nowadays perhaps in the past or in other countries...

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 5.2: Family Visit<br><br></span></strong><strong>&lt; Tuesday &gt;</strong> About a week of my lockup have passed in CPC. I missed my family members in every single minute, single day. But there were nothing much I can do, I can only wait to the day they come visit me. Although inmates are allowed to write letters to family members, but it will take more than a week to reach them.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Whenever there were announcements from intelcom informing inmates to get ready for their family visit, I will somehow feel sad and disappointed whenever my ID number not being called up. Even some of my roommates who came in the same day as me, had already been visited by their family members. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><em><strong>Didn’t they receive the notice about my lockup in CPC? Are they too busy to come or have already disappointed in me?</strong></em></span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Although I did told them not to come visit me as my sentences is short and it is too inconvenience for them to come from woodlands. I thought everything will be fine without seeing them only for weeks. But I was wrong, the longer I am being lockup in CPC, the more lonely I felt and the more I miss them. </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">Till halfway through my ‘Dayroom’ activity today, my ID number was being called up by the cookie suddenly. I responded and wondering what’s happening. “5613, standby for your family visit now!” said by the cookie. I was surprised, happy and a sudden amazing feeling which cannot be described in words. I had finally waited for this moment to come!</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">The front gate of Dayroom 3 opened in the next few minutes. I, the only inmate, walked out and join the other inmates from Dayroom 1 and Dayroom 2 whom also had their family visit. After headcount by a police officer, he escorted us to the ‘Visit rooms’ which are located at B2.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">The journey from B4 to B2 is about 20 minutes. We were escorted to a room which was near the entrance of the ‘Visit Rooms’. We were later been briefed by the prison officer about the procedures for our family visits before we are allowed to proceed further.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">I walked slowly to room 26 knowing that I have only 1 hour to communicate with my family members after the briefing. I told myself that I must treasure every single second and minute for this moment as Face-to-Face Family visit are only allowed once in every 2 weeks.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">I came to Room 26, my family members are sitting in front of me. There is a wall with a transparent glass panel separating us from body contacts. I walked into the room and close the door. Now the room are only left me with my family members. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><em>We seem to be very near to each other, yet we are very far from each other.</em></strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">The moment I sat down, I can’t control my tears dropping out from my eyes even I tried to control……………….</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">Dear readers, I apologize that I really do not know what words are best to describe that very moment and there is nothing interesting to share in my conversation with my family members. All I can say is we treasured every single minutes communicating through the intelcom. We cry together, yet chatting with each other happily. Although it’s only been a few days for us without seeing each other, to us it is like months. </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>A message to all readers: All mothers in the world are the same. She will always be the one support, care, concern and standby by your side no matter what you have done and how much you have changed. Most fathers are also the great ones although on the surface they may not show much love and care to you. Till the day when you found yourself in deep trouble, you will know they will be the only ones who will support you till the very end.</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">So, spend some time and think again. How many sms and phone calls you have made per day to your parents compared to your friends? How much time you spend a day communicating with your parents compared to your friends? How often you hang out with your parents and accompany them compared to your friends? </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">Please be filial and treat your parents well. Treasure what you have now or else you will regret for life! </span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information on family visit:</span></strong> </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">- Face-To-Face Visit is only allowed once in every 2 weeks and is 1 hour duration per hour. Only inmate’s parents/ siblings/ spouse are allow for Face-To-Face Visit.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">- The walking distance for the visitors from CPC entrance to the ‘Visit Room’ is about 15 minute’s journey. It is better for parents whom are unable to walk long distance to go for a Tele-visit instead. </span><br><span style="font-size: small;">For family members who are taking public transport to CPC, there are only 2 SBS buses (Bus No. 2 and 29) that will reach CPC.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">- CPC is located somewhere nearby Changi Village.</span><br><br><span style="font-size: small;">- <a rel="nofollow" href="http://prisonstories.webs.com/apps/forums/topics/show/5682401-family-visits">Click here for more information regarding Family Visits</a></span><br><br><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next Chapter: Books &amp; Magazines</span></strong></span><br><span style="font-size: small;"><strong>To Be Continued</strong></span> </p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 5.4: Loan sharks<br><br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial;">Loan sharks ( illegal moneylenders) which are also known as ‘Ah Long’ in Singapore. Involvement loan shark’s activities are one of the serious offence in Singapore. </span><span style="color: #000000;">First-time offenders found guilty of assisting in the carrying on of the business of an unlicensed moneylender, may be fined not less than $30,000/- and not more than $300,000/-, be imprisoned for a term not exceeding four years and shall also be liable to be punished with caning of not more than six strokes. Those who are acting on behalf of an unlicensed moneylender, commit or attempt to commit any acts of harassment shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years, fine not less than $5,000/- and not more than $50,000/- and shall also be liable to be caned not more than 6 strokes. </span></strong><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Police will to come down hard on any persons involved in loansharking activities, regardless of their age or involvement. The penalties for loansharking and loanshark-related offences are heavy, and loansharks who direct harassment or harassers who carry out acts resulting in damage to property (including splashing of paint and writings) or hurt to persons will also be caned.”</strong></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Inmates with loansharking criminal record will not be eligible for home detention program.</strong></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">So why are there still so many people getting involve in loan shark’s activities since it is a serious offence?</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">From what I know, most of the common causes are due to gambling. Most of the gamblers will approach the loan sharks for loans if they are not eligible for bank loans/ legal moneylenders. And due to the high interest rates charged from the loan sharks, they are unable to settle the payment on time. In the end, some of them claimed that they have no other choices but to assist the loan sharks in their activities to repay the outstanding loans.</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">ID: 4XX1, the inmate whom I have met while on the way back to my cell room after my family visit. He told me that he had came in to prison for a few times and this time he was sentenced to 1 year jail term due to involvement of loansharking activities. It is his first time involvement in loansharking activities and his job is only to withdrawn out the funds from ATM machines and then pass the funds to ‘someone’ whom he never known o</span><span style="color: #000000;">r met before. Last than 1 month of his involvement, he was ambushed and arrested by the police force.</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>I can still remember very clearly on what he have told me before we are separated. He said after his release he will never get involved with loan sharks again anymore. Although it is easy money to him, he would rather collect illegal bets like 4D/ TOTO/ Soccer as the risk is lower and sentence is lighter!</strong></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Well, I never expected this is what he told me. But one thing for sure on what he is trying to said is getting involve in loansharking activities is not worth it and is a 100% died end!</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">One of my roommates was sentenced to 6 months jail term due to involvement of loansharking activities as well. He is a young guy living in a normal decent lifestyle till one day his ‘best’ friend recommend him a ‘lobang’. All he need to do is just open bank accounts using his own name and give the ATM cards of his bank accounts to his ‘best’ friend. He will be paid $400 per card given. He was not informed that it was for loansharking activities, instead his friend told him that it was used for funds transfer on soccer betting. </span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">He opened 2 bank accounts as he trusted his ‘best’ friend and had earn $800 just by opening bank accounts. But soon he started to worry, he closed the bank accounts immediately. 1 month passed and he thought everything will be fine... But he is wrong, soon the police officers went to his flat directly, arrested him and he was being charged for involvement in loansharking activities . </span><br><span style="color: #000000;">Due to his greed and trusting his ‘best’ friend, he ended up himself in jail and had destroyed his entire future.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Advice: Never be greedy, be wise and be safe to check and know full details before you agreed to help anyone on any favours. Even working for a company without knowing company’s background may causes you trouble. Do you remember the recent news reported on newspapers and TV regarding about 150 students from different secondary schools were summoned to the police station for investigations due to their part-time job as distributing flyers for a company which turned up to be loan sharks?</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Here’s another recent article regarding the loan shark runner can be as young as secondary students: </span><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Teen "loanshark runner" arrested</span><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">04:09 PM Aug 27, 2011</span><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">SINGAPORE - Police have arrested a 15 year old for suspected involvement in loanshark harassment. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">He was spotted behaving suspiciously by officers on anti-loanshark operations in Serangoon North Ave 4 Friday.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Police said his mobile phone contained information believed to be related to loansharking activities.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">He's believed to have carried out loanshark harassment by splashing paint and scrawling loanshark graffiti on the walls of debtors' units in Indus Road and Boon Lay. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;">The suspect will be charged in court Sunday with loanshark harassment. CHANNEL NEWSASIA</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To all the young readers: Be wise and don’t let your greed destroy your life forever!</strong></span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;">Back to Dayroom 3 and while I was sitting outside my cell room waiting for the door to open, there was a malay inmate sitting opposite me waiting for his cell room’s door to open as well. We chat for awhile and I learnt that he was sentenced to jail due to involvement with loansharking activities as well. He worked as ‘commander’ for the loan sharks. ‘Commander’ is the one who throw paints on doors, writing on walls (Example: O$P$) and burning of borrower’s property. He was sentences to 1 year jail and 3 strokes of ‘<strong>Rattan’</strong>...</span><br><br><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Chapter 5.5: Rattan</span></strong></span><br><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To Be Continued</strong> </span></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Chapter 5.5: Rotan<br><br></span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><em>Dear Readers, I have not gone through ‘rotan’ stage so whatever I write here is based on hearsay!</em></span></strong><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">In the prison’s world, the most fearful moment for the inmates beside hanging, is ‘Rotan’ (In malay language) which means caning. I was being told that ‘rotan’ session is normally done on every Tuesday and Friday of the week. </span><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">A convicted male criminal who is between the ages of 18 and 50 and has been certified medically fit by a medical officer may be subjected to judicial caning, receiving a maximum of 24 strokes of the cane on any one occasion, irrespective of the total number of offences committed. If the offender is under 18 he may receive up to 10 strokes of the cane, but a lighter rattan cane will be used in this case. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">The convict will not be caned if he has been sentence to death. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Singaporean law allows caning to be ordered for over 30 offences, including hostage-taking, robbery, gang robbery with murder drug use, vandalism, and rioting. Caning is also a mandatory punishment for certain offences such as rape, drug trafficking, illegal, loansharking activities and for visiting foreigners who overstay their visa by more than 90 days, a measure designed to deter illegal immigrant workers.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">A rattan cane four feet (1.2 metres) long and half an inch (1.27 cm) thick is used for prison and judicial canings. The cane is soaked in water beforehand to make it heavier and more flexible. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">Caning is in practice always ordered in addition to a jail sentence and never as a punishment by itself. It is administered in an enclosed area in the prison, out of view of the public and other inmates. Those present are limited to the inmate, prison wardens, medical officers, the caning officer and sometimes high-ranking prison officials to witness the punishment.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">An inmate sentenced to caning receives no advance warning as to when he will be caned, and is notified only on the day his sentence is to be carried out. In the caning room, the inmate is ordered to strip naked and receives a medical examination by the prison doctor to check whether he is medically fit for caning, by measuring his blood pressure and other physical conditions. If the doctor gives the green light, the inmate then receives his caning, but if he is certified unfit for punishment, he is sent back to the court for his prison term to be increased instead. A prison official confirms with him the number of strokes he is to receive. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">The inmate is then led to the A-shaped frame (called a "caning trestle") and his wrists and ankles secured tightly to the frame by strong leather straps in such a way that he assumes a bent-over position on the frame at an angle of close to 90° at the hip, with his posterior protruding. Protective padding is placed on his lower back to protect the vulnerable kidney and lower spine area from any mis-strokes so that only his buttocks are exposed to the cane. The officer administering the caning takes up position beside the frame and delivers the number of strokes specified in the sentence, at intervals of 10 to 15 seconds. He is required to put his full force into each stroke. The strokes are administered all in one caning session, unless the medical officer certifies that the inmate cannot receive any more strokes because of his condition, in which case the rest of the strokes are converted to additional prison time. </span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">After the caning, the inmate is released from the frame and receives medical treatment. Antiseptic lotion is applied and the wounds left to heal. Where a large number of strokes is given, there is long-term scarring of the buttocks.</span><br><br><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was also being told by some of the inmates that the screams of the victims after each stroke of the whip makes one lose all appetite for food. The cane breaks skin and draws blood. Doctors are on hand to administer treatment and to assess if the individual can take more punishment...</span><br><br><br><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Next Chapter: Home Detention First Interview</span></strong></span><br><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><strong>To Be Continued</strong></span> </p></div>
