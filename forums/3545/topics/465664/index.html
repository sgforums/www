              <p><span class="yom-figure yom-fig-right" style="width: 630px;"><span class="legend">The unusual eerie quiet in Chinatown at 11.45pm just three nights before Chinese New Year</span></span></p>
              <p>It was really different then. The “sir” dropped off his maid at 8.30 
              in the morning and left her with  some loose change for snacks and 
              drinks. He headed for work and she stood in line, and an incredible one 
              (at over 100 meters long) had already formed by then. Lunch. He popped 
              by with tapau lunch for her and she was still nowhere near the top of 
              the queue. Come evening, at around 6pm, “sir” came back over, replaced 
              her in the queue (her number was up by then) and finally bought a few 
              packets of freshly grilled-on-the spot Lim Chee Guan bak kwa. This, was 
              the 80s in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The Chinatown streets were alive then. Photographers were jostling 
              for prime spots at the corner of the second floor hawker centre with 
              their 17mm wide angel lenses to capture the great “cross road of 
              Chinatown” picture (where Smith and  Trengganu street cross path). It 
              showed a sea of sardine-packed folks in their festive spirit jostling 
              and worming their way about in a street lit with bare tungsten bulbs and
               kerosene lamps from the street stalls. The firecracker ban had long 
              been implemented (in the 70s) but stall keepers will slip you a 
              contraband pack under that makeshift table if you just grovelled, smiled
               and asked for it.</p>
              <p>That packet of bak kwa would probably be pre-dinner snacks as your 
              family or parents cooked that all warming and significant Reunion 
              Dinner. The pork, chicken, fish, prawns, abalone, sea cucumber, fresh 
              greens, black moss fungus, mushrooms and dried oysters – all stuff that 
              is not only delicious but auspicious and meaningful – was the spread of 
              the evening. Fire crackers would occasionally break the silence of the 
              deserted streets. Having family and relatives bond over a table of food 
              and dressed in their homely finery (ie shorts, singlets, tee shirts and 
              some chaps would go topless) added to the “homecoming spirit”. Truth be 
              told, it wasn’t really about the food, it was more a reason to thank the
               Gods for another year of good health, family ties and luck that came 
              your way.</p>
              <p>Today, that Lim Chee Guan queue is still there, but not worth a 
              mention nor stunningly long enough that you cannot capture it all on 
              your not so wide angled smartphone camera. A good bak kwa is available 
              all over the island and I know our folks actually avoid Chinatown these 
              days as it is so predictable and festive in a touristy sort of way. A 
              reunion dinner at some fancy outlet with a fanciful menu at some luck 
              induced prices (they mostly end and/or start with the number 8 or 6), is
               the ritual these days. I know there are still some families who will 
              mess up their kitchens and whip this meal on their own, but they are 
              sadly, heading for extinction. Practicality rules- you don’t have to 
              shop, clean, cook, wash, serve and clean up after, if you can part with 
              $688 for the convenience at a restaurant. I think affluence is killing 
              culture and the true meaning of the reunion dinner.</p>
              <p>I was at Chinatown last night (just three nights before the Lunar New
               Year kicks in) to buy some last minute goodies and decorations. I 
              admit, it was something I have not done in decades ( I usually buy them 
              in the heartlands or off any busy street side shop). I had anticipated 
              the usual midnight human logjam there, but no, it was deserted by 
              11.45pm. Half the night market pasar malam stalls were closed and most 
              of the others were cleaning up. I breezed into a bak kwa shop, bought 
              two packs and left. No queues, no fuss. It felt like a post Chinese New 
              Year apocalypse.  I tried calling some of my lizard buddies (the type 
              that come alive at night and hunt for food) for supper and to chat about
               it but, most were already out of town. Chinese New Year at home with 
              friends and family in Singapore has lost its shine and meaning.</p>
              <p>I also miss the impromptu card game of gin rummy or black jacks when 
              we go visiting friends and family. This was the last time I recalled 
              that gambling actually bonded people. Now, they simply head to the 
              casinos and gamble with strangers or if they are underaged, they swipe 
              on the jackpot app oblivious to all and don’t even seem to appreciate 
              your ang pow. They will yank it off you as they bounce the monkey around
               on the super-amoled screen.</p>
              <p>Perhaps my buddies know something good about leaving the country this
               time of the year that I don’t. I’ll pry it off them next. 
              Meanwhile, we at Makanation would like to wish all our friends and yet 
              to be friends, a slithery smooth, healthy and wealthy year of the Snake 
              ahead. Gong xi fa cai.</p>
