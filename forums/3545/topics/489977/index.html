              <div id="post_message_1760365" style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">NCMP scheme a great replacement for flawed GRC system of elections</span></strong><br><br>The GRC system was created to promote PAP hegemony and despotism; if anybody still insists that GRC system can actually be justified by its original premise of actually "entrenches the presence of minority MPs in Parliament": then one is a fool since the following 2 examples prove this to be UNTRUE:<br><br><strong>Firstly</strong>, the law (Parliamentary Elections Act (Ch218), S24(2A)) obviously<strong> neglects ANY interest minority existence</strong> the moment GRC election results are announced as the statute does states:<em> "In respect of any group representation constituency, no writ shall be issued under subsection (1) for an election to fill any vacancy <strong>unless all the Members for that constituency</strong> have vacated their seats in Parliament."</em>: there is no need to replace a seat vacated by a minority candidate for any reason: suffice to say that just one candidate who need not be a minority need remain. A bait and switch trick by the PAP?<br><br><strong>Secondly</strong>, despite needlessly emphasizing minority race differences (through 16 GRCs occupying 76 seats in a 89 seat parliament (=85.4% of all seats post GE2015)), the 16 designated GRCs are only able to guarantee a meagre presence of 16/89= 18.0% minority representation in parliament: far less than the population census result (2014) showing 25.7% of the Singapore as belonging to minority ethnic group. The significant shortfall of 25.7%-18.0%= 7.7% (or equal to 7.7%*89=6.87=~ deficit of 7 minority MPs) remains glaring <strong>proof of how deficient/ inadequate the GRC system is at defending minority ethnic interest in parliament.</strong><br><br>These 2 examples are sufficient proof that GRC for the purpose of 'entrenching ethnic minority representation in parliament' is just political sleight of hand, a hoax or mere lip service. <br><br>More reasons to show that GRC system of elections promotes hegemony and autocracy (despotic rule) can be found at <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=80779">'How the GRC system of elections is a farce and promotes despotism and autocracy in Singapore'</a> with further criticisms at: <a style="color: #005688;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_Representation_Constituency#Criticisms_of_the_scheme">'[wiki] Group Representation Constituency: Criticisms of the scheme'</a>: gerrymandering, enshrining racism/ increasing minority social handicap due to society negatively viewing massive GRC system as a crutch minorities need to rely on/ undeservedly blaming minorities for <a style="color: #005688;" href="http://forums.asiaone.com/showthread.php?t=80779">disrupting 86.2% of the political election system</a> etc being some of the drawbacks of the GRC system of elections.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Given the multiple drawbacks of the GRC system of elections, what would be a good replacement with all the intentioned benefits of 'entrench minority parliamentary representation'?</span><br><br>One would be a return to the completely single seat method of elections but with caveats like Non-Constituency-Minority MP scheme and the Nominated Minority MP scheme (all permutations of currently in operation schemes) that would better 'entrench minority parliamentary representation' WITHOUT the attendant drawbacks as a/m.<br><br>Minority races will enjoy new found pride of being elected on their own virtues/ qualities by a multiracial electorate without having to just have token presence as part of a GRC team. Such a win would prove that minorities are directly acceptable as MPs representing a district, not just as part of a token contrivance to convince the world that Singapore is a peaceful multiracial society.<br><br>The lack of gerrymandering (a perennial problem with large district GRC elections) would also stabilise elections in Singapore, so that even independent minority race candidates will find before themselves a more level playing field unlike the current GRC electoral system which favours larger political parties so much so that everything else including minority racial interest become secondary. All political interest, minority race or otherwise, would under a solely SMC method of elections, have a fighting chance of being heard in parliament.<br><br>In line with the weight placed on ensuring Singapore's multi-racial constitution, there would be a minimum quota for minority MPs in parliament mirroring the current quota requirement for opposition MPs according to the current <a style="color: #005688;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-constituency_Member_of_Parliament">NCMP scheme</a>. There would thus be a MINIMUM quota of minority MPs in parliament (23 by current ethnic proportions is suggested).<br><br><strong>With the NCMP scheme entrenching minority race MP's representation in parliament and the opportunity to shine in public light, there will no longer be any more need for GRC system of elections and with that, lesser gerrymandering, better relationships between the electorate and their elected representatives, less party political bias/ interference during elections, more deserved social respect/dignity accrued to minority racial groups with verifiable competencies to win single seats on their own standing</strong> (instead of as a token presence where GRCs make up are concerned), more political transparency through the conduct of appropriate by-elections, lesser volatility of election results since ministers who are good MPs can always be expected to win back their seats.<br><br>(PS: should there be any complaint that capable minority race MPs are not given NCMP seats due to unfortunate circumstances (3 way contests etc) then some NMP seats can also be reserved from the total guaranteed quota of 23 and chosen by the respective key minority ethnic bodies).<br><br><strong>PAP's continued dependence on the GRC system of elections to further entrench its hegemonic (authoritarian) rule will only weaken itself and eventually bring Singapore to its knees.</strong><br>Status quo will bring failure to Singapore- one of titanic proportions: as the evil tentacles of the GRC system of elections spread wider and wider.<br>===============<br><br>The real reason for GRC system of elections was for PAP to cultivate more PAP yes men (as the mafia welcomes new entrants), always grateful to the PAP for lining the red carpet for their easy entry into parliament, through a political thievery such as gerrymandering, elimination of by-elections and other underhand methods:<br>
