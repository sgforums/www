              <p>ONLINE retailer of adult toys and cosplay costumes, wetwettoys was on 
              not the list of exhibitors at Sitex 2010, said a spokesperson for 
              electronics fair Sitex, held from Nov 25 to 28 at the Singapore Expo 
              Convention and Exhibition Centre.</p>
              <p>Girls in revealing costumes and bearing advertising boards 
              were seen distributing flyers and calendars with sexy images on both 
              sides of the Expo MRT station exit nearest the Singapore Expo, seemingly
               to catch the Sitex crowd.</p>
              <p>The spokesperson added that ?security personnel had, on 
              several occasions, approached the flyer distributors and informed them 
              that they were not permitted to distribute flyers or advertise within 
              Expo grounds".</p>
              <p>This clarification follows a complaint from a member of the 
              public who posted his grievances on citizen journalism Stomp on Nov 29.</p>
              <p>Stomper Jimmy had said, 'Is it appropriate for wetwettoys to
               advertise in public when there are so many youngsters visiting the 
              Sitex show at Expo?'</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>We have recently conducted two events. One was outside the EXPO MRT, the other was at Raffles Place. The first event was to promote our website as well as the World AIDS Day event that followed a few days after. </p>
              <p>We were rather disappointed  when all the news have been reflecting the negative comments while missing out the positive ones and other things that we are doing for the society, such as the World AIDS Day event we have conducted on 1st Dec 2010, at Raffles Place.  We even sighted some who appears to be Razor TV reporters during our event at Raffles Place, but sadly they had chosen not to include our event on the day in connection with what they had reported for the SITEX news.   I guess the media only want to promote negative news instead of the good ones that actually contributes to the society? </p>
              <p>We have placed efforts to ensure our facebook and twitter contains no adult contents, in the event that you found something which you feel is not suitable, do drop us a mail, and we will review accordingly. </p>
              <p>The calender distribution outside Expo MRT, was meant to be a promotion of our website as well as our event on 1st Dec 2010, World AIDS Day.</p>
              <p>At all times, no advertisement of any sorts were made about the adult toys that we sell on our website. In fact, the only visible merchandise that can be seen during our distribution of calenders were the Cosplay costumes.</p>
              <p>The Cosplay costumes worn by our models during the event were either one piece or two piece dress, meant to bring out the elegance of the models and of the clothings. Personal perception of the cute and elegant clothings may differ from person to person.</p>
              <p>if anyone is interested to know more about our World AIDS Day event, We can be found on FACEBOOK - [url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Wet-Wet-Toys/181529895190736]Wet Wet Toys | Facebook[/url] and TWITTER - [url=http://www.twitter.com/#!/wetwettoy]Twitter[/url]</p>
              <p>A summary of the World AIDS Day event is also available on youtube: [YOUTUBE][url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH3I_wqT0Vg]YouTube - WetWetToys.com WorldAIDSDay 2010 at Raffles Place[/url][/YOUTUBE]</p>
              <p>Below is a brief summary of our World AIDS Day event, which took place just a few days after our calender distribution outside Eunos MRT.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>[QUOTE]“Spread LOVE, not AIDS”</p>
              <p>WetWetToys.com is proud to be part of World Aids Day 2010.</p>
              <p>WetWetToys.com is an online retail shop selling adult sex toys and cosplay uniforms. </p>
              <p>In conjunction with World Aids Day, we would like to take this opportunity to promote safe sex. </p>
              <p>Since our customers and target audience are mainly adults, the best place to reach out to working adults would be Raffles Square.</p>
              <p>On 1st December 2010, we hired models dressed in our cosplay uniforms to distributed free condoms to the public </p>
              <p>during lunch hours, hoping to raise public awareness on safe sex.</p>
              <p>We also had Flashmobs, wearing visually attracting posters which sends a strong message to the public.</p>
              <p>Most passer-bys were spontaneous to reach out and collect the condoms when they were informed that it was World </p>
              <p>Aids Day.</p>
              <p>We hope everyone will do their part in practicing safe sex, spread LOVE, not AIDS.[/QUOTE]</p>
