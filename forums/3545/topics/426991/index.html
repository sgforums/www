              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So boring, it is always the same topic
              again and again. I guess I should change to a more relevant topic one
              day. But like a teacher on a scholarship, when MOE asked him to teach Biology when
              Maths is his favourite subject, can he say no? He gets paid. Whether
              a miserable salary, or one day's life. Depending on who his employer
              is.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So here we go again, more sex
              education.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I recall in another post I mentioned
              about some nickname called “Erector” which my secondary school
              classmate gave me long long ago. Well, that was merely the tip of the
              iceberg as a teenager going through puberty. After that episode,
              surely the problems either went away, or it aggravated if no right
              counsellor or teacher appeared.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">And so, in 1996 iirc in Sec 3, I got my
              first internet connection. Back then, I was merely on a 33.6kbps
              dialup connection, talk about the internet becoming faster! Even my
              3mbps ADSL now is considered slow to download pornography from
              earthquake-devasted japanese servers these days.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Where was I? Getting old le.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Oh. Hence yes, in 1996, where I knew no
              such thing as Google, I recall I went to some search engine which I
              totally cannot remember what's the name, and I typed in the noun
              “orgasm”. I heard a lot of it in secondary school, all the other
              boys were talking about it, and surely the Internet could teach me
              how to get a good one. And true enough, it did not only get me a good
              orgasm, it brought me a visual aid, one image of a Blonde woman
              sitting nude on her porch at her American home and for the first time
              in my life I saw a nude woman.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Within a few months later, I discovered
              how a vagina looks like, thanks to the 33.6kbps dialup connection
              once again. I cannot remember what happened during NS, if I vaguely
              remember, I suddenly lost interest in women and became engrossed in
              something more exciting... called Pokemon. I was playing Pokemon
              Blue/Red/Yellow/Green in camp and listening to Sun Yanzi's first
              albums, and sex and what naught meant nothing to me. Sure I had the
              usual libido, wanking in the toilets and bedrooms when nobody
              noticed.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then, come University, when everybody
              were getting girlfriends and staying in hostels where the internet
              connection was super fast. I had my first exposure to high speed
              downloads and access to pornography which amazed me. The Japanese
              were so beautiful! For one, I was straight. My other guy classmates
              were surfing some porn on Old Granny Pussies Wet and Slimy, and
              asking me to check those out; my female project mates were openly
              watching lesbian anime.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Out of a sudden, all the guys surfing
              porn together with me got married straight after graduation, and
              those female project mates who were watching lesbian anime, started
              getting ang moh boyfriends.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Yeah, and there was I, still using
              porn. Lagging behind the rest in the rat and pussy chase. Sorry for
              the crude language.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Out of seemingly nowhere, I recalled
              amongst all the guy friends I had, there was this joker who was a
              scholar like I was.. I was.. no longer.. ha. And he pointed out that
              porn is EVIL. Really really evil. Because it distorts the perception
              a guy has towards the female gender.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I hated that guy. Because he was good
              looking, rich, and had the most beautiful and submissive girlfriend.
              But then I thought, maybe he WAS right. My perception of women was
              degrading, offensive, and I had no idea how porn had screwed up my
              life and deprived me of a proper relationship.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Out of nowhere, I got religious, and
              then after checking out several different books, funny that every
              religion (book or no book) all suggests that sex should be kept
              indoors, not in front of the camera.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now I am not suggesting that porn is
              Evil, like my goodie-two-shoe buddy did. I am just stating in no
              certain fashion that these are just actors and actresses, and they
              come together in front of the production site, the director says
              action, and the women starts to moan. The guy puts on the condom,
              sticks the rod into her, she pretends as if she is enjoying it, and
              maybe she really is, and five minutes later the director says cut in
              japanese and the guy doesn't cut off his dick, he just takes it out
              and prepares for the next scene.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Then from missionary position to
              doggie, from doggie to sixty-nine, one scene after one scene, one NG
              after one NG. Have you ever noticed how many guys they normally need
              on one set?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I did. Once, I counted at least 14.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Two cameramen. Director. Scriptwriter.
              Three naked males. The bloke responsible for the makeup. The bloke
              responsible for the pantry and water. The bloke holding the lighting.
              The bloke holding the reflectors. And so on. And only one woman. At
              best, two sometimes for a single warehouse shot.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Orgy anybody?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Camera, action, roll!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Still, it really does not matter isn't
              it? Just this Saturday, I went to a hotel, and called a local pizza
              hut service. I told them my hotel name, and the guy over the phone I
              want my pizza. The guy said ok, 45 minutes, and told me $250 for two
              shots. I said ok, then I waited for 2 hours and still my pizza did
              not come. Had to go downstairs to the Hotel counter and ask the lady
              to extend for another hour, then finally when I did consider logging
              out from the Hotel, the door bell rang. I realised I was in for
              trouble when through the peeping hole I saw two caucasian women, one
              short and plump, one tall and skinny.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The two caucasians said, didn't you
              order two? I said, yeah but I meant one chinese pizza with two shots,
              not two hawaiian one each!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Spare you the details.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">They took $50 each from me and left. I
              ate Japanese instant porn straight out from the microwave instead.</p>
