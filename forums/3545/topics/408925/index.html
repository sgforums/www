              <p>By 
              																				Liew Hanqing</p>
              <p>HE had recently celebrated his birthday and had proposed to his 
              girlfriend on the very same day. But just over a week later, Mr John 
              Patrick Wee, 50, the third of late Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin's four 
              children, died of a heart attack in his sleep while on a work trip in 
              Thailand.</p>
              <p>Mr Wee, the deputy group CEO of the True Group, which 
              comprises fitness and wellness businesses across Asia, died in the wee 
              hours of Saturday morning in Bangkok, shortly after returning from a day
               of golf in Pattaya.</p>
              <p>He was rushed to hospital after earlier complaining of 
              discomfort in his chest, but died in hospital later in his sleep.</p>
              <p>His older brother, Mr Laurence Wee, 53, told The Straits 
              Times at the wake on Monday that his brother had been given a clean bill
               of health by his doctor just weeks before he left for Thailand. 'We 
              didn't expect this would happen,' he said.</p>
              <p>He added that the family had celebrated his brother's 
              birthday at a Chinese restaurant on Aug 12, just after he had proposed 
              to his girlfriend, Ms Juliana Jauw, earlier that day. Ms Jauw, an 
              undergraduate, was distraught but holding up, Mr Wee said.</p>
              <p>In a statement, Ms Jauw, 22, said she was deeply saddened by
               her fiance's sudden death. 'We were both excited to start planning for 
              our wedding. John was a loving man and adored children. He would have 
              made a wonderful husband and a loving father,' she said.</p>
