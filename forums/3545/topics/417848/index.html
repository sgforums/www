              <p>A SALES manager who took about 200 upskirt videos of unsuspecting women
               with a camera pen was sentenced to nine months' jail on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Soo Ee Hock, 35, intends to appeal and bail of $20,000 was 
              offered.</p>
              <p>The married man had pleaded guilty two weeks ago, to 12 of 
              201 counts of intruding into the privacy of women between November 2008 
              and March last year.</p>
              <p>He would clip the pen with a built-in video camera onto his 
              laptop bag and place it under the skirt of the unknown female standing 
              in front of him on an escalator, to capture an upskirt digital video 
              recording of her thighs and underwear.</p>
              <p>He was arrested at Junction 8 Bishan Shopping Centre on July
               7, 2009.</p>
              <p>District Judge Lee Poh Choo said Soo knew full well what he 
              was doing and was a serial offender. She said he intended to keep those 
              images for a long time as he had burnt them onto a CD, and 'that shows 
              the extent of his perverted mind'.</p>
              <p>Soo could have been jailed for up to one year and/or fined 
              on each charge.</p>

              <h2 class="art-PostHeader">Chairman of Punggol Park CCMC jailed for 
              upskirt videos</h2>
              <p>December 15th, 2010 - Temasek Review</p>
              <p>A  former Chairman of the Ponggol Park Community Club Management 
              Committee was sentenced to 9 months’ jail on Tuesday for taking upskirt 
              videos of unsuspecting women with a camera pen.</p>
              <p>35 year-old Danny Soo Ee Hock had pleaded guilty two weeks ago to 12 
              charges of intruding into the privacy of women between November 2008 and
               March last year, with another 189 similar charges taken into 
              consideration.</p>
              <p>The Court heard that he would clip a camera pen onto his laptop bag 
              and place it under the skirt of the unsuspecting female standing in 
              front of him on an escalator, to capture an upskirt digital video 
              recording of her thighs and underwear.</p>
              <p>He was arrested at Junction 8 Bishan Shopping Centre on July 7, 2009.</p>
              <p>District Judge Lee Poh Choo said Soo knew full well what he was doing
               and was a serial offender. She said he intended to keep those images 
              for a long time as he had burnt them onto a CD, and ‘that shows the 
              extent of his perverted mind’.</p>
              <p>A ccording to an article on PA’s website (<em>which had been removed</em>),
               Soo was described as energetic and enterprising with commitment and 
              passion to ‘tackle countless challenges in spearheading innovative 
              programmes for youths’. It revealed that Soo started out as a member of 
              the Youth Executive Committee (YEC) before gradually rising to become 
              the “youngest” Chairman of the Punggol Park Community Club Management 
              Committees (CCMC) at the age of 34.</p>
              <p>He was awarded the Public Service Medal during the National Day 
              Awards this year which was reported in the Straits Times and yet for 
              some strange reasons, the Straits Times deliberately omitted his 
              grassroots actvities and “achievements”.</p>
              <p>Soo is appealing and a bail of $20,000 was offered.</p>

              <p>that said, people shoinf good charateristics does not mena they are good people. its easy to show good in front of people. becasue in this world everyone treasure face value alot.</p>
              <p>see lah like that can also be chairman. then better make him chairman sit on chair forever, if you no let him sit on chair he will stand elsewhere and do funny things. silly can write on CD somemore. definitely not a discret time of person and not IT savvy.</p>

              <h2>Chairman of Punggol Park CCMC jailed for upskirt
              videos</h2>
              <p>December 15th, 2010 - Temasek Review</p>
              <p>A former Chairman of the Ponggol Park Community Club Management
              Committee was sentenced to 9 months’ jail on Tuesday for taking
              upskirt videos of unsuspecting women with a camera pen.</p>
              <p>35 year-old Danny Soo Ee Hock had pleaded guilty two weeks ago
              to 12 charges of intruding into the privacy of women between
              November 2008 and March last year, with another 189 similar charges
              taken into consideration.</p>
              <p>The Court heard that he would clip a camera pen onto his
              laptop bag and place it under the skirt of the unsuspecting female
              standing in front of him on an escalator, to capture an upskirt
              digital video recording of her thighs and underwear.</p>
              <p>He was arrested at Junction 8 Bishan Shopping Centre on July 7,
              2009.</p>
              <p>District Judge Lee Poh Choo said Soo knew full well what he was
              doing and was a serial offender. She said he intended to keep those
              images for a long time as he had burnt them onto a CD, and ‘that
              shows the extent of his perverted mind’.</p>
              <p>A ccording to an article on PA’s website (<em>which had been
              removed</em>), Soo was described as energetic and enterprising with
              commitment and passion to ‘tackle countless challenges in
              spearheading innovative programmes for youths’. It revealed that
              Soo started out as a member of the Youth Executive Committee (YEC)
              before gradually rising to become the “youngest” Chairman of the
              Punggol Park Community Club Management Committees (CCMC) at the age
              of 34.</p>
              <p>He was awarded the Public Service Medal during the National Day
              Awards this year which was reported in the Straits Times and yet
              for some strange reasons, the Straits Times deliberately omitted
              his grassroots actvities and “achievements”.</p>
              <p>Soo is appealing and a bail of $20,000 was offered.</p>

              <p>A lot of times, MP or advisors work with the Constituency Manager to evaluate the well being of the GRL. Sometimes the MP/Advisor will listen to the CM judgement or people around him. Sometime cannot be held.....those rub shoulder with the MP sure have better chance to say what they like. So if you are not in CCC level  or high flyer MP will not know your hardwork.   So CM play an important role here....He can make you die or alive.</p>
              <p>However the MP/Constituency Mgr may not notice those "HERO" behind the scene.</p>
              <p>To survive rub shoulder, hard work doesnt pay off at times. (Depend on individual constituency culture)</p>
              <p>When you are Gang Hoe or active, sure the non active one will pin you down, bad mouth you in front of the MP or Chairman</p>
              <p>This is politics.</p>

              <p>Notice the trend here is that opposition start digging out GrassRoot Leaders bad behaviours especially the PBM or anyone that is high flyer. Just like the PAP like to dig people's past before.</p>
              <p>PAP has always uses the Peoples Association (Grassroot) network to help them WALK about during election campaign. Confusing the residents into believing that the grassroot is PAP. GRL pls dun be kuku, you can opt not to walk with the PAP.  Unless you wanna rub shoulders.</p>
              <p>A respected GRL is not one that rub shoulders, but one who can do work and bold enough to voice concerns on behalf of the residents in your estate and work for the well being of the estate.   </p>
