              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WELLINGTON, NEW 
              ZEALAND: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong says Singapore should brace for 
              slower growth ahead, even as a technical recession may be avoided for 
              now.<br><br>Speaking at the end of his official visit to New Zealand on 
              Tuesday, Mr Lee told reporters that the GDP numbers for the second 
              quarter of this year "may look a little better than the first 
              estimates". <br><br>"So you might technically avoid a technical recession," he said. <br><br>Singapore's
               economy shrank 0.7 per cent in the April-June quarter from the first 
              quarter, based on advance estimates from the Ministry of Trade and 
              Industry (MTI). And, economists expect the government to report another 
              decline in GDP for the July-September quarter, pushing the country into a
               recession.<br><br>But Mr Lee indicated that the final Q2 numbers may be
               revised upwards, and if they turn out to be positive, a technical 
              recession will not happen in the third quarter. <br><br>Advance estimates for the third quarter will be released by MTI on Friday.<br><br>However Mr Lee added a technical recession later may be unavoidable with the prospect of slower growth.<br><br>Mr
               Lee warned that slow growth also means that Singapore will not have a 
              lot of margin for error. Hence, the need to keep the economy strong.<br><br>"When
               you are going for slower growth, and we are expecting slower growth, 
              then the chances of you dipping below zero from time to time will be 
              much greater," said Mr Lee.<br><br>He went on to say: "If you are going 
              to make five, six per cent (growth), when you slow down, you slow down 
              to three per cent, it's okay. If you're going to make one, two per cent 
              (growth), (when) you slow down, you slow down to zero or minus one, and I
               think psychologically that is a big difference. <br><br>"I think that's
               another reason why we must keep our economy strong, because there's a 
              very big impact on the mood of the people on the confidence of the 
              population and of investors when they see an economy which is able to 
              continue to make progress steadily."<br><br>On calls by some 
              Singaporeans for the country to focus less on material aspirations, Mr 
              Lee said Singapore needs to find the right balance between growth, 
              social considerations and quality of life.<br><br>He said there also needs to be dynamism and buzz so that there will be opportunities for Singaporeans. <br><br>One key challenge, Mr Lee said, is to raise productivity to ensure a steady rate of growth.<br><br>"I think we have to work very hard in upgrading productivity, because that's the key for the long term," he said. <br> <br>"In
               the short term, we can't just shut off the workers we need because if 
              you did, the companies will not be able to cope and that's not going to 
              do any good to productivity either.<br><br>"So, you have to find the 
              right balance to bring in the numbers that you need, subject to right 
              controls and in a sustainable way, and at the same time put a lot of 
              emphasis on companies upgrading themselves."<br><br>Mr Lee added: "I 
              think in Singapore many of the companies are finding it difficult 
              finding the workers that they need. They can see the business 
              opportunities there, they want to take the contracts and the orders, 
              they want to start up the new outlets, they can't find the workers. <br><br>"So,
               does that mean that productivity will go up automatically? No. But it 
              means that there's pressure on them to make the most of workers that 
              they have and to train the workers with the help from all the government
               schemes, so that productivity will go up.<br><br>"There is no magic 
              solution! You can't just turn on the tap and the hot water comes out. 
              You have to work hard at it. There'll be ups and downs and there'll be 
              rough spots, and we are going to get used to not so fast growth as 
              before, but we have to work to achieve that, because you can't just lie 
              back and say, 'I'm working too hard, I have to slow down'.<br><br>"We have to maintain the balance but we have to make the effort."<br><br>Mr
               Lee is in New Zealand from 6-9 October for an official visit. Earlier 
              Tuesday, he visited the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) 
              Formidable-class frigate RSS Stalwart in Wellington. <br><br>During the 
              ship visit hosted by Chief of Navy Rear-Admiral Ng Chee Peng, Mr Lee was
               accompanied by New Zealand's Minister of Defence Dr Jonathan Coleman 
              and other senior officials from the two countries. <br><br>Personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force and Singaporeans living in Wellington were also present. <br><br>The
               delegates were brought on a tour of the ship and briefed on the 
              frigate's capabilities. Mr Lee and Dr Coleman also interacted with the 
              crew of RSS Stalwart.<br><br>RSS Stalwart is making a port call at 
              Queen's Wharf in Wellington before its participation in Exercise Lion 
              Zeal with the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) in Auckland. <br><br>The RSN
               and RNZN interact regularly through professional exchanges and visits, 
              cross-attendance of professional courses and multilateral exercises 
              under the ambit of the Five Power Defence Arrangements and the Western 
              Pacific Naval Symposium.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee has since left New Zealand for Melbourne for the start of his official visit to Australia.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

Hmmm....if the swimming trunk doesn't fit you then you jump into the water or sea naked maybe its lighter and you can float instead of swimming...haha...just joking here. Hmmm...this reminded me that Singapore is an island surrounded by water. Being a native islander, you should learn how to float on water so you wouldn't be drowning so soon and you can flee to the nearest shore when Singapore sink when the sea level rises in the future.

              Enough of jestering now. I think we have to look at it seriously too.
              
              PM Lee said:
              â€œOn calls by some Singaporeans for the country to focus less on material aspirations, Mr Lee said Singapore needs to find the right balance between growth, social considerations and quality of life.â€�
              
              Along the way for progress, we have lost that noble quality. It was different from now and I do not see it anymore as we move on toward the future. As a matter of fact, I feel we are not able to bring that noble quality like in the past. Now, I think most Singaporeans are lost and they do not really know what direction Singapore is going.
              
              PM Lee:
              â€œOne key challenge, Mr Lee said, is to raise productivity to ensure a steady rate of growth.
              â€œI think we have to work very hard in upgrading productivity, because thatâ€™s the key for the long term,â€� he said. â€œIn the short term, we canâ€™t just shut off the workers we need because if you did, the companies will not be able to cope and thatâ€™s not going to do any good to productivity either.â€�
              
              We used to have Work Improvement Team campaign in the past to promote productivity. It has disappeared in most company. Productuctivity used to be Quantity + Quality Control = Good Result. Now it is all very messy, mostly base on dollars and cents; and Quantity rather than Qualityâ€¦.and that is very bad.
              
              PM Lee:
              â€œI think in Singapore many of the companies are finding it difficult finding the workers that they need. They can see the business opportunities there, they want to take the contracts and the orders, they want to start up the new outlets, they canâ€™t find the workersâ€�.
              
              In the past, most employers used to be very understanding and compassionate. When they know you are the bread winner of the family, they will give you a good stable income. In the past, we used to have a minimum basic salary of $250 but nowâ€¦.none. I think it is time to have a basic salary policy enforce again. I think the minimum basic salary for Singapore now should be $1500.
              
              PM said:
              â€œSo, does that mean that productivity will go up automatically? No. But it means that thereâ€™s pressure on them to make the most of workers that they have and to train the workers with the help from all the government schemes, so that productivity will go up.â€�
              
              I think most of the Bosses must go through â€œThe Undercover Bossâ€� programmes and see for themselves what problems their workers face daily at work and take care of their workerâ€™s welfare. About Skill upgrading, I have many Skill Development Certificate from WDA, but most companies in Singapore does not really recognise it and my salary still remain below $1500.
              
              PM said:
              â€œThere is no magic solution! You canâ€™t just turn on the tap and the hot water comes out. You have to work hard at it. Thereâ€™ll be ups and downs and thereâ€™ll be rough spots, and we are going to get used to not so fast growth as before, but we have to work to achieve that, because you canâ€™t just lie back and say, â€˜Iâ€™m working too hard, I have to slow downâ€™.
              
              Yes, I agree. It is time for the younger generation of Singapore to make that difference now. How about the older or mature workers who had contributed much to Singapore economy and went through many recessions with Singapore many times, what do they gain from all this and when they retire? Slowing down does not indicates that we are just lie back, but we give opportunities to the young generation Singaporeans to take over the key roles and then we retireâ€¦.just like when PM Lee took over MM Goh Chok Tong.
              
              Most old Singaporeans do not have enough cash money to retire and die happy later.
              
              PM Lee said:
              â€œWe have to maintain the balance but we have to make the effort.â€�
              
              We make the effort and maintain balance and then we stop and rest, when we are exhausted, then continue our journey again after we have recover from our exhaustion.

              'Shock therapy' economist urges NWC to call for more wage increases
              By Jeanette Tan | Yahoo! Newsroom â€“ Thu, Oct 25, 2012
                      
              An economist who earlier called for a drastic hike in salaries of low-income workers in Singapore has urged the countryâ€™s wage council to continue batting for quantitative increases in the workersâ€™ monthly pay for the next two years.
                      
              Speaking on Thursday morning before an audience of 200 people at the annual Singapore Economic Policy Forum, former National Wages Council (NWC) chairperson and Nanyang Technological University economics professor Lim Chong Yah commended the tripartite bodyâ€™s recommendation that workers getting below $1,000 a month get a $50-hike in their salaries.
                      
              â€œThat (the $50 NWC increment) is a very good move, and that might reduce the number of people having very, very low income,â€� he told reporters at the sidelines of the forum. â€œWe donâ€™t need big changes, we just need to have recommendations to increase the wages of the lowest income group in Singapore systematically over the next few years.â€�
                      
              He also said that should monthly wages remain low, say below $1,000, a compulsory minimum wage should be implemented to pull Singapore's lowest salaries up.
                      
              In his set of proposals he titled â€œShock Therapy IIâ€�, Lim also again pressed for a three-year freeze on the countryâ€™s highest salaries.
                      
              Earlier this year, Limâ€™s proposed â€œshock therapyâ€� to address the countryâ€™s widening income gap. He had urged the raising of salaries of workers earning less than $1,500 by 50 per cent over three years while imposing a moratorium on the countryâ€™s highest wages during the same time.
                      
              On Thursday, he said his latest proposals would work better than increasing government transfers and allowing salaries to rise to what he calls â€œexorbitant, unconscionableâ€� levels,  which he believes would make Singaporeâ€™s economy uncompetitive.
                      
              â€œIf we all expect the government to do this, to do that, so much transfers to help the poor, needy and low-income groups, where does the government get the money? Through taxes. (But) you see if you raise taxes too high, you affect our competitiveness,â€� he said, citing reasons such as having a small labour market, a lack of natural resources and the increased risk of inflation arising from overcrowding.
                      
              As for the moratorium, Lim said it would be imposed more as a psychological measure to prevent all of the wages at the highest echelons of the private sector from rising together. 
                      
              â€œIf the top level wages go up, they pull people linked to them up and in the long run, we become an uncompetitive economy,â€� he added. 
                      
              Might the proverbial golden goose (of our local top talent) flee the country in that scenario? Lim doubts so. 
                      
              â€œThere is no fear they will emigrate or run away just because there is a freeze or kind of moratorium... I doubt very much. But if the alternative is to have higher and higher taxes, that might frighten them away,â€� he said.
                      
              To make this plan happen without causing excessive inflation, Lim said it has to be â€œproperly handled, carefully implemented and spread over three yearsâ€�. 
                      
              He added that his aim was to ensure that companies take part in active restructuring, using better technology and mechanisation and reducing their dependence on cheap foreign labour, in particular manual labour, failing which profit margins could decline.
                      
              â€œI hope that the main impact will be on restructuring and another impact, probably this is not so desirable, on the margin of profit... profit levels in some cases will be lower,â€� he said.
                      
              Explaining why he now included the provision of a $1,000 minimum wage scheme in his proposal, Lim said it should be used as a last resort.
                      
              â€œLet us work on the policy of raising the pay... of the lowest income groups, the tail end, first,â€� he said. 
                      
              Why $1,000? Lim says it appears to be a good figure, coming in at about a third of the minimum wage in neighbouring Malaysia, and a quarter of that in Australia. 
                      
              â€œBesides that, (that amount) has been used by NTUC, by NWC as a benchmark, below which they say that wages should go up by at least $50, so itâ€™s a good, nice figure and I think thatâ€™s about right, the $1,000 figure,â€� he said, qualifying that should inflationary pressures become too high, the figure may have to be adjusted further in the future.

              Yes..I agree. My kampung was near Paya Lebar Airport it was called Kampung Ladang. Most of my friends back then in the 60s and early 70s were Chinese and I used to speak Hokkien to them. Where was your Kampung Clive?
