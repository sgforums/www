              <p><strong>NHB to improve valuation processes after museum donation controversy</strong><br> <span class="update">By Jeremy Koh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 18 April 2010 1833 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The National Heritage Board (NHB) will improve its 
              valuation processes, in the wake of the controversy over the value of a 
              donation to the Peranakan Museum.
              <br> <br> At the heart of the matter is the actual worth of a high-profile 
              donation to the Peranakan Musuem originally valued at S$15 million.
              <br> <br> The 300 pieces of Straits Chinese silverware and porcelain were a major 
              gift to the museum in 2008, and earned the donors a prestigious award as
               well as significant tax exemptions.
              <br> <br> But subsequent valuations went as low as under S$2 million.
              <br> <br> As the saga unfolded, seven of the nine members of the Asian 
              Civilisations Museum board, including its chairman, resigned.
              <br> <br> When asked to comment on their departure, Acting Minister for 
              Information, Communications and the Arts, Lui Tuck Yew said he would 
              like their reasons to remain personal and confidential, unless the seven
               ex-members choose to reveal those reasons.
              <br> <br> The couple who donated the items out of goodwill, Mr and Mrs Tan Eng 
              Sian, were also identified and dragged into the situation.
              <br> <br> "They did it out of goodwill, they did it out of altruistic reasons, and
               I'm most regretful our donor had to be involved in all this. I'm sorry 
              it has caused them so much distress," he said.
              <br> <br> Mr Lui said the valuation controversy is an isolated and rare incident. 
              He hopes the saga will not affect the long-term relationship between 
              donors and museums.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Tan have asked for their donation to be returned 
              following the controversy. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Cultural gifts: Time for a proper process</h1>
              <p>A MAJOR gift to the Peranakan Museum comes once in a lifetime. By 
              inappropriate handling, the museum has deprived Singaporeans of a major 
              Peranakan antique collection ('Museum returns 'major gift' to donors'; 
              last Wednesday).</p>
              <p>Surely, this must not happen again.</p>
              <p>Australia has a government-funded cultural gifts programme 
              which has a well-considered process that ensures a transparent and 
              thriving relationship between donors and recipient institutions.</p>
              <p>Apart from the usual experts, the programme's vetting 
              committee comprises a tax department official. European countries and 
              the United States have similarly well-considered programmes.</p>
              <p>Under the programme, the donors can claim a tax deduction 
              for their gifts. Valuers must be vetted and approved by the committee 
              and tax deductions are allowed only upon the committee's approval. 
              Recipient bodies must obtain the committee's approval for their 
              programmes which are reviewed every five years.</p>
              <p>Valuation is a stringent but fair process decided jointly by
               the committee, the approved valuers and the donor.</p>
              <p>The Australian programme preserves the cordial relationship 
              between the recipient museum and the donor.</p>
              <p>Museums today cannot afford to disconcert serious collectors
               like Mr and Mrs Tan Eng Sian who donated the Peranakan collection, 
              which the museum returned. Such collectors can benefit museums through 
              regular loans, generous gifts and eventual bequests if the museums treat
               them appropriately.</p>
              <p>For such benefactors, the significance of the tax deduction 
              is its recognition of the value of their donation, not the deduction 
              itself. Antiques and art are now so expensive that most museums cannot 
              afford to buy them any more. Corporate governance has so severely 
              constrained government and corporate citizens that it is hard to justify
               buying art and antiques.</p>
              <p>Most museums acquire their collections by cash donations or 
              in kind from serious collectors.</p>
              <p>The tax deduction is only an incentive. The low tax rate in 
              Singapore reduces this incentive, hence the need to make it 200per cent 
              tax deductible. It is not a tax rebate.</p>
              <p>That the Peranakan Museum - a national institution - would 
              inconvenience a potential patron and benefactor by accepting his gift 
              based on a valuation of $15 million by a valuer appointed by the museum,
               and then proceed to change that valuation through two subsequent lower 
              valuations without due process is beyond me.</p>
              <p>The manner in which it was done showed poor governance and 
              was a disastrous public relations exercise.</p>
              <p>It is time we had a proper programme for cultural gifts.</p>
