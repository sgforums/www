              <p>MONDAY'S report ('Animal smuggling on the rise') reveals the scale of 
              this illegal trade and it is evident that animal smugglers are making a 
              mint, and think nothing of the risks involved.</p>
              <p>Singapore's location and accessibility, together with high 
              overall consumer demand, make it a lucrative centre for transhipment or 
              local sales.</p>
              <p>One vital factor to bear in mind is the cost to the animals 
              themselves. Birds packed tightly into narrow cylinders is just but one 
              example, with many dying during the journey.</p>
              <p>It is a cruel trade that will be difficult to tackle unless 
              consumers everywhere refrain from hankering after a cheap deal or from 
              desiring to own a living being because of its novel appeal.</p>
              <p>The authorities must monitor animal smuggling vigorously and impose deterrent sentences.</p>
              <p>If animal lovers wish to own a pet, consider adopting from our shelter or from another animal welfare group.</p>
              <p>The public should research thoroughly and establish the source of a pet if they choose to buy one commercially.</p>
              <p>This will go a long way to help alleviate the suffering of many animals exploited in the illegal pet trade.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Use sniffer dogs to nab animal smugglers</h1>
              <p>IT IS disappointing to read that animal smuggling is on the increase in Singapore ("Animal smuggling on the rise"; March 21).</p>
              <p>The illegal wildlife trade is exceedingly cruel and 
              wasteful, and is now second only to the illegal trade in drugs and 
              firearms. Reports have indicated that Singapore is ranked among the top 
              10 illegal wildlife smuggling hubs in the world.</p>
              <p>While measures are in place to curb this trade in Singapore, there is, without a doubt, a need to do more and do so urgently.</p>
              <p>In response to Animal Concerns Research and Education 
              Society's (Acres) suggestion of using sniffer dogs to curb the trade, 
              the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) stated that "they were less
               cost-effective than other measures".</p>
              <p>Can AVA clarify what the other measures are and whether they are already in place?</p>
              <p>Sniffer dogs have been used successfully in several 
              countries. Thailand, for example, which is also a hub for the illegal 
              wildlife trade, now has a sniffer-dog unit. The unit is largely designed
               to serve as a deterrent to would-be smugglers and wildlife traffickers.
               The training and maintenance of the entire sniffer-dog unit functions 
              on a meagre annual budget of 1.4 million baht (S$58,000).</p>
              <p>In South Korea, Animals Asia Foundation's (AAF) detective 
              dog, Simba, worked with the Incheon Customs Department to spearhead the 
              fight against the trade in endangered species. According to AAF, Simba 
              worked in Incheon airport with his handler to literally "sniff out" 
              smuggled bear gall bladders, bear bile products, tiger bone, ivory and 
              deer musk.</p>
              <p>In his two years of employment, Simba repeatedly detected 
              major finds almost every month - totalling an astonishing 142 separate 
              animal parts. These included over 80 finds of bear bile and deer musk, 
              as well as whole bear gall bladders, snakes and seal penis.</p>
              <p>Simba even found four live baby monkeys and 22kg of marijuana for which he was not even trained.</p>
              <p>The use of sniffer dogs is not only cost-effective but is 
              time-effective as well. Acres hopes that AVA will reconsider our 
              proposal and we will be keen to collaborate with them on this project.</p>
