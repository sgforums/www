              <h1 class="storyheadline">Let the flowers bloom in one park to draw tourists</h1>
              <p>AT THE end of the drought period in March, many of us saw a beautiful 
              sight along highways where many flowering plants began to bloom.</p>
              <p>This extraordinary natural occurrence was not concentrated 
              on one spot but instead spread around the island. The flowers were of 
              beautiful shades of pink and covered almost the whole tree.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans and visitors from other countries fly to Japan 
              and South Korea to see the Sakura blossom in April. What attracts them 
              is the concentration of flowering plants within a park. People are awed 
              by the magnitude and size of such beautiful plants with flowers covering
               each and every branch.</p>
              <p>We could do the same in Singapore by planting a lot of 
              flowering plants in a designated park. When the trees bloom, their 
              beauty will not be less than that of Sakura gardens in Japan. With such a
               park, we can add to our tourism brochures a walk under the flowering 
              plants.</p>
              <p>Can the authorities please consider this proposal?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Blooming difference in tropics and temperate zones</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Mr Lee Huan Chiang for his Forum Online letter, "Let the 
              flowers bloom in one park to draw tourists", last Friday.</p>
              <p>In Singapore's tropical climate, flowering of trees and 
              plants is usually rather transient and triggered by a long dry spell 
              followed by sudden heavy rain. Most of the time, the local climate is 
              uniformly wet, without prolonged dry spells, and so intense flowering 
              periods are few and far between. In addition, such rainfall patterns are
               very difficult, if not impossible, to predict in advance.</p>
              <p>Rainfall-cued flowering is different from the seasonal 
              flowering experienced in temperate countries such as Japan. For these 
              reasons, there are no plans to specially dedicate a park to flowering 
              trees in the hope of having them flower at the same time and creating a 
              new attraction for tourists.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, we have planted many clusters of flowering 
              trees to add a concentration of colour in our parks. For example, there 
              is a row of Lagerstroemia speciosa trees (also commonly known as Rose of
               India) at West Coast Park. Several of them flowered last month and 
              provided a visual treat for park visitors.</p>

              <p>evidently, she was flustered by the surroundings because there were a few insects flying around.. she was giving the lifeguard guy who was in charge of the pool a hard time demanding that they spray the whole place with insecticide because there was "a lot of insects" and she kept ranting at the lifeguard who looked stunned..</p>
