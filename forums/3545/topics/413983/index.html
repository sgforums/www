              <p>BERLIN - SINGAPORE, Denmark and New Zealand were seen as the nations 
              least blighted by corruption, according to a survey published on Tuesday
               by watchdog Transparency International (TI).</p>
              <p>The three tied for top spot, scoring 9.3 points. They were 
              followed by Finland, Sweden, Canada and the Netherlands.</p>
              <p>Afghanistan and Myanmar shared second last place with a 
              score of 1.4, with Somalia coming in last with a score of 1.1.</p>
              <p>Nearly three-quarters of the 178 countries in TI's annual 
              survey scored worse than average on the scale, which ranges from zero 
              (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (perceived to have low levels of 
              corruption).</p>
              <p>'The results indicate a serious corruption problem,' the 
              Berlin-based anti-sleaze body said. 'Allowing corruption to continue is 
              unacceptable; too many poor and vulnerable people continue to suffer its
               consequences around the world,' said TI's president Huguette Labelle.</p>
              <p>The United States was 22nd on the list, while Greece and 
              Italy came in at 78th and 67th respectively. China was level with 
              Greece. TI said corruption was hampering efforts to combat 'the world's 
              most pressing problems' such as the financial crisis and climate change.

WHAT u mean to say are those called zaibatsus, a HUGE company like Sony that steals all the bussiness in that sector of the economy and controls it. THAT is clean corruption, where one family controls the prices and wages while the government does nothing. I dont think we have such a thing as zaibatsus in singapore, so please think it over b4 accusing us of 'clean corruption'. do u see any mega corporations in singapore? what is this "special group" of companies u speak of?</p></div>

              and asromanista my fren, what 'clean corruption; r u talking abt?
              WHAT u mean to say are those called zaibatsus, a HUGE
              company like Sony that steals all the bussiness in that sector of
              the economy and controls it. THAT is clean corruption, where one
              family controls the prices and wages while the government does
              nothing. I dont think we have such a thing as zaibatsus in
              singapore, so please think it over b4 accusing us of 'clean
              corruption'. do u see any mega corporations in singapore? what is
              this "special group" of companies u speak of?</p>

              <p><img src="http://172.31.254.244/yoursdp.org/images/stories/logo/perc.gif" border="0" alt="" width="150" align="right"><em>Singapore Democrats</em> <br><br>The Political and Economic Risk Consultancy or PERC, as it is commonly referred to, is held in high praise by Singapore's establishment. <br><br>Mr Lee Kuan Yew himself placed the organisation in the same esteemed group with global institutions like the International Bar Association (IBA). That is, until IBA criticised the Judiciary, which then made it a Western liberal NGO out to do this island in. <br><br>The Minister Mentor is not the only one, <a href="http://app.sprinter.gov.sg/data/pr/20070409992.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Ministers Mentee</span></span></a> also cite the company whenever they get the chance.</p>
              <p>The <em>Straits Times </em>regularly carries prominent reports written by it. <br><br>"Non-government" think-tanks like the <a href="http://www.siiaonline.org/?q=news/perc%u2019s-corruption-survey-corresponds-with-siia%u2019s-national-integrity-systems-study"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Singapore Institute of International Affairs</span></span></a> cannot resist citing it <br><br>Even our <a href="http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/data/doc/ManagePage/44/AnnualRpt2007/intlprofile.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Supreme Court</span></span></a> proudly refers to it. <br><br>So who or what is this group that is so admired by Singapore's establishment? Who runs this outfit and what does it do? <br><br>PERC's <a href="http://www.asiarisk.com/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">website</span></span></a> tells us that it is a "consulting firm specializing in strategic business information and analysis for companies" doing business in East and Southeast Asia. It also produces a range of risk reports on the strengths and weaknesses of individual countries in the region. So far so solid. <br><br>But when it comes to information about who runs the organisation, the website is rather diffident. For example under "Senior Management", there is only one name -- a Robert Broadfoot who is described as an economics graduate “directly responsible for managing PERC's research and consulting.” <br><br>Is there a governing board? If yes, who is on it? If no, is PERC a sole-proprietorship? Does anyone else run the organisation with Mr Broadfoot? <br><br>Based in Hong Kong, PERC says it “coordinates a team of researchers and analysts” but doesn't tell us who they are, how many there are, and what their areas of expertise are. Do they work full-time for the Consultancy or on an ad hoc project basis? If part-time, what are their main occupations and what companies do they work for? <br><br>The organisation also avers its "complete independence from any vested interest groups." Several lines below, however, it says that it engages in "retainer work and specific projects" and "in-house briefings" for international business associations. Who these groups and associations are is not revealed. <br><br>Such information is important as it allows the reader a gauge of just how independent the organisation is and, by extension, how reliable its reports are. This is especially salient when the reports are cited by governments for political purposes. Simply asserting that the company is completely independent does not make it so. <br><br>For example one of its analysts, Mr Bruce Gale, is also a senior writer with the <em>Straits Times</em>. Whether he continues to work for PERC is unclear as the website has no information on him. <br><br>Given the nature of the state-media arrangement in Singapore, it is more than fair to ask what an employee of an organisation that is supposed to have "complete independence" is doing writing for a newspaper owned and run by a government. It is imperative that PERC makes clear the status of Mr Gale. <br><br>Ironically, <a href="http://knowledge.insead.edu/politicalrisk080204.cfm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">Mr Gale</span></span></a> himself notes that "most political risk assessment remains both superficial and subjective. Typically, such analysis is very informal, consisting of little more than a few brief visits to the country..." <br><br>Even the information about the surveys that PERC conducts such as the kinds of questions asked, the variables used, the sample characteristics, etc are not readily available. One assumes that they are contained in the reports which cost US$645 to subscribe annually. Analysis of the reliability and validity of such surveys is lacking. This is a problem. Yet, the results are held next to biblical truth by those who benefit from it. <br><br>The next and obvious question is: Who pays for PERC's services? One will not be surprised to find Singapore's establishment a ready customer. For example, the Nanyang Technological University and the National Institute of Education are <a href="http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/lib/collections/db/AAZ-2463.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">online</span></span></a> subscribers to the organisation's Monthly Risk reports. <br><br>And what do these reports contain? The page tells us that the topics covered are "Politics, Economics, Business." Politics? The Singapore Democrats can confirm that PERC has never attempted to seek our views on matters political in Singapore. We're unsure if the Consultancy has interviewed any other opposition party or civil society group. We could easily find out by doing a search on its website. The only problem is the website doesn't have a Search button. <br><br>Given that the organisation is so oft-quoted by the Singapore establishment, it is time that more questions are asked of PERC which must do a better job of providing background information about itself. A consultancy that assesses the political and economic risk of countries must surely understand the importance of transparency.</p>

              <p><br>need to clarify, i think maybe what you said is true only when taking into account just their salary?</p>
              <p>but will it be true taking into account other hidden things like government bonus, issurance of shares, taking control of the government entities and sitting on the board, and then getting paid under those company entities, plus the company bonus and directors fee, of course they 1 person can sit on a few boards or cc so multiply their directors fee and company bonus...</p>

OPEN UR EYES AND LOOK AT WORD AS IT IS TODAY AS AN ADULT NOT AS A NAIVE CHILD! u guys complain of high tax and terrible living conditions, i tell u, look at what u have, compare it to the life of a american, even a french man. i dare u. go ahead, and see if u can still criticise what the PAP does for us. an average american faces retrenchment b4 40, high state taxes and changes his job at least three imes with an average wage twice less than ours. vagrancy in china or USA can easily make a nation twice the size of singapore. LOOK at what u have. why dont u call australia an even more corrupt country then? if u claim high taxes and pay, look at the aussie ministers. 50% tax on ur income for lousy social benefits? isnt that daylight robbery? hmm?</p></div>
