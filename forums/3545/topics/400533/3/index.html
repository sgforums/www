              <h1 class="storyheadline">Miles to go in gender equality</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Sulthan Niaz's letter "A nation of spoilt princesses?" 
              last Wednesday.</p>
              <p>His reference to women having to bear the "blame" for 
              Singapore's falling birth rate has skewed the entire debate.</p>
              <p>Mr Sulthan calls women who focus on personal ambition 
              "spoilt princesses". His letter suggests that women are morally obliged 
              to marry and raise children. The logic of that is not self-evident.</p>
              <p>While the nation's falling birth rate may be 
              disadvantageous to society, it is not a crime for which anyone is to be 
              "blamed" or be adjudged morally culpable. It is a sociological 
              phenomenon arising from a host of factors such as increased standards of
               living and busier lifestyles.</p>
              <p>At its heart, Mr Sulthan's letter is about the role of women
               in society. In his view, women must sacrifice career and other needs 
              for homemaking. He does not provide any basis or reason for that stand. 
              Unfortunately, others share similar views.</p>
              <p>I refer to Mr Chan Hean Boon ("Is S'pore a nation of spoilt 
              princesses? Yes"; last Friday) who stated in his letter that women are 
              capable only if they are able to juggle both family and career 
              obligations. He conveniently leaves out the obligations of husbands.</p>
              <p>Instead of encouraging women to stay at home, we should be 
              encouraging them to forge ahead in their careers. Singapore's most 
              valuable resource is our human capital. Cutting out women from the 
              workforce automatically reduces our human resources and productivity by 
              half.</p>
              <p>From the two writers' comments, it is clear that gender 
              equality has not been achieved in society's perception of women. Men are
               applauded so long as they have successful careers. However, women are 
              considered successful only if they can take on dual responsibilities of 
              both their careers and families. Men are thus subject to lower 
              expectations than women. Where is the equality in that?</p>

              <p>like medicated oil said its just most people arent willing to sacrifice to make marriage work.</p>
              <p>see how people want whats best for their kids?Â  branded clothing, handphones, mp3 players, branded shoes and bags etc.Â  do without all these and you can have your marriageÂ and children.</p>
