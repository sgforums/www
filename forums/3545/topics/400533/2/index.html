              <p>thats why we need to intorduce more sexuality. God had wanted there to be only two gender two sexes, we must go against this law and introduce more sexes just like introducing foreiggners crooss breeding Mr Lee so much stressed on!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest, we introduce few more new sexes gender.</p>

              <p>(2) BUTCHES</p>
              <p>(3) HOMOSEXUALS</p>
              <p>(4) LESBIANS</p>
