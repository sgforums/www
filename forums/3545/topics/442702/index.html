              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: One was a
               37-year-old Briton, who jumped off the rooftop of Fullerton Bay Hotel 
              into the waters around Marina Bay in a drunken state.<br><br>The other 
              was a local delivery man, believed to have been in a troubled mental 
              state days before he was found dead in the waters off Harbourfront Walk 
              in front of VivoCity. <br><br>At two separate hearings on Friday, State 
              Coroner Kessler Soh ruled that they shared the same tragic fate - both 
              drowned and there was no foul play suspected in their deaths.<br> <br>William
               Hart, a Briton who headed the sales department at an international 
              bank, died after falling nearly seven storeys from the rooftop of the 
              hotel where he went drinking with a friend on April 7.<br> <br>Hart, who
               had several glasses of wine, was also shown in his friend's video 
              recording on that day saying he wanted to jump from the rooftop and that
               he could "make the jump".<br> <br>The 1.8m-tall man, who had a reputation of jumping into swimming pools or water bodies from heights, then proceeded to do so.<br> <br>A
               toxicology report by Mr Leong Hsiao Tung, a Health Sciences Authority 
              (HSA) analyst, revealed that there were high levels of ethanol in Hart's
               blood,  indicating that he was clearly intoxicated and that his 
              judgment was impaired.<br> <br>Mr Hart's father and stepmother, who 
              turned up in court on Friday, said they were "very saddened and were 
              still coming to terms".<br> <br>In the other case, 38-year-old Mr Radin Bahrom Radin Muhammad Din drowned at the sea near VivoCity. <br> <br>Two weeks before his death on July 1, family members said he had been behaving strangely, claiming to have "heard voices".<br> <br>On that particular day, Mr Radin also behaved abnormally and had a fight at his workplace at Prima Tower at Keppel Road. <br><br>He attacked two security officers.<br> <br>Around midnight, witnesses saw Mr Radin jumping into the sea, where the tide was 2.7-metre high.<br> <br>A
               HSA toxicology report revealed that there was a higher than normal 
              level of Dextromethophan, a drug found in cough syrup, in his blood that
               can cause confusion, hallucinations and impair judgment.<br> <br>The State Coroner also noted that Mr Radin was unable to swim and that this may have affected his actions.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
