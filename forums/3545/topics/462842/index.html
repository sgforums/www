              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Transport
               Minister Lui Tuck Yew has said fare increases are needed to improve 
              service to commuters while keeping public transport operations 
              commercially viable.<br><br>In a Facebook post, Mr Lui said fare 
              increases are not to boost the short-term profits of Public Transport 
              Operators (PTOs) or improve the salaries of bus drivers.<br><br>He said 
              that's why the government must work with the PTOs to ensure that when 
              granted any fare increase, they would re-invest part of this revenue to 
              improve the public transport system to benefit commuters.  <br><br>This can be in hardware, like more buses and trains and upgrading the signalling systems. <br><br>It
               can also be in software, like better terms and salaries for staff. This
               includes bus drivers and train operators, as well as the maintenance 
              and service personnel.<br><br>Mr Lui said as fares increase, the government will have to play a larger role to keep the public transport system affordable.  <br><br>He said there must be a concerted and sustained effort to upgrade the bus driving profession.<br><br>Employment
               terms and conditions must also be improved further to recruit new 
              drivers and retain existing ones in order to ramp up bus capacity over 
              the next few years.<br><br>On who pays for the increased costs, Mr Lui 
              said there must be a proper balance among commuters in fares, or 
              taxpayers in government subsidies, or the PTOs.<br> <br>He said the 
              government is fully committed to an affordable public transport system 
              for the middle-income groups, the lower-income groups, the disabled 
              community, and other vulnerable groups. <br><br>He said the bottom line 
              is this. It is a matter of all the stakeholders - the PTOs, the 
              government, and commuters - coming together to ensure everyone enjoys a 
              reliable, high-quality and affordable public transport system.<br><br>- CNA/de</span></span></p>

              <p>The reason for the last few fare increases was:</p>
              <p>- Long time never increase fare.</p>
              <p>- Improve service standard.</p>
              <p>- Gradual increase than a HUGE increase.</p>
              <p>I would like Mr Lui to check with the communters whether there was any improvement in the service after the last fare increase.</p>
              <p>Or else please do not re-cycle the same reason without any improvement for fare increase.</p>
              <p>It is just another lame excuse for more profit.</p>
              <p>If you fooled us once, you cannot fooled us another time especially when the breakdown is not resolved yet.</p>

              <p>we do not see any valid reason to keep paying more</p>
              <p>Lastly, why must we bear the cost while the rich get to keep their dividend?</p>
              <p>This is similar to the financial crisis unfolding in Europe.</p>

              <p>Actually fact:</p>
              <p>1. SMRTB has never been earning money. The bus division has been losing money every year since I dunno when. But SMRT as the umbrella organisation makes a huge profit from other sources that the Saw established. Eg. The commercial train spaces.</p>
              <p>2. But that's no excuse for increasing bus fares. Because SBST has shown that the bus division need not lose money. For the record, SBST as the umbrella organisation made 30+M last year. Still a fair bit, but no where as huge amount as SMRT, which was 9 digit!</p>
              <p>3. The MOT is talking about "commercial viability" in the face of subsidising. That leaves a huge grey area as to what should be needed to be done. I would rather that we screw the notion of "competition" and go for a single operator that can take advantage of scale economics.</p>

              <p>Actually fact:</p>
              <p>1. SMRTB has never been earning money. The bus division has been losing money every year since I dunno when. But SMRT as the umbrella organisation makes a huge profit from other sources that the Saw established. Eg. The commercial train spaces.</p>
              <p>2. But that's no excuse for increasing bus fares. Because SBST has shown that the bus division need not lose money. For the record, SBST as the umbrella organisation made 30+M last year. Still a fair bit, but no where as huge amount as SMRT, which was 9 digit!</p>
              <p>3. The MOT is talking about "commercial viability" in the face of subsidising. That leaves a huge grey area as to what should be needed to be done. I would rather that we screw the notion of "competition" and go for a single operator that can take advantage of scale economics.</p>

              <p><br>there is no competition when it is clear cut that SMRT does train and SBST does buses... they could have train and bus services but there is no competition...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, the reason why their profit isn't high is becoz of the insane dividend they are giving out... they dun even save up for things like mantainance, renewal and repairs... When problem comes then they say no money... wtf?</p>
