              <p>THURSDAY'S report, 'Ex-Barisan leader refutes historian', took me on a
               walk down memory lane.</p>
              <p>I was part of the fray when the Singapore Government was 
              trying to overcome its teething problems while battling the communists 
              who controlled the many trade unions.</p>
              <p>Former Barisan Sosialis leader Poh Soo Kai's refutation of 
              Chinese historian Cheng Yinghong's view that the decline of Singapore's 
              once-powerful left (Barisan) was due to radical influences from China's 
              Cultural Revolution is unconvincing to me.</p>
              <p>Dr Poh claimed that it was the suppression of rivals by the 
              People's Action Party that led to the decline of Singapore's leftists. 
              This is a fallacy. In 1961, the Barisan was the "formidable" opposition 
              in Parliament. Its members decided to walk out and make the streets 
              their Parliament by resorting to violence and acts of vandalism.</p>
              <p>Operation Cold Store was started not to suppress the 
              opposition, but to apprehend and detain subversive elements so that 
              Singapore could enjoy peace and stability. Subversive members from the 
              Barisan were hauled in through the operation and had to be detained 
              under the Internal Security Act. Those members who managed to escape the
               dragnet entered the Malaysian jungle to join their comrades in the 
              Communist Party of Malaya (CPM).</p>
              <p>In 1981, Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping ordered the Suara 
              Revolusi Malaya (Voice of the Malayan Revolution), which had been 
              operating in Hunan, China, since 1969, to be shut down. This was a big 
              blow to the CPM's propaganda machinery.</p>
              <p>Another big blow suffered by the CPM was in the mid 1970s, 
              when the party was fractured internally into separate communist party 
              factions.</p>
              <p>Hence, with Deng in power, the Cultural Revolution was 
              crushed and without the support of the CPM, the Barisan was orphaned. 
              Thus, Dr Cheng's claim that its decline was due to radical influences 
              from China is plausible and holds more water.</p>
              <p>And my part in the fight against communist subversion?</p>
              <p>I was serving in the Singapore Police Force from 1961 to 
              1988 and had the privilege of cutting the chain that secured the front 
              door of the Barisan headquarters then in Victoria Street. And this was 
              during a raid on the premises in the early hours of the morning and in 
              connection with Operation Cold Store.</p>
