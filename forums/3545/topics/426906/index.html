              <p>Freedom is a very cryptic word. Freedom
              of speech, freedom from slavery and exploitation, freedom to desire
              and get what one wants, and last but not the least, freedom to have
              all body parts together.
              </p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">It has been more than 10 hours since I
              saw the accident at Ang Mo Kio MRT, and perhaps if tomorrow never
              comes for me, I should share more, type abit more. It will not make
              any difference, but maybe it may.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In an earlier post I recounted how I
              saw the young Thai girl, whom I mistaken for a boy, fall head
              forewards as if doing a dive at the yesteryear Toa Payoh Swimming
              Pool. Everybody started screaming, and I was shellshocked.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I watched in grief from the middle
              which was also a vantage point, as others on the platform rushed
              closer to see what is going on.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The point is, the most important thing
              in the universe, as I related to my cousin later after I exited the
              train station, was that the BLARDY PRESS ME IN CASE OF EMERGENCY
              BUTTON can never be found when I wanted it the most! I recalled
              myself turning to the pillar beside me when I saw the train coming,
              and I JUST COULD NOT FIND THE BLOODY EMERGENCY BUTTON which was there
              everytime I was waiting for the train!</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Everytime I thought, let's be cheeky
              and have fun. Maybe you had the same thought as I did, but like me,
              did not do anything for fear of paying a $5000 fine. Yet, when I
              needed the red button the most, it just could not be found.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I witnessed an Indian guy slouch onto
              the granite bench and he was so big-sized, it's hard to imagine that
              he would be lost of words. I asked, can I sit beside u, he gave me a
              stare and I realised he's probably about to vomit his guts out like I
              needed desperately to.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">People started to call their family,
              tell them don't come to Ang Mo Kio MRT, I was like.. that was the
              longest 5 minutes in my entire life.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As if all good things always happen in
              pairs, or touch wood thrice, the very reason why I am waiting for a
              train, is because my grandmother is admitted to hospital for
              gallstones. Same hospital TTSH as the one the Thai girl was sent to.
              Sure I am educated, but when freak accidents happen both outside the
              house and inside the house, sometimes I look at the 30+ year old
              doctor who was attending to my grandmother yesterday and suggested
              sending her for some scope tests... damn, can that joker be trusted
              or not.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">There are times..</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">silence..</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Can I do it or not sir?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Do what?</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Pray, Sir.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Erm, $100 for a prayer to be fulfilled.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Can cheaper or not.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Cannot. Two more minutes, I make it
              $120.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Okok settle. $300 for three wishes.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p></p>
              <ul>
              <li>I wish that the Thai girl recovers soon
              and god-damn it, if she doesn't get back her legs, at least give her
              a good life.</li>
              <li>I wish that my grandmother can recover
              soon. Eighty four years old, you want to stick a scope into her
              throat... say yes also evil, say no also evil. KNN.</li>
              <li>I wish that all sentient beings be
              watched over and be free from suffering and the causes of it. Be
              protected from calamity.. and fuck, I'll be a hypocrite to ask for
              eternal life. Just. Just. Watch over them.</li>
