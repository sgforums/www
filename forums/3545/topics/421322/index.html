              <p>AN UNEMPLOYED man who stabbed a cabby in the neck was jailed for 30 months on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Community Court judge Ng Peng Hong told K. Mohan that he had
               not ordered caning because of the latter's mental condition. The 
              49-year-old, who is suffering from schizophrenia, had earlier admitted 
              to voluntarily causing hurt to Mr Ngoh Chin Boon, 33, with a knife at 
              the void deck of Block 26 Sin Ming Industrial Sector A on Aug 1, 2009. 
              As a result of the attack, Mr Ngoh has lost his voice.</p>
              <p>The court heard that he was playing chess with retiree Mr 
              Chan Keng Mun, 64, at the void deck, while Mohan was drinking beer with 
              his friend nearby. Sometime between 11pm and 11.10pm, Mr Ngoh heard 
              Mohan shouting and swearing into his mobile phone. As he wanted to 
              concentrate on his game, the cabby told Mohan not to talk too loudly or 
              the police might come.</p>
              <p>During a heated argument, Mohan swung a beer bottle at Mr 
              Ngoh who pushed him, causing Mohan to fall. Mohan stood up and briskly 
              left the void deck. He returned a few minutes later with a knife to 
              attack Mr Ngoh, who tried to run and ward off the knife but was slashed.</p>
              <p>Mohan's friend came and pulled him away. Mohan's lawyer Suresh Damodara said his client needed help and long-term treatment.</p>
              <p>He said Mohan was upset and emotionally stressed after his 
              girlfriend had told him on the phone that she had aborted their child. 
              Mohan could have been jailed for up to five years or fined or caned or 
              received any two of the punishments.</p>
