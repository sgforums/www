              <p>I HIRED a transfer maid and after three months, things were not working
               out. She was unable to cope with basic chores and was unhygienic.</p>
              <p>I was thinking of getting a new maid, but in the meantime, 
              given my hectic Chinese New Year schedule, I decided to have her lodged 
              at the maid agency for a week. The day she was supposed to return to my 
              home, she ran away to her embassy.</p>
              <p>I spoke to her when she was in the embassy and she 
              apologised. She claimed she was sick and the agent did not attend to 
              her, so she ran away. She said she would leave the embassy only if I 
              continued to employ her; otherwise, she wanted to return to her country.
               She did not want a transfer.</p>
              <p>A few days later, the agent called to say that my maid had 
              changed her mind and just wanted to return to her country. She said I 
              would have to bear half of the maid's loan balance of $3,000 (the loan 
              was paid upfront to the agent and was to be recovered from the maid's 
              salary in instalments) because my maid insisted on returning to her 
              country. The agency contract stated that the employer would be 
              responsible for the maid's loan if he were to cancel the maid's work 
              permit and repatriate her.</p>
              <p>I refused. It's akin to allowing maids to come to Singapore,
               try out the job, and when they don't like what they see, they can run 
              away and seek shelter at their embassy, then demand to go home without 
              repaying the loan and refusing a transfer.</p>
              <p>Why should employers be left in the lurch to bear the consequences? I did no wrong.</p>
              <p>Will the concerned authorities please comment?</p>
