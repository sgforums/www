              <p>I have heard from foreigners whom I have met here, like those from Scandinavian countries, they prefer to work half a year, and be unemployed for the other half of the year.

              <p>There is no notable welfare scheme here like  that of Australia, or UK, for the simple reason to prevent abuse. Even at present there is some abuse here, with the CPF medical scheme.

              <p>Singapore don't call it salary tax, they call it CPF, it's different name but same nature.</p>

              <p>Medical tourist from western countries find it cheap to seek treatment here, is the same as Singaporean medical tourist seeking treatment in India and China. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>And you think income taxes and property tax are applied equally to all? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Different income levels different levels of tax rates. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Abuse of medical services? You mean you would go in for a heart bypass or chemotherapy if you are perfectly fine? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Governments in the west don't go bankrupt because of welfare, it's more like comparative advantage. Why do you think China's trade surplus ballooned? The west has always had a welfare system in place all this while. Why did this bankruptcy come about only after China's entry into global trade? You have been hoodwinked by the PAP Ministers who wants you to believe that welfare is all bad. But then again they didn't say anything when a Health Ministers paid a paltry sum for his operation. Welfare is only good when you are at the receiving end, not when somebody else is receiving it, seems to be the PAP motto. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
