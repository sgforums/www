              <div class="byline">A SIX-YEAR-OLD boy died after he fell from the kitchen window of a fifth-storey flat when no one was at home yesterday morning.
              <p>Marson Heng, a kindergarten pupil, was believed to have used
               a laundry basket to climb up to the window. The grilles were shut but 
              unlocked, as the family had put the laundry out to dry.</p>
              <p>His mother found his body at the foot of the Tampines block a
               few minutes later, when she was on her way home after running some 
              errands.</p>
              <p>The police said they received a call about the fall at 
              8.55am. The boy was pronounced dead at 9.10am. When The Straits Times 
              visited the three-room flat at Block 446, Tampines Street 42, on Monday 
              afternoon, Marson's parents were sitting listlessly in the living room.</p>
              <p>His mother, who wanted to be known only as Mrs Heng, was hugging a picture of her son to her chest.</p>
              <p>The parents said it was the first time they had left their son unattended at home.</p>

              <p>Some of the household dont want to fit any window grills at all especially with the new hdb high rise flats.</p>

              <p>I know how the mother feels. I feel sad for her. The guilt is going to be with her forever. My friend's mother, who is now 80+ year old. She lost a son 60 years ago. Till now, she still blames herself for her son's death after 60 years. Sometimes she will weep quietly because she misses her son.</p>
              <p>Although she is a great grandmother with many daughters, sons and grandchildren, she told me she has never been happy because she lost a son 60 years ago. Sometimes she will ask my friend to leave her alone because she wants to stay at home and talks to her dead son. Besides this weird talk, she looks perfectly normal to me. Her pain of losing a son did not go away after 60 years. I think she will bring her guilt to her grave. I feel sad for her.</p>

              <p>I dont agreed that children age under 10 should not be left alone. Even more than 10 yr old also dangerous especially without window grills.</p>
              <p>Maybe hdb should make it compulsory for every household to have window grills.</p>
