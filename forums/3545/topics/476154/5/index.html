              <p>No complain at work. But much things to say about daily life. Singapore is getting more and more crowded. I miss the old Singapore.</p>
              <p>I still very much love Singapore but just hoping that the government can have some control over the foreign population. Maybe give us a little more space?</p>

              <p>I always believe that formal education is the root cause.. We're told that it's good and right to greet teachers. It's good to greet parents. It's good not to talk to strangers in childhood. Then we're told that getting certificate is good.</p>
              <p>In fact, i've an ex neighbor who called me one night, crying helplessly asking how he can appeal for a polytechnic course. I asked him why polytechnic and he said he don't know but it is good. (Obviously I know he wanted a cert, but I want to ensure that he knows why he wants that cert.) <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Our culture has taught us to obey, without thinking for ourselves. Saying the law is strict is not an excuse, we need more people to stand up to fight for it! I don't understand why SG is encouraging more ideas yet they're training us to not make mistakes... </span><span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">It's a sad thing as I facilitated a class, a lady manager told me she sees the arts genes within her son yet she'll guide (mislead) him into Oil&amp;Gas or Research industry. She herself <strong>suppress</strong> her true energetic self to portray a 'right' type of relational HR manager... I've an army friend who got into a uni course and will only read the course descriptions 2 weeks before the school start.....! Should we continue to memorise exams with our might when we can literally google anything and everything now?</span></p>
              <p>It's surprising for me how he can invest the next 3 years and $30k on education just like that.... <span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">We're so trained by the industrial age to conform to rules. Now information age is no longer the same. We need to be personal and true to one another... In the past people open email, people listen to one another on the street, but now we need to be real and vulnerable as we're so numbed by flaud cases out there (we tend to remember bad past more ba...) Professionalism promotes politics, personalness promotes purity... </span></p>
              <p>As for me, I'm doing a rethinking career <span style="text-decoration: underline;">project</span>.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">How I find or create joy in work is to merge my personality, passion, purpose and practices together... </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">You can try complete the few questions below and you'll be clearer..</span></p>
              <p>Personality: The one thing i'm VERY confident to serve in a team of 5-10 people is...<br>Passion: Before I die, I want to...<br>Purpose: On my funeral, I want to hear people say...<br>Practice: Knowing my personality, passion and purpose, what I'll do next for my future are....</p>

              <p>I feel...cause we've been trained to think that we MUST have income EVERY month.. so we try to get back fast, yet it's still not something we want. The society just want our hands and head, not our hearts. Companies with vision mission statement is useless. There's not much company culture and practices to fulfill them. In fact, some companies just value in profit not knowing that profit is actually a by product of their good management... My dad is a cab driver... and I felt that a cab company which shrinks the driver's seat for customer's better experience is a crap company... if we take care of our employees and think for them, will they fight for the company? I won't say 100% will, but there will be someone out there who will appreciate it...  </p>
              <p>Dress down friday is not a company culture...they're too cliche and useless...people won't feel belonged to have dress down fridays.... all these initiatives are just strategy and not values of the company... I see organisations put up 'honesty, respect, innovative' as values, but yet who can relate that? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Instead of telling Jim to be innovative, we can tell him to 'Think Different'. That's what apple do... </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> is an awesome Tedtalk speech by Simon Sinek, i've been following him for quite sometime... He shared on how apple inspires others. Apple starts with Why, and all average company starts with What or How. </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I saw a secondary school with 5 values, but I couldnt relate to it because they're Noun... You can watch this </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2 min video</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> by Simon too... Why values are Verb...</span></p>
              <p>Mostly because of him, now I love what I do more now... being more mission driven than who I was in the past..</p>
              <p>Hope these helps :) <br><br>PS: Sorry if I sounded kind of agitated and all :/ I just had some bad past education experience and I don't think all these are worth it... I'm on a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mission</span> to help people be happier in the career and work they're in...</p>
