              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A 16-YEAR-OLD was on weekend leave from a welfare home when he raped his step-sister in 2009.</p>
              <p>The youth, now 18, did it four times in all when she was 14 
              and 15, at their home in the east. As a result, the girl became pregnant
               and delivered a baby girl in January 2010. The infant has been fostered
               out.</p>
              <p>A Community Court heard on Friday that the victim and her 
              nine-year-old half-brother were watching television at home one night in
               February 2009 when the accused started disturbing her by hitting her on
               the arms. She hit him back in a playful manner as they had done, when 
              they were young.</p>
              <p>Deputy Public Prosecutor Gail Wong said the accused suddenly
               felt an urge to have sex with the victim. He caught hold of her, pulled
               her into the bedroom and locked the door.</p>
              <p>The victim shouted at her half-brother to take the spare 
              keys and open the door. The accused then stood at the door to prevent 
              her from leaving. He also opened the door and took away the keys from 
              their half-brother and told him not to disturb. He raped her. He raped 
              her again the following month.</p>
              <p>The girl was too ashamed to tell her parents. The offences 
              came to light in October 2009 when she revealed to a school counsellor 
              what her step-brother had done. The accused, who had two other charges 
              taken into consideration, will be sentenced on April 20. The maximum 
              penalty for rape is 20 years, a fine or caning.</p>
