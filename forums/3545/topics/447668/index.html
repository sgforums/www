              <p>Feb 22, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>WHILE applauding the town councils for helping cleaners of Housing 
              Board blocks to earn $1,000 a month from $750, we should wonder how 
              cleaners manage to live on such a salary, given the steep cost of living
               ('Town council cleaners get more pay now'; yesterday).</p>

              <p>Cleaning companies should ask propective employees this question?</p>
              <p>"You come here for what?</p>
              <p>Ans: "To work." - This anwer throw the fella out.</p>
              <p>Ans: "To clean." - This is the right attitude. Take him or her.</p>
              <p>Many cleaners just perform their task with the broom, mops, wipers, and considers the job done. </p>
              <p>Clean or not is irrelevant. Tell them the area they have done is still not clean, they balk and say they have already done that area, their job done. </p>
              <p>They should come to clean, not work.  They should see and do whatever necessary without being told. Firms would pay a premium for such company with such cleaners. This means the cleaning company is a professional company, and their cleaners could easily earn more than the market rate.</p>
              <p>Frankly I have seen mentally challenged, or physically challenged cleaners with the right attitude. And the able bodied uncles and aunties are the vomit blood ones. They spoil the market and keep cleaners wages down.</p>

              <p>You are fucking naive.<br><br>You take the average lifestyle of a normal Singaporean against the earning income of the bottom tier of Singaporeans, AND you expect it to work? Then kpkb say it is a new method of birth control? WTF! Use your brain!<br><br>First of all, why did they become cleaners? By choice or by situational factors? I can safely assume that NO ONE aspires to be a cleaner and he/she should have very low (educational) qualifications to be a cleaner. As such, I can infer the way they have lead their lifestyle for the past 30 years(?).</p>
              <p>Let's take a ah beng who have wasted his life away and landed up as a cleaner. What you are proposing is that while other Singaporeans have worked hard their whole life, the ah beng who wasted his time doing nothing should have the SAME lifestyle as those who worked long hours for many years?

              <p>given singapore's education system, non of our kids will end up as a cleaner.</p>
              <p>anyway, do you know why my divorced father earned only $3/ hour? Weak health. He used to earn $15/hour. now old cannot find a good job. end up as security guard. best, just sit and patrol his area. </p>
              <p>i am guessing those locals who are cleaners either have poor health or are too old and have children to support( now everyone know english, can have a job as a sales assitant can earn $7/hour. but sometimes need to carry heavy items which old ppl can't)</p>
              <p>Life. But they are at least relying on themselves not the government.</p>
