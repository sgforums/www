              <p>given singapore's education system, non of our kids will end up

              Weak health. He used to earn $15/hour. now old cannot find a good

              <p>i am guessing those locals who are cleaners either have poor
              health or are too old and have children to support( now everyone
              know english, can have a job as a sales assitant can earn $7/hour.

              <p>You are fucking naive.<br> <br> You take the average lifestyle of a normal Singaporean against the
              earning income of the bottom tier of Singaporeans, AND you expect
              it to work? Then kpkb say it is a new method of birth control? WTF!
              Use your brain!<br> <br> First of all, why did they become cleaners? By choice or by
              situational factors? I can safely assume that NO ONE aspires to be
              a cleaner and he/she should have very low (educational)
              qualifications to be a cleaner. As such, I can infer the way they
              have lead their lifestyle for the past 30 years(?).</p>
              <p>Let's take a ah beng who have wasted his life away and landed up
              as a cleaner. What you are proposing is that while other
              Singaporeans have worked hard their whole life, the ah beng who
              wasted his time doing nothing should have the SAME lifestyle as
              those who worked long hours for many years? Where is your fucking
              logic????<br> <br> (Ofcourse there are some cleaners who do it as part time but that's
              another story.)<br> <br> And KNN, you are saying that being a cleaner, I can just sweep the
              floor and I SHOULD have enough salary to send my kids to
              universities? Then who want to work hard in Singapore??<br> <br> So if cleaners are paid 2.7k(about the average Singaporean pay),
              then the prices of everything is going to increase no? Then you
              will kpkb again.<br> <br> I don't know why I'm so pissed by such a post. Not that I am
              particularly new to such brainless comments. The only point that
              could be right in your post is that we have a crappy educational
              system. That might explain why you are so full of shit.<br> <br> Fuck man. Do you guys even think before you post? Then when people
              flame you back, you just take the high stand and say "Why so
              serious?". How are you going to gain the respect of others. Knn. No
              wonder forever hide in some online forum and kpkb at the government
              at how pathetic your life is.</p>

              <p>again, so naive. fine. then i shall revert to the topic and tear you a new one for good measure. CLEANERS. the average age of a cleaner in SIngapore easily exceeds 62. among all the elderly in Singapore, some 35.7% are cleaners. they are EVERYWHERE, from schools to hawker centres cleaning our shit. go look for any random school and pop in. MOST if not ALL the cleaners are easily over 70.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>foriegn diplomats and tourists have wrote in asking WHY. WHY our old folks have to resort to cleaning our shit(literally) in the golden age of their retirement. truth is, THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT. Don't give me this shit of DOING IT OUT OF BOREDOM FOR THEIR 'RETIREMENT' srsly, what. and. fucked. up. excuse. would YOU become a cleaner when u grow old AND u have the money to enjoy life but YOU"RE BORED?</p>
              <p>THE ISSUE i'm raising her is, WHY are so many of our elderly stuck in such a fucked up predicament? the govt? perhaps? after all, despite the empty promises and numerous so-called effective policies, it turns out the singapore society relies on its own elderly to clean our filth. we complain on the so-called failure of welfare states like the USA with such a high vagrancy rate, yet when the cleaners in our own blocks walk with a limp or shuffle about slowly with a broom, we dont give a fuck. sure, there may be ppl like you, skyblue, who do give a damn, but HOW MANY are like you? very few, if not ZERO. </p>
              <p>WHY are our elderly in such a broken state? WHY have we done NOTHING to stop this? we come to the state where ppl from countries we once criticised as 'failed' welfare states come to us and query why in such a rich country, everywhere they turn, they see the elederly cleaning table and toilets and floors?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and so you know, CLEANING IS NOT A PLEASANT JOB. dont tell me it's recreational. what a dumbfuck idea to have.</p>

              <p>Security guards and cleaners are now doing the changing of light bulbs,  and watering the plants and reset the circuit breakers, they also check on the other contractors like the pest control, and the other maintenance contractor..

              <p>There is a need to change stereo type thinking.</p>
              <p>Security guards are now called Security Officers. They are no more jagas. They look after the building, the security aspects as well as the cleanliness and orderlyness and its function. They involve themselve in setting up functions, conventions, meetings, events, etc. But there are still some old cocks who think they are just jagas.</p>
              <p>The cleaners are still thinking they are just cleaners. There are cleaners who look into the cleanliness of the place as well as the asthetics of the ground. They report anything that is amiss. Especially those who flout fire safety regulations.</p>

              <p>i am not in favour of welfarism....but there are certain conditions of the working people at the lowest rungs who are helpless and do not know the channels to elevate their grievances ....these people do not even know the kind of employment they signed in fine legal prints despite the "summary" of works being told to them...not to say the use of "fear" on them to keep their job or else...</p>
              <p>of course there are "rich" cleaners ...but my concern here is not on them but the exploited bunch....there are still such conditions exist which may not have been fully realized and elevated....</p>
              <p>we need to create the awareness and report up to help these people...the cleaners wages increment surely is applaudable but are they the minimum wages deserved in a developed country? are there checks to ensure?</p>

              question?</p>
              <p>"You come here for what?</p>
              <p>Ans: "To work." - This anwer throw the fella out.</p>
              <p>Ans: "To clean." - This is the right attitude. Take him or

              <p>Many cleaners just perform their task with the broom, mops,
              wipers, and considers the job done. </p>
              <p>Clean or not is irrelevant. Tell them the area they have done is
              still not clean, they balk and say they have already done that
              area, their job done. </p>
              <p>They should come to clean, not work.  They should see and
              do whatever necessary without being told. Firms would pay a
              premium for such company with such cleaners. This means the
              cleaning company is a professional company, and their cleaners
              could easily earn more than the market rate.</p>
              <p>Frankly I have seen mentally challenged, or physically
              challenged cleaners with the right attitude. And the able bodied
              uncles and aunties are the vomit blood ones. They spoil the market
              and keep cleaners wages down.</p>
