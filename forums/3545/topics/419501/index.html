              <p><br>First hope, then heartbreak. That was what the parents 
              of Matthew Chye Qi Yang, 19, had to endure when police first told them 
              the body found drowned in the lake was not their son, but later 
              confirmed that it was.<br><br><br><br><br>According to news reports, the couple had 
              rushed to Woodlands Town Garden on Saturday when they heard someone had 
              drowned in the lake there.<br><br>However, police had told them the body was that of an old man.<br><br>Two
               days later, the Chyes found themselves face-to-face with the police 
              again. This time, it was bad news -- their son had indeed drowned in the
               lake.<br><br>Since Friday, they had been searching for their son. 
              Matthew, who had been diagnosed with autism when he was three years old,
               had slipped out of the Woodlands flat at 10.30am.<br><br>STOMPer <strong>OhNo</strong> was shocked when he read the news in the papers today. There could have
               been a better way to deal with the situation at that time, he says.<br><br>Wrote the STOMPer in his email contribution (Jan 4):<br><br>"This is the first time I have read in the papers about police making such a mistake.<br><br>"Not
               to say it is a grave mistake, because we are all human anyway, but 
              police failed to effectively manage the expectations of those involved.<br><br>"As a result, the officer could have caused the couple even more grief than they were already experiencing.<br><br>"I
               don't know what the police standard operating procedures are, but if he
               could not allow the parents to view the body, the least he could have 
              done was to tell the couple that investigations were still ongoing.<br><br>"As quoted in the newspapers, the police spokesperson said the slip-up happened for a few reasons.<br><br>"The
               body did not fit the description or the photograph provided. Plus, it 
              seems the couple was unable to conclusively identify the clothing found 
              on the body as belonging to their son.<br><br>"Their son was finally identified through his fingerprints.<br><br>"Not
               only does it give our home team bad flak, but it's really a 
              roller-coaster ride of emotion that no one would ever want to go 
              through.<br><br>"I hope such a thing will never happen again."<br><br>Source:<a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/what_bugs_me/527322/dead_body_in_woodlands_lake_mixup_police_could_have_handled.html"><br>http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/what_bugs_me/527322/dead_body_in_woodlands_lake_mixup_police_could_have_handled.html</a></p>
