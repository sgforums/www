              <p>by Sadat Osman<br>inSing.com - <span>30 June 2012 9:00 AM | Updated 12:46 PM</span></p>
              <p>2012 may be Singapore’s most scandal-ridden year yet, barely halfway 
              through it and already five high profile scandals have pulled at the 
              moral fabric of our once squeaky-clean nation.</p>
              <p>Acts, we can only assume (and allegedly) committed in the name of 
              achieving happiness, prosperity and progress, here’s a look at the first
               – and hopefully, only – five scandals of 2012.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Online Vice Ring</strong></p>
              <p>Men will be men, and sex with a beautiful young woman is arguably hard to pass up.</p>
              <p>Aptly named as the biggest sex scandal to ever run wild in Singapore,
               the online vice ring involved 48 men who allegedly had paid sex with an
               underage prostitute after engaging her services online.</p>
              <p>Three big names popped up in this sexual foray: Lee Lip Hong, former 
              principal of Pei Chun Public School, Howard Shaw, former Singapore 
              Environment Council head and Chua Ren Cheng, former teacher at River 
              Valley High School.</p>
              <p>Note, the men were not busted for paying for fornicating – 
              prostitution is legal but zoned in Singapore – but for paying a girl 
              under the age of 18 for sex.</p>
              <p>Lee was sentenced and served a six-week jail term, Shaw recently pleaded guilty but asked for a sentence without jail time.</p>
              <p>What can we deduce from this scandal? Ascertain any young woman’s age
               before penetration just as you would check the expiry date on can of 
              tinned food collecting dust on the shelf.</p>
              <p><em>Read more about this scandal <a href="http://news.insing.com/tabloid/singapores-biggest-online-sex-scandal-case-unfolds/id-db443f00">here</a></em></p>
              <p><strong>2. Ex-Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) Chief</strong></p>
              <p>Sex seems to the number one reason for men to stray from their morals.</p>
              <p>The former SCDF chief, Peter Lim, was another alleged guilty party, 
              involved in procuring contracts from vendors. He apparently used the 
              power of his authority to show favour to three particular women and in 
              return, received sexual attention from them.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim allegedly obtained oral gratification from one Pang Chor Mui 
              at a car park at Stadium Walk, among other romps. Another woman, Esther 
              Goh, reportedly gave the ex-SCDF chief sexual gratification on seven 
              separate occasions, and Lee Wei Hoon and him allegedly got busy in the 
              city of love, Paris.</p>
              <p>So, even the high-ranking officers in our government can, and have, 
              the ability to deviate from what they were taught in training: 
              integrity.</p>
              <p>The trials are ongoing.</p>
              <p><em>Read more about this scandal <a href="http://news.insing.com/tabloid/who-are-the-women-allegedly-behind-the-ex-scdf-chief-sex-scandal-case/id-984f3f00">here</a></em></p>
              <p><strong>3. Ex-Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) Chief</strong></p>
              <p>In his industrious endeavour to alleviate the drug problem in Singapore, Ng Boon Gay allegedly fell prey to the allure of sex.</p>
              <p>He has since denied all accusations of having obtained sexual 
              gratification from Ms Cecilia Sue Siew Nang in exchange for furthering 
              business interests.</p>
              <p>Ms Sue is a sales manager with Oracle Corporation Singapore and formerly Hitachi Data Systems.</p>
              <p>Although he has been charged with four counts of corruption, Ng 
              remains resilient in the fight for his innocence and recently said that 
              there isn’t enough information for the trial to proceed.</p>
              <p>This chief reminds us all that we shouldn’t be too fast to judge 
              especially when details are fully known. But yes, one is always innocent
               until proven guilty.</p>
              <p>Another unusual fact: His wife, much like Howard Shaw’s wife, Jessie 
              Xue, are standing by their men - despite such compelling allegations of 
              adultery. Talk about luck.</p>

              <p><strong>4. Former Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) Vice-president</strong></p>
              <p>Another Peter (Khoo) has been singled out in his attempt to be above the law.</p>
              <p>Slapped with a total of ten charges, two charges for criminally breaching trust as a servant and eight others.<br>This
               ‘honest’ man admitted to receiving illegal payments and shopping 
              vouchers while he was in charge of SPH’s Editorial Projects Unit when 
              the vouchers were meant for branding and promotional purposes for the 
              Straits Times.</p>
              <p>To Khoo’s benefit, he’s been making up for his errs. To date, he has returned a sum of about $196,500.</p>

              <p><strong>5. City Harvest Church</strong></p>
              <p>Singapore finally sees the light.</p>
              <p>City Harvest Church (CHC) founder Pastor Kong Hee and his ‘jing-gang’
               were rounded by the Commercial Affairs Department for allegedly 
              swindling money from the church’s building fund.</p>
              <p>The two-year long investigations initially revealed that the sum of 
              money involved was about $23 million. Then, it was reported to be $50 
              million.</p>
              <p>While all accusations have been denied by CHC and investigations are 
              ongoing; the real juice driving this scandal? Look to the people and 
              their reactions.</p>
              <p>However this case turns out, either way, somebody is in mega trouble.</p>

              <p><br><br>SINGAPORE - A police national serviceman who misappropriated money entrusted to him faces more jail time after the Chief Justice allowed an appeal by the Public Prosecutor.<br><br>Amir Hamzah Mohammad, 24, who was serving his NS as a special constable attached to the Found and Unclaimed Property Office (FUPO), was jailed six weeks by a district court for criminal breach of trust as a public servant. Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong increased the jail term to six months yesterday, as he agreed with the prosecution that the sentence "was too lenient".<br><br>Amir's duties included driving the FUPO van to collect found property turned in at police divisions and to take them back to the unit.<br><br>At the time of the offence, FUPO had an existing backlog of property waiting to be registered and processed. Hence, supervisors stopped checking against the collection lists of items that drivers handed in from their collection rounds, according to court documents.<br><br>On Sept 21, 2010, Amir collected 32 polymer bags from Clementi Police Division Headquarters, including one which contained cash. When he returned to his base, he brought all the found property except one containing the cash, which he hid in the van. A few days later, he retrieved the bag from the van and misappropriated S$893.75.<br><br>He used part of the money to pay for his car insurance.<br><br>Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Leong Wing Tuck argued that Amir was able to commit the offence only because of the access given to him as a police officer.<br><br>While the public is entitled to expect law enforcement officers to carry out their duties "with integrity and honesty", DPP Leong said "the zero-tolerance approach" to law enforcement officers committing offences while on duty must continue.<br><br>Allowing the appeal, CJ Chan agreed Amir "took advantage of the situation". Despite Amir's plea for leniency, he noted the accused had shown "no remorse".<br><br>Amir was convicted after a trial which spanned 18 days.</p>
