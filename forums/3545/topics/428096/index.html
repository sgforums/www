              <p>STOMPer <strong>Gregory</strong> was concerned to see this China flag hung at the Kopitiam outlet at Pasir Ris West Plaza.<br><br>Said the STOMPer in an email to STOMP today (Apr 17):<br><br>"As
               we passed by the Pasir Ris West Plaza Kopitiam, my 13-year-old son 
              suddenly shouted, 'Hey Pa, why are they hanging a China flag in the 
              middle of the Kopitiam?' <br><br>"Sensing my son's great displeasure, I 
              quietly asked myself whether we are slowly becoming a new province of 
              China, especially with all those cleaners and stall assistants from 
              China in all the food courts. <br><br>"I was wondering why the flag was 
              hung in the middle of the Kopitiam. Didn't this person has basic common 
              sense? Why did Kopitiam allow the flag to be hung? <br><br>"Whoever hung the flag and whoever allowed the flag to be hung, should be 'hung' too for being insensitive to others' feeling. <br><br>"I
               do not resent China nor its people, but I do feel that our government 
              should not allow such a great influx of one nationality to come into 
              Singapore.<br><br>"They can be easily seen and found in all corners of Singapore. It has greatly affected us socially and economically. <br><br>"While
               relating this incident to a colleague, she suddenly remarked, 'With all
               these foreigners around, I am feeling like a foreigner in my own 
              country.' <br><br>"I do share the same feeling too!"<br><br>In a subsequent email to STOMP, the STOMPer said that the flag had been removed.</p>
