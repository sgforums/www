              <p><strong>MPs to propose changes to Maintenance of Parents Act</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 17 May 2010 1832 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Needy elderly parents who are abandoned by their 
              children may soon get better legal protection.
              <br> <br> A team of 10 Members of Parliament is spearheading efforts to propose 
              changes to the Maintenance of Parents Act to give the law more bite.
              <br> <br> Among the changes being considered is that of giving the Commissioner of
               Maintenance of Parents access to housing and salary records of 
              children.
              <br> <br> Singapore's population is ageing and with time, family values change 
              too.
              <br> <br> Halimah Yacob, member of the Maintenance of Parents Act Workgroup and MP
               of Jurong GRC, said: "These values are being eroded because of the 
              pressures of work. It is also because the nature of the relationships 
              has changed in a very modern society."
              <br> <br> The number of parents filing maintenance applications almost doubled to 
              199 last year from 109 in 2007. Such parents can seek redress under the 
              Maintenance of Parents Act enacted 15 years ago.
              <br> <br> But there are shortcomings - and one of them which the committee hopes 
              to tackle is to enhance the powers of the Commissioner of Maintenance of
               Parents.
              <br> <br> Chairman of the group, Marine Parade GRC MP Seah Kian Peng, said: "We 
              know that one of the difficulties the commissioner faces is the lack of 
              information. One, they don't even know how to contact the children - the
               addresses are not there."
              <br> <br> To facilitate this, the commissioner may need to have legal access to 
              records held by agencies such as the Immigration and Checkpoints 
              Authority and the Central Provident Fund board.
              <br> <br> With such information, it is hoped that cases will be settled through 
              mediation instead of going to the courts.
              <br> <br> Mr Seah said: "The financial standing of the children is an important 
              consideration. (At the) end of the day, if you have that information, 
              the commissioner will be better placed to convince, to assist, to 
              facilitate in the mediation between both parties - the applicant and the
               respondent. 
              <br> <br> "Put yourself in his shoes - the commissioner - if you don't have that 
              information it's very hard to even try to mediate, you are going against
               a blank wall without this information."
              <br> <br> The workgroup said the amendments are not about legalising filial piety,
               and neither is it about helping undeserving parents extract money from 
              children.
              <br> <br> Mr Seah said: "The act presupposes that number one - is the parent 
              deserving of care? In the first place, if the parent had in the past 
              neglected, abandoned or possibly even ill-treated their children, I 
              think this will be taken into account by the Tribunal in determining 
              whether the parents should be entitled or the case totally dismissed."
              <br> <br> "It's not always the children (who are) at fault. Parents first look 
              after their children. Have you been looking after the children well? 
              Have you been inculcating the right values? If you do that, then later 
              on - children, please look after your parents. 
              <br> <br> "And it's not just financial considerations. I think some, because of 
              their financial standings, they may be able to support in other ways, 
              emotional support or other forms."
              <br> <br> Mr Seah is the first MP from the ruling People's Action Party in 36 
              years to propose a Bill. This is also only the fourth time a back 
              bencher is initiating a Bill in Parliament since Singapore gained 
              Independence in 1965. 
              <br> <br> The workgroup hopes that changes to the Bill will be passed by November 
              this year. It will be holding public consultations in May and June, 
              involving seven focus groups in all four languages.
              <br> <br> Members of the public can also submit proposals to </span><a href="http://www.mpa.sg/">www.mpa.sg</a><span> or join a discussion thread via the </span><a href="http://www.reach.gov.sg/">REACH</a><span> platform.
