              <p>'It encourages students to do something out of fear or because it will 
              be rewarded. Compulsory volunteerism is an oxymoron.'</p>
              <p>MR JAMES REEVES: 'As a teacher, I am always supportive 
              when my students suggest we get involved with community work. However, I
               was disappointed to read Sunday's report ('Community work good for 
              students') about Foreign Minister George Yeo endorsing the compulsory 
              Community Involvement Programme (CIP) . Community work certainly can 
              imbue students with excellent values, but requiring them to put in a 
              minimum number of hours of CIP is exactly the sort of thing that 
              encourages students to do something out of fear that they will be 
              punished if they do not, or because it will be rewarded. Compulsory 
              volunteerism is an oxymoron. Students will alter their behaviour to 
              ensure they secure the requisite number of CIP hours. They will play the
               system and find the most painless way of meeting that requirement. 
              Surely this does not infuse values that we would like to see in the 
              youth of Singapore.'</p>

              <p>Q: why do children do "community work" these days?<br>A: they get marks and credits at school for them</p>
              <p>this instills a cynical point of view in the child as everything is a means to an end... the child learns neither compassion nor charity when they do "community work" not because they want to make things better, but because they feel they will profit from it...</p>
              <p>and the world is cynical enough without children being subconsciously programmed to be like that</p>

              <p>Interestingly, I had a short discussion with a secondary school 'senior' about this.</p>
              <p>I expressed my concern that the students were volunteering purely for the CIP points but his response to me was that it may be true that they volunteer for that now - but he hopes that through being 'forced' to give their time to volunteering, they will learn to experience the joy of volunteering and then do it out of passion later.</p>
              <p>I felt that what he said does have a grain of truth. It is also true that I find students who had done community work, tend to be more passionate 'volunteers' later in life, than adults who have never done it before.</p>
              <p>Also, nowadays we always go the way of trying to repackage something so young people 'like' it and 'want' to do it. Make Chinese cool, make no smoking cool - everything is worked through by making it attractive, appealing</p>
              <p>But  - there are some things that we need to do, whether it is fun, cool, enjoyable or not. And this discipline to do necessary things - whether they like it or not - is important in their growth to maturity.</p>
              <p>So, don't call it volunteerism! Call it community work, call it National Service! Anything to shake the youths out of their apathy and expose them to a life that they are too sheltered to see - You can take away the points though :P</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">CIP has shortfalls but it's a vital gateway to volunteerism</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the letters on Wednesday by Mr Kwan Jin Yao ('Review 
              community scheme in schools') and Mr James Reeves ('Community 
              Involvement Programme').</p>
              <p>The National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre believes 
              community service programmes should be part of every school's 
              curriculum. Integral to building values in our youth, service projects 
              connect students to the wider community as well as disadvantaged groups.</p>
              <p>While we acknowledge that the mandatory Community 
              Involvement Programme (CIP) is not strictly volunteerism, it is a 
              gateway to more volunteerism today and in the future. Studies in the 
              United States have shown that community service, in conjunction with 
              service learning, is a strong predictor of future volunteering.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, there are examples of students who volunteer 
              well beyond their required CIP hours, and its incentives. CIP is not 
              going to change every student, but we hope it can be a transformative 
              experience for many.</p>
              <p>Essentially, CIP is a programme run on good intentions, but 
              it has to be followed up with good execution. Here, we acknowledge that 
              CIP has not always been well implemented. Hence, the centre hopes to 
              work with more schools to promote a new approach towards designing 
              community service as a way of life for our students.</p>
              <p>For example, we have piloted programmes like iGlocal, 
              jointly run with the Lien Centre for Social Innovation at the Singapore 
              Management University and United World College of South East Asia. The 
              programme is based on the ethos that CIP should be student-initiated, 
              and that community service projects are more meaningful if students take
               more personal responsibility for them.</p>

              <p>Community service does not necessarily have to be 'volunteered'.... the CIP is a community involvement program - there's no mention about being a volunteer to begin with. It is a program that hope to expose students to the different needy communities and allow them to learn through that.</p>
              <p>A school shouldn't just focus on academic studies - yet when a school takes the students out for 'community involvement' shouldn't that be a good thing? That students learn from their community and strengthen their roles within it.</p>
              <p>The problem lies with what 2nd letter stated: that the intention is good but execution often leaves much to be desired. It's the quantitative approach towards measuring the benefit of a result that end up making the whole thing shallow. The number of hours criteria means busy teachers end up selecting meaningless tasks that does not engage the students just to chalk up the hours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have heard of of some students who may start by being 'forced' to do CIP but were involved in projects that truly engage the youths. They end up enjoying the experience through the interaction with beneficieries, and when they leave school, continue to volunteer on their own time.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Be clear on what volunteerism means</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Friday's letter by Mr Laurence Lien, chief executive 
              officer of the National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy Centre ("CIP has 
              shortfalls but it's a vital gateway to volunteerism").</p>
              <p>Mr Lien is right when he acknowledges that the mandatory 
              Community Involvement Programme (CIP) is not strictly volunteerism, but 
              he is wrong when he says it is a gateway to more volunteerism now and in
               the future. Anything that is predicated on duress, especially in 
              volunteerism and charity, is not given freely.</p>
              <p>Mr Lien asserts that studies in the United States have shown
               that community service in conjunction with service learning is a strong
               predictor of future volunteering. He does not make clear how service 
              learning is obtained.</p>
              <p>Given the strong mindset of the Americans on free will, 
              anything that carries a hint of intruding on their free will does not 
              resonate well with them. Were they forced to submit to service learning 
              as the compulsory CIP? Would they accept compulsory CIP?</p>
              <p>There is a great difference between giving time freely and 
              being forced to give time. While I do not doubt that the CIP is run on 
              good intentions, the point is not how meaningful it is to be immersed in
               it. The point in contention is volunteerism, which cannot be predicated
               on a command to do it. Good intentions do not obliterate the right to 
              the freedom to volunteer. After all, to volunteer means to make a choice
               and the presence of "mandatory" removes the choice.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">NUS study: CIP useful but lacks true spirit</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the letters by Mr Kwan Jin Yao ('Review community scheme in 
              schools') and Mr James Reeves ('Community Involvement Programme'; both 
              July 14), as well as the reply by National Volunteer &amp; Philanthropy 
              Centre chief executive Laurence Lien ('CIP has shortfalls but it's a 
              vital gateway to volunteerism'; July 16).</p>
              <p>The National University of Singapore (NUS) Volunteer Network
               conducted a university-wide study last year to find out key trends and 
              attitudes in undergraduate volunteering. The online survey elicited 
              3,143 responses from both local and foreign students. Here are some of 
              the results:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li> Four in 10 respondents felt that the Community 
              Involvement Programme (CIP) in schools was useful in exposing them to 
              community service. However, a similar number thought the activities they
               had engaged in lacked the essence of community service.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li> Three in 10 NUS undergraduates currently 
              volunteer, that is, at least once within the last 12 months, while 
              another four in 10 have volunteered before of their own initiative 
              (excluding CIP in school). </li>
              <li> 73.9 per cent said they would volunteer if 
              more friends engaged in such activities.
              <p> </p>
              </li>
              <li> Almost half (49.7 per cent) felt community 
              service was best left to personal interest and initiative. </li>
              <li> More than nine in 10 were open to volunteering
               after graduation.
              <p>Our experience has shown that voluntary service, if carried 
              out in the right spirit, can make a tremendous impact on both the 
              individual and the wider community.</p>
