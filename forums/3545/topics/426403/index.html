              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A DOCTOR died from an accidental overdose of drugs at a flat in Jurong 
              East Street 21 in March last year following a similar incident seven 
              months earlier in a hotel room, a coroner's court heard.</p>
              <p>Dr Chew Sung Lock, 45, a resident doctor with SMU Medicare 
              clinic, was found lying on the floor of his unit with the door 
              half-opened but the gate padlocked by a resident on March 29 who thought
               he was asleep. He and his family were living in a house in the East 
              Coast area. The next day, when the neighbour found him in the same 
              position, he called the police.</p>
              <p>Dr Chew's wife had reported him missing on March 29 after 
              she failed to reach him. She was worried about his heart condition as he
               had been taking medication for his stroke, as well as his heart and 
              thyroid conditions.</p>
              <p>At a coroner's inquest into his death on Monday, the court 
              heard that Dr Chew had confided in his wife early last year that he was 
              stressed over his work. He was very sad over his father's death in March
               last year.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Dr Chew, a former stroke patient, was 
              admitted to Changi General Hospital in late July 2009 for overdosing on 
              anti-depressants and sleeping pills at a hotel in Changi. A psychiatrist
               had found that he was not depressed nor suicidal. Dr Chew had checked 
              into the hotel as he had had an argument with his wife and wanted to 
              sleep it off.</p>
              <p>His wife had told police that he was a loving husband and father to their three children.</p>
