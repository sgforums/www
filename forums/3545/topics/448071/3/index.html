              It announced that they have to bring in at least 25,000 new citizens yearly to combat low birth rate, if not the country's population will go into 'recession' by 2030.
              
              Thats a total of 4 x 25,000 = 100,000 FT by the year 2016 !!!
              
              
              If you are smart enough, you'll know their true agenda for bringing so much trash in here.

              <p>At least those who renounced are honest about their feelings.
              Their loyalty has changed due to changing circumstances or

              about this? Is it fair to let them get away with dual citizenship
              when officially it is illegal? Are we closing one eye or two eyes?
              What has been done to cross check with UK and <span>AUSTRALIA</span> and America thos ewho have left for years and
