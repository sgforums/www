              <div class="">By Tessa Wong</div>
              <p>Home Affairs Minister Teo Chee Hean said in Parliament on
              Tuesday that an average of 1,200 Singaporeans had renounced their
              citizenship every year from 2007 to 2011.</p>
              <p>Of this average yearly figure, 300 are naturalised citizens.</p>
              <p>Overall, however, the renunciation rates for both naturalised
              citizens and Singapore-born citizens were low during this period -
              about 0.1 per cent or less.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo said that the reasons for emigration vary. 'Some
              emigrants leave for family reasons - because of marriage, or to
              reunite with family members overseas, while others do so for a
              different living environment,' he said.</p>

              Oh ya, once again try to ignore part of the reasons are themselves the PAP pariahs driving Singaporeans to give up on citizenship.

              <p>im about to give up my sporean citizenship.it has no uses whatsoever.i may live with people who are alien to me but i find what they have in spore is now even more alien to me now.their defence army and economic defence in spore is counterproductive to me both in spore and out of spore by their lack of good spore results.</p>
              <p> after seeing how they "helped" me or helped themselves it made me wonder what on earth is a sporean citizenship about??had it been a war and i was commandeered to go off into battle,i certainly would not have a grave even with them leading the battle and me flung into it like im worth nothing at all to them in poeacetime let alone in a real wartime even.</p>
              <p>good luck n good bye to those in spore.may the force be with u too.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Why this happen is because govt wants to reap profits, replace singaporean voters; employers desperate to maximise their revenue and cut operating costs, hire foreigners extensively.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun feel the govt is really doing anything because the budget or other measures the govt introduced recently has no direct impact on the lives of the majority of Singaporeans. Its another booze and wayang show.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is still no privileges that the govt is putting out to create value for holding the Singaporean citizenship.</p>

              <p>The reason why only 1200 renounce Sg citizenship yearly is because these people have the capability to do so. Other countries protect their citizenship dearly and you must have direct relatives there or you are really elite, if not you are not allowed to stay, period.</p>

              <p>So are you implying that the President having no political power, can dont bother about doing anything for the people? Then why the hell do you need a President for? A perpetual clown for show ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I reckon a lot of other people like me are not inclined to believe even given the power to make policies, that any of the them would have done much shlt to benefit the people anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, Most importantly, Do you even need to be a policy maker to help serve the people?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hell !! Even if they donate 1 million bucks per year is already helping the people !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But are any of the Presidents that charitable ? They are just a bunch of self serving baffoons IMHO.</p>

Are we closing one eye or two eyes? What has been done to cross check with UK  and AUSTRALIA and America thos ewho have left for years and not back?  Are we certain that  our NEW  S'pore citizens have indeed renounced their original citizenships?

              <p>One fact that is neglected is that only 1200 Singaporeans get to
              leave, yet each year foreigners continue to flood in this 700+
              square km red dot by the thousands !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So can one imagine just what kind of cramped up lives are
              Singaporeans leading now ?</p>

              <p>1200 is a lot of people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Probably equivalent to the total number of people in a packed mrt train leaving for good every year.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
