              <p>Politicians are like businessmen, they know how to compete like a cartel when forced to compete.  Besides, it is not physically possible to have 2 govts governing the same country even if they divide the country into 2 because this means spore become 2 country.  For coalition govt where some mins come from the other party, it is still problematic because public policies should not cannibalise one another to be effective.  Shared govt means cannot pinpoint responsibilities and so voters' interests will never be the foremost.  Shadow govt is also wasting money because the shadow cabinet can only be as good as asking students to come up soutions - totally unrealistic.</p>
              <p>Alternative voice is the best because there is somebody to bark at them and pap still have to answer all the problems facing the nation.</p>

              <p>They are all good for nothing.     We are in worst times since independence, thanks to the pok loong for this.     Not long after pok took over as PM heshe greedily raised hisher own salary letting itself to be the highest paid govt in the whole world.   it never look into the mirror to gauge how badly it performs to provide for the nation but only care about itself to be the highest paid govt in the world.</p>

              <p><br>what do u think?</p>
              <p>1)you dont need aircon for 6 mths because its aircon everywhere so no need pay aircon bill for 6 mths.in spore that would be like $1000 free aircon for 6mths.</p>
              <p>2) 17 year old trainees with no job experience are paid $3500/month .an adult singaporean in spore with 20 years experience and even with a diploma from polytechnoic  dont even get that $3000/mth</p>
              <p>3)even the uneducated arrogant vietnamese wife of  vietnmamese butcher who come to australia and both dont speak english can gather $1000 per week from aussie gov  if they have a baby.they collect for many many years till baby grows up.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;might be inaccurate but hey i know nuts about that as im not married only heard theres like thousands of $$$$ given by gov upon baby being born.</p>
              <p>4)and the pork here is like $7/kg if u go to supermarkets that have them on sale almost every week!</p>
              <p>5)I saw a jaguar modern model series 9 parked outside a road with the logo that look like a skull n cross bone thing.selling price on newspaper is like $15k drive away ..only pay insurance n road tax.im currently thinking of collecting a modern white mercedes...but its $35k.cars i need to collect n die b4 i die wou;ld be a white mercedes,a red porsche targa turbo same price as merc and maybe a jaguar 9 series or rolls royce.just collect and keep them in garage.drive them occasionally.is inspired by the engineering and hardwork to create such beautiful elegant cars.</p>
              <p>6)most ang mo girls seem to smile at me in supermarkets and off duty police girl also smile at me outside her police station complex academy.im actually shocked because they look like they want to be my frend or something.i find it strange at times but feel boosted in morale as compared to a vietnamese woman with a baby who go around looking like i owe her a million dollars or something</p>
              <p>7)i collect high interest rates from bank and it has never dropped to 4%/year ever.</p>
              <p>8)there are low grade jobs that pay higher than a lecturer at NUS or engineer at a spore MNC.meant only for people like vietnamese who dun speak or write english properly.they pronounce fuck as puck all the time.they too hate these jobs and one would think they were office workers in vietnam too.</p>
              <p>9)when u have worked enough $$$$$  then u can goto nz and retire in switzerland like condition with the alps snow covered green hills and bright blue clouds........maybe u can dance in open field like the movie in "sound of music".</p>
              <p>10)theres probably more from stopping of effort wasting reservist ippt ,,,,army atheletic remedial trainings.the jungle training for 1 mth is fine for reservist trainings but this 1 year atheletic army trainings to prepare sporeans fit for combat ippt till age 40 or more is too much valuable waste of time for professional people only.</p>
