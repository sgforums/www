              <p>No, this has got nothing to do with MM Lee’s comments about Singaporeans working beyond the retirement age. To deflect all that he said, I only need to ask myself two questions: How many people in the world at age 86, are still actively working? Who and what company would employ a person who is, say, 76?</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tired2010.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-28593" style="border-width: 0px;" title="tired2010" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/tired2010.jpg" alt="tired2010" width="237" height="213"></a>In life, there is a beginning and there is an end. We begin to work when we are young and we retire when we are old. Everything in between is known as “productive employment” and every productive indicator confirms that this productivity begins to wane somewhere between age 55 and 62.</p>
              <p>Beyond 62, a person is like a jalopy. The engine begins to wobble, the chassis corrodes and the car just can’t perform as handsomely as it first rolled out of the showroom. It is not unexpected because every human being who goes through this ageing process will understand. In compassionate terms, medical leave escalates and hospitalization leave prolongs coupled with countless of medical appointment in between. It is a divine reminder that a human being is not infallible, that he is mortal and it is the order of life that he cannot ignore or eschew.</p>
              <p>Hence assuming and calling for an older man to be more productive as he ages is akin to saying that we are growing younger as we are growing older. Hey, I am sorry but the world has not found a Benjamin Button just yet.</p>
              <p>In a fast paced and competitive business environment like Singapore, a company cannot afford to retain workers who are dragging and stalling the engine of the company. If a younger worker is the answer, no company would want to retain a worker beyond his retirement age. This is a fact of life we have to accept without reservation. Hence, the reality is even if a retiree wants to continue working, no amount of legislations can force a company to hire an old man.</p>
              <p>Do we want to deprive or deny those who want retirement?</p>
              <p>Retirement is a joy to be celebrated especially by those who can afford it. After years of dedicated, loyal and committed employment people look forward to retirement with alacrity. Free of encumbrances and a regulated office life for the last 30 years, there are so many passionate things to do during retirement; reading, golfing, fishing, farming, traveling or simply chilling out with friends.</p>
              <p>Yes, enjoy life because life is meant to be enjoyed and an enjoyable life is a better memory to retrieve. People want to retire when they are still strong and fit. They want to enjoy life before, as the Chinese so cynically put it, they surrender their identity card. They might even want to do some grandparenting role for all we know.</p>
              <p>And if I were a rich retiree, I would probably have just returned from the World Cup in South Africa. I would cherish this fond memory because I am not sure if I would survive to live the next four years.</p>
              <p>I know I would never work till I drop because I am very certain that no one would hire me when I reach the grand old age of 76.</p>
