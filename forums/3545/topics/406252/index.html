              <p><strong>New Khoo Teck Puat Hospital helps ease bed crunch at hospitals: Khaw</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 24 July 2010 1133 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The burden on Singapore's other general hospitals is 
              easing now with the opening of the new Khoo Teck Puat Hospital in Yishun
               says Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan.
              <br> <br> He says the results are showing.
              <br> <br> Speaking to the media at the new hospital Saturday morning, Mr Khaw said
               an additional 200 beds have been added to help ease the crunch on 
              hospital beds.
              <br> <br> Furthermore, the Accidents and Emergency Department's seeing more than 
              200 attendances a day while the outpatient clinics are seeing more than 
              800 cases a day.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw said: "The trigger point of all this is no beds in the north. So
               all rush to Tan Tock Seng. It then overflows the problem to other 
              hospitals. Then emergency patients cause problems to the elective 
              patients. This is how the chain of events. 
              <br> <br> "So if you fix the source, and that is make sure there are enough beds 
              in the north and this hospital is the solution to the problem.
              <br> <br> "Tan Tock Seng as we all know has been more than a crowded hospital and 
              occasionally we have had to have diversions, ambulances being sent to 
              the other hospitals, causing problems at the other hospitals and that 
              has eased. It has not been completed eliminated yet mainly because the 
              ambulances have not been coming to this hospital yet".
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw added that ambulances will start bringing patients to the Khoo 
              Tech Puat Hospital from Monday.
              <br> <br> The Minister is hopeful that after next week, the situation would 
              improve further.
              <br> <br> "The new hospital is already busier than the Alexandra Hospital. So 
              Alexandra Hospital therefore will be able to provide a very small relief
               to NUH. So Tan Tock Seng workload has eased a bit. 
              <br> <br> "We all know the waiting problem in Tan Tock Seng. My own target was 
              make sure all patients should not wait more than 10 hours. So last few 
              months, we still have a small percentage of patients and that one is not
               hassle-free. 
              <br> <br> "For two three weeks now, no patients have to wait for more than 10 
              hours and most of them waited less than four hours, three hours. So 
              clearly we can confidently say that the problem has eased, but not yet 
              100 per cent but after next week, I am optimistic that it should be but 
              it will take some time to run in".
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, Mr Khaw also revealed that the Health Ministry is not giving 
              up the old Alexandra Hospital site as yet.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw says if the Aexandra Hospital is closed down immediately before 
              the Jurong hospital opens by 2015, the National University Hospital 
              would suffer the same fate as the Tan Tock Seng Hospital of the last 
              three years.
              <br> <br> The old hospital will be used to prepare for the new Jurong General 
              Hospital in the West.
              <br> <br> The additional beds at the current Alexandra Hospital will also serve as
               a buffer in the event that extra beds are needed.
              <br> <br> On the new Jurong General Hospital, Mr Khaw says the planning is now in a
               very advanced stage and he believes the ground breaking ceremony is 
              likely to take place before the end of this year.
              <br> <br> The Jurong General Hospital is due to open by 2015. 
              <br> <br> He said: "(The Jurong General Hospital team) have taken over Alexandra 
              Hospital and so they actually have a hospital to run which is important.
               That was what we did for KTPH. I told them we want to try new ideas, 
              then let's test them out. So AH was a like a laboratory for the KTPH, so
               likewise AH will be the laboratory for the Jurong General Hospital 
              people.
              <br> <br> With a very strong build up on the population in the Sengkang and 
              Punggol areas, the Health Minister says a site has been identified in 
              that region for another general hospital.
              <br> <br> Mr Khaw who recently underwent a heart by-pass operation says he's about
               80 perc ent fit and his doctors feel its safe for him to do a slow jog 
              at seven kilometres per hour.
              <br> <br> He continues to keep in close touch with his constituents and together 
              with the other MPs in Sembawang GRC, he's also ready for the next 
              general election.
              <br> <br> "I am just taking it easy a little bit because it is still within three 
              months of the surgery. After three months I should be able to resume 
              almost 100 percent. I have started meet-the people session) by Skype. By
               next month I should be able to do proper MPS and I should be starting 
              block visits by September."
