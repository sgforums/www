              <p>WHILE it is gratifying to read that the Housing Board is reviewing the
               rule governing co-sharing of flats by siblings ('HDB to review rule on 
              siblings'; Jan 18), the HDB should also lower the age for flat ownership
               by single citizens by a decade to 25 years of age.</p>
              <p>As Singaporeans adopt a more urbanised Western attitude, it 
              would make sense to accommodate their obvious desire to live on their 
              own.</p>
              <p>Such a move should not be seen as a lack of filial concern 
              for their parents. My two children do not live with me, yet we have 
              healthy relationships.</p>
              <p>Staying out enables young people to grow up and be more 
              independent. It prepares them to be better partners and parents in the 
              future.</p>
              <p>Many parents in our Asian culture still mother their adult 
              children and make decisions for them. Many even impose curfew hours for 
              their single adult children when the latter are well into their early 
              30s.</p>
              <p>We can encourage these young single people to get married by
               providing generous incentives when they upgrade their flats to get 
              married.</p>
              <p>Young adult citizens at an early stage of their careers form
               a large proportion of the group of Singaporeans who face the 
              middle-income squeeze and they would certainly welcome assistance, given
               the stiff property prices.</p>

              <p>yes I think it does ..... if it becomes 21 or 25, we'll see a lot 
              more single ah xias types snapping up units with their family money and 
              holding onto them for rental income. At 21 most guys have just ORD'ed, 
              who else, but those ah xias working for their parents, can afford this 
              kind of money ? .....</p>
