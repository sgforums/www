              <p>I AM confused by the headlines on Tuesday ('50% drop in PR passes granted' and 'Fertility figures hit all-time low').</p>
              <p>I am a British citizen living in Asia for most of my working
               life. My Hong Kong Chinese wife and I chose to become Singapore 
              permanent residents (PR) in 2007, after moving back here in 2004.</p>
              <p>Our son, who has also resided here since 2004, decided to marry his Singaporean girlfriend last year.</p>
              <p>Their wish is now to take the first steps in entering the 
              property market by registering with the Housing Board, and later 
              planning a family in Singapore with a view to becoming long-term 
              residents, and possibly even considering citizenship, in the case of my 
              son.</p>
              <p>Step one is for my son, who is fully employed here and holds a recognised university degree, to apply for Singapore PR status.</p>
              <p>This was duly done shortly after his marriage. The result: 
              His application was turned down. My son and his wife even went to ask a 
              government official to appeal to the Immigration and Checkpoints 
              Authority on their behalf. He was denied again.</p>
              <p>From this, I can only assume that should my son and his wife
               choose to live, work and build a family in Britain, then Singapore is 
              much happier to say goodbye to one of its own rather than welcome one, 
              two or possibly three new citizens from this young and ambitious family.</p>

              <p>wasn't that the plan of the PAP all along? to slowly pile pressure against the locals to force them to colonise other countries.</p>
              <p>The Stayers are bullied into becoming Quitters, and eventually, the PAP's plan to replace locals with cheap obedient foreign imports will succeed.</p>

              <p>I think so, PAPist might take a liking for PRC, India, Mymmar, Philippines and other aisan countries, most will accept low pay for a start and try to move up if cannot, also ok, they will stay and just send money back home. Westerns are more mobile and they are more fickle minded. They are also not so willingly to act in PAPist Foreigner Talent Movie, others asians will. Some asians will also join in to become backstage crew and later become director like LKY.</p>
              <p>Though saying so, some Asians have considered joining us on this Sinkapore Sink, but after comparing, most will just prefer PR status. PAPist policy is doing great harm and will cause this sinking ship to sink faster.</p>
