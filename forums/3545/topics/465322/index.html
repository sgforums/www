              <p>It's becoming really depressing. I got mistaken to be from china daily 3 days in a row (and I'm not even mentioning all the other instances when stupid cashiers repeat their questions in chinese because they think I won't be able to understand them!). It gets worst, because their approaches get more and more unimaginable each time. Once it was an indian man, who asked me straight in the face one night on the streets, "From China ah?" This was tolerable, because after shouting at him, "Where are YOU from? Bangladesh?", at least he apologized, and we ended up dissing the government's rotten FT policy together. But the next one was blood boiling. I was sitting at the back row of a bus, and then this plump broad walked up, and before shamelessly stuffing herself past me into the window seat, she gave me a look of disgust! I don't think I was so improperly dressed to deserve that loh, it was just a V neck tee and jeans and canvas shoes! So judging from past experiences she must have thought I am one of those china construction workers! And even more exasperating is that I tell you even though this broad is young, she is the type of girls I would never be interested in my JC days! Then the next one gets even more dramatic. I was walking in town. Then this 40+year old ugly bastard, came up to me from my side, showed me his blueberry, and asked me in a stupid angmo-acting china accent "shien sheng, ni ke bu ke yi pang wo du zhe ge? (in chinese - mister, can you help me read this sms?)" I asked him what, you think I'm from china ah!? And then he still dared to be arrogant and said you chinese what and gave me that "the question is only whether you can help me read otherwise nvm" attitude! Like as though he's NOT chinese, like as though he's some kind of high class singaporean chinese who is NOT supposed to be bilingual! wtf!  </p>
              <p>It's like I don't even dare to step out nowadays! Anybody here has got the same experience before, please do share. Please understand that this is really distressing. I feel like migrating, but not everyone has the means. I can't say the fault lies with these people. But a portion of singaporean population is really getting rottenly ignorant, immoral and inhumane. Chinese is just chinese. Some of us have darker skin and sharper features, but these things alone do not work to identify our<em> nationality </em>because we are all <em>chinese</em>. Then what, so I have to buy expensive stuffs to distinguish myself? I'm wearing levi's jeans you know. Must it be armani, then they can be satisfied? Or do I need to hire an image consultant, and ask him <em>how do i look singaporean</em>, when I have already paid 2.5 years and counting? You think the <em>real </em>chinaman can't dress up himself? You think the <em>real </em> PRC hooker can't learn the singaporean accent and the ley loh lahs? By discriminating chinese through appearances you are only giving PRCs a chance to hide and blend into our society! At the end, you will be the one to suffer!</p>
              <p>Some people may think this is funny. But its not. How can it be supposed to be like this? If we migrate to Australia, they will say we are 2nd class citizens spurging on them. If we migrate to taiwan, our written chinese is not good enough. And need I mention US and UK? This has got to stop. Dear all, you can do something about it. I was never that special since young, so I dont think I would be now. If you have had similar experiences please share them. And please spread the word around that it is not only wrong but also stupid to discriminate amongst your own race/country people like this. If they have anything against the chinaman bus drivers china prostitutes, they should take it up to the government, not any chinese, like themselves, they see on the streets! </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">If you are one of the prepetrators of this abominable phenomenom, please understand that what goes around comes around, and however much you think you are, you are not white, you are yellow. I don't care if you depended your life on feeling superior, you can feel it however much you want, but you are not supposed to show it! You can be liable for private harassment, and potentially criminal harassment! I just want to walk on the streets without being harassed, is that wrong?</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The country is becoming more and more intolerable by the hour. I'm sure many of you feel the same way. Regardless of whether you are in your teens, in your 20s, in your 30s, 40s and on, do you want to waste your life distinguishing yourself as a singaporean? All of these can be changed if you would just</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> vote the PAP out in 2016! If they were to try any gimmicks prior to the elections (like shortening the qualification time for foreigners to become PRs, or baiting/threatening you with hdb upgrading, free money) please do not fall for it again! Think of the long run I beg of you. There is no sense in this. Yes, they are pushing the GDP up but the problem is population is rising even faster, so we can only have lower GDP per capita! Furthermore, being discriminated as a chinese, just because you look more chinese, is not the only social issue that has arisen from the foreign influx. Think about the PRC bus driver strike. Think about all the noise they make, and their incomprehensible refusal to stop. Think about the lack of space in the library, in the cinema, on the streets forcing you to enclose yourself in that small hdb unit, and thus increasing neighbor conflicts.</span></p>
              <p>Please Singapore. What happened to one people one nation one Singapore? What happened to one united people regardless of race language or religion? To build a democratic society based on <em>justice </em> and <em>equality</em>? To achieve, happiness, prosperity, and progress for <em>our nation? </em>are you <em>happy</em> now? Are you even <em>prosperous</em>? Do you even dare dream of <em>progress</em>? </p>

              <div id=":97">Trouble maker, maybe your trying to console me, and if thats the case i appreciate ur effort. But the thing is i've omitted many details, like very similar past experiences and also the fact that the 40+ bastard actually did reply yes to my claim that he's thinking im from china. And think about it, wouldnt "uncles" who need youngsters to read sms for them be asking for help on english, and not chinese since its notorious that youngsters are failing in and finding mandarin a thorn in the flesh (think "i not stupid2")? Further, to be honest that bastard is probably in his late 30s but im calling him 40+ in anger becos his face is pockmarked. I omitted all these details because the point of my post is not ask for confirmation/analysis, but to ask people with similar experiences to share. There have been similar posts in sgforum, but i hope in here people can spare some time to share more details, and I forgot to add, hopefully discuss some ways to respond appropriately to these mistaken discrimination. In fact initially i get so stunned and angered that I would just keep quiet and behave as I always do. But it just went on and on until i realize i cant continue to take the beating anymore, i have to fight back. Talking abt face... I think that guy in the pic actually look more singaporean than me.. but I'd rather not dwell on this. My point right from the beginning, is that we are all chinese, and you cannot tell the difference. All you would be judging on the is the hairstyle and clothes. Does that mean to say everyday when choosing clothes and hairstyle my primary objective must be to look singaporean? You know how tedious that can get? Not stylish, not expensive, not nice, but "singaporean". Life would be easier if someone would just tell me, "wear this pants, this shirt, this hairstyle, and no one will criticize you for looking cheena"! The problem is not everyone look good in a particular hairstyle or attire. Do we not want freedom in this country anymore?Troublemaker, u have proven enuf that u have some powers of analysis, but i dont wish this post to ensue into a glib battle, so lets just leave it at that ok? People with similar experiences, please continue to post, and do share how you respond/talk back to them, so that we can work together to make life easier for us.</div>
              <div><br>As for 8light, i agree with ur rhetoric. It is NOT RIGHT to discriminate against real mainland chinese. And this is becos parliament made a promise to them in inviting them to the country - that its one of meritocracy, and if you work hard, you get rewarded just like everybody else - and its not fair to promise one thing and do another. But the problem is that the parliament should be acting out the will of the electorate, yet right from the start the electorate has not been agreeing with the FTpolicy, because otherwise there wouldnt be so much complain over it, so what gives? Some rumor says no one knows what goes on in the election, another explanation is that the electorate had unwillingly been threatened and fooled into voting for pap because of the upgrading matters and the preelection freebies. If that is the case, then the government of the day had won its majority because of unconstitutional behavior and should not prevail. It is not right to discriminate against foreigners yet singaporeans should not be blamed. At the end, the mess should be tidied up by the unconstitutional government. It should neither be the foreigners, nor singaporeans, and definitely not me the chinese looking chinese that is suffering. </div>

              <p>if any talk that concerns politics is "politically motivated and unreliable", then there is no point on citizens discussing politics. you can see my motivation. my motivation is that i'm being pushed to a corner and i feel depressed. i rambled on to politics <em>because</em> im feeling depressed, and not the other way round. i know its a high sounding term and using it makes you feel great. but you are spreading salt on wound now. you can say its "politically tainted", because i dwelled onto politics. but what is there to rely? you dont believe dont believe loh. i understand. some things are never credible unless experienced. i wouldn't believe you when you cry pain for being discriminated as stupid. im asking people with similar experiences to share them. you probably never experienced this before, you could even be one of the prepetrators, so.. spare me la, ok?</p>

              <p>if any talk that concerns politics is "politically motivated and
              unreliable", then there is no point on citizens discussing
              politics. you can see my motivation. my motivation is that i'm
              being pushed to a corner and i feel depressed. i rambled on to
              politics <em>because</em> im feeling depressed, and not
              the other way round. i know its a high sounding term and using it
              makes you feel great. but you are spreading salt on wound now. you
              can say its "politically tainted", because i dwelled onto politics.
              but what is there to rely? you dont believe dont believe loh. i
              understand. some things are never credible unless experienced. i
              wouldn't believe you when you cry pain for being discriminated as
              stupid. im asking people with similar experiences to share them.
              you probably never experienced this before, you could even be one
              of the prepetrators, so.. spare me la, ok?</p>
