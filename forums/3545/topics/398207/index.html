              <p><strong>Climate talks in Copenhagen not a failure, but a chance for minds to 
              meet</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 02 May 2010 2157 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The climate change talks held in Copenhagen last year 
              weren't a complete failure but a chance for minds to meet, said Minister
               Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.
              <br> <br> But Mr Lee does not think much will come out from the next round of 
              talks to be held in Cancun, as long as countries like the US, China and 
              India keep to their stand on the issue.
              <br> <br> He was speaking at the 20th annual conference of the Inter-Pacific Bar 
              Association on the theme "climate change and legal practice" - the first
               major event at the Marina Sands Convention Centre. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lee described climate change as something that has real consequences 
              many years down the road. 
              <br> <br> "The biggest problem with Copenhagen (talks) is the US could not commit 
              itself because it has to go through Congress, and the Americans are not 
              prepared to say before hand we commit ourselves to reduction of "X" per 
              cent of our carbon footprint, even if they were prepared to commit 
              themselves," said MM Lee.
              <br> <br> "I don't think the Chinese and the Indians would commit themselves. I 
              see more dilly-dallying internationally with every country focused on 
              its own internal problems. So we are into a very difficult, messy series
               of annual meetings," he added. 
              <br> <br> Elaborating on why climate change agreement did not materialise, Mr Lee 
              said: "The problem is governments; the government stays in power not by 
              promising to cut down growth rates, but by promising a better lifeâ€¦ So 
              the idea of taking tough action now against putting off to the future 
              generation, the result is  - let's put it off and talk about it."
              <br> <br> Climate change was not the only issue participants at the Inter-Pacific 
              Bar Association conference were interested in. They also wanted Mr Lee's
               views on the future of China and India, and whether the Doha Round of 
              talks would move forward.
              <br> <br> "I think the Doha Round is not going to go anywhere as long as this (US)
               Congress will not pass the laws," said Mr Lee. 
              <br> <br> And there was also the often asked question of how Singapore can help 
              countries like China and India develop.
              <br> <br> "The first thing you learn as a small country is to act small and 
              humble. You go around telling people, they say you are out of your 
              depth, you don't understand my problems. So we keep our mouth shut 
              unless we are asked," said Mr Lee. 
              <br> <br> The four-day conference will also discuss the challenges posed by 
              climate change to various sectors such as aviation. - CNA /ls</span></p>
