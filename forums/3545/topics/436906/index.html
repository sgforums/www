              i don't understand what is the purpose of SERS ? after we work so hard to pay off a flat and we want to heave a sigh of relief, one round of SERS come and we have to pack and move.  Worse,  i understand that the flat owner has to pay for the replacement flat for the current market price. Is that true ?  the flat we buy years old can't catch up with the price of the flat nowadays.
              
              Can we appeal to stop SERS in our neighbourhood? We want to relax after the flat is finally paid off...not go on another round of monthly payment.

              Don't forget having to pay interest on a new loan.
              
              Yup, the old flats become either expat apartments like at Tanjong Pagar, or foreign worker dorms like at Kallang.

                  also the price of a flat nowadays is going near half a million, we can't relax as a Singaporean, we must slave till our death for one flat after another ( not our choice).
                  
                  This is so unfair. Why are we forced to move? I am very comfortable with my old flat.
                  New flat sometimes give more problem and the space has shrunk so much compared to the old flat.

              <p>if the purpose is to have more beautiful new flats, then what
              are they doing with the old flats?<br> <br> they're not demolishing it... they're letting private companies
              take over the management of them and renting it out.... take a look
              for yourself... Bedok South blocks 48/49/50.</p>

              <p>actually, they can dun implement SERS at all, lots of ppl willing to pay high price to buy the flats at Bedok Central or Clementi Central or AMK... but for the sake of the current residents and to maximum the  land usage, they implement SERS..but then now the price is too high, so not that worth it... during the 90s, my neighbouring blocks in TPY was the first to be selected under the SERS scheme.. and all the residents are glad to have a bigger flat (4 or 5 rooms compared to 3 rooms) and the price is reasonable then and those residents that bought the 5 rooms flat at S$350 000 at that time were laughing..</p>
              <p>Once all the residents move out, they usually will demolish the old flats immediately but as in the case in TPY (former block 89/136-140/164-167), the lands were left vacant for several years before the new flats are build or land being sold to private developers.. so right now they are smart, they keep the flats for some time and rent out and earn some more income and solve some housing problem, until the time come for the area to be rebuild...</p>
              <p>look at TPY, the old flats were of 11 storeys high.. now they build it to 40 storeys to maximize the usage....</p>

              but i heard that the space shrink.  4 room become 3 room, 3 room become like studio.
              
              Paying more for smaller space.  I still like the old high ceiling spacious flat design.
              
              The issue here is we don't have the choice to stay put. We must move irregardless whether we want or not.  Like being forced.  Sigh !

              <p><br>I am not sure about the shrinking part but mostly is standard flat. 5 rm = 110 sqm, 4 rm = 92 or 85 sqm, and so on.</p>
              <p>Maybe you see shrink might due to the design and layout.</p>
              <p>With the spiral downwards of birth rates, couples will not want to have such a big house, possibly 3 room or 4 room will do. Small house = less costly.</p>

              but you can't rent out more rooms.  3 room unlike 5 room flat, which you can have rooms to  rent out  for extra income when you need it in old age or retrenched, for eg.
              
              what couples prefer smaller flat is nonsense, that's because they can't afford bigger flat.
              
              If the 5 room flat is just 200k to 300k like 10 years ago, you see whether couples will buy or not. Sure all grab big flat.

              <p>Yes, way too expensive for a newly couple who just start working.</p>
              <p>How to afford? Likely the parents have to foot the 1st installment and then couples take up 25 to 30 yr housing loan?</p>
              <p>No wonder couples dont want to have baby. One of the reason ya.</p>
