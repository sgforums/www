              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Singapore's Senior Minister, Goh Chok Tong, has said the emergence of 
              both new media and niche content providers will give rise to an 
              increasingly individualistic or "atomised" society.<br><br>This makes it
               more challenging for policymakers to build public consensus.<br><br>Speaking
               at the TODAY newspaper's 10th anniversary dinner, a star-studded event 
              attended by some of Singapore's leading newsmakers, Mr Goh shared his 
              views on how traditional papers can cope.<br><br>He said the TODAY 
              newspaper has done well, growing its readership by 30 per cent to almost
               700,000 in five years. It has also been profitable since five years 
              ago.<br><br>Mr Goh said: "TODAY's success owes much to its distinctive 
              editorial approach and presentation style. It is a serious newspaper 
              which offers a variety of opinions and perspectives. I may not always 
              agree with them but at least they set you thinking, which is TODAY's 
              motto.<br><br>"I support the newspaper's aim to get its readers thinking
               about the issues of the day - for I believe that only a thinking 
              population who cares about the future of Singapore can sustain our 
              growth and prosperity."<br><br>In a letter to the paper, Prime Minister 
              Lee Hsien Loong said he reads the paper often, and it has been able to 
              present complex news stories into easy-to-understand articles.<br><br>He
               said: "The newspaper takes a balanced editorial stance, and publishes a
               broad spectrum of opinions and commentary. It does a particularly good 
              job of breaking down and presenting complex news stories into digestible
               and easy to understand articles."<br><br>The media environment now is 
              vastly different from when the paper first started 10 years ago. 
              Singaporeans now have easy access to many more sources of news, and they
               are also generating their own news content through social media 
              websites.<br><br>Mr Goh said traditional news providers like TODAY can 
              stay relevant by ensuring they remain accurate and balanced sources of 
              news and by featuring strong local content.<br><br>They can also stay 
              ahead of the competition by keeping up with technology, which is what 
              the TODAY newspaper has done with its new iPad application.<br><br>Lucas
               Chow, CEO, MediaCorp, said: "The TODAY iPad is more than just the 
              online version of the hard copy newspaper. It leverages on MediaCorp's 
              rich multi-media content, offering readers videos from Channel NewsAsia 
              and 'live' radio from 938LIVE. <br><br>"The reason why we're doing this 
              is not because we want to be the first, but because it's our way of 
              engaging with our readers, their changing lifestyles and reading 
              habits."<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p>You will appreciate overseas media more than Singapore if you have a chance to view.   It was an order from Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew that Mediacorp and Mediaworks merge   He backed up by stating that Singapore was too small to have competition between two TV stations, will "kill" each other if they keep it at two.   Who dare defy ?</p>
              <p>PS:   He does not have the same in mind that Singapore is too small for so many foreigners to compete with Singaporeans on jobs.    A no care attitude when it concerns the livelihood of Singaporeans.   Medicorp is an arm of money making "machine" for him.</p>
