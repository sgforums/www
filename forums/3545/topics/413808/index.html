              <p><strong>Rule of law applies to all, regardless of nationality &amp; status: 
              Shanmugam</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 24 October 2010 1757 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Singapore Law Minister K Shanmugam has said that the country applies the
               rule of law to anyone, regardless of the nationality of the person 
              involved, his background or status.<br><br>He was commenting on the case
               involving American citizen, Kamari Kenyada Charlton, who has been 
              charged with overstaying in Singapore and cheating.<br><br>Speaking to 
              reporters on the sidelines of a community event on Sunday, Mr Shanmugam 
              said it is "very unfortunate" that some comments have been made 
              prematurely about Charlton being subject to discrimination.<br><br>He 
              pointed out that Singapore authorities had proceeded according to the 
              law.<br><br>Charlton's former lawyer M Ravi had alleged that Charlton 
              had been subject to discriminatory treatment.<br><br>Charlton was picked
               up when he was attempting to leave Singapore. <br><br>He had overstayed
               and at the same time he was on an Interpol list.<br><br>His name was on
               the list based on complaints that had been made against him by 
              authorities outside of Singapore.<br><br>It is alleged that Charlton had
               cheated elderly Australians through a phone scam operation. <br><br>If 
              convicted for overstaying, he faces a mandatory three strokes of the 
              cane.<br><br>The case has raised some interest in the American media, as
               Charlton could be the first American to be caned in Singapore after the
               Michael Fay case in 1994.<br><br>Charlton's case will be heard again on
               October 29.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam, who is also Second Home Affairs 
              Minister, said: "Anyone who looks at the facts will see this is an 
              investigative process. <br><br>"Of course, this is from the police 
              perspective and the police have made clear that investigations are still
               proceeding, and what charges will be proceeded with in court and 
              whether there are enough facts to justify any particular charge, all 
              these are matters which are not crystallised yet, so it is really 
              premature to jump to conclusions at this stage. <br><br>"We should let 
              the process take its course and even if the charges are proceeded with, 
              ultimately it is up to the courts to decide". - CNA/ms</span></span><span class="update"> </span><img style="visibility: hidden;" src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpVzt6aQ.jpg" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
