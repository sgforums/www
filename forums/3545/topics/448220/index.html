              <p>Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam noted 
              in Parliament on Thursday that some MPs had called for higher healthcare
               expenditure, but said that this would require higher taxes.</p>
              <p>As it is, the Government is already 
              increasing its healthcare expenditure from the current 1.5 per cent of 
              Singapore's gross domestic product to 3.5 per cent by 2030, he said. If 
              Singapore's spending on healthcare go up to 6 per cent of the GDP - 
              which is what Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
              (OECD) countries spend - then it has to raise taxes too, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman said he did not like the term 'first world
               social safety net' used by opposition MP Low Thia Khiang to describe 
              the Budget earlier in the debate.</p>
              <p>If Singapore had a first world social safety net, then this may mean first world taxes, said Mr Tharman.</p>

               It's just a crying shame if  even with the revenue from two casinos and stamp duties from continuous property speculation( thus revenue from stamp duties) we are spending so little for health care for our elderly people. Where does the rest go to?  what';s the break down?  How much of  the total pie spent on remuneration of the civil servants? how much on defence? How much on miscellaneous? Do we need a 3rd casino to improve health care for the old?

              <p>Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam noted in Parliament on
              Thursday that some MPs had called for higher healthcare
              expenditure, but said that this would require higher taxes.</p>
              <p>As it is, the Government is already increasing its healthcare
              expenditure from the current 1.5 per cent of Singapore's gross
              domestic product to 3.5 per cent by 2030, he said. If Singapore's
              spending on healthcare go up to 6 per cent of the GDP - which is
              what Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
              countries spend - then it has to raise taxes too, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Tharman said he did not like the term 'first world social
              safety net' used by opposition MP Low Thia Khiang to describe the
              Budget earlier in the debate.</p>
              <p>If Singapore had a first world social safety net, then this may
              mean first world taxes, said Mr Tharman.</p>

                      When he took over as Finance Minister ,  I had great hopes that more will be done for the old and sick. Afterall I was told that his father was a doctor and a very compassionate one at that.  When government leaders fall sick , they get the best treatment in first class wards. Maybe they should simply spend one night or two  of their one or two weeks stay in hospital ( if they have the chance)  to stay in a 3rd class ward(incognito if that is  possible even) to observe  the patients and their families, and what they go thro. And even then, do not forget that there are others out there who delay seeking treatment at the  hospital because they are afraid they cannot afford the cost! Oh by the way, for those who do not know , 3rd class wards are  still paying wards though subsidized - no free lunch  ok!
