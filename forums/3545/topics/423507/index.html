              <p>I REFER to last Saturday's report ("Changes for firms"), which quoted 
              Mr Ivan Lee, founder of restaurant chain Thai Express, as saying that 
              the rise in foreign worker levy would be passed on to consumers most of 
              the time, which is why prices of food and services continue to go up.</p>
              <p>His remark seems to imply that the Government can introduce 
              any manner of levies and all businessmen need to do is pass on the cost 
              to customers. Any rise in the prices of food and services can, 
              therefore, be attributed to the Government.</p>
              <p>His comment reveals an unacceptable attitude by businesses 
              towards customers and suggests an indifference to the spirit and 
              objective of the foreign worker levy.</p>
              <p>From a customer's viewpoint, such a remark, especially 
              coming from the boss himself, is wrong. I, for one, shall not be 
              patronising his restaurants.</p>

              <p> Dear Mr Gan,</p>
              <p>I empathy your anger on my comments of passing on the costs to the consumers. I can understand the recent food hikes are increasing the expenses of the majority. From a business point of view, it does not make any sense for us to fully absorp the levy as we can coping with the supply side of the costs due to the price hike in chillis, oil and other food ingredients.</p>
              <p>If I can't even cover the costs, my business can go bust and you will never get to taste my delicious foods anymore. Do consider to partonage my chain of restaurants, I will inform my staff to serve you two cup of water FREE. If that is not enough, I throw in one bowl of rice FREE as well.</p>
              <p>Your sincerely</p>
              <p>2nd Man of Thai's Express</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Gan,</p>
              <p>Mr Ivan Lee is running a business, that is to say, he is trying to make a living through self-employment.</p>
              <p>I am sure that restaurauteurs will not cavalierly increase the prices of their fare, knowing full well that customers like you may choose to boycott their business and run off to their rivals.</p>
              <p>However, I also know that there's only so much that restaurant owners can do to absorb rising costs before their earnings drop unacceptably low. If that sounds unfair to you, then please consider how you would react should your own company cut your wages to pay for rising operating costs.</p>
              <p>And be glad that he is upfront and honest about his reasons for wanting to raise his prices, for I am sure that there are many other restaurant owners who are far less forthcoming.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if you are truly worried about the rising cost of eating out, then maybe you should just eat at home.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I REFER to Gan Teck Lee's reponse to last Saturday's report ("Change for firms"), which quoted Mr Ivan Lee, founder of restaurant chain Thai Express, as saying that the rise in foreign worker levy would be passed on to consumers most of the time, which is why prices of food and services continue to go up.</p>
              <p>From a forumite's viewpoint, such a remark, especially coming from a consumer himself, is a waste of newspaper space and shows poor quality response in the local paper as people are just arguing rather than offering suggestions to improve economic and social problems foreign workers bring to Singapore. It exhibits Mr Gan's lack of understanding and pitiful ego over a trivial comment.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean myself, the levy's aim is not to increase the damage, but to improve a local Singaporean's competitiveness again foreign workers in the food and service industry. Most food and service industry are facing shortage of staff, and due to that, a rising levy will mean that most employers resort to passing the buck to the end consumers.</p>
              <p>In this competitive market, we have to relook at the Government's strategy. A good start for the Government is to introduce more "benefits" to hiring locals instead of increasing levy. Levy will only do what Mr Ivan Lee suggested, increase cost of living.</p>

              <p>Think, take for instance, maybe a rich guy from some where else, he's got a big chain in his own country, he comes in, one shot, he opens up maybe 10 franchais resturants, with a very deep pockets, he can at least knocks out some of his weaker immediate opponents.</p>
              <p>With so much different foreigners, he will already have a ready made market. Due to locals interest in eating, they will also try and if the quality is good then they will also be customers.</p>
              <p>By that time, after he have a more sure feel of customers needs, he can also proceed to knock out the rest.</p>
              <p>Those that got knocked out, not all will be in trouble, most have many other business ventures, not necessary food anyway.</p>
              <p>I say give the rich hell, they will give hell to us poor, we will just see who die first.</p>
              <p> The traitor PAP government have given them more than enough, they repaid the country with employemt of foriegners and low wages, depressing wages further, opening up even a wider gap between rich and poor.</p>
              <p>Utimately, business are taking their cue from the government for behaving like jerks and nothing else.</p>
              <p>Even businessmen have no communal love of this country, talk about what else?</p>
              <p>I still rememenber BreadDog which doesn't hire locals, by the way that joker have lots of other franchaise, so even if now I don't eat his shxt bread anymore, will he got bankrupt?</p>

              <p>see the problem with fucking ministers is that they don't do business themselves and they probably don't come from business families. So they have little idea most times about how such an increase of levy can impact on the ultimate consumers.</p>

              <p>at the end of the day, it's either if one is making a profit or a loss. If one is making a profit, it depends on how greedy that person is. Making a profit of $1000 or even $1 is still a profit..this is the standard term of profit. However, some are greedy...they want to maintain the same profit margin which is never possible</p>
