              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">At the annual polytechnic forum today (Sep 18), polytechnic students shoot PAP MP Indranee Rajah with questions over foreigners, university admission, permanent residence and National Service. The polytechnic students are unhappy over the Singapore government for letting in too many foreigners, not having enough university places, jobs for Singaporeans and the purpose of serving National Service when new citizens and PRs are exempted.</p>

              <blockquote style='border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 20px 1.5em 20px -40px; outline: 0px; padding: 20px 20px 1px 80px; vertical-align: baseline; quotes: "" ""; position: relative; background: #f7f7f7;'>
              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">“If you don’t have enough of your own people, then you have to ask people from outside to come in. And that is a very tricky balancing act to do, because you must not have so many people coming in from the outside that your own local, Singaporean core is eroded.</p>
              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">There are sectors that Singaporeans are not keen on working, such as construction. So that is one area where we will still need to have people from abroad to help out with.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">However students were not questioning the intake of work permit holders but rather foreigners with degree qualifications who came to Singapore to accept wages lower than market rate. PAP MP Indranee ended the forum telling polytechnic students not to be xenophobic and be willing to accept more foreigners:</p>
              <blockquote style='border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-size: 13px; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin: 20px 1.5em 20px -40px; outline: 0px; padding: 20px 20px 1px 80px; vertical-align: baseline; quotes: "" ""; position: relative; background: #f7f7f7;'>
              <p style="border: 0px; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.5em; outline: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">“…(I) urge Singaporeans not to be xenophobic. We should be willing to allow people to join the Singapore family.”</p>

              <p>Let me clarify. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">I think there is mis-understanding here.</span></p>
              <p>Yes, I agree that we need people from outside Singapore to come to Singapore to work. </p>
              <p>No, I do not agree that we should let people from outside Singapore come here to take away our jobs.</p>
              <p>Like it or not, I think in Singapore, the number of manpower we need is greater than the number of local population available to work.</p>
              <p>After we employ all of the local population available to work, we still need to hire people from outside Singapore, to make up for the number of manpower that we need but still lack of.</p>
              <p><strong>(by the way, I thought now there is already some kind of practice, that there is a limit in how many percent of foreigners a company can hire? </strong>if the Small and Medium Enterprises are experiencing a shortage of manpower as a result, maybe we should increase the percentage<strong>)</strong></p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, currently, a large proportion of the people from outside Singapore comes from outside South-East Asia. I guess the reason why many of us are not comfortable is because of the difference in culture, because we come from different parts of the world. </p>
              <p>That is why, I suggest that we reduce the intake of people from outside South-East Asia, while increase the intake of people from within South-East Asia, if we have to hire people from outside Singapore.</p>
              <p>If a large proportion of the people from outside Singapore are from the neighbouring countries, maybe many of us would be more comfortable. I assume that since we come from the same part of the world, we share the same culture. Hence, we are more willing to accept people from outside Singapore to come to Singapore, to work with us.</p>
              <p>Well, this is only a suggestion.</p>
