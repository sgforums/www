              <p><span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 31 December 2010 1806 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Singapore's economy grew a dramatic 14.7 per cent for the whole of 2010,
               the best growth on record ever for the country. <br><br>Economists say 
              the last time Singapore saw anything close to this was from 1968 to 1970
               when growth was around 14 per cent.<br><br>Fourth quarter figures came 
              in at 12.5 per cent year-on-year. <br><br>In his New Year's Message, 
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong described the growth as "a dramatic 
              rebound from negative growth last year".<br><br>But he also tempered 
              expectations, saying the results are because of "special circumstances" 
              and are "unlikely to be repeated soon".<br><br>The Ministry of Trade and
               Industry (MTI)'s growth projection was for 4 to 6 per cent next year, 
              much lower than this year. <br><br>Mr Lee noted that the outlook for the
               world economy is mixed and cited among other things, pressures in the 
              US and Europe. <br><br>He said that Asia is however maintaining a strong
               growth momentum.<br> <br>"China and India are forging ahead, and 
              countries in Southeast Asia are growing steadily. Hopefully Asia will 
              continue to do well despite the weakness in developed countries, and 
              create a favourable regional environment for Singa­pore," he said.<br><br>But,
               Singapore has its own challenges - managing inflow of immigrants and 
              foreign workers, the need to keep home ownership affordable and helping 
              low-income Singaporeans cope with the increasing cost of living. <br><br>Mr
               Lee said: "We have the means to tackle these problems, and make things 
              better. But in doing so we must remember to keep Singapore open and 
              welcoming to talent, preserve the value of the flats of 800,000 HDB 
              homeowners, and strengthen the spirit of self-reliance among 
              Singa­poreans."<br><br>He also acknowledged that globalisation has led 
              to a widening income gap in Singapore, a phenomenon also seen in other 
              countries like the US, China and India.<br><br>But in Singapore, he said
               the government strives to ensure the broad majority of citizens benefit
               from growth including the lower-income, less-skilled and sandwiched 
              class.<br><br>He cited schemes such as ComCare and Workfare which are 
              meant to give poorer Singaporeans a leg up.<br><br>For middle-income 
              earners, Mr Lee said the government has lowered income tax rates and is 
              building more executive condominiums to widen housing choices.<br><br>But
               Mr Lee added that the most important programmes are not what he called 
              "financial transfers" from the government but efforts to upgrade people 
              and workers. <br><br>That is why, Mr Lee noted, Singapore has been 
              investing heavily in workers' training and education.<br><br>He cited 
              results of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) as 
              proof that these investments have paid off. <br><br>In PISA, Singapore 
              students ranked among the top five for reading, mathematics and science.
               <br><br>Noting that other Asian economies - South Korea, Hong Kong and 
              Shanghai - had high scores, Mr Lee said that showed the quality of 
              talent in Asia and the competition that Singapore was up against.<br><br>He
               said: "To hold our own, Singapore needs to continue to upgrade schools,
               teachers and pedagogy as well as attract and integrate talent in our 
              society."<br><br>The government has also launched a S$5.5b fund to be 
              rolled out over five years to boost the productivity drive. This would 
              go into funding workers' training and also support for innovation among 
              enterprises. A high-level National Productivity and Continuing Education
               Council was also launched to help drive this national effort. <br><br>Prime
               Minister Lee said other tangibles that influence the performance of a 
              nation include superior teamwork and leadership, as well as having the 
              right Singapore spirit and said Singapore showed some of that spirit 
              during the Youth Olympic Games (YOG).<br><br>"We showed this spirit in 
              the Youth Olympic Games. We came together to organise a successful YOG, 
              despite our small size and the short preparation time. The result was an
               intense, enriching and memorable experience for all...We must nurture 
              and strengthen this spirit which makes Singapore work, and Singaporeans 
              special," he said. <br><br>"With high-quality education, alert and 
              dynamic leadership and the Singa­pore spirit, we can be confident of the
               future. We can overcome challenges that come our way, seize 
              opportunities in a booming Asia and continue improving the lives of all 
              our people. Let us strengthen these fundamentals that underpin our 
              success, and commit ourselves to realise our dreams for our nation," 
              added Mr Lee.<br><br>The Prime Minister wishes all Singaporeans a Happy 
              New Year.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <div class="byLineDateArticle">05:55 AM Dec 09, 2010</div>
              <p>SINGAPORE - While the Republic's pace of economic growth next 
              year is expected to slow to a third of this year's blistering 
              performance, inflation is projected to inch upwards. <br><br> According to a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) survey of 
              economists, inflation will hit 2.9 per cent next year, up marginally 
              from the estimate for this year. <br><br> The forecasts were made before the latest COE prices were announced a few hours later.<br><br> Singapore will likely be the world's fastest-growing economy this 
              year - with the official GDP forecast standing at between 13 and 15 per 
              cent - helped by a rebound in manufacturing and financial services as 
              well as contributions from the new integrated resorts. <br><br> But, even as the growth moderates to a more sustainable level, 
              inflationary pressures will continue - spurred by rising wages and 
              housing costs as well as increasing energy and commodity prices 
              globally.<br><br> Inflationary pressures have already prompted the 
              MAS to tighten its monetary policy twice this year, both at its April 
              and October meetings. It has allowed stronger appreciation of the 
              Singapore dollar to ease imported inflation. <br><br> Inflation in 
              Singapore hit a 28-year high in 2008 - driven by higher cost of food, 
              accommodation, electricity tariffs, petrol, holiday travel and taxi 
              fares - before dropping to less than 1 per cent the following year, when
               the global financial crisis struck.<br><br> Economists noted that,
               this time round, a tight labour market will push up wages which, in 
              turn, is likely to lead to higher prices of food, clothing, 
              accommodation and transportation. <br><br> "Wages are picking up 
              and from a policy point of view, wage-price spiral risks is one ball to 
              keep an eye on," said Mr Vishnu Varathan, Asia Economist at Capital 
              Economics.<br><br> Mr Tai Hui, Head of South East Asia Economic 
              Research at Standard Chartered Bank, pointed out that inflation next 
              year could be as high as 3.4 per cent, driven in part by higher property
               prices and rentals. <br><br> Economists who are expecting 
              inflation to moderate next year are betting that the Government's 
              measures to cool the property market will have an impact on prices and 
              that the El Nino weather effect that crimped harvests in Southeast Asia 
              this year would not be as pronounced in the next twelve months.<br><br> "We're looking for inflation to ease back to 2.6 per cent for 2011,
               but that's on the assumption that oil doesn't go to US$100 a barrel, 
              there's a stabilisation in property prices and there are no food supply 
              problems," said Ms Selena Ling, head of treasury research at OCBC. <br><br> <br><br> MONETARY TIGHTENING, ASSISTANCE FOR LOW-INCOME ON THE CARDS? <br><br> Economists say that the MAS still has room to allow further 
              appreciation of the Sing dollar - which would counter imported inflation
               given that Singapore imports much of its food and oil. With regional 
              currencies also continuing to strengthen, Singapore is unlikely to lose 
              its competitive edge against regional peers, they added.<br><br> Said Mr Varathan: "Even after the policy tightening in October, the 
              inflation outlook has not softened, and has instead edged up modestly. 
              In the context of enduring supply-side price pressures, as is evident in
               higher commodity prices, and demand-pull risks to inflation, we can't 
              decisively say the MAS is done yet," <br><br> The Sing dollar has 
              appreciated by 7 per cent against the greenback so far this year. 
              According to the MAS survey of economists, another 6 per cent 
              appreciation is expected next year. <br><br> Apart from further 
              monetary tightening, Standard Chartered economist Alvin Liew said the 
              Government could help Singaporeans - especially the low-income - cope by
               giving "some kind of assistance... in terms of handouts".<br><br> Said Mr Liew: "I think it will go well; especially we are looking at an election year in 2011."<br><br> Mr Liew noted that the Government could also allow more foreign 
              workers to enter the workforce in the short term "as a cushion for price
               cost pressures".<br><br> Barclays Capital senior regional 
              economist Leong Wai Ho added that the Government might not wait until 
              the Budget - which is traditionally announced in March - to act. Said Mr
               Leong: "One of the things (the Government) can do to limit asset price 
              rises - which is not inflation per se - is actually to implement more 
              cooling measures targeted at the property market."</p>

              <p>(SINGAPORE) Economists now expect Singapore's gross
               domestic product (GDP) to grow 5.1 per cent next year, moderating to 
              just a third of expected growth of 15 per cent this year.</p>
              <p>These 
              median forecasts from 22 economists surveyed by the Monetary Authority 
              of Singapore (MAS) in November were each 0.1 of a percentage point 
              higher than forecasts a quarter ago. The three-monthly survey 
              consolidates professional forecasters' views and does not represent 
              MAS's own.</p>
              <p>Headline growth predictions from the survey are in 
              line with the current official 2011 growth forecast range of an 
              above-trend 4-6 per cent, as well as the official 2010 forecast of 15 
              per cent - which places Singapore among the fastest- growing economies

              Growth might overshoot the forecast too, with the survey predicting a 
              larger than 50 per cent probability that the economy could grow more 
              than 15 per cent this year.</p>
              <p>In this final survey before the 
              close of the year, economists also hiked their 2010 forecasts for 
              manufacturing and financial services growth, but tempered growth 
              expectations for construction, wholesale &amp; retail trade, as well as 
              hotels &amp; restaurants.</p>
              <p>The view that services will power 
              growth next year surfaced in the numbers too, with economists 
              forecasting the strongest growth in financial services, thanks to strong
               capital flows, as well as the robust hotels &amp; restaurants sector in
               2011.</p>
              <p>The opening of more attractions in the integrated resorts
               (IRs) and a buoyant economic outlook bode well for tourist inflows, and
               thus for the tourism-related services segments, economists have said. 
              Of these, the gaming segment in particular could contribute up to 1.7 
              percentage points of next year's GDP growth, DBS economist Irvin Seah 
              said in a recent note.</p>
              <p>Job creation is also expected to benefit 
              from the robust services sector, which could explain why the already low
               unemployment rate forecast of 2.1 per cent this year is expected to 
              shrink further to 2 per cent in 2011.</p>
              <p>On the inflation front, 
              however, economists now expect prices to rise at a faster clip than they
               predicted a quarter ago. The median consumer price inflation forecast 
              for 2011 is now 2.9 per cent, higher than the 2.5 per cent forecast in 
              the September edition of the survey.</p>
              <p>This means that they no 
              longer think 2011 price increases will moderate from this year's median 
              inflation forecast of 2.8 per cent.</p>
              <p>Non-oil domestic exports 
              growth is expected to halve to 12 per cent next year, from the higher 
              base after this year's forecast rebound of 24 per cent.</p>
              <p>With 
              Asia's strong economic recovery and loose US monetary policy prompting 
              investors to seek higher yields here, the Singapore dollar is also 
              expected to appreciate further next year to $1.24 against the US dollar,
               from an expected $1.29 by end-2010.</p>
              <p>Interest rates are expected
               to recover slightly, with economists forecasting a 3-month 
              Singapore-dollar interbank rate of 0.7 per cent by end-2011, compared to
               the 0.47 per cent rate forecast for end-2010.</p>

              <p>According to the updated UBS study ‘Price and Earnings’ released in 
              August last year, Singapore is now the 9th most expensive city in the 
              world (if rents are included). It is the second most expensive city in 
              Asia after Tokyo. (download full study <a href="http://www.ubs.com/1/e/wealthmanagement/wealth_management_research/prices_earnings.html">here</a>)</p>

              <p>Heading the list is Oslo, Zurich, Geneva, Tokyo and Copenhagen. 
              However, the citizens of all the cities which are more expensive than 
              Singapore have higher wages and domestic purchasing power.</p>
              <p>The same study also revealed that Singaporeans have relatively low 
              domestic wages and purchasing power compared to other first world 
              nations and is the lowest among the Asian Tigers.</p>
              <p>While Singapore may have a first world economy and infrastructure, 
              its citizens do not enjoy the standard of living befitting of a first

              increasing number of Singaporeans are struggling to make ends meet with 
              their meager wages which have more or less remained stagnant.</p>
              <p>The median monthly wages of an average Singapore worker is only 
              $2,500 which is far below that of workers in other first world nations.</p>
              <p>Despite the ’spectacular’ growth of Singapore’s economy at 14.7 
              percent last year, the fruits of the growth is not distributed equally 
              among Singaporeans due to the open-door immigration policies of the 
              government which allow the rapid influx of cheap foreign workers to 
              boost the GDP growth artificially while depressing the wages of locals 
              at the same time.</p>
