                   Coast Park</h1>
              <p>By Grace Chua</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>IS A slick from Tuesday's oil spill hit the East Coast Park yesterday,
                   beach-goers were told to stay out of the water and boats were stained 
                  or stranded on dry land.</p>
              <p>By late afternoon, the oil from the collision between 
                  Malaysian-registered oil tanker MT Bunga Kelana 3 and St Vincents and 
                  The Grenadines-registered bulk carrier MV Waily had spread from the SAF 
                  Yacht Club next to the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal all the way to the 
                  chalets in East Coast Park.</p>
              <p>The hulls of boats moored at the yacht club were smeared 
                  with the dark, viscous oil, some of which had become trapped within the 
                  walls of the square marina.</p>
              <p>The club's marketing manager Terence Tan noted that no oil 
                  had been seen on Tuesday morning, when the spill occurred; at lunch time
                   that day, some six hours after the spill, only a thin layer of oil was 
                  in the water at the club.</p>
              <p>But yesterday, receptionists at the club took to wearing 
                  face masks to ward off fumes given off by the evaporating oil.</p>
              <p>Workers from salvage company Singapore Salvage Engineers 
                  were spraying chemical de-greasers in the club's boat launch area to 
                  disperse the oil, but Mr Tan said of their efforts: 'It's like bringing a
                   penknife to a gunfight. The big guns are all out at sea, working on the
                   oil spill there.'</p>

              																				Liew Hanqing &amp; Grace Chua</p>
              <p>SHOWERS over the weekend could impede efforts to contain the oil spill
               from Tuesday morning's collision between two large vessels off the 
              Changi coast.</p>
              <p>Mr Foong Chee Leong, the National Environment Agency's (NEA)
               director-general of meteorological services, said weather conditions 
              over the weekend could result in 'rough seas' carrying more oil patches 
              towards the coastline.</p>
              <p>The collision spilled 2,500 tonnes of crude oil which has 
              been swept towards shore by winds and tides, coating beaches in a 7.2 km
               stretch from East Coast Park's Big Splash water park to Changi.</p>
              <p>Short intervals of rain with thunder are expected this 
              afternoon, with rain also expected in the late mornings and early 
              afternoons tomorrow and Sunday, Mr Foong said.</p>
              <p>At a joint press conference with national water agency PUB 
              yesterday, Mr Foong said conditions over the last two days had not 
              helped things. 'The wind has been blowing the oil slick towards land,' 
              he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Joseph Hui, NEA's director-general of environmental 
              protection, said 'full resources' had been deployed in the clean-up 
              effort.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The oil spill caused by the collision of two vessels 
              at sea on Tuesday has spread to Chek Jawa.
              <br> <br> The area on Pulau Ubin, an island just off Changi Point, boasts of 
              several different ecosystems, as well as plants and animals that are no 
              longer common in Singapore.
              <br> <br> Portions of the oil slick have also affected Changi Beach between car 
              parks 6 and 7.
              <br> <br> Some 700 metres are affected.
              <br> <br> The National Environment Agency (NEA) said it is looking out for new 
              spots, although the situation at East Coast has stabilised. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p>The oil spill from Tuesday morning’s collision between two large 
              vessels has been spotted along a 700-metre stretch of  Changi Beach.</p>
              <p>According to a <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1059580/1/.html"><em>Channel NewsAsia report</em></a>, oil patches were 
              also spotted along Chek Jawa’s 150-metre stretch of its coastal  
              boardwalk, which is popular among nature lovers. Clean up operations are
               underway at these locations.</p>
              <p>Environmental groups are closely monitoring the situation and have 
              expressed concern that the oil slick will hurt  Singapore’s precious 
              coastal wildlife.</p>
              <p>Louis Ng, executive director of activist group <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Animal+Concerns+Research+and+Education+Society&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Animal Concerns Research  and Education Society</a>,

              <p><strong>Beach activities, businesses along East Coast hurt by oil spill</strong><br> <span class="update">By Joanne Chan &amp; Evelyn Choo | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 28 May 2010 2220 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The oil spill is hurting not just the environment - 
              but businesses and activities that centre around the beach.
              <br> <br> Sailors who want to train for upcoming races such as the Singapore Laser
               Trophy, Singapore National 420 Champs and Singapore National Byte 
              Champs have been affected by the beach closures due to the oil spill. 
              <br> <br> Some of the foreign sailors arrived in Singapore early in the hopes of 
              training in local conditions, but their boats have since been docked.
              <br> <br> National sailors preparing for the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) also had to
               move elsewhere.
              <br> <br> "For them, we have shifted our training to the north. We are now at the 
              Raffles Marina, the management there has been very kind to allow us to 
              go over there for our training," said Edwin Low, executive director of 
              Singapore Sailing Federation. 
              <br> <br> Low added that all physical training outdoors has been moved indoors, 
              and gym work has shifted to the Singapore Sports Council.
              <br> <br> Businesses are also reeling from the impact.
              <br> <br> At the People's Association Water-Ventures Sea Sports Club, windsurfers 
              have also been grounded.
              <br> <br> A bicycle rental shop has lost 50 per cent of its customers.
              <br> <br> "Of course, we've been affected. There's nobody even on a public 
              holiday," said the bicycle rental shop operator. 
              <br> <br> He blames the fumes for his business blues.
              <br> <br> But hawkers at the nearby food centres said the fumes were present only 
              at the beginning and still enjoy a steady stream of customers.
              <br> <br> It is also business as usual at Goldkist Beach Resort. The management 
              said it has yet to receive a single cancellation of bookings since the 
              spill. - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <p><strong>Clean-up of oil spill at Changi and East Coast to end soon</strong><br> <span class="update">By Evelyn Lam/Joanne Chan/Evelyn Choo | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 29 May 2010 2015 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The National Environment Agency (NEA) on Saturday said
               that clean-up efforts of the oil spill in East Coast Park and Changi 
              Beach following a collision of two vessels on Tuesday should be complete
               by Sunday.
              <br> <br> The situation in Chek Jawa at Pulau Ubin is also under control, but 
              researchers said there could be long-term effects on the eco-system.
              <br> <br> It was a quiet affair for volunteers and workers, all trying to nurse 
              Chek Jawa back to health.
              <br> <br> The oil spill had seeped into the island on Friday, and they have been 
              working since then.
              <br> <br> Dong Kum Sang, volunteer, National Parks Board, said: "This morning, we 
              were here at 7am, right up to almost lunch time. We were at the mangrove
               site. It was not that bad, it seems to be improving."
              <br> <br> Authorities said the eco-system was not severely damaged.
              <br> <br> Andrew Tan, CEO, National Environment Agency, said: "As of today, most 
              of it has been cleaned up. 
              <br> <br> "The National Parks Board, working together with groups such as the 
              Tropical Marine Science Institute and the Raffles Museum of Biodiversity
               Research, have been working hard to make sure that there is minimal 
              environmental impact itself. 
              <br> <br> "So I think, barring any unforeseen circumstances, I would say that the 
              situation in Chek Jawa is under control."
              <br> <br> Researchers, on the other hand, warn of long-term effects.
              <br> <br> Peter Ng, director, Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, said: "We 
              have not seen mass kills, but I am sure some are affected. (In the) 
              longer term, the oil will affect the animals and plants in different 
              ways. 
              <br> <br> "It may reduce the reproduction, it may reduce the growth rate, it might
               reduce their strength. And that has long-term implications."
              <br> <br> The public can still visit Chek Jawa, but there will be no guided walks 
              in the next two weeks, to allow the NEA to monitor the situation.
              <br> <br> The slick has also spread to Malaysian waters, to the east of Pulau 
              Tekong.
              <br> <br> Malaysian authorities have been informed and Singapore's Maritime and 
              Port Authority and NEA are offering assistance.
              <br> <br> Back at Changi Beach, more areas have been hit by the spill. Car parks 
              one to four were the latest zones affected.
              <br> <br> But Mr Tan said that the clean-up operation is on track.
              <br> <br> He said: "Barring any new oil patches that hit our coast, we should be 
              cleaning up most of East Coast Park and Changi Beach by tomorrow."
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, authorities said they will continue to monitor the situation 
              closely. - CNA/ms</span></p>

              <p><strong>East Coast Beach, Changi Beach clear of oil stains</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 30 May 2010 1929 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: There's good news on efforts to contain and clean up an
               oil slick caused by the collision of two vessels in Singapore.
              <br> <br> The spill came from the Malaysian-registered tanker MT Bunga Kelana 3, 
              which was carrying nearly 62,000 tonnes of crude when it collided on 
              Tuesday with the MV Waily, a bulk carrier registered in St Vincent and 
              the Grenadines. About 2,500 tonnes of crude leaked from a gash in the 
              double-hulled tanker.
              <br> <br> Authorities said on Sunday that the slick, which closed public beaches 
              on Singapore's eastern coastline, has been mostly contained. Waters off 
              East Coast Beach and Changi Beach are now clear of oil stains.
              <br> <br> The National Environment Agency (NEA) said there are also no oil patches
               visible at sea. The agency said the petroleum-like smell at both 
              beaches is now hardly detectable.
              <br> <br> But work is still underway to clear the 60.4 tonnes of contaminated sand
               removed from the affected beaches. The contaminated sand will be 
              disposed off at the Semakau Offshore Landfill.
              <br> <br> Since Wednesday, nearly 500 workers have been mobilised to clean up the 
              oil on the affected beaches.
              <br> <br> Though the situation is improving, NEA said that the two beaches will 
              still be closed pending ongoing checks on the water quality, which is 
              expected to return to normal in a few days.
              <br> <br> Till then, the public has been advised to refrain from swimming and 
              engaging in water activities.
              <br> <br> But some beach-goers were already having a go. One of them said: "We 
              were looking at the beach and it seems that they have cleared up most of
               the oil stain, so we thought that it is ok to go back into the water." 
              <br> <br> "I don't think the water is that bad. The past two days, I have also 
              been sailing. I came back with some oil slick on the board and on the 
              sail....just do some cleaning. I think that will do," said another.
              <br> <br> Beach-goers were also heading to unaffected areas like Pasir Ris. "We 
              were supposed to go to East Coast Park to have a barbecue, but in the 
              end we moved here because of the oil spill."
              <br> <br> The NEA added that cleaning efforts at the vulnerable natural reserve at
               Chek Jawa were also almost complete. "At Chek Jawa, 98 percent of 
              cleaning is complete. Only small patches of oil film are visible on the 
              water surface," the agency said.
              <br> <br> But oil absorbent booms are in place to minimise the impact on the 
              eco-system.
              <br> <br> Visitors can still go to Chek Jawa, but guided walks have been suspended
               for two weeks (from 29 May) to allow NParks to better monitor the 
              situation.
              <br> <br> The NEA said it will continue to carry out surveillance at East Coast 
              Park, Changi Beach and Pulau Ubin. 
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the damaged vessel has been moved to a Johor anchorage.
              <br> <br> And the Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) of Singapore said containment 
              and
              <br> clean-up efforts will continue.
              <br> <br> The MPA said that further patches of oil slick were observed in 
              Malaysian waters and in the Traffic Separation Scheme to the east of 
              Singapore by passing ships and aircraft on Sunday.
              <br> <br> Malaysian counterparts have been informed and MPA is offering assistance
               in line with the Standard Operating Procedure for Joint Oil Spill 
              Combat in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.
              <br> <br> Separately, no oil slick was reported in the Traffic Separation Scheme 
              (TSS) off Changi East or within the anchorages of Singapore's port 
              waters.
              <br> <br> Isolated patches of oil with debris were sighted in the waters just 
              outside SAF Yacht Club and Changi Naval Base but were promptly cleaned 
              up. 
              <br> <br> The MPA said that the possibility of small isolated patches of oil with 
              debris surfacing remains and that response craft remain in place ready 
              to deal with any oil patches.

              <p><strong>MPA says efforts to clean up oil spill show "positive results"</strong><br> <span class="update">By Claire Huang | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 31 May 2010 1824 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Maritime and Port Authority (MPA) has said efforts
               to contain and clean up the oil spill from a collision at sea last 
              Tuesday have shown "positive results".
              <br> <br> Waters from Changi Naval Base to East Coast Park are clear of any oil 
              patches.
              <br> <br> MPA said that as of Monday, there has not been any report of oil patches
               in the Singapore Strait south of Changi.
              <br> <br> So far, traffic in the Singapore Strait has remained unaffected.
              <br> <br> MPA, however, cautioned that there is a possibility of small isolated 
              oil patches with debris surfacing.
              <br> <br> It added that it will continue to monitor the waters closely and carry 
              out clean-up work if necessary.
              <br> <br> Currently, the various craft involved in the containment and clean-up 
              efforts remain deployed at sea round-the-clock.
              <br> <br> MPA said it will continue to work with the Indonesian and Malaysian 
              authorities, in line with the Standard Operating Procedure for Joint Oil
               Spill Combat in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore.
              <br> <br> It has also offered assistance to the Indonesian and Malaysian 
              counterparts, should it be needed.
              <br> <br> The public can contact MPA's 24-hour Marine Safety Control Centre at 
              6325-2489 to report any sighting of oil slick in Singapore's waters or 
              coastlines.

              <p>By 
              																				Amresh Gunasingham</p>
              <p>BEACHES in the east were opened again yesterday, more than a week 
              after they were closed following an oil spill off the Changi coast.</p>
              <p>The reopening of the beaches in Changi, East Coast Park and 
              Pasir Ris comes after days of testing the water in the affected areas, 
              which have been given a clean bill of health, the National Environment 
              Agency (NEA) said yesterday.</p>
              <p>It added that all water activities could now be resumed.</p>
              <p>The waters had been closed since May 25, when an oil slick 
              caused by a collision of two large vessels off Changi had spread to a 
              10km stretch of the eastern shoreline.</p>
              <p>When The Straits Times visited East Coast Park yesterday, 
              there was a mix of revellers splashing about in the water on an overcast
               afternoon and other beachgoers who preferred to play it safe, opting to
               tread carefully on the sand instead of taking a dip.</p>
              <p>Although the water appeared clear of oil, the beach was 
              dotted with black tar balls and twigs - enough to put some off taking to
               the water.</p>
