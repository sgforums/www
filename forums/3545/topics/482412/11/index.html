              <p>Nothing to discuss there about it because he is offering Taiwanese Hokkien Lessons and he did not lie that he is going to offer Local Hokkien Lessons what. so whoever is interested can attend mah.</p>
              <p>My dear sis, for every Singaporean who says that they dislike Tw Hokkien will equally in numbers meet with a Taiwanese who will say they dislike Sg Hokkien because to them Sg Hokkien contains a handful amount of Cantonese, Teochew, Peranakan Malay, English, Hainanese loanwords and sentence patterns.</p>
              <p>Also the history of formation of Hokkiens is different in Taiwan and Singapore, therefore of course there will be tonal patterns which are different.</p>
              <p>Let me give a short glimpse:</p>
              <p>China Hokkien had been moving to Taiwan even since the Ming Dynasty in huge numbers and the mass migration started from Ch'ing Dynasty. However in SE.Asia it was small numbers in Ming and Ch'ing and only gained significant momentum after Ch'ing collapsed. Our history of Hokkien in Sg is definitely shorter than that of Taiwan. And furthermore those small numbers that came here in the Ming period has already been acculturated into the Straits/Peranakan ethnic group already and cannot be counted as true Hokkien speakers.</p>
              <p>After the 1949 takeover of Communist in China, China launched various campaigns to destroy local languages. Before Communist takeover of China, there was already an exodus of Hokkien literati (that time called æ›¸å¡¾) to Taiwan due to the turmoil in China between the Kuomintang and the Communist struggle for power. This resulted that education level in China were not high during the takeover period and later the banishment of intellectuals across China during Cultural revolution, the uneducated masses has been misled into thinking speaking local languages is a sign of  "backward" behaviour due to government brainwashing.</p>
              <p>Those Kuomintang who crossed to Taiwan at 1945 did not immediately stop Hokkien language, it was due to a gradual process because the people who held power in Kuomintang were northerners (incld. Wu speaking areas). They actively propagated Mandarin so that they "feel" they stay in power. These populations who crossed over to Taiwan from 1945 can be identified roughly 15% of current Taiwanese population, however they did a lot to stop Hokkien from being propagated in education and later on in gradual steps in the media. However as the standards of education in Taiwan is quite high all along (because when the Ch'ing dynasty collapse and after that, lots of literati left Hokkien province for Taiwan and bought the traditional Hokkien education to Taiwan and saved the destruction of Hokkien education from the Communist China), the awareness of Hokkien is much higher in Taiwan than in China or in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, much more similar to China, most Hokkien people who arrived here in Ch'ing period are non-educated and mostly villagers and fishermans and coolies, therefore they were not aware of the precious mother tongue being forcefully shamed by the government after the new independent government took over. To them, learning the language of the "officials" were more important than preserving one's own "mother tongue" as it brings "food" onto the table.</p>
              <p>This is how the government in 3 different countries took away the rights of the mother tongue.</p>
              <p>What is different is the Hokkien literati who arrived in Taiwan after fleeing the political turmoil in China had taken root in Taiwan and helped survived the traditional <span style="line-height: 1.231;">æ›¸å¡¾ Hokkien education which has been destroyed in China.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">traditional </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">æ›¸å¡¾ Hokkien education </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">had not had enough time to take root to mature in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia Hokkien communities before</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I) the Singapore government took steps to eradicate dialects<br>II) Malaysian government took steps to play political disharmony between different dialect groups in malaysia such that the chinese community were forced to unite themselves by setting up mandarin schools, and<br>III) Indonesian government took steps to eradicate all forms of Chinese indication in the society under Soeharto.</span></p>

              <p>Part II:</p>
              <p>From the Ming and Ching dynasty onwards, the Hokkien who arrived in Taiwan tend to stay together in their different local varieties.  Example: the Chuanchew speakers (incl Ankhway, Engchoon, Lam'Ua) and Amoy people tend to cluster in the north (current Taipei and the west coast) while the Chiangchew speakers (incl Chiau'An, LengNga) tend to cluster in the central and the south.</p>
              <p>What came the next disatrous event for Hokkiens in Taiwan is the exodus of Mainlanders after 1945 who came with Kuomintang families. The power people took their political base in Taipei and built the Kuomintang government based in the north. In Taiwan Hokkien history, it is known that Taipei Hokkien speakers were among the 1st to give up speaking Hokkien and turned to the government language Mandarin. That means the Amoy, Chuanchew, Ankhway, Engchoon, and Lam'Ua speakers were the first and foremost who gave up their mother tongue due to the stronger presence of the Kuomintang Mandarin government in the north.</p>
              <p>The Central and South who were more Chiangchew, Chiau'An speakers were spared from this initial language shift which happened to the Amoy, Chuanchew, Ankhway, Engchoon and Lam'Ua speakers in the north. As Taiwan transits to a more democratic society in the 80's, the Northern Taiwanese had already lose their ability to speak Hokkien. The current strength of the Taiwanese language movement hence had to come from the Central and the South, which are more Chiangchew and Chiau'An based Hokkien.  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">This is the VERY reason that you feel why Taiwanese Hokkien is not very familiar to our ears.</span></p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because what happened in Singapore Hokkien is exactly the opposite. In Singapore, there were not only Hokkien immigrants but Teochew, Hainanese, Cantonese, Hockchiew, Henghua, Hakka as well.  A rough estimate would be if there were 100 Chinese, 40 are Hokkien, 22 are Cantonese, 20 are Teochew, 6 are Hainanese, 6 are Hakka and the rest are others.   Out of these 40 Hokkiens, perhaps an estimated 25 are Amoy/Chuanchew type and 15 are Chiangchew/LengNga type.  Why did the Singapore Hokkien turned out to be more of Amoy/Chuanchew type is because of these initial difference in numbers. Secondly, the Chuanchew type specifically possessed more similar traits in Vowel qualities to the Teochew dialect and facilitated the Teochew people using Hokkien as a common language easier compared to Chiangchew type. So much so the the Amoy/Chuanchew type turned out to be the stronger influential language in Singapore and the Singapore radio stations, TV programs in the past and Rediffusion had used the Amoy as the Hokkien standard variety for Singapore.</p>
              <p>Therefore to Singaporeans, Taiwanese Hokkien <span style="text-decoration: underline;">now</span> sounds different but whereas in the past, it was actually Taiwanese Hokkien should sound = Singaporean Hokkien, because in the past, the northern Taipei were populated by Amoy speaking peoples.  However, these Amoy speakers were also the first ones to give up their mother language and switched over to the language of the northern mainlander new government which was mandarin.  Nowadays it is said that in Taipei you can't hear any Amoy Hokkien spoken by people below 70 years old.  To hear Hokkien you have to go countryside in the south where young people still speaks Hokkien (but it's Chiangchew type Hokkien)</p>

              immediately stop Hokkien language, it was due to a gradual process
              because the people who held power in Kuomintang were northerners
              (incld. Wu speaking areas). They actively propagated Mandarin so
              that they "feel" they stay in power. These populations who crossed
              over to Taiwan from 1945 can be identified roughly 15% of current
              Taiwanese population, however they did a lot to stop Hokkien from
              being propagated in education and later on in gradual steps in the
              media. However as the standards of education in Taiwan is quite
              high all along (because when the Ch'ing dynasty collapse and after
              that, lots of literati left Hokkien province for Taiwan and bought
              the traditional Hokkien education to Taiwan and saved the
              destruction of Hokkien education from the Communist China), the
              awareness of Hokkien is much higher in Taiwan than in China or in
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, much more similar to China, most Hokkien people
              who arrived here in Ch'ing period are non-educated and mostly
              villagers and fishermans and coolies, therefore they were not aware
              of the precious mother tongue being forcefully shamed by the
              government after the new independent government took over. To them,
              learning the language of the "officials" were more important than
              preserving one's own "mother tongue" as it brings "food" onto the
              table.</p>
              <p>This is how the government in 3 different countries took away
              the rights of the mother tongue.</p>
              <p>What is different is the Hokkien literati who arrived in Taiwan
              after fleeing the political turmoil in China had taken root in
              Taiwan and helped survived the traditional <span style="line-height: 1.231;">æ›¸å¡¾ Hokkien education which has been destroyed
