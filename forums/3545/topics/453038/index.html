              <h2>Bloomberg: 70 percent of jobs created in Singapore went to foreigners last year</h2>
              <p class="date">Posted by temasektimes on May 25, 2012</p>
              <p class="date">Foreigners appeared to have benefited more from Singapore’s booming 
              economy than Singaporeans, according to shocking statistics revealed by 
              Bloomberg.</p>
              <p>In an article published today, Bloomberg revealed the majority of jobs created in Singapore last year went to foreigners and not locals:</p>
              <p><strong>“Of the 122,600 jobs created in Singapore last year, about 70 percent, or 84,800 positions, went to foreigners.”</strong></p>
              <p>The percentage of jobs going to Singapore citizens is likely to be 
              less as the country lumps citizens and PRs under the same category of 
              ‘locals’ in all its statistics.</p>
              <p>Despite the wide discrepancy in the number of new jobs going to 
              Singaporeans and foreigners, Singapore’s unemployment rate remains low 
              at around 2.5 percent.</p>

              <p>On 26 May 2012, Western Australian Times reported that Spore has 7000 MNCs and 3000 chinese and indian companies operating.  If we assume each co has 80 employees, that means the presence of these 10,000 cos would have 800,000 jobs.  Now from my memory, spore has 1m foreign workers and some 300k on employment and S passes(some kind soul who could please confirm these figures).  Obviously, we can see that these foreign companies still provide several hundred thousands jobs for sporeans on top of coming here to contribute to the economy in the forms of rentals, leases, supplies, food and beverages, tpt, etc which our local SMEs benefits - of which many oppo are SME bosses! </p>
              <p>Of course, there will be some of us making less income from these employment and S passes but that is not the point.  However, I seem to get this contention about foreign nationals here which is totally wrong.  Even if these 10k cos here do not provide jobs to sporeans, they still provide jobs to sporeans thru the local firms because of more businesses.  If spore does not welcome them, and so they operate in somewhere else, spore will not get any of these additional businesses and would not be able to support the additional jobs.</p>
              <p>However, for smaller cos and local companies, they might cheat on the quotas and that is up to us to alert enforcement agencies.  My main suspicion is mainly our own local businesses as they also like foreign employees.  Sometimes the infringing might not be the bosses - it could be because some of the managers are foreigners and would prefer their own people - so  it is up to us to alert if we come accross but please do not any how allege without proof as sg govt agencies need proof to enforce - otherwise spore will be a jungle without laws!</p>

              <p>How many singaporeans want to clean toilets or wash dishes or clear rubbish?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The more people you import into the country, the more of these low end jobs will be created.</p>

              <p>Don't be fooled by the "many jobs created but no singaporean wants to do them" reason they try to psycho you with.</p>

              <p>How often do you hear about high end jobs like biotech or engineering jobs being created now? </p>

              <p>It's the easiest way to increase GDP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just import more and more people.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>People need to eat and crap and do what human beings need to do everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last time when population was just 4 million, everything was running nice and smooth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You never hear much about low wages or jobs that no Singaporeans want to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everybody had a decent job and was happy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then suddenly more and more people started to live in the country - and these people needed to eat, crap and fulfill their basic human needs.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So the bak ku teh store suddenly had more customers and needed to employ another worker to cater to the demand.  Voila, one job created.  But wait, every Singaporean already had a decent job already.  So, who will fill this new job created? Get one of the foreigners to do it lor. This is the same for other food stores as demand for food increased.  So voila, even more stall assistant jobs created. How to fill the position? Hire more foreigners lor.  And at low wages some more.  Then all these extra foreigners also need to eat right? Increase demand for even more food, clothing, basic goods and services like cutting hair,  buying groceries and stuff etc. Voila, even more jobs created.  But mind you, all these jobs are all low level service jobs - no need to have a phd to wrap your nasi lemak or sell you the latest detergent from ABC company. So you see how come every year, there are seemingly thousands of jobs created but no SIngaporeans willing to do them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And then when times are bad and companies start retrenching, those Singaporeans with no more good jobs have to start looking for lower level jobs to feed their family and so they look at the low level stall assistant jobs and cleaning jobs which pay like a few dollars an hour and shake their heads. How to pay the high mortgage loans with the few dollars an hour job? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But too bad.  All the salaries for low end jobs already depressed and cannot be pushed up any more due to the existence of very cheap foreign workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So end up complain lor.  During election kpkb lor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But can't blame them, they do so much for the country and do NS and pay taxes but in the end, they get a lousy deal. And get labelled as complainers or choosy or whiners.</p>
