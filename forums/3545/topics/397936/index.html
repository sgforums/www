              <p>While the Restaurant Association of Singapore mulls over whether to 
              introduce tipping<strong>, </strong>Lisa-Ann Lee wonders if the move will 
              (finally) improve service standards. With additional reporting by Kurt 
              Ganapathy, Arman Shah and Darryl 
              Koe.</p>
              <p>It’s one of those questions that never fail to spark a debate: To tip or not 
              to tip? For as long as anyone can remember, Singapore, like many other Asian 
              countries, has always been a tip-free zone. Indeed, in the ‘70s, it was 
              precisely because the government wanted to eradicate tipping that the 10 percent 
              service charge was introduced. Lately however, this looks set to change. While 
              they may be in the minority, a few cafes and restaurants have already begun 
              waiving the service charge. The Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) has 
              also been studying how tipping works in the US for several years and while 
              studies are still in the preliminary stage, it hopes to see how tipping might 
              help improve service standards here. Currently the 10 percent service charge 
              that customers pay in restaurants goes to the owners and helps cover staff’s 
              salaries and miscellaneous expenses. It is hoped that if the money goes directly 
              to the servers, this will motivate them to provide better service.<br>RAS 
              general manager Fong Kwok Shiung acknowledges that implementing it won’t be easy 
              in Singapore since the notion of good service is a subjective one. “It depends 
              on the diner’s perspective and as such, the yardstick can be quite varied. Also, 
              while studying the scene in the US, we noticed a problem—and that is as long as 
              you give the customer a fork and spoon, and a glass of water, it is considered 
              good service. We need to see how we can implement it so that service staff are 
              tipped for good service, and not just for performing their duties.”</p>
              <p><strong>Tipping: Will it really take off? </strong><br>However, while the 
              idea of tipping might sound good on paper, many of those working in the 
              restaurant industry are ambivalent about whether it will actually work here. 
              Simon Phoon, a cook at Western café Food for Thought in Bugis and a seven-year 
              veteran in the industry, believes that tipping is a step forward but only if the 
              money collected goes back to the staff. “In my previous company, the management 
              used to cut into our tips to pay for repairs and other miscellaneous things.” 
              For others, the biggest obstacle lies in the fact that unlike the US, tipping is 
              not part of the culture in Singapore. Says Willin Low, chef-owner of Wild 
              Rocket, “I am not sure [this will take off] unless the government runs a 
              campaign to encourage tipping! Even then I don’t know if that will be effective 
              becauseâ€¯culturally Singaporeans rarely tip and I think it is very hard to 
              convince them to do so.”<br>Others point to Singaporeans’ money-pinching ways. 
              Asks Edina Hong, co-owner of Saint Pierre, “How do you expect customers to tip 
              the wait staff when they’re asking us for a discount or requesting that we waive 
              the corkage?” Nick Iman, co-owner of The Smoke Shack in Tanjong Pagar, says 
              simply, “I don’t think Singaporeans will do this because we’re too cheap.” 
              <br>Customers we interviewed also had mixed feelings about replacing the service 
              charge with tipping. Understandably, those with experience in the service 
              industry were more inclined to look favorably upon the idea. “From a service 
              point of view, I definitely think tipping is a good idea as servers will now 
              have an incentive to work harder and provide better service,” says flight 
              steward Rishibaraj Mohan. “But honestly, I don’t think Singaporeans are 
              appreciative enough to start tipping. Some will, but the service must be 
              ridiculously excellent (like a free drink on the server’s tab) for a Singaporean 
              customer to voluntarily tip a restaurant.”<br>And then there are those like 
              events executive Winnie Eng who feel that the service charge should remain and 
              that tips should be given at the discretion of the diner. “Servers should be 
              passionate about their jobs, and they shouldn’t just provide good service 
              because they think they will be tipped,” she says. Student Lim Chu Ern feels 
              that the poor standards of service in Singapore don’t warrant replacing the 
              service charge. “Why should I reward service staff for doing such a terrible job 
              of something that they ought to be good at? People will naturally tip if they 
              feel the service is worth it. There’s no need to make it a fixed rule to do so.”</p>
              <p><strong>Beyond monetary gains</strong><br>But even if tipping were to gain a 
              foothold in Singapore, many feel that it takes more than monetary incentive to 
              improve service standards here. Indeed, the latest customer satisfaction survey 
              conducted by the SMU’s Institute of Service Excellence shows the country lagging 
              behind rivals Hong Kong and South Korea, with satisfaction levels for the 
              restaurant sector dipping for the third consecutive year. For some, this sad 
              state of affairs is hardly surprising and can be attributed to the lack of a 
              service culture. Says Jay Hequet of Fou de Fafa, “Good service isn’t just about 
              smiling and greeting a customer. There is an inner part of service that is part 
              of one’s culture, that is, you are taught from a young age how to serve and make 
              a visitor to your home feel welcome. For someone who’s been brought up in such a 
              culture, providing good service comes easily.” Her solution for this? 
              Incorporate the notion of service as part of people’s education in schools so 
              that it comes more naturally to them when they enter the industry. <br>But by 
              far, everyone we spoke to agreed that the most pressing issue that needs to be 
              addressed is the image of the service industry. Says Ben Bousnina, general 
              manager of Rasa Sentosa Resort, “Working in the service industry is not a 
              blue-collar vocation that anyone can do. We need to change the image of service 
              personnel and draw people who have the aptitude and the right attitude. Service 
              is an attitude. Good service is good not because of the act of the service, but 
              the thought behind it.”<br>However, attracting the right people is easier said 
              than done. As Hong points out, “The ones who can give good service—we’re talking 
              about those who like to meet and talk to people—are not in this industry. 
              They’ve all become doctors and lawyers. You will never get them because service 
              staff here are treated so poorly.” As such, many believe there needs to be a 
              change in the public’s mindset if things are to improve. Says Low, “I think we 
              need to have a mindset change at three levels. First, business owners need to 
              take action to ensure that service staff are trained and taught that proper 
              service and politenessâ€¯should be a way of life. Second, service staff must be 
              made to feel that their job is just as respectable as any other so they can take 
              pride in their jobs and do it well. Third, customers must treat service staff 
              with respect. If you were to go to someone’s house to eat and they serve you, 
              would you be rude to them?”<br>Would it help to increase the pay of service 
              industry workers? Hong believes that though this sounds ideal, it is not without 
              its own problems. “If you pay people better, you have to start charging a higher 
              price and the expectations of customers will also increase in turn.” <br>Unlike 
              the retail industry which has GEMS, a movement set up to improve service 
              standards in the retail industry, the F&amp;B industry has no such program. Will 
              it help to implement something similar? The opinions are mixed. While many 
              acknowledge that implementing such a program is a step in the right direction, 
              some like Hequet question whether it will actually change anything. “We have to 
              look at what we want to get out of it and whether it’s results driven. If it is 
              done on a superficial level, meaning that all you do is give out stars, it won’t 
              really change things at all. Someone who’s really good at giving good service 
              will have no problems being “Employee of the Month” but what about the rest of 
              the staff? However, if it is done on a deeper level, and it is accredited, then 
              yes, it will be helpful.” <br>To return to the question: Can service standards 
              here be improved? While solutions abound, it looks like the answers are far from 
              easy. What is certain, however, is that something has to be done soon if we 
              don’t want to keep lagging behind our Asian neighbors. While the RAS may still 
              be gathering feedback from its studies, at least there’s hope that change is 
              slowly, but surely, taking place. The point to be made about tipping is that 
              it’s not really about the money. It’s about showing that you appreciate your 
              server, as many of those in the service industry whom we interviewed have 
              pointed out. If someone has done a really good job, shouldn’t the 10 percent go 
              to him or her instead of to the restaurant? This idea seems generally well 
              received but whether tipping actually takes off depends on whether most of us 
              would actually do it. Given our famously tight-fisted ways, how many people 
              would honestly leave a tip if there wasn’t a service charge and if tipping 
              wasn’t made mandatory? <br>If Singapore is ever going to be a world-class city 
              with world-class service, perhaps it’s time we acknowledged that we too have a 
              role to play in making things better both for ourselves and the people serving 
              us, and that we shouldn’t just wait for the government to turn things 
              around.</p>
              <h3><strong>Bad service: Are we to blame?</strong></h3>
              <p><strong>While much has been said about falling service standards, should 
              customers shoulder some of the blame as well? </strong></p>
              <p>For every complaint about Singapore’s service professionals, there are just 
              as many about local customers. Indeed, ask anyone in the service industry and 
              they’ll tell you Singaporean customers can be a difficult lot to please. Says 
              Sunyah Riduan, a part-time Starbucks shift manager, “Locals are worse [than 
              foreigners] because they make sure that every cent they spend is worth it. They 
              can be nasty, especially when there are service charges involved and some expect 
              to be served like kings and queens.” <br>For many that we spoke to, these 
              demanding attitudes are further compounded by Singaporeans’ kiasu mentality. 
              Observes Winnie Eng, “When traveling, Singaporeans never fail to ask for early 
              check-in and late check out. <br>They tend to make full use of the amenities and 
              facilities they are entitled to. If their request fails to get fulfilled, 
              Singaporeans will find their ways to get hold of any ‘FOC apology 
              gift’.<br>Other service industry insiders say that there is also the issue of 
              respect (or lack thereof) surrounding customers’ attitudes towards people in the 
              service industry. Customers have a role to play if they want good service, and 
              this begins with respecting, or at the very least, acknowledging the servers, 
              instead of expecting it just because one is a paying customer. However, getting 
              this mutual respect is easier said than done given the poor regard most people 
              have for jobs in the service industry. Says Fou de Fafa’s Jay Hequet, “In 
              Europe, waiters are well-respected professionals. However, over here, being a 
              waiter or a restaurant manager is seen as a loser’s job; you do it because you 
              need the extra money or because you can’t find anything better.” It also doesn’t 
              help that most Singaporeans in general are very demanding or that some of them 
              treat waiters like servants. Sums up Saint Pierre’s Edina Hong: “If you don’t 
              respect the people serving you, how do you expect to get good service in 
              return?”</p>
              <h3>Worst. Experience. Ever.</h3>
              <p><strong>You can be sure these people won’t be leaving a tip. </strong></p>

              One menu item wasn’t available, and she got visibly pissed off waiting for us to 
              choose a replacement. When it was time to pay, the cashier punched in the 
              numbers and stared blankly at me; I had to ask for the price, and after paying,

              <h3>A GEM of an idea</h3>
              <p>We have campaigns telling us to be courteous, to speak good English and to 
              get married and have children. It was only a matter of time before someone came 
              up with the idea for the Go the Extra Mile Movement (GEMS) campaign. But how 
              effective has it really been? <br>Launched in October 2005, GEMS’ goal was to 
              increase the nation’s standards of service through a variety of measures 
              including training programs and leadership seminars (If you’re Singaporean, you 
              know the drill.) But has it really improved matters? The answer depends on how 
              much you enjoy crunching numbers. In a press release issued by the Singapore 
              Workforce Development Agency (WDA) in 2007, its list of achievements includes a 
              65 percent increase in sales growth at 10 pilot companies a year after launching 
              the Customer Centric Initiative (CCI) for the retail sector and providing more 
              than 400 SMEs in the heartlands with WSQ “Provide GEMS Service” training since 
              April 2006.<br>If one’s criterion for measuring good service involves sending as 
              many people as possible for training courses and then issuing them a certificate 
              stating that they have successfully completed the course, then yes, GEMS has 
              been a resounding success. But if what we’re interested in are results, then the 
              answer becomes less straightforward. How exactly does one measure good 
              service—by the number of greetings or smiles we get when we enter a shop? If a 
              sales rep smiles and greets you but tells you to refer to the company’s website 
              or marketing brochure when you ask a question, is this considered good service 
              or is it a superficial facsimile of what service should really be about? 
              <br>This in turn begs the question: Can service be taught? Bernice Wilson, 
              section head of Temasek Polytechnic’s Diploma in Culinary &amp; Catering 
              Management program, thinks so. “It is possible for good service to be taught and 
              learned,” she says. “It’s about making sure that a habit forms. At Temasek 
              Polytechnic, we start with the very basics. We insist on formal greetings. Not a 
              casual “Morning” but “Good Morning Sir” or “Good Morning Ma’am”, and if you know 
              the person’s name, you refer to them by their name.” But she also acknowledges 
              that inculcating good service is something that requires time and commitment. “ 
              Service was mostly bad 10 years ago, but now it’s 50/50. There is more 
              awareness, and attempts at providing good customer service, but the delivery is 
              sometimes lacking. There is some “slapping of the wrist;” for example if a 
              customer wants a change in an item on the menu, service staff may accept, then 
              say, ‘Okay, but next time don’t. This time I’ll let it go.’”<br>Last year, the 
              government launched the next phase of the GEMS movement. Called GEMS Up, the 
              goal is to raise service standards even further, changing the public’s 
              perception of the service industry by profiling service role models and making 
              the overall service industry “cheaper, better and faster” so the country can 
              remain competitive. Spearheading this phase are Changi Airport Group, ION 
              Orchard, and Sentosa Development Corporation, which have pledged to show 
              “visible transformation” by next year. <br>Will we see a dramatic transformation 
              in service standards and more importantly, will Singaporeans be attracted to a 
              career in the service industry? It’s anybody’s guess but suffice to say, check 
              back next year to find out.</p>
