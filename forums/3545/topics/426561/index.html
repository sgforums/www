              <p>What is tis???</p>
              <p>Does this mean just because a person is a graduate from Harvard and Cambridge means he is more capable than other people with mediocre degrees?</p>
              <p>Not fair. Why can't for once I hear people from government top positions work their way up from a decent poor family rather than those spoiled rich man sons who can afford to send them to Harvard and Cambridge to study?</p>
              <p>I hear that there are businessmen in India and Malaysia who don't even have primary school education, can succeed and become billionaires, all coming from the roots of poor family. Not like Singapore which is entrenched in elitism and the need to have prestigous education. I felt that people with normal degrees can perform just as well as those who graduated from Ivy league universities.</p>
              <p>Don't forget the Unabomber had degrees from Ivy League Schools, a genuis at 15 because he enrolled in UCLA that year. But he was kicked out as a PHD professor because he lacked EQ and later endulged in terrorism.</p>

              <div class="byline">SENIOR Minister Goh Chok Tong said in a post on his Facebook page on 
              Friday that Mr Heng Swee Keat, 49, who is stepping down as head of 
              Monetary of Singapore (MAS), is of ministerial calibre.
              <p>'A high flyer and sound central banker, he has the potential to be a 
              Minister and core member of fourth generation team,' SM Goh wrote.</p>
              <p>'Glad he is prepared to take (the) rough and tumble of politics.'</p>
              <p>Mr Heng will step down as the managing director of MAS on Saturday, after six years in the role.</p>
              <p>Mr Ravi Menon, 47, currently Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of 
              Trade and Industry (MTI), will replace him at the helm of Singapore's 
              central bank and financial regulator.</p>
              <p>Mr Heng has been widely tipped to enter politics and SM Goh's post is
               the first confirmation by the ruling party that he will be part of the 
              new slate of candidates.</p>
