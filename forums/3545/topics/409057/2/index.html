              <p><strong>Singaporean arrested for inciting violence on Facebook</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 25 August 2010 1726 hrs </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A Singaporean man who attacked on Facebook the ruling 
              party and urged people to "burn" a cabinet minister has been arrested on
               charges of inciting violence, police said Wednesday.
              <br> <br> In a statement, police said they had arrested a "man in his late 20s" on
               Tuesday "in connection with investigations into offences related to 
              incitement of violence".
              <br> <br> The statement did not name the man or give details of the offence, but 
              said he was released on bail pending further investigation.
              <br> <br> Local media identified him as Abdul Malik Ghazali, 27, who posted a 
              series of comments on the social networking site critical of how 
              Singapore is hosting the inaugural Youth Olympic Games (YOG).
              <br> <br> Abdul Malik, who works for a company specialising in wood and flooring, 
              said on his Facebook page that he was arrested "due to my involvement in
               anti-YOG and anti-PAP (People's Action Party) Facebook pages".
              <br> <br> One of his postings highlighted recent floods in Singapore, the escape 
              of detained terror suspect Mas Selamat Kastari, the amount of money 
              spent to host the games and reports of the poor standard of food served 
              for games volunteers.
              <br> <br> He said it was time to "burn" the sports minister and the PAP.
              <br> <br> Abdul Malik said in comments published Wednesday by "The New Paper" that
               "the comment is a metaphor".
              <br> <br> "I did not intend for it to be taken literally. I did not mean for 
              someone to actually burn," he said.
              <br> <br> Some in cyberspace rallied to Abdul Malik's defence. 
              <br> <br> One Facebook poster calling himself "Kok Meng" wrote "seems like even 
              metaphors are forbidden these days". 
              <br> <br> "Police should get a grip and let loose. We are a democracy."

              <p>this mad fucker went to literally burn the Yio Chu Kang MP as chronicled by <a href="http://rockson.blogspot.com/2009/01/singapore-mp-kena-burn-by-crazy-fucker.html">Rockson</a></p>
              <p>so now the MIW damned scared people actually go and burn their MPs.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>but then, the MIW is so lost and out of touch that they don't even know that to "burn" someone is internet lingo for going to tekan and take someone down a few levels...</p>
              <p>as seen in the short story by the visionary of the Internet, William Gibson..</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">More than 200 masked protesters smashed windows, vandalized cars and newspaper boxes and intimidated pedestrians in downtown Vancouver Saturday morning before being confronted and dispersed by police in riot gear.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The anti-Olympics protesters, many dressed in black balaclavas and masks, and carrying a ladder, smashed up to three windows at the Hudson's Bay store and one at the Toronto-Dominion Bank near the intersection of Granville and West Georgia streets.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The group also sprayed the windows with red paint, were involved in several confrontations with supporters of the Olympic Games, and threw marbles and spat at police before marching down West Georgia Street toward the Bayshore Hotel in Coal Harbour where the International Olympic Committee members are staying.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">But as the marchers neared the hotel they were turned back by the Vancouver Police Department crowd control unit and the 2010 Integrated Security Unit at the Cardero Street intersection.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">The police then managed to disperse the protesters into several smaller groups, and at one point a core group of the most violent protesters was encircled by police at the intersection of Robson and Jervis streets in the downtown area.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Police said seven suspects were arrested, including one with a bicycle chain wrapped around his fist, and charges of mischief were pending. They also said they seized a bag containing a hammer.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">By noon, the rest of the protesters had been largely dispersed by police, although some of the protesters said they planned to regroup later in the day.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">Vancouver Police Chief Jim Chu later blamed a group of about 100 anarchists at the protest for causing many of the problems.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px;">"The demonstration involving a number of anarchists, some of whom dress all in black and employ a tactic called Black Bloc. This included a loosely organized group of thugs from Central Canada known to attach themselves to any cause, travel to any event that attracts media coverage and promote anarchy wherever they go," said a statement issued by police.</p>
