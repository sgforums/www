              <p><strong>[Source: </strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/?sk=messages&amp;tid=1455839249439#%21/group.php?gid=106184679437182&amp;ref=ts"><strong>I
               hate YOG Facebook</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p>
              <p>The news was reported in <strong>page four of The New Paper</strong> today.</p>
              <p>In an email reply to Temasek Review, Mr Malek said he was arrested 
              over <strong>a particular comment he left on the Facebook</strong> and 
              was <strong>questioned over his involvement with the “I hate YOG” 
              Facebook and his political affiliations:</strong></p>
              <p>“The official reason given was the particular comment, but they did 
              question about involvment in the FB group as well. Such as, why did I 
              start a Facebook page, what was my problem with the YOG, did I join any 
              political party, etc.</p>
              <p>Fixating on the specific words is, in my opinion, very shallow of 
              them as they are not reading with understanding, although the meaning is
               quite clear.</p>
              <p>On a side note, the reporter did mention to me this morning that the <strong>police
               are uncomfortable with the media inquiries about this case.</strong> They do not want to be seen as “heavy-handed”. This is because<strong> the charge is very subjective and the police do not wish to look bad in 
              the light of the criticisms of the YOG.</strong></p>
              <p>If it is any use, I spotted an <strong>MDA note with “Secret” marked 
              across the top.</strong> It was a one-sentence message starting with 
              “Netter Malik Syasha Slengzz ….” (The rest was covered by a file).”</p>
              <p>Mr Malek had earlier posed several difficult questions about the YOG 
              to <strong>PAP MP and Young PAP Vice Chairman Mr Zaqy Mohamad</strong> on his Facebook which he was unable to answer. Mr Zaqy subsequently 
              removed Mr Malek as a friend from his Facebook.</p>
              <p>According to unconfirmed tip-offs we received, a raid was conducted 
              yesterday which saw a dozen netizens being arrested in connection with 
              the involvement in the anti-YOG Facebook.</p>
              <p>Started only two weeks ago, the Facebook has garnered more than 2,700
               friends so far.</p>
              <p>The founder of the Facebook Mr Edmund Khor has just clarified that he
               was not called up for questioning by the police.</p>
              <p>We would like to appeal to readers who are privy to or has 
              information pertaining to this incident to contact us with our <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/contact-us/">online 
              submission form</a>  and provide more information so that we can follow 
              up on this incident. If you are the person/s being arrested by the 
              Police, we would like to hear from you, please contact us.</p>
              <p>The YOG have so far been nothing but an embaressment to the ruling 
              party and we are not at all surprised that drastic measures are being 
              taken to silence its critics to “save face”.This incident goes to prove 
              that the ruling party is willing to resort to any and all means to 
              achieve their agenda by abusing and manupilating the law to invade the 
              constitutional rights of free speech and privacy of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>In view of the lack of information at press time, we would like to 
              urge all our readers to excercise caution and refrain from posting on 
              Fackbook which appears to be very willing to  provide confidential 
              information (against their own Privacy Policy) to the authorities on any
               lame grounds for investigation purposes.</p>
              <p>Unlike FackBook which keeps all their access logs for years (the 
              reason why Police can conveniently round anyone up), our site is 
              clustered on 3 different servers in 3 countries and rotated weekly 
              between 2 main servers (mirror) with the recent deactivated server 
              formatted and reinstalled to ensure that all visitor’s data are removed.
               Additionally, all emails sent to us are stored on the server and not 
              locally which means that neither of our correspondent has a copy of your
               email or information on his or her desktop (pop3 disabled on all our 
              servers). Simply put, we do not keep visitor’s information on our 
              servers for more than a week.</p>
              <p>We wish to once again assure our readers that we take your privacy 
              very seriously and will never under any ciscumstances hand over your 
              information to irrelevant person/s including the authorities 
              unless  ordered by a court of competant jurisdiction (ie: court with 
              jurisdiction in the country where our server is co-located).</p>
              <p>Additionally, in view of the coming General Election and depending on
               the amount of donations we received, we have plans to offer a VPN 
              account for all our readers (at 50% off market rate) if budget allows.</p>
