              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A FORMER television actor went on trial on Monday on three charges of 
              cheating three men of donations totalling more than $260,000 in 
              connection with a charity soccer match he organised two years ago.</p>
              <p>Lim Aik Seng, 45, better known as Lin Yisheng, is said to 
              have cheated Mr Sim Chin Song of $50,000 on June 1, 2007. He is also 
              similarly accused of cheating Mr Tang Keng Boon of $10,000 by making him
               believe that the donation was meant for voluntary welfare organisation 
              Metta Welfare Association..</p>
              <p>The third charge accuses him of inducing businessman Peh 
              Kang Lee into getting cash donations totalling $205,000 from several 
              people between March and June 2007 for Metta.</p>
              <p>The prosecution's first witness, Mr Ho Ah Huat, 52, chief 
              executive officer of Scorpio East Holdings, testified that a subsidiary 
              of his company made a $10,000 donation to Celebrities Holdings in July 
              last year.</p>
              <p>This was after his friend, Mr Peh, had informed him of a 
              soccer match to be played between Hongkong and Singapore celebrities 
              with the proceeds, after deduction of expenses, going to charity.</p>
              <p>He later learnt from Mr Peh about some problem in the 
              raising of funds from a newspaper report. Mr Peh had lodged a police 
              report.</p>
              <p>Lim, a Star Search finalist in 1998, has also a pending case
               of failing to pay the salaries of his employees at his failed business,
               Celebrities.</p>
              <p>The hearing continues.</p>
              <p>If convicted of cheating, he faces a jail term of up to 
              seven years and a fine on each charge.</p>
