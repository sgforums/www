              <p>by 
              																				Teh Joo Lin</p>
              <p>WITHIN three weeks, police have caught a 20-year-old suspect in 
              connection with the murder of a woman in Woodlands Drive on Sept 22, 
              following the release of a revised photofit of the suspect earlier this 
              week.</p>
              <p>Officers from the Criminal Investigation Department's 
              special section tracked down the male suspect and arrested him on 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>Police said on Friday that preliminary investigations 
              revealed that the suspect is also believed to be involved in the attack 
              of a woman jogger at Khatib Bongsu Park Connector on Feb 2.</p>
              <p>The suspect will be charged in court on Saturday for murder,
               and faces the death penalty if he is convicted.</p>
              <p>CID Director, Senior Assistant Commissioner Ng Boon Gay 
              commended the officers who worked round-the-clock to solve the case.</p>
              <p>In the Woodlands case, the body of Ms Hoe Hong Lin, 32, a 
              clerk, was found with at least one stab wound, next to a basketball 
              court beside Block 895C, Woodlands Drive 50, after celebrating the 
              Mid-Autumn Festival with her husband, son and nephew in a playground 
              about 200m away from their block.</p>
              <p>She was believed to have been attacked on her way back after
               walking her nephew to her sister's flat at nearby Woodlands Drive 14.</p>
              <p>In the other case, a health-care worker was attacked on Feb 2
               at the Khatib Bongsu park connector in Yishun Avenue 6. During the 
              struggle, she grabbed the knife, causing it to break at the handle. The 
              blade was later recovered at the scene.</p>
              <p>The victim suffered multiple wounds on her face and upper 
              body, and a C-shaped open wound on her right cheek She was slashed just 
              four days after another woman was knifed nearby, also in Yishun.</p>
              <p>Following the park attack, police released a photofit put 
              together by the 23-year-old jogger, which showed a man with longer hair 
              and smaller eyes. In a new clearer photo released on Tuesday, the 
              suspect has a short crop and strong features.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : A 
              20-year-old full-time national serviceman has been arrested in 
              connection with the murder of a 32-year-old woman at Woodlands Drive 50 
              that took place on September 22.<br><br>He is also believed to be involved in another stabbing attack that happened in February.<br><br>Earlier
               this week, police released a photofit of the assailant believed to be 
              involved in the stabbing attack on a female jogger along the Khatib 
              Bongsu Park connector on February 2. He is also said to be connected to 
              the murder of Hoe Hong Lin at Woodlands Drive 50 on September 22.<br><br>The
               suspect, a full-time national serviceman with the Republic of Singapore
               Navy, was handed over to the police on Thursday evening.<br><br>The 
              Defence Ministry said he was in custody of the Singapore Armed Forces 
              Military Police Command, awaiting trial for the offence of Absent 
              Without Official Leave.<br><br>He is believed to have attacked Ms Hoe at
               a park while she was on the way home at night. A 13-centimetre knife 
              was recovered at the scene.<br><br>Police said the suspect has no 
              criminal records, and that the motive behind the murder has not been 
              determined, pending police investigations. But it is understood that the
               possibility that the suspect could be suffering from a mental illness 
              has not be ruled out.<br><br>Police said it was not an easy task to 
              narrow down the suspect. The effort required the help of external 
              agencies like the Health Sciences Authority, and forensic evidence 
              played a key role in this case.<br><br>Foo Jit Choon, assistant 
              superintendent in the Special Investigation Section of CID, said: "With 
              regards to the Woodlands murder, the unknown can be attributed to two 
              factors - the victim and the suspect do not know each other, and 
              secondly, at the time of the incident, it was very dark. Even though we 
              had witnesses, they were unable to pinpoint to us exactly who was the 
              suspect."<br><br>Police are also investigating if the suspect is also involved in two other similar attacks in January and May this year.<br><br>In all the four cases, the victims are Chinese women in their 20s and 30s, slim built and have shoulder length hair.<br><br>They were alone at the time of the attack and nothing was stolen from them.<br><br>It also appears that they were targeted at random.<br><br>Ms Hoe leaves behind her husband and two children.<br><br>Her eldest brother Nicholas Hoe said the family was informed of the arrest on Thursday night.<br><br>He said the family feels relieved and hopes justice would be served.<br><br>Mr
               Hoe said: "Let's say if this guy has no motive and it is just a random 
              attack, I believe it is really unfair to my sister, she is really 
              innocent. It is very hard, especially for my parents, but we have been 
              trying to call them, trying to make sure that they are fine. <br><br>"My
               brother also tries to bring them out, so that they would not just stay 
              at home and keep thinking about my sister. Last night, after we received
               the information from police that they have detained the suspect, I 
              informed my family and they also feel relieved."<br><br>The suspect will be charged in court on Saturday with murder.<br><br>If convicted, he faces the death penalty. - CNA/ir/ms</span></span></p>
