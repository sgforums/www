              <p>Singapore - His "formal association" with the Eurasian Association began some 20 years ago, when he was the chief executive of Indian self-help group SINDA and was approached to collaborate on various projects and education programmes. <br><br>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S Iswaran looks set to continue the partnership as he accepted the Eurasian Association's request to represent the community's interest in the Cabinet. The community was previously represented by former foreign minister, Mr George Yeo.<br><br>Mr Iswaran's appointment was announced by the Eurasian Association's president William Jansen at the community's reunion gala dinner last night, as he stressed the need for the community's representation in the Cabinet.<br><br>"After Mr George Yeo was no longer able to represent us in Cabinet, we sounded out to several of the leaders of the Eurasian Community as to whom they thought could best represent Eurasians in Cabinet," said Mr Jansen. "There was an overwhelming and positive response and comfort with Mr S Iswaran representing us."<br><br>Mr Jansen noted that Mr Iswaran, as the former CEO of SINDA, had an intimate knowledge of the building and running of self-help groups. And it was during those years that the Eurasian Association built "a close association and relationship" with Mr Iswaran, added Mr Jansen.<br><br>Mr Iswaran, who was "deeply honoured" by the appointment, attributed "old ties" with the community as a key factor for the Eurasian Association's request. <br><br>Speaking to reporters last night, he said he was first approached by Mr Yeo for the role, an appointment which had the "full blessings and support" of the Prime Minister.<br><br>Mr Iswaran, who is also Second Minister for Home Affairs and Trade &amp; Industry, noted the difference from when Mr Yeo first assumed the role in 1992. <br><br>"At that time, there were no Eurasian representatives in Parliament," said Mr Iswaran. "Now, you have (Speaker of Parliament) Michael Palmer and (Holland-Bukit Timah Member of Parliament) Christopher de Souza doing a good job.<br><br>"The way I see my role would be to work closely with Michael and Chris and to make sure that in Cabinet level discussions, when there are matters that are of relevance to the community, I'll make sure they will be addressed."<br><br>Asked about issues he might want to bring up, Mr Iswaran said there are no "pre-conceived agenda or ideas at this stage". <br><br>He added: "I wanted to establish relationship first and then to go on from there. I'll be making sure I get a good feel of the range of activities they are doing and what kind of concerns and issues they have and discuss these in some detail with Michael and Chris."</p>
