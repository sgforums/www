              <p>MR NARAYANA Narayana's letter on Wednesday ("Singapore Pools, Turf 
              Club adding to gambling concerns") vividly captures the gambling 
              scenario here. I agree with him that the spread of gambling activities 
              should be a source of worry, even as these operators help to fill the 
              Government's coffers, albeit at the expense of the vulnerable.</p>
              <p>I don't doubt the sincerity of Singapore Pools and Turf Club
               in trying to urge people to "play responsibly", but surely they did not
               seriously think that merely putting up a sign was going to work? 
              Nowadays, one can't help noticing that these signs have largely been 
              overwhelmed by much bigger ones reminding the public of impending 
              super-draws and urging everybody to go for them.</p>
              <p>If this is not encouraging people to gamble, what is?</p>
              <p>Gambling in the heartland is getting out of hand, and we 
              should be concerned. It's not uncommon to see queues at 4-D/Toto outlets
               that are longer than those at supermarket cashier counters. If indeed 
              selling false hope to the desperate and gullible is what we must do, 
              let's do it discreetly and without promoting the devil-may-care attitude
               to gambling that we see all around. Let's keep gambling activities out 
              of the malls and supermarkets, and away from children.</p>
              <p>The social cost of gambling is mounting and Singapore Pools and Turf Club can help minimise this by acting more responsibly.</p>

              <p>no doubt we could not control all vices...it derives from individual's compulsive habits..</p>

              <p>First of all, I don't gamble in casinos. The cost is too high.</p>
              <p>Second, I only play toto and sweep. Not even 4D where prize is dependant on bet cost. With $3 toto, I can have chance to win group 1-4. Even if I lose, it's only $3 per draw. I don't bet more to win more and I don't bet more during special draws.</p>
              <p>Low crime doesn't mean no crime.<br>Low chances of winning doesn't mean will not win.</p>

              <p>Yes, the odds of winning toto group 1 is very very low.... 1 in 8,000,000.</p>
              <p>But winning groups 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 is also nice. Odds of winning any prize is <strong>1 in 300 </strong>(that is if you only buy 1 ordinary combination, but I buy 6 ordinary combinations so the odds of winning any prize should be higher than that).</p>

              <p>I am more worried that gambling may cause me to lose my focus in life. I may become addicted to gambling and then lose focus of my job and get fired for it. worse I may lose my hard earned money saved through many years of savings, is it worth to lose it half or all on a game of blackjack and worse, incurred debts that may need years to clear and for what?</p>
              <p>what if I incur lots of gambling debts and unable to think properly and in a desperate attempt, I go borrow from loan shark and the problem escalate for me and my family. If I am married with kids, my wife may leave and divorce me. not only do I lose my hard earned money, but incurred debts and lose my family. is it worth it, think about it.</p>

              <p>ok granted that some gamble because they are seeking thrill and not seeking riches through gambling. but then the more thrill you seek, the more you are hooked and the more you are unable to think properly. its a vicious cycle, ever heard of gamble who never slept for days gambled in the casino.</p>
              <p>if you are seeking thrill, seek other hobbies instead, such as kayaking or sky diving instead of gambling. you will start off gambling very small, but gradually you will start gambling big as you are seeking more thrill.</p>
              <p>so as a matter of principle, I do not even gamble 4D, Toto or even world cup or EPL betting anymore. one gamble in 4D may lead to EPL betting and then to casino eventually.</p>

              <p>yes gambling is always a vice, has been and will be.gambling has ruined many lives and family. there was this man who murdered his family because of gambling debts, because he didnt want his children to be treated as second class, but who is to blame, no one but that irresponsible coward man himself.</p>
