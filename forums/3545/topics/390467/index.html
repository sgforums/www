              <p>Feb 9, 2010 - ST Forum</p>
              <p><strong>Mandate assured ...</strong></p>
              <p><strong>... As long as PAP remains incorruptible.</strong></p>
              <p>IN HIS letter last Saturday, 'Life after PAP', Mr Ng Kok Lim asserts
              that Singaporeans have the inherent and innate ability to prosper and
              flourish, no matter who leads the country. In support of his argument,
              he mentions how various changes of government in the region have not
              been detrimental to the countries involved.</p>
              <p>Separately,
              in his letter also last Saturday, 'Politically vibrant Singapore', Mr
              Albert Tay advocates competition in the political arena, which he says
              can only facilitate advancement.</p>
              <p>Ethnically,
              Singaporeans are no different from the countries they migrated from.
              If, indeed, all work ethic is equal, every country in the region would
              have scaled the same peaks as Singapore. That we have achieved a
              standing in the world beyond expectations says as much about our
              resourcefulness to overcome hardship as it does about the quality of
              our leadership in our country's formative years.</p>
              <p>Sterling
              governance in Singapore has not diminished over the decades. Long-
              serving governments of other countries lost the trust of their
              electorates as the dominant political parties degenerated into
              inefficiency, racked by moral turpitude and roiled by scandal.</p>
              <p>This
              is not the case with the People's Action Party (PAP), whose venal sin
              lies in steadfastly implementing unpopular policies with short-term
              pain while making long-term gains which only patience will see bear
              fruit. As long as the PAP maintains its moral probity while charting a
              clear course through the mine-laden future, it should retain a handsome
              mandate to rule, as changing horses in midstream simply for the sake of
              change is insensate.</p>
              <p>The rules of the market
              seemingly dictate that competition brings efficiency and advancement.
              Yet, a look at the filibustering in various foreign Parliaments should
              tell us that non-constructive opposition to government policies is
              pernicious to a country, paralysing it with worthless rhetoric when
              firm and decisive leadership is needed.</p>
              <p>One need
              only look at the unhealthy competition between StarHub and SingTel and
              the ongoing World Cup telecast imbroglio to confirm that
              conventional wisdom has its limits.</p>

              <p>You will never find scandals in a close knit family government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP is one big happy family. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's sad to learn that UK, US, Western Europe, Japan and Australia have all degenerated into inefficiency racked by moral turpitude and rolled by scandal. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Short-term pain while making long-term gains? It's more like making short term gains (for the government) now and paying short term (citizens) and long term (citizens) price. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's so unhealthy about StarHub and SingTel in the handphone market? What's so unhealthy about the competition for World Cup telecast rights? An addendum, StarHub and SingTel aren't perfect competitive companies, it's a facade for free competition, but the actual holding company for both of them are the government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The World Cup broadcast rights resulted in both companies working together submitting a joint bid, akin to PAP working hand in hand (not fixing them up) with the opposition for the betterment of Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Moral of the story, it doesn't matter who wins, so long as the winning party is not self serving like increasing his salary to afew million dollars. Ooops.....was I too honest and directly implicated some party. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h1>Ng Kok Lim demolishes Dr Yik Keng Yeong’s arguments supporting PAP’s continued political hegemony</h1>
              <div class="dateleft">
              <p><span class="time">February 10, 2010</span> - Temasek Review</p>
              <p><strong>By Ng Kok Lim</strong></p>
              <p>I refer to the letter by Dr Yik Keng Yeong dated 9 Feb 2010. <br>  <br> Dr Yik points to the unequal scaling of the economic peak by countries
              in the region to suggest that work ethic is not the same across
              countries.  By extension, places that have scaled the same peak must
              necesssarily share the same work ethics.  This is consistent with the
              observation that East Asian societies like Hong Kong, Korea and Taiwan
              have scaled the same peaks as Singapore while sharing similar cultures
              and work ethics.  Since the majority of Singaporeans originated from
              East Asia, it helps explain why Singapore is able to scale the same
              peaks scaled by other East Asians.  Hence, Dr Yik’s ethnicity argument
              gives greater credence to the idea that a country’s fate lies more with
              its people than with its government.<br>  <br> Dr Yik’s assertion that sterling governance in Singapore has not
              diminished holds no water as Singapore lost billions in some recent
              transactions and experienced sky high inflation in property prices.<br>  <br> The countries Dr Yik refers to where governments have lost the trust of
              their electorates and which have then degenerated into inefficiency and
              depravity bear little semblance to Singapore in terms of social fabric
              and the ethical makeup of its people.  We can always find other
              countries like those of the Western democracies where governments
              change regularly without their countries falling apart.  Therefore, the
              countries we compare ourselves to must be appropriate in order for the
              comparison to make sense.  Comparing ourselves against countries with
              similar work ethics like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and even Thailand
              suggests that government change is no cause for worry for Singaporeans.<br>  <br> Dr Yik assets that the PAP’s venal sin is steadfastly implementing
              unpopular policies.  But the PAP never has need to commit venal sins as
              it writes its own paycheck.  The idea that short term pain must
              necessarily bring about long term gain is too often used to justify
              policies that have become inappropriate and not feasible both in the
              short term and in the long term.<br>  <br> Moral probity becomes obscured when the PAP pays itself better than
              what Chen Shui Bian could stash away over eight years.  The description
              of the PAP charting through mine laden waters omits the many knee jerk
              reactions along the way.<br>  <br> Make no mistake Dr Yik, we are not changing horses midstream for the
              sake of changing horses.  We are changing horse because the horse has
              decided to call the shots and take its owner for a ride.<br>  <br> The antics and noise that we see in foreign parliaments such as that of
              Taiwan’s should not detract us from the fact that their economies
              continue to pull ahead full steam.  We should therefore not assume that
              the opposition is necessarily non-constructive and pernicious to our
              country let alone paralysing to it.<br>  <br> When a nation chooses to brush aside the grievances of its people as
              mere rhetoric, that is when the danger of totalitarianism is at its
              greatest.  For when we surrender our independent judgement of what is
              right and what is wrong to supposedly firm and decisive leadership,
              that firmness and decisiveness can lead our country to total ruin and
              destruction.  The most famous case in point being the surrender of the
              collective judgments of the German people to the firmness and
              decisiveness of Hitler and his Nazi government.  History always repeats
              itself.  Let it not repeat on us.<br>  <br> While the competition between Starhub and Singtel is indeed unhealthy,
              the solution isn’t no competition but perfect competition instead. 
              When the nation wide broadband network is in place and many more
              internet / television companies come on board, the competitive power of
              each company will diminish along with their ability to engage in
              destructive bidding.  If this doesn’t work, we can make use of
              anti-trust proceedings to break Starhub and Singtel into many smaller
              units.<br>  <br> Conventional wisdom has its virtues, we just need to be able to recognise them.<br>   <br> Thank you<br><strong>Ng Kok Lim</strong></p>
