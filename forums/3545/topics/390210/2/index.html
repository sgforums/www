              </span><p></p>
              <p>AS HE cut the ribbon to open Singapore's first casino on Sunday, Genting Group chairman Lim Kok Thay said: 'We have waited a long time for this.'</p>
              <p>Clearly, so had many others.</p>
              <p>The new Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) casino was so packed within hours of opening that it had to shut its doors for 2-1/2 hours at 12.30am yesterday.</p>
              <p>Those already inside were having trouble placing a bet or just finding a seat at the gaming tables and slot machines. Outside, people were asked to wait.</p>
              <p>Some of those who go in were in no hurry to leave.</p>
              <p>There were casino visitors who emerged after breakfast yesterday, having spent the whole night at the gambling tables. A few said they expected to be back again in the afternoon for Round Two.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 15px;">THE director of the National Council on Problem Gambling, Ms Charlotte Beck, said that as of 7.30pm on Sunday, 3,248 Singaporeans and PRs had forked out for the entry levy, and another 122 had purchased the annual pass.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">The daily levies can be paid up to 30 days in advance.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">While the casino was the star attraction, the rest of the resort also saw a steady stream of visitors turning up to view the theme park, tour the grounds and visit the restaurants and shops.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">Altogether, Sunday saw 75,000 visitors descend on Sentosa, making it a record turnout for the holiday island.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 15px;">The $10 preview tickets to Universal Studios were sold out despite none of the 19 rides or shows being open. Visitors said they were happy to be the first to catch a glimpse of the 20ha park and have a free set meal in one of the park restaurants included in the ticket.</p>

              <p>i am still really curious if the theme park in singapore will be a sustained success.</p>
              <p>1. theme park visitorship in popular theme parks around the world are showing flat or declining numbers. altho' the singapore universal studios will have lots of initial interests, sustaining the interests over the years will be a major challenge.</p>
              <p>2. you have mushrooming themeparks all over asia. there is no real competitive edge per say. singapore can potentially attract rich visitors from the south-east asian countries, particularly the singa-phile indonesians, but it is not a `must visit' destination for the rest as they have theme parks in their countries as well.  </p>
              <p>3. the tropical hot and humid or/&amp; wet weather that singapore has will put a dampener to the overall experience. to enjoy themeparks, which is typically a day long affair, you need to have mild temperatures so you won't feel tired psychologically, or hot and sticky while in the queues. the experience will not be a good one if one has to stay out in the sun at a prolong period of time. the only time it will work is potentially after dusk, where it is cooler. i will hate to be in the queue @ noon waiting 30mins for my turn at the roller coaster.</p>
              <p>4. lastly, this may be prejudiced; i have no confidence in genting running universal studios. their own themepark in genting is a mess. granted that they will be subjected to different QCs from the franchiser, i still think the maintainence and service level to the visitors will be compromised. just becos you don't have a world class organization managing this. </p>

               talk cock? That's usually the pap
              The paper that I read showed a picture of an empty casino...on opening day...a low shot that just showed a lady casino employee waiting for gamblers and and 4-5 slot machines in row( without players.). They used a low angle shot to minimize the effect that it was empty though.
