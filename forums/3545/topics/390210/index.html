              <p><strong>Resorts World at Sentosa awarded casino licence</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 06 February 2010 1602 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The Resorts World at Sentosa Integrated Resort has been awarded its casino licence.
              <br> <br> In a brief statement posted on its website, the Casino Regulatory
              Authority of Singapore said the licence was granted on Saturday.
              <br> <br>Previously, Resorts World had said it's ready to start operating
              Singapore's first legal casino as soon as the government issued the
              gambling licence.
              <br> <br> The other integrated resort by Marina Bay Sands is set to open in April after encountering construction delays.
              <br> <br> So far, about 3,500 people with serious criminal records have been barred from the two casinos when they open.
              <br> <br>In a statement on Friday night, the police said notices called the
              Commissioner of Police Exclusion Orders will be served on those with a
              history of crimes related to drugs, illegal moneylending, prostitution
              and secret societies, among other things.
              <br> <br>It's the latest in a series of steps taken by the authorities to
              keep criminal elements out of the casinos opening soon. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p class="header"><span>SINGAPORE: Speculation has been rife that the theme park and
              casino at Resort World Sentosa will open in time for the Lunar New Year
              this weekend.
              <br> <br> But it now seems that the Universal Studios theme park will not be ready in time.
              <br> <br>Sources tell MediaCorp's TODAY newspaper that the park will only
              open in a few weeks' time, after final safety checks are completed.
              <br> <br> But all Resorts World will say, is that it is "on track" to open by end-March.
              <br> <br> The integrated resort said it has seen more enquiries about both the park and casino.
              <br> <br> All rooms in the resort's hotels are also fully booked.  - TODAY/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>Lunar New Year opening for Singapore's first casino</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 11 February 2010 1418 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Genting Singapore said its Resorts World Sentosa
              casino in Singapore will have a soft opening on Sunday, February 14, in
              time for the Lunar New Year.
              <br> <br> Its Universal Studios theme park is still on schedule to open in the first quarter of this year.
              <br> <br> In a statement filed with the Singapore Exchange, Genting said the rides at the theme park are still being fine-tuned.
              <br> <br> The casino will admit its first public guests at the auspicious hour of 12.18pm, with a private ceremony.
              <br> <br>A day of festivities at the integrated resort has been planned to
              mark the red-letter day, including the debut of its public attraction
              "Lake of Dreams", and evening previews at its Universal Studios theme
              park. <br> <br> Tan Hee Teck, CEO of Resorts World Sentosa, said the resort is still
              fine-tuning the rides and shows in the theme park, which are still on
              schedule to open in the first quarter of 2010.
              <br> <br>But a week-long preview of the theme park will be conducted to give
              Singaporeans a special and unique first-to-see walk-through
              opportunity. The theme park's restaurants and shopping venues will be
              open for guests, although rides and shows will not be operational.
              <br> <br>For sneak peek week, Universal Studios Singapore will open from 5pm
              to 9pm every night from February 14 to February 21. Admission will be
              by S$10 tickets, rebated by a same-value dining voucher. Sale of the
              tickets starts from 11:18am tomorrow.
              <br> <br>Guests can visit the box office at the Universal Studios Singapore
              front gate to purchase tickets for another day, as there will be no
              same-day ticket sales available.
              <br> <br>After the sneak peek week, Universal Studios Singapore will open on
              February 22 to employees of Resorts World Sentosa, Genting, and
              Universal Studios Singapore. This is followed by specially-invited
              families, charities and guests. <br> <br> It expects to welcome its first public guests in early March.

              <p><strong>Singapore's first casino at Resorts World Sentosa opens its doors</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 14 February 2010 1720 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore opened the first of two casino resorts
              Sunday, part of a multi-billion dollar bet to transform itself into a
              hot tourist destination and reduce the economy's reliance on
              manufacturing.
              <br> <br>The casino at Resorts World Sentosa welcomed its first punter - a
              middle aged Singaporean woman - at the auspicious time of 12:18 pm
              (0418 GMT) on the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year.
              <br> <br> When pronounced in the Cantonese dialect, 12:18 sounds like "prosperity".   
              <br> <br>The first bettor was followed by an initial crowd of about 200
              enthusiastic gamblers and within hours of the opening, hundreds more
              were queuing up outside. Ushers gave out free bottled water and ice
              cream in the sweltering tropical heat.
              <br> <br>The opening - to be followed within months by a second casino
              resort built by Las Vegas Sands in Singapore's business district - is
              part of an ambitious plan to transform the city into a key destination
              for casino high-rollers, business executives and families.
              <br> <br>"I'll probably play jackpot. I'm willing to wager around a hundred
              (dollars) in it," said Tiong Tak Si, 60, a retiree from Brunei.
              <br> <br>Resorts World Sentosa, which is on Sentosa island, a former British
              garrison linked to the main island by bridge, is owned by Malaysian
              gaming giant Genting Group.
              <br> <br>"We have waited a long time for this. Today's opening of the casino
              is a milestone for Resorts World Sentosa, for Genting Group and for
              Singapore," said group chairman Lim Kok Thay.
              <br> <br>The construction of Resorts World Sentosa, together with the Las
              Vegas Sands' casino resort, Marina Bay Sands, is costing more than
              US$10 billion.
              <br> <br> They will also offer visitors a range of glitzy hotels, restaurants and luxury goods shops.
              <br> <br>Genting's casino complex includes a Universal Studios movie theme
              park, which it opened Sunday for sneak previews ahead of full
              operations.
              <br> <br>Singapore, host to thousands of multinational corporations, is
              already a major travel draw because of its reputation for safety,
              cleanliness and efficiency, as well as man-made attractions such as
              top-end shopping malls.
              <br> <br>However, it is a tiny island which lacks the white-sand beaches and
              breath-taking scenery found in neighbouring countries like Indonesia
              and Malaysia and the government is continually searching for new ideas
              to create a buzz about the city-state.
              <br> <br> In 2008 it made sporting history when it hosted the world's first Formula One night race.
              <br> <br>It has built the world's biggest observation wheel, the Singapore
              flyer, and an arts venue and has given its prime Orchard Road shopping
              belt a makeover.
              <br> <br> Now it plans a landscaped area called Gardens by the Bay near the Marina Barrage built in 2008.
              <br> <br>The city-state is aiming to get 17 million visitors a year
              generating more than US$21 billion by 2015, up from 9.7 million
              visitors last year.
              <br> <br> Analysts expect the casino resorts to help the city meet those targets.
              <br> <br>"There is clearly a push to add to the range and depth of
              attractions here and that is important for a place like this," said
              Robert McIntosh, an executive director with CBRE Hotels Asia Pacific, a
              consultancy firm.
              <br> <br> "They (casino resorts) are a massive boost to overall tourism to Singapore," he told AFP.
              <br> <br>CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, an independent brokerage firm, said
              Singapore's casinos are expected to generate revenues of US$2.1 billion
              this year, rising to US$3.5 billion in 2011.
              <br> <br> Singapore in 2005 agreed to go ahead with the two casino resorts after a rare public debate.
              <br> <br>Opponents feared gambling would threaten the city's "family values"
              and put it at risk of becoming a centre for money-laundering.
              <br> <br>But the government has put in safeguards, including imposing a
              S$100 entrance fee for Singaporeans and permanent residents and banning
              anyone declared bankrupt from the casinos outright.
              <br> <br> Last month it launched a dedicated police unit to investigate casino-related crimes.
