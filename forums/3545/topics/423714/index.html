              <p><span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 25 February 2011 1833 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore government has submitted its </span><a class="path" href="http://www.mfa.gov.sg/upr">report</a><span> on the country's human rights track record to the United Nations, as part of a review of all UN member states.<br><br>This is the first time Singapore's human rights record is under scrutiny by the UN.<br><br>One-hundred-and-fifty-nine
               states have been reviewed since first the first Universal Periodic 
              Review (UPR) session in April 2008. <br><br>The 10,700-word report submitted to the UN seeks to put in context Singapore's political and social landscape.<br><br>It
               also looks into the protection of human rights in areas such as 
              housing, education and special interest groups such as women, children 
              and migrant workers.<br><br>Observers said issues that could attract 
              attention include those concerning Singapore's position on detention 
              without trial, right of assembly and corporal punishment including the 
              death penalty.   <br><br>In its report, the government said Singapore's 
              diverse multi-racial, multi-religious society poses a challenge in 
              balancing social harmony with the preservation of individual rights.<br><br>Under
               the chapter on political and civil liberties, the government said "no 
              person has ever been detained for engaging in lawful political 
              activities" in Singapore.<br><br>It added Singaporeans are free to set 
              up societies and associations. There were 7,100 registered societies in 
              2009, compared to 5,300 in 1999 and 3,900 in 1988. <br><br>But the 
              report added while Singaporeans are free to establish such groups, there
               are certain restrictions in the Societies Act to "ensure that groups 
              intended for unlawful purposes or pose a threat to public order and 
              welfare are not established".<br><br>Between 2007 and 2009, five out of 886 applications for registration were rejected.<br><br>The government added Singapore "considers capital punishment as a criminal justice issue, rather than a human rights one".<br><br>The report said capital punishment is imposed only for the most serious of crimes.<br><br>In the case of drug trafficking, the death penalty has deterred major drug syndicates from establishing themselves in Singapore.<br><br>On
               preventive detention, the government said it's a "last resort" to 
              counter serious threats against public or national security.<br><br>"The need to protect witnesses and informants from intimidation is one of the reasons for preventive detention".<br><br>The
               Internal Security Act (ISA) for example, is not "punitive" but 
              "preventive" in neutralising threats such as the emergence of terror 
              group, the Jemaah Islamiyah.<br><br>The report said: "Governments around
               the world increasingly recognise the need for preventive powers within a
               comprehensive institutionalised framework to deal effectively with 
              terrorism and all forms of violent extremism".   <br><br>While the 
              Singapore constitution provides that every citizen has the right to 
              freedom of expression, the report said "Singapore's small size, high 
              population density and diversity mean that actions or speech by one 
              group of people could potentially have an impact on other groups. <br><br>"Given this, it is vital that individual rights and freedoms be exercised responsibly within a legal framework".<br><br>Civil society groups said the process is a good learning journey. <br><br>Braema
               Mathi, chairperson of Maruah, which represents a coalition of civil 
              society organisations in Singapore, said: "It runs the risk of being a 
              talk show, definitely we have to admit that, and I think this is where 
              the test comes for the state -- whether the state is serious and to the 
              best that all I have seen of Singapore, Singapore takes its 
              international conventions very seriously and when it does agree to 
              something, it tries to make sure that it acts on them.  <br><br>"So I'm hoping that this will be one such structure that it will move on certain things.<br><br>"Of
               course, it will be foolhardy to think that 'wow! We will go and change 
              everything overnight', but on certain crucial things, I think we must 
              move and I hope that in the next four-year cycle, we can go there and 
              say 'ok these areas, we have improved substantially, not just the 
              marginal tinkering around the edges'.  <br><br>"We hope that with 
              greater publicity, (we) will be more aware of human rights. This is in a
               way a report card that the UN is trying to bring more and more 
              countries onto a universal platform on how human rights is appreciated, 
              observed and acted upon.<br><br>"I think that's a very good beginning and we hope that more of our citizens will get engaged in looking at this". <br><br>Ms Mathi said this was a rigorous process for civil society and the government because Singapore is fact oriented.  <br><br>"And in that process, we also do a lot of self learning and that's a good thing," she said. <br><br>"This
               cannot be done in isolation, governments cannot work on these things on
               their own, neither can civil society. So the more we interact, the more
               we consult one another, the more we work towards common goals, the 
              better we make the country."<br> <br>Still, Ms Mathi said she would have seen more of the inputs from civil society groups included in the report.<br><br>"The
               state has given a factual accounting of our thought processes, our 
              history, how we relate to, in broad strokes, the concept of human 
              rights.  <br><br>"Basically it is the state stating its case in a lot of ways and I think there are no surprises in that approach. <br><br>"It
               would have been good to have some response because for the first time, 
              quite a number of the civil society organisations put up their report to
               the office of the human rights council and therefore I do think it 
              would have been great to see some form of interaction.<br><br>"But I 
              also understand that this is the approach the state will take and all 
              the specific issues will come up on May 6 when the government will be 
              due for its report submission and interaction by other governments, who 
              will then ask questions alongside international NGOs.<br><br>"So we hope
               that during that period of interaction, there will be more substantive 
              questions on the various matters raised by the different civil society 
              groups". <br><br>The national report is one of three to be submitted to the UN.<br><br>The
               rest are reports by local and international civil society organisations
               as well as one from the Office of the High Commissioner of Human 
              Rights.<br><br>Singapore, led by Minister for Home Affairs &amp; Minister for Law K Shanmugam, will make its representation in Geneva on May 6.<br><br>The three-hour session will involve a dialogue with UN member and observer states.<br><br>An outcome document which is a summary of the proceedings and recommendations will be adopted on May 10.<br><br>The
               final outcome document will be adopted in September. This is where 
              civic society organisations can also speak before the UN formally adopts
               the outcome document.<br><br>The final outcome document from this process will form the basis of the next review in four years. <br><br>The government has said Singapore will build on its achievements in human rights. <br><br>Preserving
               racial and religious harmony is top priority but it added laws will 
              evolve to meet the changing political, economic and social aspirations 
              of Singaporeans". <br><br>-CNA/wk</span> </span></p>
