              people are dead after a boat carrying about 30 passengers sank off 
              Mersing, Johor.<br><br>According to the local Chief of Police, Mohd Nor 
              Rashid, the dead are believed to be Singaporeans.<br><br>He told Channel
               NewsAsia that another two passengers are missing, also believed to be 
              Singaporeans.<br><br>The incident happened at about 1.30pm on Sunday, 
              when the boat was travelling between Sibu Island towards Mersing's 
              Tanjung Leman ferry terminal.<br><br>Others on board include Malaysians 
              and a Chinese national.<br><br>Search and rescue operations are ongoing.<br><br>Malaysian
               police believe the boat was overloaded beyond its normal capacity of 12
               passengers, and Mr Mohd Nor Rashid said strong winds and currents may 
              have caused the boat to capsize.<br><br>Both the operator and the 
              Malaysian boat driver have been arrested.<br><br>Meanwhile, Singapore's 
              Foreign Affairs Ministry said it understands that several Singaporeans 
              were on board the boat which capsized en route from Sibu to Mersing in 
              Malaysia.<br><br>An MFA spokesman said officers from its 
              Consulate-General in Johor Bahru are on their way to Mersing to provide 
              assistance.<br><br>Singaporeans who are unable to reach their loved ones
               who were on the boat can contact the MFA duty office at +65-6379-8800 
              (24 hours) and the Singapore Consulate-General in Johor Bahru at 
              +60-7226-5012 (24 hours).<br><br>- CNA/ms<br></span></span></p>

              <p><br>also check and enquire the availability of life jackets and how many life jackets in the boat. a boat for 10 people should hav e at least 10 jackets. wear them on if you feel safe before journey starts. that's why i never like travel to batam on frequent bassis. even driving taking public transport to johore also. the more frequent you on the road and at sea, the higher chances of such things happening to you.</p>

              <p>By

              <p>THE tragedy in Mersing which left 4 Singaporeans dead and one still 
              missing has had a ripple effect among tourists in the area.</p>
              <p>Two Singaporeans staying at the Tunjuk Laut beach resort 
              near the jetty where the tragedy struck told RazorTV that they have 
              cancelled their fishing plans.</p>
              <p>One of them expressed her shock as she had travelled on a similar boat
               just two months ago.</p>
              <p>'The water was choppy because it was the monsoon season but 
              we didn't have that kind of fear but after hearing Monday's news, we 
              decided to stay put at the chalet and cancel our fishing plans,' said 
              Singaporean tourist Lily Mary Santhou.</p>
              <p>Family members and loved ones were still mourning their loss
               when RazorTV visited the Tanjung Leman jetty on Monday.</p>
