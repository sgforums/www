              <p><strong>Oct 13, 2011 - ST Forum</strong></p>
              <p>IN THE past week, the local media broadcast documentaries on the role
               of ethnic Chinese in colonial Singapore in ending 2,000 years of 
              feudalism in China, to commemorate the centenary of the 1911 revolution 
              that overthrew dynastic rule.</p>
              <p>The eight visits here by the father of 
              modern China, Sun Yat Sen, to raise funds for the revolutionary movement
               were given prime prominence. The Balestier Road villa where he stayed 
              has been transformed into a historical monument ('Historic Sun Yat Sen 
              villa reopens'; Sunday).</p>
              <p>Visiting politicians, prominent businessmen and 
              academics have called on Singaporeans to remember the contributions of 
              Nanyang (overseas) Chinese to the villa.</p>
              <p>While I do not discount the significance of
               the revolution, I am uncomfortable with how our local identity and 
              history remain subordinated to foreign history.</p>
              <p>Although Sun was an important figure, his stay here was extremely brief and his interest in Singapore, probably peripheral.</p>
              <p>Yet, the villa where he stayed is preserved while the
               graves of prominent pioneers of Singapore like Lim Nee Soon, Chew Boon 
              Lay and Ong Sam Leong are not.</p>
              <p>The Bukit Brown Cemetery where these sons of 
              Singapore are buried must make way for redevelopment ('Bukit Brown to 
              make way for housing'; May 30).</p>
              <p>In the rush to celebrate the first milestone of 
              modern China on Oct 10, 1911, we have forgotten a local incident of 
              immense historical significance, especially close to the hearts of older
               Singaporeans, which took place on Oct 10, 1943.</p>
              <p>This was the Double Tenth Massacre, a tragic day when
               the Japanese military police arrested and tortured 57 people they 
              suspected of being involved in an allied raid that sank several ships at
               the Singapore harbour in World War II. Fifteen of them died later. This
               date does not even rate an annual mention.</p>
              <p>In an era of nation-building where we should regard 
              ourselves as Singaporeans first and profess loyalty exclusively to 
              Singapore, the assertion of Chinese pride by some Chinese Singaporeans 
              on China's 1911 revolution is disturbing.</p>
              <p>As Singapore approaches the bicentenary of its 
              founding in 1819, the emphasis on writing our history and preserving our
               heritage should not be expended disproportionately on prominent 
              foreigners who happened to pass through.</p>
              <p>Our emphasis should be firmly focused on Singaporeans who helped shape the history of this little red dot.</p>

              <p>There were no local politics in Singapore until after 1945, most political groups and political activities in Singapore before that were oriented towards overseas aims. This was the nature of local political history.</p>
              <p>Chinese politics in Singapore was about China politics, Indian politics was about India. The politics was not about Singapore. There was no concept, no idea of Singapore as state or Singapore identity. Singapore was considered as part of Malaya. The term "Malaya" includes Singapore.</p>
              <p>Malays and peranakans were less politically active and politicised, although there was a KMM for the malays.</p>
