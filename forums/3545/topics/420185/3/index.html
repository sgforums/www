              <div>census of population 2010<br> Number of single Singaporeans on the rise And those who have tied
              the knot are having fewer childrenÂ  By Li Xueying, Political
              Correspondent<br> <br> THEY are footloose and fancy-free - and their numbers are
              growing.<br> <br> To be exact, one in three residents - or <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">one million of those who call Singapore home - is
              single</span></strong>. In percentage terms, the figure has gone up
              from 30 per cent a decade ago to 32 per cent today.<br> <br> Also in a seemingly unstoppable trend bucking the Government's
              efforts to get Singaporeans to procreate, even those who have tied
              the knot are having fewer children.<br> <br> One in five women in their 30s who have ever been married is
              childless. That is 20 per cent, up from 14 per cent in 2000.<br> <br> One of them is teacher M. Choo, 32, whose attitude towards having
              children is expressed thus: 'Kids? It's not a priority. We will see
              how it goes.'<br> <br> The same trend goes for older, ever-married women in their 40s. The
              percentage of those who are childless has risen from 6.4 per cent
              to 9.3 per cent.<br> <br> Among women in their 40s who have married, university graduates
              have the fewest children, an average of 1.74 children, against 2.21
              children for those with below secondary qualifications.<br> <br> The Chinese tend to have the smallest families, the Malays the
              largest, and the Indians are in between.<br> <br> The latest census data comes in the midst of Singapore's plummeting
              total fertility rate, which fell to a historic low of 1.22 last
              year, despite government policies ranging from longer maternity
              leave to cash bonuses.<br> <br> As for those who have not married, if he is a man, he is likely to
              have below secondary qualifications.<br> <br> Among men aged 40 to 44, 24.1 per cent of those with below
              secondary qualifications are single, compared with 12.9 per cent
              for graduate men.<br> <br> If she is a woman, the converse is true.<br> <br> Among women aged 40 to 44, 23.5 per cent of graduates are single,
              compared with 10.8 per cent for those with below secondary
              qualifications.<br> <br> Among all ethnic groups, the Chinese have the highest proportion of
              singles.<br> <br> For instance, 17.5 per cent of Chinese women aged 40 to 44 are
              single - more than double the 8.2 per cent among Malay women.<br> <br> Of the perennial mismatch between lower-educated men and
              better-educated women who are single, sociologist and Nominated MP
              Paulin Straughan noted that Singapore continues to be governed by
              'strong notions of patriarchy that say that men should be the
              leader'.<br> <br> However, she sees a glimmer of hope.<br> <br> 'Moving forward, I don't think we will be stuck in this situation
              forever.'<br> <br> The reason is that Singapore society has levelled up in terms of
              education.<br> <br> 'For the next generation of younger male Singaporeans, they will be
              able to achieve at least secondary education,' she said.<br> <br> <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:xueying@sph.com.sg"><span style="color: #9a0a0a;">xueying@sph.com.sg</span></a></div>

              <p>Let's look at some of the factors that mightÂ cause SingaporeansÂ to remain single.</p>
              <p>- stressful lifestyle, long working hours</p>
              <p>-Â pay and wagesÂ are unable to keep up with the rate of price increases in life</p>
              <p>- Women's Charter, and no oraganised committee to address the stresses and problems faced by Singaporean males, single or married and protect them as well.</p>
              <p>- NS, detersÂ men from marrying earlier as they want to startÂ and build up a good career before even planning their finances to getÂ into a relationship and marriage</p>
              <p>- Prices of housing and cars keep on increasing, hindering Singaporeans of planning these aspects for a healthy family environment.</p>
              <p>With prices of HDB flats keep on increasing, which SingaporeansÂ haveÂ to payÂ for something thatÂ doesn't even belong to them ultimately and slogging their half of their livesÂ just to buy this apartment, Singaporeans are having a hard time trying to convince themselves to have children where basic obligations of paying off the flat's expenses seems to be already taking a large chunk of their burden. Moreover, COE prices keep on increasing and increasing. Before even having to afford your own transport, what's the point of thinking about setting up a family? Not to mention more and more ERPs.</p>
              <p>- High costs of living for necessities, besides housing and transport. Aspects like the education, health care/hospitalisation expenses for the child now and in future.</p>
              <p>- Too competitive environment, in terms of jobs and wages, basic needs and now even personal space and freedom.</p>
              <p>- Responsiblities of marriage and raising up children, especially when the lifestyle here is already too stressful, and costs of living is so high.</p>
              <p>But I have to disagree on the part that males below secondary school qualifications are single and marrying at a later age. Even now, males with diploma and degree qualifications are single or/and marrying late. Main reason is that they see more financial insecurity in future as the costs of living keep on increasing and the job market is so competitive to give them a job that pays decently. They rather focus more on their career and work their way up now to get a good pay and position in future, before even thinking of getting into a relationship.</p>
              <p>And this is especially true for my pool of friends, some although not all, who are reaching or are already past 30 years old but still do not have a relationship and get married. One of them even told me, "I can't even afford to buy a car and a house, how to convince the girl that I can give her (and kids) a decent family environment in future?"</p>
              <p>In future, it might not be the gender inequality based on education that hinders marriage but the root of the problem might be the high costs of living and too competitive job market.</p>
              <p>Â </p>

              <p>It's their choice, and no one has the right to dictate how they should live their lives for the sake of "national interest" or "tradition" - especially if it means getting into a relationship with someone they cannot live with.</p>

              <p>ExpertsÂ believe the high cost of livingÂ is the main deterrent to couples having children.</p>
              <p>They are only getting married in June, but already the couple have decided against having any children.</p>
              <p>Speaking to <em>The Straits Times (ST)</em>, civil servant Jean Heng, 30, said she chooses her independence and freedom above having a baby.</p>
              <p>She said, âLife in Singapore is very stressful. Work takes up a huge amount of time and I have no energy to take care of kids. If I want to have kids, I would want to devote enough resources in terms of time and money.â</p>
              <p>Ms Heng and her teacher-fiance are just one of the many couples in Singapore who have decided to strike babies off their marriage checklist, citing common reasons such as financial and time constraints.</p>
              <p>Experts ST spoke to are not surprised by the findings of theÂ <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=census+of+population+2010&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Census of PopulationÂ 2010</span></a>, whichÂ saw more childless married women and more one-child families. TheyÂ cited the high cost of living as a main reason for couples shying away from raising children.</p>
              <p>Associate Professor Tan Khye Chong, a statistics lecturer from <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=nanyang+technological+university&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Nanyang Technological University</span></a>, said both husband and wife have to work to pay off the property loan.Â âItâs more difficult to start a family with both working and some may put off having a family until they are older.â</p>
              <p>Professor Gavin Jones, a demographer at the Sociology department at the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+university+singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">National University of Singapore</span></a>, said the âperceived high financial and opportunity costâ deters couples.</p>
              <p>âOnce they have children, it closes off options seen as desirable; for example, free time, holidays and a career,â he said, adding thatÂ parentsÂ are alsoÂ under pressure to produce âquality childrenâ to do well in school and get ahead in life.</p>
              <p>âThere is pressure to devote a lot of effort to parenting, so it means giving them things like tuition. Itâs a highly labour-intensive process to raise kids here,â he said.</p>
              <p>Experts expect the low numbers to translate into far-reaching implications for the country, reported <em>ST</em>.</p>

              <p>âWhile it can be quite exciting, there will also be anxiety over the change in the Singapore identity,â he added. Policies would also need to be tweaked to cope with an already ageing population, which means people would have to work even longer.</p>
              <p>The recent Census of PopulationÂ 2010Â foundÂ a <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>six percentage point increase in the proportion of childless married women aged 30 to 39</strong></span> and a near-3 percentage point increase in women in their late 40s.</p>

              <p>I believe it has already been decided a long time ago that chinese from china will make up the numbers. They must have done their post baby bonus research / analysis and realised it isn't working at all.</p>
              <p>The main reason for not having kids is the cost of living.....and I don't think he really cares about that. So the easy way out is import of new population.</p>
