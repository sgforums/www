              <p>THE Census of Population 2010 released by the Singapore Department of 
              Statistics reveals a rise in the number of singles, especially prominent
               in the younger age groups between 2000 and 2010.</p>
              <p>Among Singapore citizens aged 30 to 34 years, the proportion
               of singles rose significantly from 33 to 43 per cent for males, and 
              from 22 to 31 per cent for females. This translates to a 10 per cent and
               9 per cent increase respectively.</p>
              <p>Singlehood was most prevalent among citizen males with below
               secondary qualifications and graduate citizen females.</p>
              <p>On the family front, there has been an increase of 6 per 
              cent - from 14 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2010 - in the 
              proportion of childless families.</p>
              <p>This took place among females aged 30 to 39 years. The age 
              group of 40 to 49 years saw an increase of 6.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent 
              during the same period.</p>
              <p>An upward trend has been noted in the number of families 
              that only have one child. Among females aged 40 to 49 years, the 
              proportion went up from 15 per cent in 2000 to 19 per cent in 2010. 
              Families with two children continue to be the norm.</p>

              <p>you are right.</p>
              <p>i dont understand the govt's rationale on this.  who cares about retirement when you have trouble surviving today?  its a simple logic but the so-called scholars cannot understand this?</p>
              <p>the cpf rule is just a sorry excuse to hold on tou our hard-earned money for their silly investments.</p>
              <p>why do we need them to tell us how and when to use our money.  its time they scrapped the cpf ruling.  it sucks!!!</p>
              <p>its not like the govt is going to look after us when we are down and broke.</p>

              <p>Exactly. Why the fuck they use such a nonsensical justification?</p>
              <p>They got PhD for farK? Someone should revoke their certs for their lack of common sense. They just say whatever they want becoz they can. It doesn't really matter to them as long as they produce us explanations which are valid even if its not related.</p>
              <p>Its just like when my uncle wanted to go buy petroleum the other day. The station didn't let him use plastic bottles making him use tins or metal bottles. Their reason "it could cause sparks". Isn't it the exact opposite?.</p>
