              <p>HAVING closely followed the vigorous debate on the subject of 
              granting a day off a week to domestic maids, I am unable to comprehend 
              the hullabaloo over something that is so fundamental - that is, every 
              worker needs a rest. Isn't this a given?</p>
              <p>Most of us work either a five-day or five-and-a-half-day 
              week, with up to 21 days of annual leave, and 11 public holidays. But 
              when it comes to granting a day off a week to domestic maids, we feel 
              that the sky is collapsing on us.</p>
              <p>Maids generally work long hours, with most starting their 
              household chores from as early as 5am and stopping at about 10pm. It can
               be longer for those who work in households with large families, 
              especially when they have to wash four cars, do the laundry, clean the 
              house, walk the dog and cook.</p>
              <p>Many employers do not treat their maids well. Over time, I have made many observations, and the following is only a sample:</p>
              <p>1. When employers go on vacation, they move the maid to 
              their parents' or in-laws' homes, so that they continue with the daily 
              household chores there. This smacks of the "making one's money's worth" 
              mentality.</p>
              <p>2. Maids are at the beck and call of the employers, even to the extent of fetching a glass of water.</p>
              <p>3. When families dine out, the maids are taken along to look
               after the children. In some instances, the maids are not given food.</p>
              <p>4. They are not allowed to talk on the phone. However, I 
              must add that maids, when allowed to use the phone, need to exercise 
              discipline.</p>
              <p>5. Instances of maid abuse are sufficiently frequent.</p>
              <p>So there is a lot of soul searching needed for employers of 
              maids. Maids, like them, are human, and need to be treated like one. 
              There should be no modern-day slavery.</p>

              <p>While the writer is well-intentioned, there are several points of which I disagree with him.</p>
              <p>First,</p>
              <p>He assumes that not giving him a day off, means that the maid is overworked and is not having enough rest.</p>
              <p>I believe this may or may not be the case.</p>
              <p>Even when the maid is working on a normal weekday, lets say on Monday or Tuesday, the welfare of the maid must be in attention and that means she must have enough rest, enough sleep, and the workload must be managable and so on. This doesnt neccessarily mean that a one day off is the solution.</p>
              <p>Second,</p>
              <p>People who dont give one-day off doesnt necessarily mean the maid is overworked. Again it depends on daily workload.</p>
              <p>We see the reasons employers are hesitant in giving one day off are, worrying that the maid will be interacting with bad people, or, that the maid is needed during that day off, or, the maid herself doesnt mind and is willing to work to earn more cash.</p>
              <p>Anyways I personally dont have any strong opinion on this. Off day or not off day, is ok.</p>
              <p>But I want to challenge the writer's further faulty assumptions.</p>
              <p>He said when employers go on vacation, transferring the maid to relatives is a kind of "milking" or "exploiting" them. This is wrong. Why is it deemed as an exploitation ? We see that the writer has some kind of fundamental wrong assumptions or prejudices.</p>
              <p>Further,</p>
              <p>He said asking for glass of water is also an exploitation.</p>
              <p>This is wrong again.</p>
              <p>If we go to restaurants, dont we also ask waiters for glass of water ?</p>
              <p>What is wrong with it ?</p>
              <p>Again the issue is not whether asking these things is too much or not, but whether the employers are polite and decent. The employers should be polite and remember to say "thank you" after the glass of water is fetched. But to say that the act of asking for fetching of water is wrong, is wrong assumption.</p>
              <p>Maids are not slaves and are not chattles. So when this writer are thinking these things, maybe he is having prejudice and is imagining things in his mind, as if maids are such poor people who are getting oppressed by slave masters. This is not true.</p>
              <p>Furthermore,</p>
              <p>He said on family outings, maids dont eat together with the family, and also maids cannot use phones at homes.</p>
              <p>What is wrong with it ?</p>
              <p>Again, he assumes this is a type of human rights violation and a kind of exploitation.</p>
              <p>This is false.</p>
              <p>In fact it is correct and proper to maintain a distance and a decorum, between employer and employee, especially one where in this case of maids, the nature of work is such that there is a lot of contacts and interactions in an intimate personal family area.</p>
              <p>In fact, if such a distance is not maintained, bad things will happen.</p>
              <p>Why did Arnold Schwarzenegger have sex-affair with his maid ?</p>
              <p>So we see maintaining proper distance is a correct action, and is not harmful to the dignity of the maid, in fact it protects and respect the dignity of the employee concerned.</p>
              <p>Again finally I conclude that the writer is an unrealistic person and actually holds many prejudices on maids and is thinking in his mind many funny things.</p>
              <p>Just know that maids are not slaves, and are not chattels. They are employees, working in a domestic informal sector, at homes, interacting with employers families. They have their rights and their duties, but also understand that due to the nature of their work, there will be some meshing between private and work, and both sides will work out what is best and most comfortable for both of them. No need for high-horse pronouncements to "protect" them and come up with these patronizing suggestions. They are patronizing to the maid and to the employers families.</p>
              <p>Thank you.</p>
