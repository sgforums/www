              <div class="kicker">LAND CRUNCH</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Free up golf courses for other sports</h1>
              <p>IN HIS letter, 'Land, not money, is the primary problem' (March 30), 
              Mr Andrew Williams bemoaned the dearth of permanent spaces for 
              recreational sports in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the light of increasing enthusiasm for these pursuits 
              among the young, he reasoned that more land, rather than money, needs to
               be found to meet their needs.</p>
              <p>We may not have to look far for such land.</p>
              <p>In a report last year ('Plots of greenery for recreation and
               friendship'), 300 plots totalling 582ha of open spaces were made 
              available for recreational use free of charge.</p>
              <p>This is roughly the size of 892 football pitches. There is 
              no indication that this area will be enlarged in tandem with the 
              increasing popularity of sports.</p>
              <p>Yet, in contrast, to date we have built 22 golf courses, 
              most of which are 18-holed oases to cater to a sport whose following is a
               mere 2 per cent of all regular sports participants, according to the 
              Singapore Sports Council's National Sports Participation Survey in 2005.</p>
              <p>Discounting the driving ranges, these 22 courses occupy 
              about 1,400ha of land, if one makes the conservative calculation of 
              pegging each course at an average of 65ha each.</p>
              <p>The 1,400ha of land is equivalent to 2,200 football pitches.</p>
              <p>Given the disparity in space allocation for sports and 
              recreation, it is easy to conclude that golf courses, especially in the 
              context of land-scarce Singapore, are hogging far more state land than 
              is necessary.</p>
              <p>The old rationale that the land cannot be used for other 
              developments strains credulity.</p>
              <p>Regardless of the innumerable justifications, ranging from 
              health to economic well-being, for turning vast stretches of premium 
              land into golf courses for the pleasure of a small minority, the 
              question that must be asked in the context of a land squeeze for sports 
              is: Do we really need 22?</p>
              <p>We must free up in stages some of our golf courses for the 
              sake of the growing number of sports-loving children who need the space 
              to play and grow into robust and health-conscious adults. The extent of 
              benefits far outweighs those that golf can provide.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Golf courses can be green and non-elitist</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Lee Seck Kay's letter yesterday, 'Free up golf courses 
              for other sports'.</p>
              <p>I agree. The old excuse that golf courses were built only 
              near reservoirs does not hold water any more.</p>
              <p>Golf courses should not only be shared with other sports, 
              but should also allow native biodiversity to return and thrive.</p>
              <p>This can be done by creating tree links between golf courses
               - like park connectors - for native fauna to move freely and create a 
              larger gene pool.</p>
              <p>If these connectors are wide and dense enough, they can 
              eventually be used by nature lovers.</p>
              <p>Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong recently urged Singaporeans to
               make immigrants feel welcome. Isn't it time golf clubs shed their 
              elitist image and made Singaporeans and visitors welcome?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Golf course sites have constraints, so less suited for 
              community sports</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Mr Lee Seck Kay ('Free up golf courses for other sports'; 
              April 8) and Mr Grant W. Pereira ('Golf courses can be green and 
              non-elitist'; last Friday) for their feedback.</p>
              <p>As part of the comprehensive land-use planning process, the 
              Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) works closely with government 
              agencies to ensure that sufficient land is set aside for economic, 
              social and recreational uses. For sports, the URA and the Singapore 
              Sports Council (SSC) plan for a range of facilities to cater to the 
              interests of different groups.</p>
              <p>At present, the SSC promotes participation in sports through
               its comprehensive network of public sports facilities, such as some 20 
              stadiums, 24 swimming complexes and 16 multi-purpose sports halls, most 
              of which are located within residential areas so they are easily 
              accessible to the community.</p>
              <p>In addition, through the collaboration with the Ministry of
               Education (MOE), there are 130 school fields and 30 school sports halls
               available for public use over the weekend under the Dual Use Scheme.</p>
              <p>Most existing golf courses are located in areas with various
               constraints which mean development potential of the land is limited. 
              Examples include areas with noise and height constraints, such as in the
               vicinity of airports.</p>
              <p>Such sites are also generally farther from residential 
              areas, and hence less suitable for community sports facilities.</p>
              <p>Nonetheless, in reviewing land use plans, the URA will weigh
               competing land use needs and assess how much land should be set aside 
              for golf courses in the long term.</p>
