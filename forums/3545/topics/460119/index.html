              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Emeritus 
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong says Singapore has to stay exceptional by 
              remaining cohesive as a nation, with first-rate leaders to navigate the 
              choppy seas of the changing world order.<br><br>As a small state with its own changing domestic landscape, it will have its work cut out, he said.<br><br>Mr
               Goh shared his views, experiences and hard truths on how Singapore 
              navigates, survives and even thrives in a challenging world -- at a 
              public lecture, "Navigating A Changing World: Perspectives of a Small 
              State", at Harvard University Asia Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
              on Monday.<br><br>Mr Goh, who was invited to speak as an Ezra F. Vogel 
              Distinguished Visitor said the perennial challenge for small states is 
              to preserve their independence and remain relevant and competitive.<br><br>He
               said they will have a long and bumpy journey with recurring political, 
              economic and financial crises, and even regional conflicts, along the 
              way.<br><br>Stressing the need for domestic consensus, Mr Goh said 
              Singapore's experience has shown that small states can overcome the odds
               and play a meaningful role in the international arena if they can 
              succeed as a country -- with a vibrant economy, effective and 
              forward-looking national institutions, as well a progressive and 
              prosperous society.<br><br>He said governance must be outstanding and 
              there must be a national consensus on where the country is heading and 
              how problems are to be solved.<br><br>"Unless we are respected as a 
              successful country, we cannot expect to exercise any international 
              influence. Why should others listen to us or deal with us if our house 
              is in disarray and we cannot even solve our own problems?" he asked.<br><br>Mr
               Goh said Singapore has been able to navigate changes in the 
              international environment because it has had far-sighted, competent and 
              decisive leaders since independence and has succeeded in building a 
              prosperous society.<br><br>But there is no guarantee that it can 
              continue to do so successfully in future; and it has to continue to 
              strive to stay ahead of the curve, adjust its policies in a rational and
               pragmatic manner and stay united as a people.  <br><br>Mr Goh said: "We must see the world as it is -- an ocean of big fish, small fish and shrimps -- and not what we wish it to be. <br><br>"And
               therein lies the challenging task of having to forge a consensus with 
              greater political diversity and citizen involvement, while retaining our
               agility to respond decisively and quickly to challenges and 
              opportunities." <br><br>Mr Goh, who was prime minister from 1990 to 
              2004, said in his 14 years at the helm, his singular mission was to 
              "Keep Singapore Going".<br><br>By this, he meant safeguarding the 
              country's independence, securing its future, growing the economy, 
              improving the livelihood of Singaporeans, preserving social harmony and 
              expanding Singapore's international space.<br><br>"These changes and the
               global environment are not always benign. They include not just 
              geopolitical shifts, but also economic competition and the impact of 
              technological advancements. One wrong turn, and the consequences may be 
              disastrous," he said.<br><br>Mr Goh said this does not mean that small states are destined to be the vassals or chameleons of the world.<br><br>Instead,
               Singapore takes a realistic and strategic view of the world, makes 
              itself relevant to others in vital areas, plays a positive international
               role and contributes constructively to global issues.<br><br>To prosper
               in the fluid international environment, small states must keep 
              enlarging their diplomatic, economic and strategic space.<br><br>And one
               way Singapore has done so is by building strong relationships, 
              especially against the backdrop of a key relationship -- that of the 
              United States and China.<br><br>A constructive relationship between the 
              two giants, said Mr Goh, is good for both parties and vital for the rest
               of the world, especially for small states like Singapore.<br><br>As 
              China grows, some degree of competition with the US is inevitable but 
              there is no reason why competition cannot take place within a stable 
              framework, with both countries exercising their responsibilities as 
              international stakeholders.<br><br>Unlike US-Soviet relations, there is 
              no ideological divide between the US and China, as both sides want 
              essentially the same things -- stability in their relations and in the 
              international system to pursue economic growth and a better life for 
              their people.<br><br>He cited an African proverb "When elephants fight, 
              the grass gets hurt" to make the point that small people are sacrificed 
              by warring chiefs and small countries suffer collateral damage from 
              conflict amongst big powers. <br><br>Countries such as Singapore have a vested interest to ensure elephants do not fight, said Mr Goh.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

Singaporeans have so many plus points that made it what it is today, otherwise foreigners would not love to be part of the family. Everyone stands to win for being lovingly love hahahaha! It goes to show that highly paid does not necessarily mean that it's the proper course for ministerial pay to steer sg away from their increasing problem of disregarding the efforts of contribution from both foreign countries assistance, foreigners and in particular the great efforts, resilience and benevolence nature of most singaporeans since the "secession" of sg from msia. </p></div>
