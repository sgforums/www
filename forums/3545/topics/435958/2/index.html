              <p>Seriously, what charges can be pressed onto her? Misuse of Computer Act? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>Sheesh. Be realistic. If she had made some racial-based insults or something, at least she can be charged under the Racial Harmony Act.</p>
              <p>Her employers are already conducting a probe against her, and I think that's already quite damaging to her.</p>

              shorten the NS serving period . or better yet to have none serving
              NS at all and let those who really wanna serve full time in army to
              do it or utilize more gurkha . it would help to save more
              time . imagine after school we go NS and then we come out and
              prepare for uni by the time we are already like what . 22 ? 23
              ? and by the time we finished uni we are already about 27
              or 28 . lets say we can live to the age of 60 . half already
              gone you see . and how long would company let you
              work before they retire you ? if you are lucky .
              lets say they let you work until 50 year old . that means
              right after you graduated from uni you only have less than 20 years

              In a stunning turn to the ongoing saga involving degoratory remarks made by Ms Rachelle Ann Beguia, her husband Gay Chao Hui just posted on the Facebook page of Penny Low claiming responsibility for them.
              
              In the short statement, Mr Gay, who is working as a tutor at Tampines Junior College claimed he used her wifeâ€™s facebook to post the remarks without her knowledge:
              
              â€œOn 10 August 2011, using my wife Rachelle Ann Beguiaâ€™s facebook account, I her husband Gay Chao Hui, had posted remarks that have inflamed many Singaporeans. These remarks were posted without her knowledge.â€�
              
              He apologized to those who have been â€˜hurtâ€™ by â€˜hisâ€™ postings as well as the National Heart Center, adding that he has subjected his wife to â€˜immenseâ€™ emotional distress.
              
              â€œI would like to express my remorse and deepest apologies to the people of Singapore who have been hurt by my remarks.â€�
              
              His lame explanation was not accepted by the majority of the netizens who felt he is taking the rap for his wife to prevent her from being sacked by NHC.

              â€œObviously it was Rachelle Ann Beguia who made those remarks, she took leave the following day after making those remarks. Guilty conscience much? Donâ€™t tell me she was feeling unwell thatâ€™s why she took leave the following day because if she really is, she wouldâ€™ve went to rest/sleep rather than staying up late in the night posting those seditious remarks, trying to cover up by deleting those comments and changing her name and deactivating her facebook account.â€�
              
              Tan Fu Shun is not convinced:
              
              â€œMr gayâ€¦. donâ€™t try to bluff us â€¦ we know that it not you who write that remarkâ€¦.. donâ€™t waste your time trying to block the bullets for your wifeâ€¦ it futile â€¦â€�
              
              Haziq Evan Rose spotted the difference in writing style:
              
              â€œHahahahaha, hey Rachelle, your writing styleâ€™s totally different from before. Do you think weâ€™re stupid? Oneâ€™s writing style is like his signature. And its plainly obvious yours is clearly different from Rachelleâ€™s.â€�
