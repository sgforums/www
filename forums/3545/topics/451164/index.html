              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: It is 
              important that Singapore's newspapers, radio and television stations do 
              not lose sight of their key strengths, even as the media industry adapts
               to the online playing field, Minister for Information, Communication 
              and the Arts Yaacob Ibrahim said.<br><br>Speaking at a luncheon 
              organised by Singapore Press Club on Monday, Dr Yaacob said as more 
              Singaporeans turn to the Internet and social media for news and views, 
              they also continue to refer to the established traditional media as 
              their main source of news.<br><br>One example was the two elections held in Singapore in 2011.<br><br>Dr
               Yaacob stressed that while the newspaper, radio and television players 
              exercise their own independent editorial judgement in their reporting, 
              they must remain mindful of their roles and responsibilities.<br><br>He 
              said Singapore's media model is based on consensus and facilitating 
              nation building, as well as preserving social cohesion and empowering 
              audiences to make informed decisions as a society.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said the question that would now arise is whether this approach should continue online.<br><br>"Our
               major companies which have established presence can set the right tone 
              online as well with good practices of information sharing and moderation
               on the various online platforms," he said.<br><br>"We can encourage 
              information and viewpoints that inform and evaluate, and not disturb and
               divide. This will enhance their credibility that they already enjoy in 
              the real world."<br><br>Dr Yaacob said this will enhance the credibility that they already enjoy in the real world.<br><br>He also spoke about an internet code of conduct involving the larger online community.<br><br>"If
               there are enough moderating voices within the Internet to decide what 
              is good and what is not acceptable, I believe it will work," Dr Yaacob 
              said.<br><br>"The government has a stake in this and we will continue to
               encourage and engage people who have an interest in how the code of 
              conduct can be shaped."<br><br>The last thing the government should do, Dr Yaacob said, is to adopt a top-down process.<br><br>The
               top-down process will become an instruction and, in some way, the 
              public will look towards the government to enforce the code, he said.<br><br>If
               it is a bottom-up process, a certain degree of give-and-take and a 
              certain degree of moderation would have to take place, Dr Yaacob added.<br><br>He said the light-touch approach for the Internet has worked and can continue to work as good sense can prevail.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
