              <p>HR: people want cheap. who cares?! taht's why they are her. they rais eteh salary sgreans already filled the gaps already! and with the low birthrate thansk to the HLfamily head's fstop 2 policy, we cannot replace our aging and dead population fast enough to take on the jobs.</p>
              <p>faster: yest besides all the above mentioned as possible root causes, how about oeprations and procedures. is the load too mush or speed too fast for the braking to be effective? was any protocol violated?</p>
              <p>that's why isay its still partly gahmen to blame. somany unskilled labor around, who let them in? MOM jsut allow companies or their middle people to handle and they just approve only lah? MOM should have people technically inclined the athe aresas of work to also review the cheap labors tht comes in if certain ckill set ios required, interview them if need to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>like that is fast mah. i can bet this is not teh first time they doing this or might have broken the standard oeprtaing protocol and relates to safety. only last time many times nothing happen but now i guess we made it in the news.</p>
              <p> </p>

              Then why on earth they did the testing of the jacking
              mechanism on one of the legs of the oil rig knowing that there are
              workers onboard? Its that the correct high level safety and quality
              protocol practise in Singapore shipyard?</p>

              Hope you dun mind that I point out this, I dun think that they are doing the load testing when there are workers onboard.  They indiciate that the loadtest was already done (I presume when they mention this, it mean that this system had been commissioning already).  But i do agree to wait for further information as now it is just piece of information which still dun can't show the full picture.
              
              Below is the statement - Mr Wong said initial investigations showed the braking system on one of the movable legs of the rig had failed, causing the platform to slide down the leg on that side.
               
              Load tests run on the rig just a day before the accident had shown the three legs of the rig could bear a load of some 9000 tonnes each, said Mr Wong.

              they care less about safety, efficiency and productivity. They
              could even purposely do a poor job on the project knowing that
              through time it would be damaged or destroyed. That is sabotage.

              Agree with this as I had come across such sabotage when there are people who on purpose cut the wire cable when I am on one project assignment in SG (Nobody know who did this but there are warning sign claiming that this is a crime and will be send to police if caught.  Though after end of the project as we did not manage to get the person, I can't tell that it is a local or foreigner doing this)

              what if design and engineering no issue? what if its a poor
              weld or imappropriate equipment installation? workers dont know how
              to interpret or never do as per instructed?, AND even shit the
              inspectors failed to catch the problem or skipped some aras of
              checking?</p>

              It is possible as according to the statement, the system had been load test the day before.  But just to correct you normally the worker is not the one to interpret but the engineer and the inspectors is suppose to check the work.   Actually fyi, I know who is the client/owner of this rig and i know that this company (which is a US company) tend to hire alot of FT inspectors/engineer from country P, I and C as their recruitment agency tend to supply them with staffs from this few countries.  However at the moment, the whole report is not out yet so nobody know what happen yet.

              Ok. Initially when I read the news in yahoo when the accident had occurred, it mentioned that the testing was done while the workers were onboard. I know someone who is a freelance marine engineer, when they mentioned a 22 year old female engineer was injured, thought it was her and made a quick check and glad it wasn't.

              Ok. Initially when I read the news in yahoo when the accident had
              occurred, it mentioned that the testing was done while the workers
              were onboard. I know someone who is a freelance marine engineer,
              when they mentioned a 22 year old female engineer was injured,
              thought it was her and made a quick check and glad it wasn't.</p>

              Quite lucky on this case also.  But I thought when conducting such loadtest, people should not be onboard.

              That is why I ask as someone mention that the jack leg had bend which is quite rare though pls, it is still possible, I saw it happen offshore before.
              
              That also why i mention that there should be no workers onboard during loadtest.  It should be be couple of commissioning guys which are client rep, class rep, a couple of yard guys, and a few operation guy that running the system.  And that should be all, I can't think of any other people that need to go onboard.  During that time, there should not be any other work being done.  At least that how SG practice and all the different place that I know practice.

              <p>I have a full time job, but in between, I sometimes have a huge lull between jobs, and my full time job lets me work from home, so I freelance as an engineer for another company to check engineering drawings when I have time, can supplement my income leh.</p>
              <p>To answer your question, this industry is not "real mission critical" as what you think. It only becomes that case when that particular installation is out the yard, and making an obcene amount of money. The shipyard employs, and outsources its vendors, and sub contractors, so these vendors, and sub contractors would be the one engaging their own staff, and yes they could be freelance. Most of the freelance positions I've come across for this industry are rope access guys, and divers. They don't get a basic monthly pay, but they do get a day rate, which commensurates with the risk of the job.</p>

              And not only that but as a freelance marine engineer you can earn more I think. My friend earns a fixs basic salary of $2000 per month regardless whether she goes onboard the vessel or not and the extra incentive is each time she goes onboard she gets paid $800 but I'm not sure whether there is any monthly CPF contribution from her boss or deduction from her gross monthly salary.
