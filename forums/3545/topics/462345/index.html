              From what I read, the rig is not handover yet and still at berth.  So should not be in deep sea at the moment (afterall within SG sea, there no oil to extract).  Since it is not handover yet, it should be still around pre-commissioning or commissioning phase as it is one month before handover.  Anyway, this look more like an engineering issue that cause this failure (can be due to human during design/installation/commissioning etc).

              <p style="margin-bottom: 13px; border: 0px; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Mr Tan said he was encouraged that all the workers on the rig had been evacuated within 20 minutes.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>tell me now am i wrong to say its really</p>

              <p><br>From what I read, the rig is not handover yet and still at berth. So should not be in deep sea at the moment (afterall within SG sea, there no oil to extract). Since it is not handover yet, it should be still around pre-commissioning or commissioning phase as it is one month before handover. Anyway, this look more like an engineering issue that cause this failure (can be due to human during design/installation/commissioning etc).</p>

              <p><br>what if design and engineering no issue? what if its a poor weld or imappropriate equipment installation? workers dont know how to interpret or never do as per instructed?, AND even shit the inspectors failed to catch the problem or skipped some aras of checking?</p>

              I've attended the marine industry workshop at Keppel Shipyard, Sing Marine and Sembawang Shipyard in 2005. Singapore holds a big major share in the world for building, converting, renovating and repairs of sea vessels and oil rigs. And I know not many Singaporeans would like to work at the shipyard because of its hazardous occupation.
                      
              I'm not working in the air-conditioning room and desk bound now. I'm into semi retirement now. However, in my last profession I was dealing with many foreign workers and I heard many of their problems about work or management treatment but I couldn't do much for them. I'm not ignorant in hard work and working under the hot sun....was working during my school holidays in the past as construction worker carrying bricks up the stairs and I was also at one time a metal roofing specialist. 
                      
              I don't blame the foreign workers rather their management or their superiors for not taking care good of their welfare. The foreign workers from India and Bangladesh are daily rated which is about $27 to $28 per day. Most of them not really skilled workers with experience working in the shipyard back in their own countries.

              Then why on earth they did the testing of the jacking mechanism on one of the legs of the oil rig knowing that there are workers onboard? Its that the correct high level safety and quality protocol practise in Singapore shipyard?
                      
              Lets wait for the investigation to be over and lets hope its really 100% mechanism failure and not human negligence. This is a serious accident which could be avoided and someone really need to be responsible for it.
