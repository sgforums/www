              <p><strong>Singapore's DNA to be young city-state will enable country to thrive</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 05 April 2010 2246 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's DNA to be a young city-state is the key 
              that will enable the country to thrive.
              <br> <br> Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean made this point as he addressed more
               than 250 undergraduates at a forum on Monday.
              <br> <br> The forum was organised by the National University of Singapore (NUS) 
              Student's Political Association.
              <br> <br> It was an audience fit for the topic at hand - "Singapore - Forever 
              Young".
              <br> <br> After 45 years of independence, Singapore is still a considerably young 
              nation.
              <br> <br> But as DPM Teo pointed out, past successes do not guarantee future 
              achievements.
              <br> <br> He cited the example of Ireland. He said that up to three years ago, 
              Ireland was known as the Celtic Tiger, just as Singapore is known as one
               of the Asian Tigers. 
              <br> <br> But a period of excess and the global financial meltdown plunged 
              Ireland's economy into crisis. 
              <br> <br> And for Singapore not to suffer the same fate, it needs to reinvent 
              itself and adapt to changing environments.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said that just like an individual, being young for city-states 
              like Singapore is an attitude of mind.
              <br> <br> The good news is that Singapore has five building blocks that give the 
              country strong foundations.
              <br> <br> One is that there is a strong culture of education and learning here.
              <br> <br> "A strong culture of education and continuous learning keeps our people 
              young and relevant, no matter what their ages are," said Mr Teo.
              <br> <br> Complementing that is a culture of seeking knowledge, innovation and 
              ideas.
              <br> <br> That's where Singapore's strategy to grow as an R&amp;D hub in areas 
              ranging from electronics to pharmaceuticals comes to play.
              <br> <br> "If we are trapped in the industries of the past, we will become the new
               'rust belt', with old factories, making old products, using old skills 
              and technology," said Mr Teo.
              <br> <br> "If we have to depend only on imported ideas, we will not be able to 
              climb beyond our current economic level to new heights, and will 
              eventually be surpassed and left behind," he added.
              <br> <br> "To be 'forever young', we need to be at the forefront of knowledge and 
              innovation. (We need to be) creators and not just users of ideas," said 
              Mr Teo. 
              <br> <br> Singapore also needs to be a vibrant and sustainable global city.
              <br> <br> "Though cities only occupy two percent of the Earth's land area, they 
              consume over 75 percent of its natural resources. There is a pressing 
              need for sustainable urban development solutions," said Mr Teo. 
              <br> <br> "Because of Singapore's unique circumstances, we have the opportunity to
               be at the forefront of successful urban living - which is connected, 
              safe, sustainable and socially integrated," added Mr Teo.
              <br> <br> Without any natural resources, Mr Teo said, Singapore must be a magnet 
              for talent and must rejuvenate its population.
              <br> <br> "As a city-state, we have one big advantage over our competitor cities. 
              Our competitor cities have few tools to regulate this rural inflow, 
              while we can shape, with immigration controls, who comes to Singapore," 
              he said.
              <br> <br> "So we have to get the setting right. But I've always been very 
              confident about our immigration policy, because we can get the setting, 
              we can adjust the setting. We thus constantly adjust the tap so that we 
              can bring in the people that we need to sustain population and economic 
              growth and dynamism, while maintaining our social cohesion and 
              stability."
              <br> <br> And tying everything together is a strong and forward-looking 
              leadership.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo called for leadership renewal, not just within the political 
              sphere but also the community. "We need active citizens who are prepared
               to come forward to actively and constructively contribute to making 
              Singapore a better home for all of us."
              <br> <br> The forum also featured a wide-ranging dialogue session with the 
              undergraduates. One recurring theme was the issue of Singapore's 
              vulnerability, it being a small city-state.
              <br> <br> Mr Teo said it is possible for the country to fall if it is not careful.
               He said as a small nation, the margin for error is much less compared 
              to bigger countries. And being trade dependent, Singapore is also 
              vulnerable to external factors.
              <br> <br> He said that is why the country needs to create buffers in an uncertain 
              world. Mr Teo pointed to Singapore's reserves and strong investment in 
              defence as examples of big anchors that keep the country stable.
              <br> <br> He said: "So the question is: should all of you be so frightened that 
              all of you abandon ship straightaway?
              <br> <br> "No, the answer is 'no'. What I'm trying to put to you is, you should 
              have a well-founded confidence in our own future. 
              <br> <br> "Why? Because even though we have vulnerabilities, we have anchors 
              against these vulnerabilities, and indeed we have many, many strengths 
              for the future."
