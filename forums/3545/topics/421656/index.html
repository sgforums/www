              <p>MY FAMILY has been taking in abandoned rabbits for the past 10 years, 
              so I was troubled by the Rabbits In The City event organised by Pets 
              Village at Suntec City Mall from Jan 20 to Jan 30.</p>
              <p>First, rabbits are very timid and fragile animals, and 
              subjecting them to such stress at a crowded public event is cruel as it 
              can result in them falling ill and even dying.</p>
              <p>Worse still, at the event, some rabbits were kept in tiny 
              cages not even fit to house a hamster. The larger rabbits barely had 
              enough space to turn around. Furthermore, the cages had wire floors, 
              which could result in the animals developing sore hocks.</p>
              <p>The Pets Village staff standing at the table with the 
              rabbits in cages also did not stop people from poking their fingers at 
              the rabbits.</p>
              <p>Moreover, people were allowed to pat the rabbits which would
               definitely have caused them severe stress. Some of my more timid 
              rabbits at home won't even let me pat them, but will run away if I try. 
              However, the rabbits at the Suntec event were put on a table surrounded 
              by people, with nowhere to run.</p>
              <p>A staff member there claimed the event was to educate the 
              public. However, with all the things they were doing wrong, how could 
              they be educating the public? Although they said they were not selling 
              rabbits at the event, Pets Village does sell rabbits, and its staff were
               giving out the company business cards.</p>
              <p>I was really shocked to learn that the event was approved by
               the Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA), and hope that AVA will 
              never again allow such events to take place, and will put more effort 
              into educating the public about rabbits.</p>
