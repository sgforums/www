              					<span class="qsAdd qs-source-iapsitlnk0000002"><span>Dan Carroll</span></span> </span><br> <span class="dateline">May 19, 2013</span> - <em>The Motley Fool </em><span class="comments"></span></p>
              <p>The recession has taken a toll on economies around the world, 
              from driving down standards of living to sending unemployment to record 
              levels. Through it all, however, some nations' people have emerged 
              stronger and wealthier than ever before. Is there a trend among the 
              richest countries on the planet, and can investors benefit from these 
              economies' gains?</p>
              <p>Compiled from data from the International Monetary Fund's 2013 
              estimates, here are the richest five nations among the world's 50 
              largest economies, sorted by GDP per capita and adjusted for 
              purchasing-power parity. While at least one expected name makes the 
              list, a few may surprise you.</p>
              <p><strong>No. 5: Switzerland, $46,474 per person</strong><br>Kicking 
              off the list is Europe's second-wealthiest country, Switzerland. The 
              Swiss economy has performed remarkably well despite its proximity to 
              recession-battered European nations. Switzerland's GDP grew 3% in 2010 
              and an estimated 0.9% in 2012. Those aren't eye-popping numbers, but 
              compared to Europe's far-reaching contraction, it's a relieving dose of 
              stability. Swiss citizens have gained from the country's notoriety as a 
              tax haven, and the country's forward-looking moves -- such as its 
              preliminary agreement to a free-trade deal with China -- should only 
              benefit its economy in coming years. The IMF expects Switzerland's GDP 
              per capita to rise to more than $54,000 by 2018.</p>
              <p>Investors can get in on the country's good fortune as well. Swiss drugmaker <strong>Novartis</strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">NVS</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)
                has been a standout stock among big pharmas, with shares gaining more 
              than 45% over the past year. Novartis' future is bright with drugs such 
              as its oral multiple-sclerosis medication Gilenya, which analysts have pegged to gain peak sales of between $2 billion and $3.5 billion. Among Swiss stocks, <strong>Nestle</strong> (<span class="ticker">NASDAQOTH: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">NSRGY</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>) , which has seen its shares gain 20% over the past year, is poised to become a leader among the growing infant-nutrition business.
               Infant nutrition has risen especially sharply in emerging markets such 
              as China, and Nestle's one of the top players poised to capitalize. 
              Investors have plenty to pick from in this wealthy nation.</p>
              <p><strong>No. 4: United Arab Emirates, $49,883 per person</strong><br>A
               few Middle Eastern nations have profited in a big way from the region's
               oil bounty, but few have done so as successfully -- and as publicly -- 
              as the UAE. Dubai, the country's largest city, has exploded into a 
              desert metropolis as the nation's citizens have enjoyed top-tier gains 
              in standards of living. The nation's still in the middle of developing, 
              with tourism playing an important role in the country's economic growth.
               Foreign investment has also supercharged the country's economy, with 
              more than $10 billion in foreign investment entering the country in 
              2011. The IMF's estimates are optimistic: The organization expects the 
              UAE's GDP per capita to grow to more than $57,000 by 2018.</p>
              <p>The nation's rise has been a boon for the country's markets, which 
              recently hit multiyear highs. While investing in this rising star isn't 
              so easy as investing in an established nation such as Switzerland, 
              Middle East ETFs such as the <strong>Market Vectors Gulf States Index ETF</strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSEMKT: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">MES</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)
                offer exposure to the brightest growth story in the region. Almost 30%
               of this ETF's exposure is concentrated in the UAE, the second-leading 
              nation in the ETF and trailing only Kuwait.</p>
              <p><strong>No. 3: United States, $51,248 per person</strong><br>I think 
              most investors will recognize this nation. For all the hits the U.S. 
              economy has taken throughout its slow recovery from the depths of the 
              recession, the average American still lives a remarkably wealthy 
              lifestyle. Falling unemployment, which declined to 7.5%
               recently, and the country's housing rebound have helped America dig out
               of the economic doldrums. The IMF expects good things ahead for the 
              U.S., predicting a per-capita GDP of more than $63,000 by 2018. While 
              challenges remain for the U.S., the country's GDP continues on an upward
               track despite the recent tax increases and implementation of 
              sequestration.</p>
              <p>If you're looking to take advantage of the U.S.' economic growth, 
              look no further than the housing recovery. Home improvement retailers 
              such as <strong>Home Depot</strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">HD</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)  and <strong>Lowe's</strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">LOW</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)  are at the center of this trend. Home Depot has done well by growing its profit and return on equity,
               and it grew sales by 14% in its most recent quarterly report -- 
              although the stock's run-up of 63% over the last year gives pause. 
              Lowe's smaller size has slowed the company down in relation to Home 
              Depot, and while the stock has done well in gaining more than 50% over 
              the past year, Lowe's will need to pick up same-store sales growth to 
              match Home Depot. Still, both stocks look poised to capitalize on the 
              American economy's resurgent growth.</p>
              <p><strong>No. 2: Norway, $56,663 per person</strong><br>At No. 2, 
              Norway is Europe's wealthiest nation. Like Switzerland, this economy has
               remained remarkably stable throughout Europe's debt crisis. Norway's 
              GDP grew by 0.7% in 2013's first quarter as the nation's oil resources 
              powered the country's wealth. While some Norwegian experts have warned 
              that the country's dependence on oil and energy could hurt its future, 
              Norway's doing well right now: Projections peg the country's mainland 
              economy to grow by 2.75% this year.</p>
              <p>The IMF's certainly bullish, projecting Norway's GDP per capita to 
              grow to nearly $66,000 in 2018, maintaining its lead over the U.S. While
               Norwegian companies are hard to find on American stock exchanges, one 
              low-risk way to gain Norwegian exposure is to buy shares in the main Big
               Oil firms. <strong>BP </strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSE: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">BP</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)
                and many of its competitors engage in exploration and drilling in the 
              North Sea. Out of all the oil majors, however, BP may be the one stock 
              to avoid in Norway: A government agency pushed a safety review on the 
              company in late April following a leak at one of BP's North Sea fields 
              last September. For now, expect this company to remain closely watched 
              in Norway.</p>
              <p><strong>No. 1: Singapore, $61,567 per person</strong><br>The 
              wealthiest nation in the world's top 50 economies has been one of the 
              hottest growth stories in recent years. Singapore's emergence as a 
              business hub and tax haven -- research firm WealthInsight predicts that 
              the country will surpass Switzerland as the world's largest offshore 
              wealth hub by 2020 -- has been a boon for its population's standard of 
              living. Foreign investment has poured into the nation, turning Singapore
               into Southeast Asia's pre-eminent economy. The country is expected to 
              gain even more in the next few years, with the IMF expecting Singapore's
               GDP per capita to rise to an astounding $77,000 by 2018.</p>
              <p>The <strong>iShares MSCI Singapore Index Fund</strong> (<span class="ticker">NYSEMKT: <span class="qsAdd qs-source-isssitthv0000001">EWS</span></span> <span class="addToWatchListIcon qsAdd qs-source-iwlsitbut0000010"> </span>)
                has performed well alongside the country's growth, gaining more than 
              22% over the past year. The ETF is weighted heavily toward finance and 
              real estate, with more than half of its assets in those two sectors. 
              While the Singapore ETF will likely continue to rise with the nation's 
              economy, don't expect rapid gains from an index fund like this.</p>

              Rich foreigners bought private properties in Singapore just for investment but they don't live in Singapore...some of them could be mafias, corrupted officials, drug dealers etcs to wash their dirty money. Worse of all the terrorist financial supporters or the terrorists themselves using this means to hide their money...its possible. As for the Singaporean themselves, most of them can't afford it but force themselves to buy the private properties as investment for future profits but many too landed up being a bankrupt...totally.
