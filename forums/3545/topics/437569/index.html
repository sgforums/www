               i think Singaporeans should watch more China movies and serial, then we will realise China Nationals look down on their own people even worse than us. 
              
              Beijing residents will always look down on those who flock to their capital to work and get married. Even a Beijing wife will always look down on her other province born husband. I saw this in a China movie. They do not spare any words to critise their own countrymen in their own country.
              
              As for the India nationals, their caste system is even more obvious.
              
              I donâ€™t think we should feel that we are anti-foreigners when they are the ones who come to Singapore and bring their superiority culture here to look down on us. 
              
              Thatâ€™s why we are anti-foreigners. Singaporeans are definitely more tolerant and less status conscious than China and India nationals.
              
              Recently there is this Going Home show on 8 and you can see how much an Indonesian maid can bring home to build a big house, buy a truck for the husband to start a transport company in as short as 6 years in Singapore. Another Bangala gardener in Singapore become a landlord of two shops and a landed house when he works here.
              
              Singapore is a big pot of Gold to these foreigners. They should at least respect our country and Singaporeans. 
              
              China managers/executives earn 6-8k rmb which is only a mere 1200 sing dollar after exchange.  Their lower rank jobs earn 1200 rmb.   Why should they be proud towards Singaporeans when they are here to study and work with a good pay of 4000 - 10,000 sing dollars?
              
              We give them a chance to earn so much money better than their own homeland. They should not bring their critising culture here and start to compare and make noises about us. This is the least they should do . RESPECT US !!!!

              <p>i have met one philippino maid who retired home with a huge land and a huge house after working in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should not be too sympathizing to these foreign workers when they return home to be landlords, rich people and envied by their poor countrymen. I think Singaporeans are too soft hearted.</p>
              <p>When i watch TV8 Sojourn Home serials, i can't stand these foreigners crying about having to leave their children while they come here to work, then see their big land, big house, rich assets and envious neighbours. What the heck, they are given a great chance to earn so much wealth for a short 10 years and they cried like as if they are forced to leave home to work in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Nobody forced them and they should be grateful they even got such a chance to earn so much money to be so rich back home.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans don't be dumb, wake up to their " mocking us, laughing at us " behind our back and smiling to their banks back home acting.</p>

To Lee Kuan Yew, Lim Chin Siong was probably his greatest adversary that he respected. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lim did what LKY could not do in the 1950s: mobilize tens of thousands ethnic Chinese just by his words. Lim Chin Siong, was not recognized but is one the founding members of the PAP. His very presence in our history shaped not only our independence</span></span></strong> but also how the concept of detention without trail (by ISD) and the affiliation of the labour union (eg: NTUC) to the PAP.<br><br></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/1600/LCS001.jpg"><span style="font-size: 18px;"><img style="border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px; float: right;" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3258/1229/320/LCS001.jpg" alt=""></span></a><span style="font-size: 18px;">Time and time again, I’ve mentioned that history is often written by victors, victors of a political dogfight and victors of unfair competition. The winners will get titles that remain across time encapsulating their distinguished successes but not their failures. The losers sometime suffer a fate worse than death, which is that their name being erased of annals. Simply, their lives and their accomplishments never existed.</span></span></div>

              <p>One very classic example how Foreign Talent mock us behind our back while earning money and fame in Singapore, this Taiwan host Chen Guo Cheng whose " Three dishes one soup" serial on TV used to be my favourite until during his third serial, his pro-taiwanese and mock Singaporeans ugly true face showed. Chen Guo Cheng started to invite many Taiwanese celebrities onto his show and he started to show his favour towards them by always letting them win to bring back the prize set.</p>
              <p>During the second last episode, Chen Guo Cheng mocked at Chef Daniel who voted for the Singaporean by saying on TV " why did you vote him? because he is a Singaporean?"and then start sniggering.  Chen Guo Cheng and his taiwanese co-host chef both voted for a old taiwanese singer who obviously can't cook.</p>
              <p>Only Chef Daniel stood on the side of the better cook Singaporean. How can Chen Guo Cheng insulted a Professional Singaporean Chef when he himself is biased towards the taiwanese singer?</p>
              <p> i am glad this serial is stopped immediately.  I salute the decision. Why do we let a taiwanese come here to openly insult Singaporeans on a TV show ? Chen Guo Cheng didn't show any least bit of respect towards us after he gained fame and a chance to travel while working in Singapore TV station.</p>

              <p>Lee Kuan Yew destroyed all the chinese schools because he feared the political threat of people trained in these schools and so imposed his beloved english education system on the entire island.</p>
              <p>All trained in english schools, standard of mandarin is like shit, then we are forced to import these people from PRC, Taiwan to come and host channel 8 shows and they secretly despise us for our garbage mandarin and singlish.</p>
              <p>Launch a thousand speak mandarin campaigns, but no effort to build up chinese schools because the babas in the PAP fear the political threat of the dialect chinese in this country.</p>

              <p>LKY has build for Singapore a good economy, this is a proven record but he has also mould Singapore this small country according to his ideologies, making us different.</p>
              <p>We should be proud of that and not let these FT come and mock us.  You have just reinforced the fact that FT are the intolerant and not understanding people, not Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>I have seen how Taiwan's host mock fun of other nationalities in the face on their TV programmes, they have the " i am superior" mentality in their own country. When they import this into Singapore, it doesn't make us feel good.</p>

              <p>i think Singaporeans should watch more China movies and serial,
              then we will realise China Nationals look down on their own people
              even worse than us.</p>
              <p>Beijing residents will always look down on those who flock to
              their capital to work and get married. Even a Beijing wife will
              always look down on her other province born husband. I saw this in
              a China movie. They do not spare any words to critise their own
              countrymen in their own country.</p>
              <p>As for the India nationals, their caste system is even more
              obvious.</p>
              <p>I don’t think we should feel that we are anti-foreigners when
              they are the ones who come to Singapore and bring their superiority
              culture here to look down on us.</p>
              <p>That’s why we are anti-foreigners. Singaporeans are definitely
              more tolerant and less status conscious than China and India
              nationals.</p>
              <p>Recently there is this Going Home show on 8 and you can see how
              much an Indonesian maid can bring home to build a big house, buy a
              truck for the husband to start a transport company in as short as 6
              years in Singapore. Another Bangala gardener in Singapore become a
              landlord of two shops and a landed house when he works here.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a big pot of Gold to these foreigners. They should
              at least respect our country and Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>China managers/executives earn 6-8k rmb which is only a mere
              1200 sing dollar after exchange. Their lower rank jobs earn 1200
              rmb. Why should they be proud towards Singaporeans when they are
              here to study and work with a good pay of 4000 – 10,000 sing
              dollars?</p>
              <p>We give them a chance to earn so much money better than their
              own homeland. They should not bring their critising culture here
              and start to compare and make noises about us. This is the least
              they should do . <span>RESPECT US</span> !!!!</p>
