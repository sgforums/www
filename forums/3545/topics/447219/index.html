              <p>Why is there so much dislike towards PAP? While I can understand the concerns of high housing prices, lack of supply of HDB, high COE prices, high cost of living, but the extent of the dislike is seriously beyond fathom.</p>
              <p>One thing bugging my mind is the recent issue of the low birth rate. Some people choose to blame our former prime minister with his policy then, "Stop at two" during 1970 to 1976. There is indeed a linkage to our current dilemma, however if you just take a step back, you can clearly see that the policy of "Stop at two" was necessary to the blooming economy back then. I don't think our government has some crystal ball to forsee the future(30 years later leh!)... but even if the government had forsee the current situation, the policy is still vital to control the birth rates, otherwise there will be a different Singapore today.</p>
              <p>I have noticed a great number of Singaporeans just bashing nonsensically. Can anyone justify their comments? I sincerely wish to know why.</p>
              <p>Maybe I would even place my vote in more capable hands in the next GE.</p>

              <p>Hey hey, before you get all touchy, you must know that cost of living also affect me ok. Salary not increasing as fast as its going out.</p>
              <p>Ok, maybe the bashing nonsensically was stretched too far, but I really don't understand why every thing can be linked to the faults of the government. Like blaming the jam on the PIE and also blaming for the high COE prices. I mean, what do they expect the government to do? Expand the roads into housing districts? And lead to higher housing prices?</p>

              <p>But with the arguement of passion and skills, if a junkie is passionate about changing Singapore, can you trust him more than a scholar with little passion? Ofcourse the combination of both would be nothing less than great.</p>

              <p>How is your life horrible just thanks to their immigrant policy?<br><br>As much as I believe in the potential of people, there is also the need for people to grow at their own pace. Which similars to the education system now. They can "upgrade" to a better school/stream if they seem to be late bloomers. But yes, I also see faults in the education system but the fundamentals still make sense to me.</p>
              <p>Haha no air to breathe in crowded train, that one the government also has its own limits. Ultimately SMRT is still a private company though Temasek Holdings has shares in it.</p>

              <p>Being poor is hoping you won't grow any taller or bigger because
                  you have no money to buy new clothes.</p>
              <p>Being poor is having hand down clothes.</p>

              <p>I also feel poor when you put it in that manner, haha. Though you will hate me for this, but our poor and other countries poor is a huge gap. Nevertheless, no one likes being poor, no matter how it is defined.</p>
              <p>I have to say that it is not schools who push newbie teachers to us, but MOE who decides on the distribution of teachers. I know several teachers who said that NIE has a strict interview when they evaluate potential teachers. How true is that, I leave it to you guys to decide.</p>

              <p>How is your life horrible just thanks to their immigrant
              policy?<br> <br> As much as I believe in the potential of people, there is also the
              need for people to grow at their own pace. Which similars to the
              education system now. They can "upgrade" to a better school/stream
              if they seem to be late bloomers. But yes, I also see faults in the
              education system but the fundamentals still make sense to me.</p>
              <p>Haha no air to breathe in crowded train, that one the government
              also has its own limits. Ultimately SMRT is still a private company
              though Temasek Holdings has shares in it.</p>

              <p>People who grew up poor like me will never have children unless
              we are rich, at least earning $5000 a month, have a house.</p>

              <p>Likewise. It's basic morals to want to provide your child with a comfortable household without sticky financial issues coming into play.</p>
              <p>So I never once blamed SG girls from being materialistic. I can only work harder if I want a good wife right. They don't drop from the sky or through lottery.</p>
