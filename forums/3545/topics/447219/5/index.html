              Is being out of touch really the  reason? Can a government be  governing for more than 5 decades and be out of touch? And yet contiune to be voted in?

              public transport fare adjustments</a> can be expected this year, said <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Lui+Tuck+Yew&amp;#38;ei=UTF-8&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;vm=r&amp;#38;cs=bz">Minister 
              for Transport Lui Tuck Yew</a>.</p>
              <p>Speaking in parliament on Wednesday, Lui announced that public transport 
              operators are currently facing higher costs -- especially on their bus 
              operations -- and hence, the government should not be in a rush to review this 
              year's fare adjustments.</p>
              <p>Lui added that the current fare formula is due for review this year and that 
              any fare adjustments that were not made this year will be taken into 
              consideration into next year's fare formula.</p>
              <p>With no changes to fare adjustments, the disabled and polytechnic students 
              will not get to enjoy any fare concessions.</p>
              <p>Although Lui expressed sympathy for these two groups of citizens, he 
              maintained that "not all of these requests [to implement fare concessions] can 
              be addressed immediately or entirely within a single fare revision 
              exercise".</p>
              <p>In addition, Lui also asked for patience from the Members of Parliament who 
              had advocated fare concessions for polytechnic students, before adding that the 
              <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Public+Transport+Council+Singapore&amp;#38;ei=UTF-8&amp;#38;fr=fp-today&amp;#38;vm=r&amp;#38;cs=bz">Public 
              Transport Council</a> (PTC), which is the body that regulates fares, is "acutely 
              aware" of the requests for concession and will co-operate with transport 
              operators to consider these requests.</p>
              <p><strong>Low-income earners at losing end</strong></p>
              <p>Singaporeans expressed concern with Lui's announcement, with many 
              anticipating fare adjustments in next year's formula.</p>
              <p>Others also noted that the static fares will no doubt affect low-income 
              families who are already struggling to make ends meet.</p>
              <p>Said Facebook user Ong Yongjie, who responded to <a href="https://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=Av8701HRnX1GJLiwLbWxLc0BV8d_;_ylu=X3oDMTFtNGZnMmFqBG1pdANCbG9nIFBvc3QgQm9keQRwb3MDNQRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nQm9keVRlbXBBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTMydGdnb2cxBGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDODMyODJmNzUtZDVhOC0zNTNhLWIwOWItOGYwZWRmMTUyYWFmBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdlBHRlc3QD;_ylv=0/SIG=1235k941u/EXP=1332404589/**https%3A//www.facebook.com/yahoosingaporenewsroom">Yahoo! 
              Singapore's wall post</a>, "Transport minister Lui Tuck Yew should get our 
              approval first… Did he even think about those low-income families [who have to 
              take] transport to work or school?"</p>
              <p>Another user, Celia Lim echoed Ong. She said: "Does the transport minister 
              know that there are many Singaporeans who are forced to reduce their weekly 
              visit of their old parents to once a month, or two months or even quarterly 
              [because of unyielding transport fares]?"</p>
              <p>"Mr Lui, you do not understand what it means to be an average income earner, 
              let alone a poor person, in today's Singapore. You and your colleagues have been 
              clouded by those digitised dreams of your own version of world class public 
              transport system!" Lim continued.</p>
              <p>However others like Facebook user Jon Ng noted that instead of complaining 
              that transport operators could use the proposed S$1.1 billion -- which was 
              announced in this year's Budget to <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/singapore-gov-t-tighten-foreign-worker-quota-081803198.html">improve 
              bus service levels</a> --  to reduce transport fares, Singaporeans should 
              instead take a more proactive approach.</p>
              <p>"With new trains, there will be increased operation expenses. The $1.1 
              billion doesn't include these costs — [but] just the purchase of hardware. For 
              those who harp on the amount… nothing would change unless you think, suggest and 
              really submit a proposal [to the government] instead."</p>

              <p>Said Facebook user Ong Yongjie, who responded to <a rel="nofollow" href="https://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=Av8701HRnX1GJLiwLbWxLc0BV8d_;_ylu=X3oDMTFtNGZnMmFqBG1pdANCbG9nIFBvc3QgQm9keQRwb3MDNQRzZWMDTWVkaWFCbG9nQm9keVRlbXBBc3NlbWJseQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTMydGdnb2cxBGludGwDc2cEbGFuZwNlbi1zZwRwc3RhaWQDODMyODJmNzUtZDVhOC0zNTNhLWIwOWItOGYwZWRmMTUyYWFmBHBzdGNhdANzaW5nYXBvcmUEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdlBHRlc3QD;_ylv=0/SIG=1235k941u/EXP=1332404589/**https%3A//www.facebook.com/yahoosingaporenewsroom">Yahoo! Singapore's wall post</a>, "Transport
                  minister Lui Tuck Yew should get our approval first… Did he even
                  think about those low-income families [who have to take] transport
                  to work or school?"</p>
              <p>Another user, Celia Lim echoed Ong. She said: "Does the
                  transport minister know that there are many Singaporeans who are
                  forced to reduce their weekly visit of their old parents to once a
                  month, or two months or even quarterly [because of unyielding
                  transport fares]?"</p>
              <p>"Mr Lui, you do not understand what it means to be an average
                  income earner, let alone a poor person, in today's Singapore. You
                  and your colleagues have been clouded by those digitised dreams of
                  your own version of world class public transport system!" Lim
                  continued.</p>
              <p>However others like Facebook user Jon Ng noted that instead of
                  complaining that transport operators could use the proposed S$1.1
                  billion -- which was announced in this year's Budget to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/singapore-gov-t-tighten-foreign-worker-quota-081803198.html">improve bus service levels</a> --  to reduce
                  transport fares, Singaporeans should instead take a more proactive
                  approach.</p>
              <p>"With new trains, there will be increased operation expenses.
                  The $1.1 billion doesn't include these costs — [but] just the
                  purchase of hardware. For those who harp on the amount… nothing
                  would change unless you think, suggest and really submit a proposal
                  [to the government] instead."</p>

              Out of touch intentionally lah.    Know too much or accept too much they have to come out with more money to help.    Heck care attitude suits them best to  ensure they are still on the right track to self serving.

              <p>I don't know why everybody complaining about PAP. You should look at Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Malaysia could have become an economic tiger. But sadly a lot of mismanagement by the BN gahmen. The BN now complain that budget deficit cause by high subsidies. But actual fact is the BN politicians running the country to the ground with all their mafia rackets extorting the country.</p>
              <p>The proton car is a national racket to profit all BN politicians and businessmen. The whole supply chain network is dominated by them. They deliberately tax high import duties on jap/continental/american cars to force msians to buy their crap proton/naza/perodua cars. Which in turn all the suppliers of spare parts benefit from this. Most msians cannot afford expensive import cars are forced to buy the shit proton car which is defective and have a lot of quality problems.</p>
              <p>Then there is land issue. A lot of state gahmen collude with BN politicians - sell them land dirt cheap price and then develop shopping malls and office blocks to make big margins.</p>
              <p>There is the rubbish OSA law that does not allow the citizens to vet the contracts made between gahmen and private contractors - so the gahmen continue to bleed the country dry.</p>
              <p>Also there is highway concessionaires. Many well connected BN politicians make money thru this racket. They go and build a stupid highway and then block all the small roads forcing residents to use their stupid highway and then charge toll to the residences.</p>
              <p>There is also well connected construction companies connected to BN - they all cheat the people one. They go and quote high high price and the gahmen accept this crap contracts. In the end they use cheap substandard materials to build bridges/stadiums/infrastructures/flyovers. Sometimes schools and stadiums collapse because of this substandard materials. Imagine the margins these bastards make ! Some more no tender ! No transparency ! So nobody knows the terms of these contracts.</p>
              <p>Always we hear these few stupid companies - gamudddaaa and MMMCCC always get the lucrative govt tenders.</p>
              <p>Then there is the blady media. They are so bias. All the newspapers - chinese/tamil/english/malay are owned by the gahmen. Everyday we hear them blast the opposition and only praise the gahmen. Whenever the opposition do good job we never hear only when they screw up the gahmen controlled newspapers post it on front page big big.</p>
              <p>Malaysia started out on same level playing field as South Korea. But look at South Korea today - can fight Japan with Samsung Hyundai and Daewoo.</p>
              <p>Malaysia got what? Petrol? Even that is running out.</p>
              <p>Then our education level is like shit. This year gahmen declared 10,000 students got straight As ! Wah sound very good. Only thing is that the gahmen made the exam so easy so that the majority people can pass. A lot of chinese so pissed with our education system that they migrate overseas for better education for their kids.</p>
              <p>So what is wrong with PAP? Yeah, theyare a bit ruthless but at least they did a GREAT JOB to put singapore where it is today.</p>
              <p>Then election was cancelled for municipal councils by BN in 1969. This has resulted in state gahmen choosing their own municipal reps. These reps continue to develop the country out of control. Until landslides kill 50 people in highland towers. Residents try to sue but gahmen made a new statute law to place municipal councils immune to prosecution. So these corrupted municipal councillars continue to sell land cheap and develop them and pocket $$$ into their own private pockets. The development going out of control until housing areas such as Puchong expand so big resulting in 2 hour jams.</p>
              <p>Public transportation is non existence. Last time got mini bus, srijaya and even a lot of chinese bus transport such as Toong Foong. But no no the gahmen want to control everything. Then they cancelled bus permits and awarded them to Mahathir co called Metrobus and one stupid company. So now the busses come around like once an hour ! Also some places got no bus at all. The stupid LRT only service certain places. KTM commutor always break down.</p>

              <p>Then our education level is like shit. This year gahmen declared 10,000 students got straight As ! Wah sound very good. Only thing is that the gahmen made the exam so easy so that the majority people can pass. A lot of chinese so pissed with our education system that they migrate overseas for better education for their kids.</p>
              <p>So what is wrong with PAP? Yeah, theyare a bit ruthless but at least they did a GREAT JOB to put singapore where it is today.</p>
              <p>Then election was cancelled for municipal councils by BN in 1969. This has resulted in state gahmen choosing their own municipal reps. These reps continue to develop the country out of control. Until landslides kill 50 people in highland towers. Residents try to sue but gahmen made a new statute law to place municipal councils immune to prosecution. So these corrupted municipal councillars continue to sell land cheap and develop them and pocket $$$ into their own private pockets. The development going out of control until housing areas such as Puchong expand so big resulting in 2 hour jams.</p>
              <p>Public transportation is non existence. Last time got mini bus, srijaya and even a lot of chinese bus transport such as Toong Foong. But no no the gahmen want to control everything. Then they cancelled bus permits and awarded them to Mahathir co called Metrobus and one stupid company. So now the busses come around like once an hour ! Also some places got no bus at all. The stupid LRT only service certain places. KTM commutor always break down.</p>

              <p>You should appreciate what you have. Sure PAP have caused you a bit of inconvenience such as expensive housing/inflation/high ministray salary. But had singapore still been part of malaysia - you be in much worse position.</p>

              <p>I don't know why everybody complaining about PAP. You should
              look at Malaysia.</p>
              <p>Malaysia could have become an economic tiger. But sadly a lot of
              mismanagement by the BN gahmen. The BN now complain that budget
              deficit cause by high subsidies. But actual fact is the BN
              politicians running the country to the ground with all their mafia
              rackets extorting the country.</p>
              <p>The proton car is a national racket to profit all BN politicians
              and businessmen. The whole supply chain network is dominated by
              them. They deliberately tax high import duties on
              jap/continental/american cars to force msians to buy their crap
              proton/naza/perodua cars. Which in turn all the suppliers of spare
              parts benefit from this. Most msians cannot afford expensive import
              cars are forced to buy the shit proton car which is defective and
              have a lot of quality problems.</p>
              <p>Then there is land issue. A lot of state gahmen collude with BN
              politicians - sell them land dirt cheap price and then develop
              shopping malls and office blocks to make big margins.</p>
              <p>There is the rubbish OSA law that does not allow the citizens to
              vet the contracts made between gahmen and private contractors - so
              the gahmen continue to bleed the country dry.</p>
              <p>Also there is highway concessionaires. Many well connected BN
              politicians make money thru this racket. They go and build a stupid
              highway and then block all the small roads forcing residents to use
              their stupid highway and then charge toll to the residences.</p>
              <p>There is also well connected construction companies connected to
              BN - they all cheat the people one. They go and quote high high
              price and the gahmen accept this crap contracts. In the end they
              use cheap substandard materials to build
              bridges/stadiums/infrastructures/flyovers. Sometimes schools and
              stadiums collapse because of this substandard materials. Imagine
              the margins these bastards make ! Some more no tender ! No
              transparency ! So nobody knows the terms of these contracts.</p>
              <p>Always we hear these few stupid companies - gamudddaaa and
              MMMCCC always get the lucrative govt tenders.</p>
              <p>Then there is the blady media. They are so bias. All the
              newspapers - chinese/tamil/english/malay are owned by the gahmen.
              Everyday we hear them blast the opposition and only praise the
              gahmen. Whenever the opposition do good job we never hear only when
              they screw up the gahmen controlled newspapers post it on front
              page big big.</p>
              <p>Malaysia started out on same level playing field as South Korea.
              But look at South Korea today - can fight Japan with Samsung
