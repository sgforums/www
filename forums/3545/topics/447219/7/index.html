              <p>But this is different much different. Compare Malaysia to Singapore which both countries are very similar is like compare your result to your twin brother who share the same parents. So why your twin brother is scoring better results than you when both of you are living in the same flat? When your room (malaysia) is three times bigger than his room (singapore) ?</p>

              <p>Of course you compare. You think SDP or any other opposition can do better job than PAP. If that is not comparison...what is that? Never learn...haiz</p>
              <p>The moment you post here you are complaining because you become part of the forum.</p>
              <p>I just don't understand you. You say PAP this and that...yet you vote them to gahmen. I just to get you man.</p>
              <p>I just saying that you should look at it as half cup full not half cup empty. They aren't exactly perfect but at least they did some fantastic job. I just cannot imagine had PAP not decided to come out fr federation and not taken Singapore out of backwater.</p>
              <p>You guys would be complaining about racial inequality and not enough federal $$$ pouring into singapore. Yeah - that is what is happening to malaysia. The federal gahmen is tightening federal money to Selangor Kelantan and Penang states because they belong to opposition. So just imagine you driving in streets littered with pot holes, traffic jams, too many motorbikes, clog drains, all the industrial estates going to Johor instead of singapore.</p>
              <p>So if not happy with PAP vote them out of gahmen.</p>

              <p>Yeah lor. Then vote for the party you want. But I don't understand why so much angst towards PAP. They haven;t done so bad after all right? At least singapore didn't end up as a backwater fishing island catching sotong. Now singapore is self reliant, can supply own water, priviledge to have one of the highest std of living in world.</p>
              <p>Look, nothing can be done about the high cost of living. Because of scarce space. Look at New York and London, they are compact place. Not surprising you will face shortage in housing and high cost. So what is there to complain? What you want? The gahmen is not god you know. You know they are the first to come out with HDB flat of which the Thatcher admin in UK copied LKY's concept. Then Malaysia started to copy singapore concept of HDB to provide cheap housing to the poor.</p>
              <p>It is like this. You have been using this soap powder from Lever Brothers for a very long time. Very reliable, have been with you thick and thin. When you have crisis, you spill ketchup on your shirt, you know you got lever brother soap powder to wash off stain. tHEN suddenly one day the world suffer shortage of soap powder and lever brothers forced to offer higher prices. Then lever brothers wanted to cut down cost and sell soap powder cheaper to consumers so they decided to retrench local singaporeans and replace them with foreign workers from bangla and PRC. This make the singaporeans unhappy.</p>
              <p>Then come Ah Kiasu economical soap powder. Suddenly Ah Kiasu say they can offer cheaper by 15% than lever brothers. They also boast they can employ local singaporeans can sustain this price. But Ah Kiasu soap powder is still new in the industry, industry watchers wonder whether they can sustain this price or not or keep to their promises.</p>
              <p>So yeah when you compare - better care care. You may think grass grenier on the other side.</p>

              <p>Yeah lor. Then vote for the party you want. But I don't understand why so much angst towards PAP. They haven;t done so bad after all right? At least singapore didn't end up as a backwater fishing island catching sotong. Now singapore is self reliant, can supply own water, priviledge to have one of the highest std of living in world.</p>
              <p>Look, nothing can be done about the high cost of living. Because of scarce space. Look at New York and London, they are compact place. Not surprising you will face shortage in housing and high cost. So what is there to complain? What you want? The gahmen is not god you know. You know they are the first to come out with HDB flat of which the Thatcher admin in UK copied LKY's concept. Then Malaysia started to copy singapore concept of HDB to provide cheap housing to the poor.</p>
              <p>It is like this. You have been using this soap powder from Lever Brothers for a very long time. Very reliable, have been with you thick and thin. When you have crisis, you spill ketchup on your shirt, you know you got lever brother soap powder to wash off stain. tHEN suddenly one day the world suffer shortage of soap powder and lever brothers forced to offer higher prices. Then lever brothers wanted to cut down cost and sell soap powder cheaper to consumers so they decided to retrench local singaporeans and replace them with foreign workers from bangla and PRC. This make the singaporeans unhappy.</p>
              <p>Then come Ah Kiasu economical soap powder. Suddenly Ah Kiasu say they can offer cheaper by 15% than lever brothers. They also boast they can employ local singaporeans can sustain this price. But Ah Kiasu soap powder is still new in the industry, industry watchers wonder whether they can sustain this price or not or keep to their promises.</p>
              <p>So yeah when you compare - better care care. You may think grass grenier on the other side.</p>

              <p>I think some people just want to challenge authority or follow
              westerner’s idea of democracy. I think pap’s way of “partial
              democracy” is best for the country and they’re definitely one of
              the best government in the world. Politicians from all over the
              world and people like Munger are full of praise for singapore’s
              systems and governing style. And <span>PAP</span> is
              excellent in finance. Tharman is extremely talented, even
              opposition mps have admitted that. I don’t think the opposition can
              do a better job and right now, the best party in Singapore is
              <span>PAP</span> by far.</p>

              <p>But this is different much different. Compare Malaysia to

                  your result to your twin brother who share the same parents. So why
                  your twin brother is scoring better results than you when both of
                  you are living in the same flat? When your room (malaysia) is three
