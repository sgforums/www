              <p>You sure? Yes Malaysian government ministers are not paid as
              well as singaporean ministers but they get a lot of kickbacks.
              Recently a female minister (women&amp;culture minister) had to step
              down because there was a scandal involving her husband who is the
              chairman of National Feedlot Co (A foundation set up to help malay
              farmers with loan and technical aid for breeding cows). The
              minister's husband was caught red-handed  $100 million loan
              for himself to buy shares in KLSE under his name.</p>
              <p>And then there is another minister whom I shall not
              name. There is a scandal involving him - he is said to have
              deliberately hiked up the price of two submarines bought
              from Spain to $ 2 billion dollars. I ask you - how can two
              submarines be worth $2 billion ???? Much of the money must
              have been pocketed somewhere.</p>
              <p>I heard from a friend who used to work as a director
              for a construction company that does roadworks in
              Trengannu that the Trengganu state government delibrately
              ask his company to build another highway parallel to an
              existing highway - just to make money. His company hike up the
              price and the excess is share between politicians in Trengganu and
              his company. The highway project is worth $100 million.

              <p>I am not even a PR holder. Why I want to go live in compact HDB flat when I can live in a big house with garden and land. I can also buy a car without any restriction. Food is cheap. Electricity is cheap.</p>

              <p>You really don't understand because you have never been to other countries where there is totally no system only 100% corruption like India.</p>
              <p>You complain complain complain but end of the day, PAP still win the GE. I don't know whether your mouth corresponse to your hands. Because i read so many complains about PAP but in the end PAP still win majority in GE. Is it that you complain here becuse nobody knows who you are but when you go to ballot box you are too afraid to vote for opposition because you afraid you will be targeted by PAP. Hah, no bravery at all. Only complain. No action.</p>

                  Read through the debate between you and other, seen to me that you are having double standard on you view point.
                  
                  1) You declared that you are not Singaporean/not even a PR, perhaps a Malaysian, which I take you word for this.
                  2) While you are slap other here that complain about PAP, you are also complaining Malaysia govt here.   Doing the samething.
                  3) You claim that PAP still having the support of the majority (60%) thus PAP are doing a good job.   Then same case in Malaysia, BN have the majority supporter of the voters in Malaysia, so why are you keep trying to indicate that they are no good.  See the double standard here.
                  4) Since you mention that you are not Singaporean, don't you think that it is not up to you to make this claim.  You had the mindset that Malaysia govt is no good, how you felt that a non-malaysian go over and over again to say that the Malaysia govt is the best in the world.
                  
                  Of course I am base on when you say that you are not a Singaporean and not even a PR here.
              
              Plus, you are not the only that travel to different countries before, alot of the younger singaporean had study/travel overseas before, which I see why the vote of PAP is dropping because they had manage tot start to see the problem with the PAP govt.
