              <p>Let me put it clear.</p>
              <p>- There is some displease with the current policy. But it is never to the extend, like libya now.</p>
              <p>- We must agree that things are not going well around the world in recent years. However, it is never as bad as US or europe.</p>
              <p>- There is a gap with the rich and poor. But, it is considered relatively narrow, compared to India and China.</p>
              <p>- Our goverment is xxx. But it is never as bad as Malaysia and Indonesia.</p>
              <p>- There is always some flaws with the policies. And adjustments have been made.</p>
              <p>- People put up their voices.They want to be heard. After all, this is our homeland. This is the place we live in and belong. We choose how we want to live. We just want to be happy.Â </p>
              <p>One thing that is unclear is, why our country is so small. And yet the salaries are so high for some1. If FTs are so good, we should also import politicians and paid them for half of the price! Seriously, SG is lacking of new leaders to take over the job.Â </p>

              <p>Because of.......the rich-poor gap.......rising cost of living.......expensive housing price.......lack of social mobility......etc and so on......</p>
              <p>That is why the ones who oppose PAP the most is the lower socio-economic class</p>
              <p>(according to LKY)</p>
              <p>The ones who support PAP the most is the upper middle class.</p>

Angry for being invisible and trivialized despite  so much unhappiness! Angry that their contented fellow Singaporeans who are unable to empathize with their predicament!

              <p>I can share some of my observation. A long time ago, we had a large number of conformist: people who would support anything that the government says. So even when the government arrests people arbitrary without trial or deny guys with long hair from entering the country, the people still supports them.</p>
              <p>Somewhere between the last 10 - 15 years, we have a lot of people converting into anti-conformist: people who would oppose anything that the government says. So even when the government policies are not very different from what the oppositions are proposing, the people still opposes them.</p>
              <p>In short: Same shit, different camp.</p>

              I beg to differ, these people clamoured to heard, and hopefully engaged intelliglibly, and not dumbed down.
                  In many ways, we as a nation is still immature, inheriting an adversarial style politics.
                  Everybody just want to better the lives of themselves and loved ones, and be happy. Some will hold the government to higher expectations than others! I don't believe any ranters can make a full time profession out of ranting. Ha!Ha!
