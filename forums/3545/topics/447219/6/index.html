              <p><br>I understand that PAP at times can be a bit "proud" and they tend not to listen to the citizens.</p>
              <p>But if you notice what you have achieved lately - it is utterly amazing. You are talking about a small island only 697 sq km. You have no mineral resources/lack water/no land for farming. Yet PAP has managed to make singaporeans a high skill society and attract a lot of foreign investors to set up HQ or Asia Pacific offices in singapore. Yet PAP has managed to provide housing in the form of HDB flats and is facing a lot of obstacles due to lack of available land. Yet PAP is able to raise the education level in singapore (many malaysians are sending their kids to singapore to study because they don't trust their own education system). Yet PAP is able to build recycling systems for singapore and help the island to sustain at least 40% of supply of their own water (relying less from malaysia).</p>
              <p>I mean - you guys have done a fantastic job considering the kind of obstacles you have to work with (lack of resources/hostile neigbhours/multiracial tension during the70s.</p>

              <p>You sure? Yes Malaysian government ministers are not paid as well as singaporean ministers but they get a lot of kickbacks. Recently a female minister (women&amp;culture minister) had to step down because there was a scandal involving her husband who is the chairman of National Feedlot Co (A foundation set up to help malay farmers with loan and technical aid for breeding cows). The minister's husband was caught red-handed  $100 million loan for himself to buy shares in KLSE under his name.</p>
              <p>And then there is another minister whom I shall not name. There is a scandal involving him - he is said to have deliberately hiked up the price of two submarines bought from Spain to $ 2 billion dollars. I ask you - how can two submarines be worth $2 billion ???? Much of the money must have been pocketed somewhere.</p>
              <p>I heard from a friend who used to work as a director for a construction company that does roadworks in Trengannu that the Trengganu state government delibrately ask his company to build another highway parallel to an existing highway - just to make money. His company hike up the price and the excess is share between politicians in Trengganu and his company. The highway project is worth $100 million.  </p>

              <p>And then there was a former Selangor minister who belong to the BN party. He was a vice president of UMNO. He was caught carrying $3million to Australia because he failed to declare to the Australian government.</p>
              <p>And another former Selangor minister from BN party was caught owning a giant mansion house worth $50mil when his salary was only $216k a year. How can he afford a $50mil mansion?</p>

              <p>Oh yes, perhaps you want to advise the Malaysia govt to be like PAP, treat the country as a business.      AS i said, don't compare, PAP is paying themselves the highest salary in the world their performance ought to be top class, above that of many other countries.    You still don't get it.    </p>
              <p>Besides I am a Singaporean I just take what you said about Malaysia as a pinch of salt.  As a Singaporean I am concerned about how the govt in my country treat us and the country.   </p>

                          mismanagement by the BN gahmen. The BN now complain that budget
                          deficit cause by high subsidies. But actual fact is the BN
                          politicians running the country to the ground with all their mafia
                          rackets extorting the country.</p>
              <p>The proton car is a national racket to profit all BN politicians
                          and businessmen. The whole supply chain network is dominated by
                          them. They deliberately tax high import duties on
                          jap/continental/american cars to force msians to buy their crap
                          proton/naza/perodua cars. Which in turn all the suppliers of spare
                          parts benefit from this. Most msians cannot afford expensive import
                          cars are forced to buy the shit proton car which is defective and
                          have a lot of quality problems.</p>
              <p>Then there is land issue. A lot of state gahmen collude with BN
                          politicians - sell them land dirt cheap price and then develop
                          shopping malls and office blocks to make big margins.</p>
              <p>There is the rubbish OSA law that does not allow the citizens to
                          vet the contracts made between gahmen and private contractors - so
                          the gahmen continue to bleed the country dry.</p>
              <p>Also there is highway concessionaires. Many well connected BN
                          politicians make money thru this racket. They go and build a stupid
                          highway and then block all the small roads forcing residents to use
                          their stupid highway and then charge toll to the residences.</p>
              <p>There is also well connected construction companies connected to
                          BN - they all cheat the people one. They go and quote high high
                          price and the gahmen accept this crap contracts. In the end they
                          use cheap substandard materials to build
                          bridges/stadiums/infrastructures/flyovers. Sometimes schools and
                          stadiums collapse because of this substandard materials. Imagine
                          the margins these bastards make ! Some more no tender ! No
                          transparency ! So nobody knows the terms of these contracts.</p>
              <p>Always we hear these few stupid companies - gamudddaaa and
                          MMMCCC always get the lucrative govt tenders.</p>
              <p>Then there is the blady media. They are so bias. All the
                          newspapers - chinese/tamil/english/malay are owned by the gahmen.
                          Everyday we hear them blast the opposition and only praise the
                          gahmen. Whenever the opposition do good job we never hear only when
                          they screw up the gahmen controlled newspapers post it on front
                          page big big.</p>
              <p>Malaysia started out on same level playing field as South Korea.
                          But look at South Korea today - can fight Japan with Samsung
                          Hyundai and Daewoo.</p>
              <p>Malaysia got what? Petrol? Even that is running out.</p>
              <p>Then our education level is like shit. This year gahmen declared
                          10,000 students got straight As ! Wah sound very good. Only thing
                          is that the gahmen made the exam so easy so that the majority
                          people can pass. A lot of chinese so pissed with our education
                          system that they migrate overseas for better education for their
                          kids.</p>
              <p>So what is wrong with PAP? Yeah, theyare a bit ruthless but at
                          least they did a GREAT JOB to put singapore where it is today.</p>
              <p>Then election was cancelled for municipal councils by BN in
                          1969. This has resulted in state gahmen choosing their own
                          municipal reps. These reps continue to develop the country out of
                          control. Until landslides kill 50 people in highland towers.
                          Residents try to sue but gahmen made a new statute law to place
                          municipal councils immune to prosecution. So these corrupted
                          municipal councillars continue to sell land cheap and develop them
                          and pocket $$$ into their own private pockets. The development
                          going out of control until housing areas such as Puchong expand so
                          big resulting in 2 hour jams.</p>
              <p>Public transportation is non existence. Last time got mini bus,
                          srijaya and even a lot of chinese bus transport such as Toong
                          Foong. But no no the gahmen want to control everything. Then they
                          cancelled bus permits and awarded them to Mahathir co called
                          Metrobus and one stupid company. So now the busses come around like
                          once an hour ! Also some places got no bus at all. The stupid LRT
                          only service certain places. KTM commutor always break down.</p>

              <p>But if you notice what you have achieved lately - it is utterly
              amazing. You are talking about a small island only 697 sq km. You
              have no mineral resources/lack water/no land for farming. Yet PAP
              has managed to make singaporeans a high skill society and attract a
              lot of foreign investors to set up HQ or Asia Pacific offices in
              singapore. Yet PAP has managed to provide housing in the form of
              HDB flats and is facing a lot of obstacles due to lack of available
              land. Yet PAP is able to raise the education level in singapore
              (many malaysians are sending their kids to singapore to study
              because they don't trust their own education system). Yet PAP is
              able to build recycling systems for singapore and help the island
              to sustain at least 40% of supply of their own water (relying less
              from malaysia).</p>
              <p>I mean - you guys have done a fantastic job considering the kind
              of obstacles you have to work with (lack of resources/hostile

              <p>PAP has goals for Singapore and to get there, has to go through a stage of "good" development that make everybody happy.</p>
              <p>Now we are past that stage, their goals only make suffering for us. We will not work till we drop, forgo our cars, pay for our houses into retirement, live in 980 square feet per family (4 room flat) and do NS while foreigners take our jobs and school places.</p>

              <p>Why not compare? I am not saying that you should vote PAP back to gahmen. Of course you can say no limit to comparison because you can compare singapore to somalia. But I compare malaysia to singapore because both countries got a lot of similarities. Moreover both countries used to be one country. Since LKY brought singapore out of the 1963 merger - it is good to know how singapore did since it branch out from malaysia. Also malaysia and singapore has 3 major race:indian malay chinese. Speak manglish and singlish.</p>
              <p>Isn't it logical to compare?</p>
              <p>Just think about it: what would you do had singapore still been part of malaysia? A good yardstick would be Penang because Penang is very similar to singapore. Today penang is also facing land shortage/rising cost of condos/crowding.</p>
              <p>I know PAP has conducted a lot of political abuse to maintain power. Their GE is very confusing. PAP got 70% of the votes yet got 95% of the seats. Their demarcation is very unfair.</p>
              <p>You can still choose an alternative gahmen. I am saying PAP is not good in terms of human rights/proud and too businesslike but they still do better than most gahmen in SEA region.</p>

              <p><br>Of course pay and pay - it is call the multiplier effect - you must keep the economy rolling. What you expect? You live in small island - this is how economy works. Yuor only resource is the high skill labour. The only thing your gahmen can do is to make you pay and pay.</p>
              <p>You expect singapore to subsidise you on food/fuel/education? You not live in vast country like Soviet Union. You don't have coal/oil/plantation/farmland/minerals.</p>
              <p>If you want gahmen is be populist then imagine Cuba but at worst scale. Drive 1960s car - if you lucky to afford one/ always power outage/ traffic jam/ amenities breaking down/wait long queues to hospital &amp; public services.</p>
              <p>You can only live in cheap and low cost society if you are like venezuela - rich in oil and big country. But even that is hard because Hugo Chavez is causing venezuela to be inefficient - long lines to supermarket &amp; food and other supplies run out fast.</p>
              <p>Hey me not supporting PAP. But me wondering why so much angst towards PAP. If not happy then vote them out. Why so many complain yet PAP is in power?</p>

              <p>PAP has goals for Singapore and to get there, has to go through a stage of "good" development that make everybody happy.</p>
              <p>Now we are past that stage, their goals only make suffering for us. We will not work till we drop, forgo our cars, pay for our houses into retirement, live in 980 square feet per family (4 room flat) and do NS while foreigners take our jobs and school places.</p>

              <p><br>I say PAP has outlived its usefulness. Last time they lead you out of economical doldrums and crisis after separation from malaysia.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should now be seeking more say and be heard by gahmen. Singapore should seek more suffrage and human rights.</p>
              <p>Cannot do much for cost of living. Because inevitably this is out of the gahmen control. You see the oil price rising because of mid east turmoil. Oil price rise cause everything else to rise. Also land in singapore is scarce. Can;t do anything about housing unless plan to be house underwater like seaworld. Even I go to foreign country like Taiwan &amp; australia &amp; new zealand - i can see cost of living rising surely this would impact singapore.</p>
              <p>Only thing to do is to control immigration. I dislike PRC people. I don't know why you all encourage them to migrate. Mei you li mao. One day i was talking to a few friends outside a shop own by a PRC guy - he dont like us blocking his biz so he took out his broom and try to sweep us away. Really rude people. I dont understnad why PAP want this kind of people living in your country.</p>

              bit of inconvenience such as expensive housing/inflation/high
