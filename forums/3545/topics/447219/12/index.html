              <p>wow, what an interesting debate. i feel compelled to give my two cents worth! ok, i came from a lower income family, but studied damn hard to get into a good course in university. so now, i would consider myself upper middle income (going by the statistics in MOM which you can't really believe becuase the truely rich pple do not have income, only dividends from their many many companies).</p>
              <p>But anyway, my stand upfront is that i don't think the PAP did a bad job in bringing SG to where it is.i hate how stressful, crowded and overrun with foreigners sg is becoming but i see it happening in almost every city (sydney also overrun with foreigners like sgoreans) jsut tt these pple have a choice of moving to the countryside, which SGoreans will never have. so i dunno what is the alternative for sg - try a different route from other countries and risk going downhill? no more pradas, chanels, comfy taxi rides, concerts from pop stars and world class hotel and famous restarurants. that is the upside of living in a city like sg. and htat is what i feel my generation (besides me coz i am very heartland still coz of my family background) craves - both from people who i think are able to afford it, and those whom i think are not able to afford it.</p>
              <p>from my feel of things, people like me (who managed to move from lower income to upper middle income are ok with the PAP. those who vote against, generally are voting becuase they want a true democracy or are unhappy with the style of politics). genearlly, i find that for those people who experience a drop in life style (i.e. from living in condo with parents to now having to apply for a very small hdb flat) are very unhappy with the PAP. among the circle of friends who are the most angsty are those who grew up living in a condo / landed house / bigger hdb flats / have a car / family brought them overseas, but now they are not able to afford the same lifestyle for themselves <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>without saving</strong></span> up for it. i stress that becuase i realise a lot of young people do not save. I also have very rich pple who grew up in rich familes who are very unhappyw ith the PAP. why? they say that there are poor people in singapore and they are unhappy that the PAP is not doing more for these people. But for the record, these rich people are not going to help the poor people, they want the govt to do it. besides, they often compalin about taxes and would not hesitate to move their father's buisness overseas to reduce taxes payable.</p>
              <p>i know that people out htere think that the uber rich and upper middle income are very FOR PAP. but i just wish to correct this perception imho. from what i see,. those who were born rich are not. they have different ways of looking at the world in which they want other people to look after the poor. just not them.</p>

              <p>Cannot tell already la.   So many know about it they go then now the govt going to renovate the food centre and after which food cost will go up again.   Govt claimed not enough seats wor so want to renovate, crappy lame excuse.   Govt just renovated this food centre not long ago.</p>
              <p>FYI, even it is only $1.50 but the standard is not consistent.   Oily and sometimes tastes too much of sauce.</p>

              <p>wow, what an interesting debate. i feel compelled to give my two
              cents worth! ok, i came from a lower income family, but studied
              damn hard to get into a good course in university. so now, i would
              consider myself upper middle income (going by the statistics in MOM
              which you can't really believe becuase the truely rich pple do not
              have income, only dividends from their many many companies).</p>
              <p>But anyway, my stand upfront is that i don't think the PAP did a
              bad job in bringing SG to where it is.i hate how stressful, crowded
              and overrun with foreigners sg is becoming but i see it happening
              in almost every city (sydney also overrun with foreigners like
              sgoreans) jsut tt these pple have a choice of moving to the
              countryside, which SGoreans will never have. so i dunno what is the
              alternative for sg - try a different route from other countries and
              risk going downhill? no more pradas, chanels, comfy taxi rides,
              concerts from pop stars and world class hotel and famous
              restarurants. that is the upside of living in a city like sg. and
              htat is what i feel my generation (besides me coz i am very
              heartland still coz of my family background) craves - both from
              people who i think are able to afford it, and those whom i think
              are not able to afford it.</p>
              <p>from my feel of things, people like me (who managed to move from
              lower income to upper middle income are ok with the PAP. those who
              vote against, generally are voting becuase they want a true
              democracy or are unhappy with the style of politics). genearlly, i
              find that for those people who experience a drop in life style
              (i.e. from living in condo with parents to now having to apply for
              a very small hdb flat) are very unhappy with the PAP. among the
              circle of friends who are the most angsty are those who grew up
              living in a condo / landed house / bigger hdb flats / have a car /
              family brought them overseas, but now they are not able to afford
              the same lifestyle for themselves <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>without
              saving</strong></span> up for it. i stress that becuase i realise a
              lot of young people do not save. I also have very rich pple who
              grew up in rich familes who are very unhappyw ith the PAP. why?
              they say that there are poor people in singapore and they are
              unhappy that the PAP is not doing more for these people. But for
              the record, these rich people are not going to help the poor
              people, they want the govt to do it. besides, they often compalin
              about taxes and would not hesitate to move their father's buisness
              overseas to reduce taxes payable.</p>
              <p>i know that people out htere think that the uber rich and upper
              middle income are very FOR PAP. but i just wish to correct this
              perception imho. from what i see,. those who were born rich are
              not. they have different ways of looking at the world in which they
              want other people to look after the poor. just not them.</p>
