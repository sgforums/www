              <p>You are crying over spilled milk. Complain Complain Complain but still under PAP. You say you hate PAP but you still so coward when you go to ballot box and hand start to shake. Your brain start to swell with sleepless wimsomnea - afraid that PAP would cancel your application for HDB - that you cross for PAP.</p>
              <p>If the one who is sucking up for PAP - its you. But you are worst because you not only suck up to PAP you also pretend to speak out against PAP though your heart belong to PAP.</p>

              <p><br>Read through the debate between you and other, seen to me that you are having double standard on you view point. 1) You declared that you are not Singaporean/not even a PR, perhaps a Malaysian, which I take you word for this. 2) While you are slap other here that complain about PAP, you are also complaining Malaysia govt here. Doing the samething. 3) You claim that PAP still having the support of the majority (60%) thus PAP are doing a good job. Then same case in Malaysia, BN have the majority supporter of the voters in Malaysia, so why are you keep trying to indicate that they are no good. See the double standard here. 4) Since you mention that you are not Singaporean, don't you think that it is not up to you to make this claim. You had the mindset that Malaysia govt is no good, how you felt that a non-malaysian go over and over again to say that the Malaysia govt is the best in the world. Of course I am base on when you say that you are not a Singaporean and not even a PR here. Plus, you are not the only that travel to different countries before, alot of the younger singaporean had study/travel overseas before, which I see why the vote of PAP is dropping because they had manage tot start to see the problem with the PAP govt.</p>

              <p>Hey you not read my post properly. Don't be lazybunny and open your eyes big big. I never say Malaysia gahmen is good. Why BN always win the election? Get your facts right. Because they cheat in the election. There is a lot of case whereby the ballot boxes get lost on the way to the counting center. Then the gahmen use a lot of postal votes which is made of fake votes. Some constituencies got a lot of dubious citizens - records of people long dead (still registered voters). Then BN like to redraw lines. If they see an opposition stronghold for chinese - they purposely redraw the borders and include next door constituency with more malays to balance the votes. Then there are some areas with only 10,000 malays consider one parliamentary vote compared to a city area with 100,000 chinese voters bunch up as one parliament area.</p>
              <p>Vote for PAP dropping but yet PAP still in power. Of course they do a better job. You just look at MAlaysia - crime rate is going up.</p>

              <p>I am saying it in your context. Kapeesh?</p>
              <p>I never said the reason for Singapore winning the election was because they did a good job. I only said that you people like to complain but you have not looked at the good job they did.</p>
              <p>You must be out of your mind to compare singapore police to malaysian police. Malaysian police kill people during interogation. I have a friend who know a friend that used to work for the opposition state government, he was asked to attend a questioning. The next thing we all hear was that he fell 11 floors down. Then a royal commission hearing was made and concluded that he committed suicide?</p>
              <p>His family was angry over this incident because he would never kill himself knowing that his girlfriend was pregnant with his child and he was about to make preparations for marriage. The people suspect the police threatened him to make false statements against his superiors (opposition leaders) or else they would hang him by the window, holding his belt.</p>
              <p>I suppose you speak for yourself in terms of your blindness too. If you ask many malaysians, on average almost every one comes across a traffic policeman who would stop them at the traffic for minor offences and ask them for bribe.</p>
              <p>Honest mistake? One MRT breakdown and every singaporean is asking for heads to roll. You know how many times a stupid malaysian KTM train breakdown? Almost once a week.</p>
              <p>I am comparing msia to singapore because both countries have many similarities in terms of culture, race and economy. Read again. You always don't get my facts right. You never read from the start. You always complain complain and complain.</p>
              <p>I am comparing apple to apple. If else, you mind as well tell me to compare malaysia to sudan. Then there would be no end to this ! Understand? Kapeesh?</p>

                          <p>I am saying it in your context. Kapeesh?</p>
                          <p>I never said the reason for Singapore winning the election was
                          because they did a good job. I only said that you people like to
                          complain but you have not looked at the good job they did.</p>
                          <p>You must be out of your mind to compare singapore police to
                          malaysian police. Malaysian police kill people during interogation.
                          I have a friend who know a friend that used to work for the
                          opposition state government, he was asked to attend a questioning.
                          The next thing we all hear was that he fell 11 floors down. Then a
                          royal commission hearing was made and concluded that he committed
                          suicide?</p>
                          <p>His family was angry over this incident because he would never
                          kill himself knowing that his girlfriend was pregnant with his
                          child and he was about to make preparations for marriage. The
                          people suspect the police threatened him to make false statements
                          against his superiors (opposition leaders) or else they would hang
                          him by the window, holding his belt.</p>
                          <p>I suppose you speak for yourself in terms of your blindness too.
                          If you ask many malaysians, on average almost every one comes
                          across a traffic policeman who would stop them at the traffic for
                          minor offences and ask them for bribe.</p>
                          <p>Honest mistake? One MRT breakdown and every singaporean is
                          asking for heads to roll. You know how many times a stupid
                          malaysian KTM train breakdown? Almost once a week.</p>
                          <p>I am comparing msia to singapore because both countries have
                          many similarities in terms of culture, race and economy. Read
                          again. You always don't get my facts right. You never read from the
                          start. You always complain complain and complain.</p>
                          <p>I am comparing apple to apple. If else, you mind as well tell me
                          to compare malaysia to sudan. Then there would be no end to this !
                          Understand? Kapeesh?</p>

                       <p>   You always complain complain and complain abt the Malaysia govt, that is what you had been doing at the start of your post.</p><p>
              </p><p>  In the end you malaysian still vote for them.  See the similar here.  So base on your logic, all you malaysian shld not complaining against your Malaysian police action, because you guys here vote for the govt. </p><p>
                      
                      
                      
                      
              </p><p>         Plus when i mention abt the Honest Mistake, I am talking abt the escape of a Terroist in a suppose high secure prision, best thing is that he can manage to escape out of SG. </p><p>
                      
                      
              </p><p>        Of cos unless it is ok for you malaysian to complain against your govt and it is not ok for Singaporean to complain against ours. </p><p>
              
              </p><p> Plus the best part that I like your post is regarding " I have a friend who know a friend", couple of the opp supporter in SG is using the samething. </p><p>
