              <p>TIME and energy were wasted on Wednesday, all in the name of a new media marketing campaign for a shaver.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday night, Philips Electronics Singapore apologised
                   for alarming the public with its guerilla advertising campaign 
                  featuring a video of a 'bear' along Ulu Pandan Road.</p>
              <p>The police told The Straits Times that it is now 
                  investigating if what happened was an offence of public nuisance under 
                  Section 268 of the Penal Code, which can lead to a fine of up to $1,000.</p>
              <p>In a statement, Philips said the 'bear' was actually a 
                  mascot deployed as part of a guerilla marketing campaign undertaken by 
                  social media agency, The Secret Little Agency, to launch a new shaver.</p>
              <p>'We had anticipated the attention that the bear would draw 
                  but had no intention to cause any alarm. We would like to apologise for 
                  any concern caused,' it said.</p>
              <p>It is understood that the agency had not alerted any of the 
                  authorities about the 'bear' before the campaign, though it did inquire 
                  if a permit was needed to wear an 'animal mascot outfit'.</p>

              <p>************************</p>
              <p>I suggest firing all the heads of marketing at Philips.</p>
              <p>This stunt would have been funny.... if it hadn't wasted the time and resources of the police, ACRES, and the Singapore Zoo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>What makes it more inexcusable is that the SingPost vandal saga should have taught everyone the value of responsible marketing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : Worried 
              residents, searches by animal interest and wildlife groups, even police 
              officers having to cordon off the area - all because of a purported 
              "bear" sighting along Ulu Pandan Road which has turned out to be a 
              publicity stunt by a company to market shavers.<br><br>The blurry video 
              clip of a purported "bear" rummaging through a dustbin at a bus stop had
               been making the rounds on the Internet. It was also reported on 
              television and in newspapers such as Lianhe Wanbao, Shin Min Daily and 
              The New Paper.<br><br>In a statement on Wednesday, through public 
              relations agency Fleishman-Hillard, Philips Electronics Singapore 
              clarified that the bear was a mascot for a guerilla marketing campaign 
              for a shaver undertaken by social media agency, The Secret Little 
              Agency.<br><br>"We acknowledge that the resemblance of the mascot to a 
              live bear has caused some public concern in the neighbourhood where the 
              mascot was sighted. We had anticipated the attention that the bear will 
              draw but have no intention to cause any alarm. We would like to 
              apologise for any concern caused," the electronics giant said.<br><br>But
               the police, as well as tens of men and women from Animal Concerns 
              Research and Education Society (Acres) and Wildlife Reserves Singapore 
              who scoured the area for hours on Wednesday, were not amused.<br><br>On 
              Wednesday night, a police spokesman said: "In response to media queries 
              on the sighting of a 'bear' in Ulu Pandan, Police confirm that we're 
              investigating an offence of Public Nuisance under Section 268 of the 
              Penal Code."<br><br>On Monday, the video clip was sent to several news 
              outlets by a person claiming to be a civil engineer named "Wilson Tay", 
              who claimed his teenaged son shot the clip while he was driving on the 
              road.<br><br>TODAY newspaper decided against running the story on 
              Wednesday until proper checks could be done, including finding out the 
              full particulars of the so called witness and having this reporter meet 
              him face-to-face to ascertain the authenticity of the "bear sighting" 
              claims he had made online.<br><br>This reporter had sent an email to the
               informant, asking him to call her – which he did. But when this 
              reporter then tried to contact Mr Tay on the mobile number he provided, 
              the person who answered denied he was Mr Tay and said she was not the 
              first one to call that number looking for the informant.<br><br>When contacted, The Secret Little Agency said the aim was to get the public to blog and talk about the sighting on social media.<br><br>Creative
               partner Nicholas Ye said they called up to enquire with the Police if a
               licence was needed on Sunday before heading down to film the video on 
              Monday at about 2am.<br><br>"This is irresponsible and it is a waste of 
              resources ... publicity by all means, but this has gone way too far," 
              said Acres founder and executive director Louis Ng, whose group also 
              conducted an hour long search on Tuesday.<br><br>Singaporeans whom MediaCorp spoke to had mixed reactions to the news.<br><br>"It
               is hilarious that this bear mascot got on the news ... but imagine the 
              stress and work they have caused the police and zoo over this silly 
              mistaken identity," said a nurse Lee Xiu Hua, 24.<br><br>The latest 
              publicity gimmick brings to mind SingPost’s postbox graffiti stunt in 
              January this year - the last time resources were invested when SingPost 
              employed an agency to spray graffiti on its postboxes in the lead-up to 
              the Youth Olympic Games.<br><br>Members of the public were startled when
               they spotted a vandal at work, and called the police. The police said 
              then that they would take up the matter with SingPost.<br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/il</span></span></p>

              <p>Creative marketing is fine, but those marketing idiots should have at least sat down and thought about the possible repercussions. It's obvious that they didn't do so, or they were otherwise too stupid to realize what the consequences could be.</p>
              <p>It does not require a degree in marketing to figure out that faking a bear sighting in a residential area can actually lead to public distress and provoke a reaction from the authorities. Which makes me wonder where they all got their degrees from.</p>
              <p>At least in the SingPost saga, in the worst case scenario the 'vandal' would have been tackled, handcuffed, and made to spend the night in a police lockup. No one would have to die - just that the vandal would have an unpleasant experience.</p>
              <p>Philips and the ad agency here went much further - that bugger in the bear suit could have been shot with tranquilizer darts or 9mm rounds. Are they willing to take the rap for that should it happen?</p>
