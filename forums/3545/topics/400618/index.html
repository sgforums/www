              <h1 class="storyheadline">Ambassador replies to MM's remarks about Costa Rica</h1>
              <p>I THANK Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew for his reference to the abolition
               of the army in Costa Rica in last Friday's report ( 'MM Lee: US base in
               Japan boosts stability').</p>
              <p>MM Lee was reported to have stated that the Nobel Peace 
              Prize was awarded to the President of Costa Rica for disbanding the 
              army, but this is not accurate.</p>
              <p>The army was dissolved on Dec 1, 1948 by the then President 
              Jose Figueres as 'a precaution against the militarism that has undercut 
              or perennially thwarted democracy in Central America'.</p>
              <p>The move also allowed for the allocation of more resources 
              to education and health, indicators that Costa Rica stands for today on 
              the world stage.</p>
              <p>The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize was President Oscar 
              Arias Sanchez, who ruled Costa Rica from 1986 to 1990 and from 2006 to 
              2010.</p>
              <p>He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts
               to achieve peace in Central America, which was then involved in armed 
              conflicts and instability.</p>
              <p>On May 8, President Arias relinquished his office to Ms 
              Laura Chinchilla, who is Costa Rica's first woman President.</p>
              <p>I also respectfully disagree with MM Lee's remark that our 
              leaders did not have to worry about neighbouring countries attacking 
              Costa Rica because we had no wealth to talk about.</p>
              <p>We have great wealth, it is everywhere, and Costa Ricans 
              have been looking after it for the past 40 years. Our wealth is green, 
              represented by 4.5 per cent of the biodiversity known to date; all in a 
              territory which constitutes only 0.03 per cent of the world.</p>

              <p>FOR veteran American journalist Tom Plate, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew is "the director of the blockbuster that is Singapore".</p>
              <p>Mr Plate gives his take on "this iconic and fashionably authoritarian director" in his new book, Conversations With Lee Kuan Yew - Citizen Singapore: How To Build A Nation.</p>

              The 211-page book is based mainly on a four-hour exclusive interview that took place over two days last July.</p>
              <p>As the approach to writing the book was based on a dialogue, the interview subject had to be interesting for there to be content, explained Mr Plate, who is well-known for his syndicated columns about Asia in the Los Angeles Times.</p>
              <p>"Now, is LKY interesting? No problem. He's the easiest (person to interview) in the history of the world," Mr Plate, 66, told my paper yesterday. "You don't need small talk, you don't have to butter him up, you don't have to bring flowers and perfume and (things) like that. You go in and boom, let's go."</p>
              <p>Mr Plate, who has interviewed Mr Lee on more than three occasions between the 1990s and now, is said to be the only American journalist that Mr Lee has granted so much interview time to.</p>
              <p>While he has written a number of weighty articles quoting Mr Lee's views on policy and issues at large, Mr Plate wanted to write an accessible book "that would potentially appeal to a reader of Time and Newsweek, or The Economist or Financial Times, whether they be Singaporean or not".</p>
              <p>The book is written in Mr Plate's trademark humorous, witty and candid style.</p>
              <p>"You (the reader) get to be the fly on the wall and, in the course of this conversation, you trace through a lot of his thinking," he said.</p>
              <p>The conversations in the book cover a wide range of topics. There are serious discussions on philosophy, international relations and governance.</p>
              <p>But a more personal side of the MM is revealed towards the end, when the men touch on more intimate issues: age, Mr Lee's wife, his son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and his daughter, Dr Lee Wei Ling, director of the National Neuroscience Institute.</p>
              <p>During a break, author and interviewee even banter about what Mr Lee would do if he were to take on the post of United Nations secretary-general.</p>
              <p>"I try to get a bit more of (Mr Lee) as a man, as well as a brainiac and as a leader," said Mr Plate, who also described the politician as warm, trusting and open.</p>
              <p>When asked what he uncovered about Mr Lee this time, Mr Plate said: "Because I've had more time with him, I began to see him in a slightly different light. So, I felt more educated. Not that there were departures in his views - he's very consistent - but I began to understand certain nuances and subtleties."</p>
              <p>Conversations With Lee Kuan Yew is the first book in a series called Giants Of Asia, which will subsequently feature Malaysia's former <span id="adv_hiliteText" class="adv_class" style="border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-color: #0066cc; cursor: pointer;">pr</span>ime minister, Tun Dr Mahathir Moham<span id="adv_hiliteText">ad</span>, and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki Moon.</p>

Chancellor Allan Hawke and Vice Chancellor Ian Chubb of the Australian National University (ANU) are the latest to join the Australian movers and shakers who laud distasteful people - in their case, former Singaporean prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, who now holds an ANU honorary doctorate.<br><br>That the ANU could impugn its reputation for excellence in Asian studies and human rights law to further the ambitions of its top two officers is surprising enough. That these men should ram through the award by shelving university processes of review and then praise Lee's "integrity," "commitment to advancing the causes of peace and prosperity" and "international statesmanship [sic]" is downright contemptible. But credit where credit's due: Lee would applaud their methods.<br><br>Hawke and Chubb, no doubt, will be unmoved to hear of Lee's most recent slur against a head of state - hardly proper protocol, one might think, for the recipient of a gong for statesmanship. Nonetheless, on April 4, Lee trotted out an attack on President Chen Shui-bian, saying that he was duping Taiwanese into believing that independence from China is possible because war would result and the US would not intervene.<br><br>The problem with this salvo was that it wasn't just personal; it was a bouquet to China and a put-down directed at millions of Taiwanese people who believe in democracy and liberty. So a personal attack on Lee for his cardigan despotism and hubris is perfectly in order - because so much of Singapore and its neuroses are linked to Lee's person.<br><br>Lee's record on human rights is poor. He, like other autocrats in the region, demeans his people by labeling liberties of press and academic freedom as Western conceits that are not conducive to "Asian" societies. This mentality - culturalist bordering on racist - set up one of the more enduring intellectual hoaxes of the 1990s, namely that there exist "Asian values" (as opposed to Western or Judeo-Christian values, presumably, though his argument was never coherent). And these values, funnily enough, seem to absolve people such as Lee for oppressive behavior - as long as an economic return is delivered.<br><br>Lee's legacy of authoritarianism lives on. This week saw the banning of a<a style="color: #ff9900; text-decoration: none;" href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2022589417781119779&amp;hl=en-GB">documentary about a long-time political prisoner in Singapore, Said Zahari</a>. Suffice it to say that Singapore's credibility is shaky if it can't face up to events of 30 years ago and cites social order as a pretext for shutting down debate.<br><br>And if it wasn't clear before, it should be now: With the latest pay rise that lawmakers have awarded themselves (justification: lavishing millions of dollars on the "most talented" legislators and executive officials beats corruption), the Singaporean state can now be dubbed the world's most lucrative - and sanitized - protection racket. Lee, who these days goes under the risible title of "minister mentor," will himself pocket another small fortune. But even by Singaporean standards, this self-aggrandizement is so brazen that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has promised to donate his new riches to charity.<br><br>Lee Kuan Yew, his son and their supporters can keep their city-state <a style="color: #ff9900; text-decoration: none;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleptocracy">kleptocracy </a>and their largely pliant people. And long may he be courted by foreign academic powerbrokers and governments dazzled by his connections.<br><br>But Lee Kuan Yew is no friend of Taiwan. Until Singapore learns to deal with domestic political opponents other than by intimidating, bankrupting, arresting and torturing them, there is little to learn from Lee's <a style="color: #ff9900; text-decoration: none;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fief">fiefdom</a> or his lectures. Taiwan has seen it all before - and left it behind.</div>

              <p>I think this Lee Kuan Yew should shut his fucking mouth and stop disgracing himself and Singapore in front of others. Scared of being exposed as a political fraud also, this Lee Kuan Yew. </p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew, you betrayed Britain to Japanese, why not give a talk on that?</p>
              <p>Don't keep on shamelessly praise yourself. Fucking traitor of Singapore.</p>

              <div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6em;">I write this blog posting only to highlight 3 significant facts:<br><br>
              <div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #6600cc;">1. Not that his signatures are on these old notes, but the fact that he is one of the very small number of PAp Ministers whose salaries were still at NORMALLY ACCEPTABLE LEVEL.</span> The current ministers of famiLEE LEEgime are drawing some <span style="color: #ff0000;">20X</span> or more salaries than when late Mr. Goh was DPM &amp; Defense Minister. <span style="color: #6600cc;">This is the most significant thing we must remember</span>.<br></div>
              <br><br><a style="color: #99aadd; text-decoration: none;" href="http://mrbanknotes.com/images/singapore/Orchid%20%241%20-%20Sign%20Goh%20Keng%20Swee%20.gif"><img style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 287px; height: 306px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #222222;" src="http://mrbanknotes.com/images/singapore/Orchid%20%241%20-%20Sign%20Goh%20Keng%20Swee%20.gif" border="0" alt=""></a><br>
              <div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.6em; text-align: justify;">2. He is one of the very small numbers of PAp ministers who <span style="font-weight: bold; color: #6600cc;">humbly contributed to crucial and appreciated changes Singapore had been through</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Most of the famiLEE LEEgime ministers are arrogant and made changes unnecessary; unacceptable; unappreciated to Singapore and helped themselves more than our peasants</span>. This is another significant fact that Singaporeans must remember of late Mr. Goh.<br></div>
              <br><a style="color: #99aadd; text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/wdu/07Jul07/20070709.083107_gks_mexicans.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 350px; height: 175px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #222222;" src="http://www.asiaone.com/A1MEDIA/wdu/07Jul07/20070709.083107_gks_mexicans.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br>

Yet another significant fact that Singaporeans need to recognize of late Mr. Goh is that <span style="color: #ff0000;">he contributed his part and then in due time HE LEFT</span>, he did not become any SM MM AM PM ZM what not. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He did not installed his son his family members into Temasek GIC, he did not want to rise and rule Singapore from death</span>, otherwise LKy should be very worried about him.<br></div>

Today many of our citizens feels like 2nd class citizens here, and felt betrayed and neglected. I ask you to please watch over well-being of our Singaporeans from the better place where you are. Thank You Mr. Goh.</span></div>
