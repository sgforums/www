              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              ex-president of the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) and former
               MP Choo Wee Khiang has been charged in court with corruption.<br><br>The
               Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) said from 2005 to 2007, 
              it received several anonymous complaints against Choo, alleging that he 
              had charged his personal airfares, expenses, phone bills to the 
              Association and received gifts from Chinese coaches and players. <br><br>Choo was the STTA at the time of the alleged offences.<br><br>Acting
               on the information received, the Bureau conducted an investigation 
              which revealed that in 2005, Choo had received S$1,500 from Liu Zhongze,
               who was then a national team player, and Luo Jie, who was then an 
              assistant coach of the STTA, in return for giving Liu more opportunities
               to represent the Association in table tennis tournaments. <br><br>Investigation
               also revealed that between 2003 and 2004, Choo had received a total of 
              US$600 on two separate occasions from Shi Mei Sheng, who was then a STTA
               coach, as a reward to Choo for approving the use of two different 
              training facilities in China. <br><br>Besides Choo, the former High Performance Manager of STTA Koh Li Ping was also charged on Thursday morning.<br><br>The
               Bureau said between 2002 and 2003, Luo Jie, whose work pass only 
              permitted him to work for STTA, provided table tennis training to 
              students for a local secondary school. <br><br>But the school was unable to pay him for the training provided, which amounted to S$8,400. <br><br>Luo Jie told Choo and Koh about this. <br><br>They
               then allegedly arranged with the principal of the school to engage STTA
               in a new training arrangement with the intention to use the proceeds 
              received to pay Luo Jie for the outstanding fees. <br><br>Subsequently, 
              after STTA received the payment from the school, Koh obtained approval 
              from Choo to authorise a payment of S$8,400 to Luo Jie, even though the 
              latter did not provide any training services under the new training 
              arrangement. <br><br>Choo Wee Khiang was charged with three counts of 
              corruptly accepting gratification under Section 6(a) of the Prevention 
              of Corruption Act, Chapter 241) and one count of criminal breach of 
              trust as a servant, which is an offence under Section 408 of the Penal 
              Code, Chapter 224. <br><br>Koh Li Ping was charged with one count of 
              engaging with Choo Wee Khiang in a conspiracy to commit criminal breach 
              of trust as a servant, an offence under Section 408 read with Section 
              109 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
