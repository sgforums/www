              <p>i love what we have become and what we are (eg low crime, ease of travel to other countries, good currency etc), but i do not like the direction we appear to be going to. </p>
              <p>i dont want to leave on a whim just because i dont like it, because that is what i think of some nationalities who come in bulk to SG.</p>
              <p>i dont like when ministers say we should retire in JB or that our transport system is working fine and nothing is wrong.</p>
              <p>i dont like when i cannot take out all my hard earned money in my old age, as long as i chose to be responsible about it.</p>
              <p>i dont like when in my workplace there are so many non locals. </p>
              <p>yes i know its the same complaints thats on repeat over and over again, but well nobody has really addressed nor changed them right?</p>

              Not every ah moh country is gong bust. Don't buy into PAP propaganda. Asia is not going to take over the west. We are going to be on par with the west.
              
              In Europe, you have two ends of the equation. You get rich countries like Germany, United Kingdom, France - but on the other end? Romania, Ukraine, Greece....
              
              What about Asia? Sure, we have the high end countries, like Singapore, China, Japan, Korea -  but on the other end? Thailand, Philippines, Myanmar?....

              It is actually better to be a citizen of any EU country than Singapore.
                                                  
                                                  
              Why?
              
              Singapore is the only country that has such an open leg foreign talent policy. In the places I've work in, there are so many protectionist policy that help the locals that only really talented people can get a work visa. So, even if I give up my Singapore citizenship, I can still come back to her - the govt does not discriminate! What is the real use of the Singapore citizenship when my political power is so limited, my voice is unheard, my freedom restricted and my life in fear of the government because I've a political opinion? 
                                                  
                                                  
              There's simply benefits at all keeping a Singapore citizenship. You don't get to live and work in any Asian country you want. What's more? CPF, NS liabilities and high cost of living. Working here as a foreigner is very easy as well, so why be a Singaporean?
                                                  
              
              But what about the EU? You get to work in any EU countries, and including the fantastic package of working in Singapore too simply because our govt really likes immigrants doesn't care. In EU countries, you get to enjoy many rights which can never be enjoyed in Singapore. Oh and yes, LGBT gets more rights in the EU than Singapore. Their marriage is recognized - here, we have bigots using pro-family as a cover for their homophobia. 
                                                  
                                                  
              Racism in EU? Oh don't be a deluded Singaporean again. I've met very little racism there in the EU, probably because I assimilated well and adapt to their culture. I also believe that the PAP should stop playing the xenophobic card on the PRC immigrants in SG - they often refuse to learn the local language and ignore local customs and rules and act as if they're still in China. They talk loudly on trains, refused to learn English despite the fact the English is Singapore's working language, and basically being a bull in a China shop - this is the type of immigrants no country WANT. 
                                
              
              Even you, Singaporeans Chinese reject this kind of people. Now, if you do what I do, assimilation, there's no problem for you. DON'T play the race card anymore. It's preventing your personal development.
