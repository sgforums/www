              That is only if they are not in the supervisors position, once the pinoys become the management, they will form their own gang and try to kick everyone out so that they can bring their own fellows in.   This is not the only case, recall the pinoy nurse incident, and there another pinoy who work in Sg and also threatened to kill any singaporean who dare to step foot on phillipines and you call this gentle.
              
              I agree on PRC and indian tend to be more rude, however I am felt, pinoys are more likely to backstab you (if you are not a pinoy) at work.

              Don't need to explain are you singaporean or not.  I am also a singaporean, done my NS, worked with various people from different countries too.  I respect you view, but I hold my views that pinoys are also as backstabber and not much better than PRC/Indians from india.  No doubt singaporean there are backstabber, but singaporean won't form a group of singaporean whereas pinoys will form their own group and as long as you are not pinoys (regardless how well you can do you job, they will try to force you out so that the company can hire another pinoys).  As far all the pinoys that I encounter have these traits.

              Are u sure that he is just one of the minority, let me see, "the pinoys health-care that mistreat the old folk", "the pinoy nurse that work in govt which post in her facebook", "the pinoy that work in SG and threatened to kill all singaporean who dare to step foot on phillipines" and then of cos "this pinoy that who call us rotten".
              
              If u have a chances to work for them and really open u eyes, u might have a different impression.  Yes, in the open they seen to be nice and friendly, but if really bother, they act differently if they think nobody in seeing.  And anyway that is how the mistreatment case being find out, through hidden carema, as they thought that the old folks cannot complain.  And mind u, it is not just one healthcare personals that do this, but couple of them get caught in the carema which mean that they are a whole group of the doing this.

              <p><br> Are u sure that he is just one of the minority, let me see, "the
              pinoys health-care that mistreat the old folk", "the pinoy nurse
              that work in govt which post in her facebook", "the pinoy that work
              in SG and threatened to kill all singaporean who dare to step foot
              on phillipines" and then of cos "this pinoy that who call us
              rotten". If u have a chances to work for them and really open u
              eyes, u might have a different impression. Yes, in the open they
              seen to be nice and friendly, but if really bother, they act
              differently if they think nobody in seeing. And anyway that is how
              the mistreatment case being find out, through hidden carema, as
              they thought that the old folks cannot complain. And mind u, it is
              not just one healthcare personals that do this, but couple of them
              get caught in the carema which mean that they are a whole group of
              the doing this.</p>

              <p>anyway...the companies said are not in japan but in oceania region.vast difference.....perhaps the japanese culture values its asian people way better than sporean side although in ww2 the japs like abandoned all their soldiers to fight in wars and after the wr even forgot to bring back the remains of their fallen soldiers that it had sent out even when the jap embassy was approached.</p>
