              <p>i find these people very particular about wining. i dont care about sports, but tese people are really high on ego and sensitive.</p>
              <p>i also attend lots of sports with such people massing. i cheered all competitors and felt something whenever i see some fail. all nationalities included.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but whever you see their own country men's turn, they will cheer extra loud, and if their own cuntrymen failed, they will look 100 x disappointed and pissed.</p>
              <p>country small people's heart nust be big, country big, but suaully i see the people heart very small. that;'s ther reason, their country has no place for their small hearts.</p>

              <p>LOL.</p>
              <p>Philipinos are themselves RUDE and ARROGANT. Go to their country and you will experience it. Some philipinos don't even like their own kind.</p>
              <p>It's interesting how these foreigners come to Singapore and criticise our society when their own culture back home is far worst.</p>
              <p>India is racist, yet  indian nationals complain our Singaporean racist.</p>
              <p>Philipinos are rude and nasty, yet they call us rotten.. LOL !!!</p>
              <p>These foreigners must think very highly of us. We must be the saints and angels they hope to meet in heaven.</p>
              <p>Singapore is now an island for these escapist...</p>
              <p>They come here to escape the filth and nastiness in their homeland... yet they themselves brought along the filth and nastiness into our land.</p>
              <p>Sad.</p>
              <p>The funniest part about the pinoys post is that in Philippines, the way they solve problem is " Don't like it, LEAVE".</p>
              <p>In his posting " Pinoys are here to stay".. that must really means they REALLY LOVE our country regardless how rotten our people are. Of cors, Sg is wayyy better than dirty place they call home.</p>
              <p>In their homeland they are used to being rude to foreigners, they will stare at you, point finger at you and laugh at you in their own language.. so , "rotten" is probably their only known means of saying  "hi,  there stranger".</p>

              <p>Of cors they only focus on the win, because that's all they've got.</p>
              <p>They have nothing else worth being proud.</p>
              <p>Sure they had Manny, but he lost to that Mexican guy already. Manny is done, finished.</p>
              <p>Now, they have nothing.</p>
              <p>It's foolish for them to pride themselves on something so fleeting.</p>
              <p>They should instead focus on something else more sustainable, more worthy.</p>
              <p>Fix their shitty culture, educate their people, upgrade their living conditions.. that way, their own people don't need to ESCAPE elsewhere and become a foreigner.</p>

              <p>if pinoys call sporean rotten maybe its somewhat true.</p>
              <p>the pinoys engineers, techs  etc as compared to the china ,india,bangladesh folks,,,,,,,pinoys are so so but a bit more polite but more well behaved than sickaporeans more or less or almost the same at times.</p>
              <p>i used to werk with these folks engineers ,techs etc.....and these folks share amongst themselves info on whats happening.so if they find out  how some sporeans they find inferior by their 3rd world standards end up get a stat board job way better and given more perks with almost an ass hole knowledge coupled with equally a rotten thug like method...perhaps its true.</p>
