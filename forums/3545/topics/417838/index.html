              <p>An elderly woman unknowingly 'glued her eyelids shut' 
              when she applied dental adhesive paste that was dispensed by a hospital 
              pharmacy. STOMPer <strong>Austin</strong>, her son, said she was supposed to be given eye gel for her eye problems.<br><br>Said the STOMPer:<br><br>"As
               shown in the pictures attached, my mother was prescribed Solcoseryl 20%
               Eye Gel but whoever was behind the counter gave her Solcoseryl DENTAL 
              ADHESIVE PASTE instead.<br><br>"My mother does not understand English, and her eyesight is too poor to make out the words even if she did.<br><br>"I
               came home to find her complaining that it was difficult to open her 
              eyelids and discovered to my horror that she had applied this paste to 
              her eyes."<br><br>In a phone conversation with STOMP, Austin had 
              verified that his mother's eyelids were glued shut because she had 
              applied the dental adhesive paste.<br><br>He added:<br><br>"She had to 
              have her eyes rinsed repeatedly. As it is, there is no telling if there 
              is going to be any permanent damage from this mistake and she may very 
              well had gone blind if nobody was home tonight.<br><br>"Please urge your
               readers to check and double-check anything that they are given by 
              hospital pharmacies, especially if they have elderly parents."<br><br>According
               to the STOMPer, his mother brought to the hospital's A&amp;E 
              department, where she was given an eye irrigation treatment.</p>
              <p>However, the family is still waiting for a response from the hospital on the matter.</p>

              <p>Mistakes are bound to happen as I observed on many occasions, pharmacy staff were chit chatting amoung themselves or with patients.  It is always crowded and there is not enough seats.  I suggest the non-prescription items on open shelves such health care items be removed from the pharmacy to create more space for seats. </p>

              <p><strong>'Deeply sorry for error': NUH apologises for giving woman wrong medication<br></strong><br>NUH has apologised for dispensing dental adhesive paste instead of eye 
              gel to an elderly housewife, which resulted in her right eye being 
              'glued shut'. <br><br>The hospital admitted that the incident was the 
              result of an error on its part and that it will do its best to see 
              through the housewife's recovery. <br><br>The incident was <a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/got_service_or_not/514298/mum_glued_her_eyes_shut_because_pharmacy_gave_dental.html">first reported to STOMP yesterday</a> (Dec 14) by the 63-year-old patient's son, STOMPer <strong>Austin</strong>.<br><br>He
               said that his mother, Madam Pang Har Tin, was prescribed Solcoseryl 20%
               Eye Gel to treat a corneal abrasion she sustained during procedures 
              performed at NUH, in a routine treatment for pre-existing eye 
              conditions. <br><br>However, an error made at the NUH pharmacy resulted 
              in her bringing home Solcoseryl Dental Adhesive Paste instead, an 
              ointment to treat inflammation and wounds to the mouth.<br><br>The 
              patient, who cannot read English, applied the medication, and 
              subsequently found difficulty in opening her right eye. She was rushed 
              to the accident and emergency department at NUH to have her eye flushed 
              out.<br><br>NUH said in a statement yesterday: <br><br>"We are deeply sorry for Madam Pang Har Tin's experience which resulted from our error.<br><br>"Her
               well-being is our priority, and we have arranged for our eye specialist
               to review her on Wednesday. We will do our best to see through Madam 
              Pang's recovery."<br><br>NUH also said: "The pharmacy staff involved 
              have been counselled, and we have tightened our processes to minimise 
              the risk of a similar error."<br><br>Eye specialists provided some insight into the incident. <br><br>Dr Esther Fu, an opthomologist from Gleneagles Medical Centre said:<br><br>"While
               the chemical mixture Solcoseryl itself will not cause major side 
              effects, how it affects the eye depends on factors such as the acidity 
              of this dental preparation and other compounds added."<br><br>Dr 
              Christopher Khng, an eye surgeon at Gleneagles, said: "The thick, gritty
               texture of the dental paste could worsen the corneal abrasion, opening 
              more area to bacteria infection. In a worst-case scenario, this could 
              lead to vision loss."<br><br>He added, however, that severe side effects
               were unlikely as a paste would probably cause the individual to tear, 
              washing the substance out of the eye.<br><br>Ms Christine Teng, 
              vice-president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore said that the 
              main reason the error occurred was probably due to 'the products looking
               very alike, which led the wrong product being packed and dispensed'.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/got_service_or_not/515268/nuh_apologises_for_giving_patient_dental.html"><br>http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/got_service_or_not/515268/nuh_apologises_for_giving_patient_dental.html</a></p>

              <p><strong>'Deeply sorry for error': NUH apologises for giving
              woman wrong medication<br></strong><br> NUH has apologised for dispensing dental adhesive paste instead of
              eye gel to an elderly housewife, which resulted in her right eye
              being 'glued shut'.<br> <br> The hospital admitted that the incident was the result of an error
              on its part and that it will do its best to see through the
              housewife's recovery.<br> <br> The incident was <a rel="nofollow" href="http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/got_service_or_not/514298/mum_glued_her_eyes_shut_because_pharmacy_gave_dental.html">first reported to STOMP yesterday</a> (Dec 14) by
              the 63-year-old patient's son, STOMPer
              <strong>Austin</strong>.<br> <br> He said that his mother, Madam Pang Har Tin, was prescribed
              Solcoseryl 20% Eye Gel to treat a corneal abrasion she sustained
              during procedures performed at NUH, in a routine treatment for
              pre-existing eye conditions.<br> <br> However, an error made at the NUH pharmacy resulted in her bringing
              home Solcoseryl Dental Adhesive Paste instead, an ointment to treat
              inflammation and wounds to the mouth.<br> <br> The patient, who cannot read English, applied the medication, and
              subsequently found difficulty in opening her right eye. She was
              rushed to the accident and emergency department at NUH to have her
              eye flushed out.<br> <br> NUH said in a statement yesterday:<br> <br> "We are deeply sorry for Madam Pang Har Tin's experience which
              resulted from our error.<br> <br> "Her well-being is our priority, and we have arranged for our eye
              specialist to review her on Wednesday. We will do our best to see
              through Madam Pang's recovery."<br> <br> NUH also said: "The pharmacy staff involved have been counselled,
              and we have tightened our processes to minimise the risk of a
              similar error."<br> <br> Eye specialists provided some insight into the incident.<br> <br> Dr Esther Fu, an opthomologist from Gleneagles Medical Centre
              said:<br> <br> "While the chemical mixture Solcoseryl itself will not cause major
              side effects, how it affects the eye depends on factors such as the
              acidity of this dental preparation and other compounds
              added."<br> <br> Dr Christopher Khng, an eye surgeon at Gleneagles, said: "The
              thick, gritty texture of the dental paste could worsen the corneal
              abrasion, opening more area to bacteria infection. In a worst-case
              scenario, this could lead to vision loss."<br> <br> He added, however, that severe side effects were unlikely as a
              paste would probably cause the individual to tear, washing the
              substance out of the eye.<br> <br> Ms Christine Teng, vice-president of the Pharmaceutical Society of
              Singapore said that the main reason the error occurred was probably
              due to 'the products looking very alike, which led the wrong
              product being packed and dispensed'.<br> <br> Source:<a rel="nofollow"><br> http://singaporeseen.stomp.com.sg/stomp/sgseen/got_service_or_not/515268/nuh_apologises_for_giving_patient_dental.html</a></p>
