              <p><strong>Mosquito larvae found breeding in Sheng Siong wet market at Elias Mall</strong><br> <span class="update">By Ng Lian Cheong | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 18 October 2010 2015 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: An 
              inspection by the National Environment Agency earlier this month found 
              mosquito larvae breeding at a Sheng Siong-owned wet market at Elias 
              Mall. <br><br>The wet market has been closed for more than half a year 
              as the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) has not approved Sheng 
              Siong's proposals as they do not meet HDB's requirements for wet 
              markets.<br><br>NEA said it found mosquitoes breeding in seven spots in 
              the 12,000 square-feet wet market when it inspected the area on 7 
              October.<br><br>It added that it found some 1,500 larvae, about half of 
              which are believed to be from dengue-causing mosquitoes.<br><br>As a 
              result, NEA said the supermarket chain will be taken to court where if 
              convicted, the company faces a S$10,000 fine.<br><br>Pest experts say 
              empty areas are conducive breeding grounds for mosquitoes once there is 
              stagnant water.<br><br>NEA returned to the premises for inspections 
              again on Monday.<br><br>According to David Teo, Property Manager with 
              Sheng Siong, the NEA was "satisfied" with the measures taken.<br><br>"After
               the inspection, NEA is satisfied with our preventive measure on 
              mosquito breeding. NEA request us to remove all the debris on site for 
              their next inspection. We have also informed our pest control operator 
              to carry out weekly inspection," said Mr Teo. <br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p><br>Another spoilt brat. I can tell you , i work in one of the sheng siong owned wet market. And i can tell you the place i work in is very clean and hygenic. And you think you can find everything in a supermarket? i can tell you , you won't find fresh veggie in supermarket. Older generation prefer wet market more than supermarket. What do you know? spoilt brat like you only like air-con , and thinks wet market is dirty and disgusting. Sorry but your comment sounds more disgusting to me. And for god sake , ppl in the wet market selling raw meat also uses gloves. Your comments just insulted the heritage and history of wet market , and also insulted me. I hope you will wake up your freaking idea and please stop surfing sgforums and fuck back to the tv to watch your sheng siong supermarket show. =)</p>

I know that there are some things you can buy at wet markets, but truthfully they are awful places to visit, especially the seafood section. How civilized you are to start insulting me for a simple comment. Learn from lohkinwah instead. Be calm! And I must say, Sheng Siong is a disappointment, especially with their cheapo TV shows which really degrades our Singaporean image.</p></div>

Your 2 cents worth? or your 2 cents worth of insulting? i turn the tables against you? because you deserve it for insulting a wet market like this. i start hurling vulgarities at you? i didnt say "fuck you" or anything or even "chao cheebye" to you. did i? i only told you to fuck back to your sheng siong show , that's not hurling vulgarities at you. Even if u think i did , you deserve it and i don't give a damn. awful place to visit? only brat like you think like this. Don't tell me you from young till now , you never eaten anything brought from wet market? and for your more information , if i am not calm , i would already fuck u upside down more jialat jialat. Know why i insulted you? because you just insulted the older generation favourite place , the place where they buy things to keep their family from starving. Without wet market you think supermarket will even exist? no one will have the idea of opening a supermarket. Your so call simple comment just degrade the existance of wet market , oh if sheng siong is not of your kind , then fuck back to your shop n save.</p></div>

              <p><br>aww really? you never eaten anything knowingly that came from wet market? you know the outside food you eat , most came from wet market? i bet you don't know how much wet market food you have intake into your stomach , why i know why outside food mostly came from wet market? because i supply some of my stuff to them. So you might even eat the food that come from my place. So are you gonna say that you get stomachache everytime you eat outside food? or are you going to say you have been eating at home since you were 6? Yeah my nick fits me, and i think spoilt brat fits into your character completely. And just for laugh , shop n save is under a very big company together with 7-eleven and other chain , so if you think they ain't gonna make the cut , what make you think you can do it better? i think you even have problem opening a small mini mart. Please stop making stupid comments that you think is a simple comments to annoy people. And sorry for my stereotypical view. Anyway i don't give a fuck. Oh why am i apologising? Anyway i was being sarcastic. =)) , spoilt brat like you don't deserve anything better.</p>
