              <p><em>It was revealed that army captain, Kheng Kok Keong agreed
               to harass other debtors in return for having his own debts reduced. 
              (Photo: Yahoo!).</em></p>
              <p>An army captain who also became a loanshark runner pleaded guilty on 
              Monday to four charges of harassment for vandalising the homes of 
              alleged debtors.</p>
              <p>Seventeen other charges against 34-year-old Kheng Kok Keong will be taken into consideration when he is sentenced on Thursday.</p>
              <p>According to local media reports, the army captain had gambled away at the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=resorts+world+sentosa+casino&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Resorts World Sentosa (RWS)</a> casino and resorted to borrowing money from an illegal moneylender.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that he had owed money to a loanshark known 
              only  as Ah Seng and agreed to harass other debtors in return for having
               his  debt reduced by S$2,000 every month.</p>
              <p>Kheng scribbled the victim’s name and identity card number on the 
              wall and scrawled “O$P$” – meaning “owe money, pay money”. He also 
              squeezed super glue into the padlock on the gate of the flat in 
              Commonwealth Crescent.</p>
              <p>However, the logistics officer then returned to the flat an hour 
              later after he realised he had left his cigarettes there. The 
              43-year-old occupant of the flat guessed Kheng was the culprit and 
              caught him before handing him to the police.</p>
              <p>They found three tins of paint in his possession, as well as a bottle
               of thinner and two cellphones – tools typically used by loanshark 
              runners.</p>
              <p>The court was not told how much he owed but his lawyer, Mr G. 
              Dinagaran, said Kheng had built up losses after visiting the casino at 
              RWS. After continuous harassment by Ah Seng’s runners, the army captain 
              agreed to be a runner too.</p>
              <p>For Kheng, both his family and 14-year career in the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+armed+forces&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore Armed Forces (SAF)</a> are in ruins.</p>
              <p>Since he was remanded in October, Ah Seng’s men had harassed his 
              family by scribbling on walls, throwing paint and using super glue to 
              destroy keyholes and padlocks – the very things he used to do.</p>
              <p>This drove his Taiwanese wife to walk out of the marriage and return 
              to Taiwan with their children, aged five and seven, said Mr Dinagaran.</p>
              <p>Kheng, who earned S$5,000 a month, will also be dismissed from the army.</p>
              <p>Pleading for a light sentence, his lawyer said that Kheng had never 
              been in trouble with the law before and had served the army honorably 
              before this incident. He had also been commended but the documents to 
              prove this were unavailable.</p>
              <p>The lawyer said this was because Kheng’s parents were afraid to 
              collect them from his flat in Yishun Avenue 6, which was being 
              practically besieged by Ah Seng’s runners.</p>
              <p>Those convicted of harassment can be jailed for up to five years and 
              fined between S$5,000 and S$50,000 on each charged. If the property is 
              damaged, they will be given three to six strokes of the cane.<br><br>Source:<a href="/forums/3545/topics/"><br>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/02/15/army-captain-turned-loanshark-runner-charged-in-court/</a></p>
