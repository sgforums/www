              <p>SINGAPORE - A SWISS expatriate who was jailed and caned for 
              spray-painting a Singapore metro train has flown home after serving his 
              sentence, the Swiss embassy said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, a 32-year-old software consultant, was 
              released from Changi Prison on Monday and quickly took a flight back to 
              Switzerland, the embassy's deputy head of mission Peter Zimmerli told 
              AFP.</p>
              <p>Fricker was jailed in June for vandalism and trespass, and a
               high court judge in August extended his sentence from five to seven 
              months following appeals from state prosecutors who felt the original 
              jail term was lenient.</p>
              <p>He was also ordered to be whipped three times with a wooden 
              cane, a form of punishment applicable to vandalism and other offences 
              including rape.</p>
              <p>Prosecutors said Fricker broke into a train depot in May and
               spray-painted two carriages together with a 29-year-old Briton, Lloyd 
              Dane Alexander, who is still wanted in Singapore after fleeing the 
              city-state.</p>
              <p>The pair spray-painted the words 'McKoy' and 'Banos' - the 
              signatures of two train vandals whose elaborate works are celebrated in 
              YouTube videos and websites that regard graffiti as an art form. -- AFP</p>

              <h2>SMRT vandal arrested in Switzerland</h2>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Alicia Wong – November 16th, 
              2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p>Swiss national Oliver Fricker, who flew home to Switzerland after 
              he was released from Changi Prison, was arrested by Swiss police after 
              he landed at Zurich Airport.</p>
              <p>According to a <em>Straits Times</em> report, a Swiss police 
              spokesman said  Fricker is suspected of having vandalised several trains
               in Switzerland  between 2002 and this year, causing damage of about 
              200,000 Swiss francs ($260,000).</p>
              <p>He added that the vandalism on the Swiss trains had some similarities
               to  that on the SMRT train which Fricker and an accomplice 
              spray-painted in  May.</p>
              <p>The report added that the SMRT train was scrawled with the words 
              ‘McKoy Banos’ – the signature  tag of two ‘graffiti artists’ believed to
               have spray-painted trains  around the world.</p>
              <p>“We have registered this ‘McKoy’ tag several times on Swiss trains. 
              We assume he was spray-painting with others. But we do not know those 
              suspects,” said the spokesman.</p>
              <p>The Swiss police had been in contact with the Singapore authorities, 
              he added.</p>
              <p>The Swiss police found that Fricker might be the man  responsible for
               the spate of train vandalism cases only after he was  arrested here in 
              May.</p>
              <p>Fricker is now being held in a prison in Zug and a judge is expected 
              to decide if he should be released pending trial.</p>
              <p>Under Swiss law, the former software consultant faces between one and
               five years in jail for vandalism.</p>
              <p>The 32-year-old was released from prison on Monday morning after he 
              completed less than five months of his seven months jail.</p>
              <p>He received one-third remission for good behaviour. He had also been 
              sentenced to three strokes of the cane for trespassing and vandalising 
              an SMRT
               train in May.</p>
              <p>Fricker and an alleged accomplice, Briton Dane Alexander Lloyd, 29, 
              had cut a hole in the Changi depot fence, and entered to spray-paint the
               words “McKoy
               Banos” on a train. Lloyd is believed to have fled to Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>According to <em>ST</em>, Fricker left the Changi
               Prison Complex at 8 am on Monday and was taken to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority building for 
              repatriation procedures.</p>
              <p>Fricker had been living in Singapore for the past 18 months, before 
              his arrest. He was caught two days before he was to return to 
              Switzerland.</p>
              <p>The Swiss embassy told <em>ST</em> that a representative had visited 
              Fricker occasionally while he was imprisoned and gave him consular 
              assistance.</p>
              <p>A spokesman for Switzerland-based company Comit, where Fricker 
              worked, said the IT consultant remains contracted, without further 
              elaboration.</p>
