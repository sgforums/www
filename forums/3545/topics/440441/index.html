              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>HANOI: A critically 
              endangered species of rhinoceros has been poached to extinction in 
              Vietnam, wildlife groups said Tuesday after determining that a Javan 
              rhino found dead last year was the last of its kind.<br><br>The WWF and 
              the International Rhino Foundation (IRF) pronounced the Javan rhinoceros
               extinct in Vietnam after all dung samples in a 2009 and 2010 survey at 
              Cat Tien National Park were confirmed to have been from the same animal.<br><br>The
               park was the only known habitat in Vietnam for the Javan rhino, which 
              is slightly smaller than its counterparts living in Africa, India and 
              Nepal and described by the WWF as "probably the rarest large mammal on 
              the planet".<br><br>"The last Javan rhino in Vietnam has gone," said 
              Tran Thi Minh Hien, WWF Vietnam country director. "Vietnam has lost part
               of its natural heritage."<br><br>WWF said poaching was the likely cause
               of death for the rhino, which was found in April 2010 with a gunshot 
              wound to its leg and its horn hacked off in Cat Tien, around 160 
              kilometres (100 miles) from Ho Chi Minh City in the south.<br><br>The 
              group said "ineffective protection by the park was ultimately the cause 
              of the extinction" and warned that illegal hunting to supply the 
              wildlife trade threatened the futures of other rare animals in the 
              country.<br><br>"The tragedy of the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros is a sad
               symbol of this extinction crisis," said Nick Cox of WWF's species 
              programme in the Greater Mekong.<br><br>Rhinos are one of the most 
              sought after species for traditional medicine in Asia, with the horn 
              fetching as much as $100,000 per kilogramme ($45,000 per pound), 
              according to WWF. Many in Vietnam believe horn can cure cancer.<br><br>At
               a press conference in Hanoi, Cox said it was "incredible" that people 
              would pay such large sums for the horns, when they are made from the 
              same substance as human fingernails and have "no medicinal value".<br><br>Tran
               Van Thanh, of the Ministry of Health's department of traditional 
              medicine said most practitioners did not believe that rhino horn was an 
              effective remedy, but added that "rich people can get anything" making 
              the trade "difficult to stop".<br><br>The rhinoceros was believed to be 
              extinct on mainland Asia until 1988 when one of the animals was hunted 
              from the Cat Tien area, leading to the discovery of a small population.<br><br>Javan rhinos are critically endangered, with barely 50 individuals left in a single group in a small national park in Indonesia.<br><br>WWF
               said Asia's voracious demand for rhino horn continues to increase every
               year, meaning "protection and expansion of the Indonesian population is
               the highest priority".<br><br>Vietnam held talks with South Africa last
               month as the African nation battles soaring rhino poaching. South 
              Africa saw 333 rhinos killed for their horns last year and has already 
              lost over 300 in 2011, compared with just 13 in 2007.<br><br>Other species on the verge of extinction in Vietnam include the tiger, Asian elephant and Siamese crocodile, WWF said.<br><br>- AFP/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>is poaching punishable by death?</p>
              <p>if it isnt it is high time they make it so to deter those people from killing animals to extinction.</p>

              <p>World War 1 was fought because there were 'too many people' and countries need more land. The world population back then was only 1.7billion. And that was considered as too much people.</p>
              <p>Now, the world has exceed 6 billion people. It is disturbing to think that nature no longer has any means to reset the equilibrium. Even if something calamitic happens and manage to wipe out 90% of humans, there will still be over 600millions left, which is still too many to count.</p>
              <p>You can wipe out 99%, and there will still be 60million people, enough for the world to continue functioning.</p>
              <p>At 99.9%,you have 6million left. We can still sustain a civilisation. Look at the Romans. They had civilised Europe, with a population of under 1m.</p>
              <p>Humanity's worst disease, the Black Death, was only able to wipe out 30-60% of the population. Our population has grown too vast for nature to reset to equilibrium. Nothing short of an alien invasion can effectively reduce our population to more sustainable levels.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, even aliens will be engulfed by 6 billion greedy, hungry mouths.</p>

              <p>educate the people cosuming the products, as well as those involved in killing the rhinos. Though i found "<span><span>.<em>.... it was "incredible" that

              <p>sometimes the people who kill these animals have to do so in order to survive - otherwise they have very little options for adequate income. Not saying this is always the case, but it's a possibility.</p>
              <p>I would assume WWF's objective is to save the animals, so an article like this would be to highlight the related issues. Any other (relevant) factors in the background won't be included.</p>
