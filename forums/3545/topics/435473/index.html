Occasionally, he would either start a fire at the door or use a bicycle lock to secure the gate.<br><br>Soh was picked up by the police on June 14 during an islandwide operation against an unlicensed moneylending syndicate.<br><br>Ah Boon’s identity has not been ascertained.<br><br>Soh could have been jailed for up to five years, fined up to $50,000 and caned up to six strokes on each charge of harassment. <br><br>Last year, harsher penalties were incorporated into the Moneylenders Act. <br><br>The number of unlicensed moneylending and harassment cases soared to a record high of 18,649 in 2009. Last year, the number fell by about 10 per cent to 16,833 cases.</div>
