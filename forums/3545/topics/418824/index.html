              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The 
              threat of a property bubble forming in Singapore saw the government 
              intervening in the market twice in 2010.<br><br>The slew of measures 
              ranged from raising housing supply to discouraging speculation.<br><br>National
               Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said this cautious approach of 
              incremental steps is to bring prices down to a sustainable level, but 
              not crash the market.<br><br>Property prices have shown few signs of 
              slowing down since rebounding in late 2009, following Singapore's 
              recovery from the global economic downturn.<br><br>A strong economy, low
               unemployment rate and liquidity from foreign investors in 2010 pushed 
              private property prices past the previous peak in 1996.<br><br>In the 
              public housing sector, prices in the resale market hit new records as 
              home buyers were swept away by positive market sentiment.<br><br>The 
              cash premium buyers pay upfront - also known as cash-over-valuation 
              (COV) - climbed to S$30,000.<br><br>To curb speculation, a seller's 
              stamp duty was introduced in February for property sold within a year of
               purchase.<br><br>The effective period was raised to three years during 
              the second round of changes in August.<br><br>The maximum loan amount 
              buyers can take from financial institutions was also reduced from 90 per
               cent to 70 per cent over the two rounds of changes.<br><br>Unlike the 
              previous property run when a capital tax - a tax on profits made from 
              selling private property - was introduced prior to the market crash in 
              1996, this time round, the government is taking small steps.<br><br>"We 
              are not taking a big bang approach, but taking a very calibrated 
              approach to this. Why? Because we want to make sure the market can be 
              sustained... We also don't want the market to crash because there will 
              be other repercussions if that were to happen," said Mr Mah. <br><br>The
               cooling measures announced on August 30 appear to have achieved some of
               its desired impact.<br><br>"Probably on the public housing market, but 
              not so much on the private side. I think the private side, we have been 
              consistent. But on the public housing market, I think the big change was
               when we disallowed dual ownership of public and private property within
               this minimum occupation period, which is now 5 years. Previously it was
               3 years," said Mr Mah.  <br><br>While prices in the private market are 
              still rising, the rate of increase has slowed down.<br><br>Prices of 
              private residential properties rose 2.9 per cent in the third quarter, 
              compared with a 5.3 per cent increase in the second quarter.<br><br>The 
              COV has declined gradually, dropping to S$22,000 in November.<br><br>Observers
               said COV levels may eventually drop to S$10,000 to S$20,000, as more 
              housing supply come onto the market.<br><br>The government plans to 
              release 22,000 new flats in 2011, depending on the take-up rate. <br><br>HDB
               will also release land sites for another 4,000 flats under the Design, 
              Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) and 4,000 Executive Condominium units.<br><br>Chris
               Koh, director of the Dennis Wee Group said: "Sellers need to be more 
              realistic; this isn't like a year ago when you could ask for COV as high
               as possible and people may grab it. I think buyers are a lot wiser. And
               those who were really in need and desperate would have bought.<br><br>"Now
               we are seeing the genuine buyers... It's no longer just jumping onto 
              the bandwagon. A lot of financial prudence is exercised before actually 
              buying.”<br><br>The government has indicated it will introduce more 
              measures if necessary to curb speculation. <br><br>But for now, it 
              appears no further action will be taken as it monitors the impact of the
               latest round of measures. <br><br>The National Development Minister 
              said it will be a few more months before the full extent of the August 
              changes are felt.<br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>
