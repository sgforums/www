              <p>voting the pap out of parliament is not going to happen as it took like 40 years for opposition to garner a paltry 2 seats out of the hundred seats in parliament. 2/100 after 40 years!!!does that look good?!!means everyone in spore could possibily be an unthinking niu who are unable to go anywhere or do anything let alone vote wisely.most likely u need to wait till 2052 to see the whole pap get voted out or ensure they get voted out.how much are u willing to bet that PAP will be voted out by next election?will u be willing to bet  a roomful of KFC for all if they get voted out?i mean if PAP won,u need to hand out a roomful of KFC to everyone because the production figures to oust a PAP just dont make sense and so u would have lost the bet to vote a PAP out in next election.remeber that u are dealing with people who have learnt methods from MIT usa etc to screw humanoids in spore using various methods.</p>
              <p>and then even if u vote them out ,the real work begins. u going to trust the werk on folks like ice?good lord!folks like ice would be turned into whipped cream in japan.it took japan 20 years to build a fit for business japan to do worldwide business after ww2..then with voting out of predominant parties in japan,it saw worse changes decade after decade with no progres in sight.they may have technical dedicated people way better than me or any sporeans i know in spore.so far in spore,the spore engineers i notice both diploma and degree in my first job were mainly poor or badly made.they were more like supervisors and ass kissers instead of having detailed knowledge as an engineer.out of 20 engineers,only 5 were singaporeans,the rest were foreigners.</p>
              <p>as companies i have went i noticed even worse engineers.....i wouldnt call them engineers but mere ornaments and loud speakers in the factories..all of them specialise in politics instead of hardcore engineering.why would i want to make them prosper every hour...when theres nothing for me?it made no sense so i immigrated.simple as that..u dun give people enogh...all good people will leave!</p>
              <p>so these would be the people doing the building up of spore if PAP would be voted out......if u left these people on an island they would ruin it.</p>
              <p>then the cycle restarts itself with the same or worse problems as the €PAP.</p>
              <p> then what?</p>
              <p>we need to have talented people in spore who are able to bring the country thru once PAP gets voted out.the business clerk ,bus driver,supervisors would be easy task.but the hard task would be in the engineering sector as not everyone is created to be a problem solver and were exposed to many facets in making $$$$ using high technology.most of your asian neighbours and even australia are seething with jealousy whenever they see a singaporean.and very ofyen feel the need to kill them because they are all engineers,executives and highly educated with a good or very good command of english.they(vietnamese) on the whole try to kiss ass with their employers from developed  euro countries with their poor comprehension of english.it probably sound weird from what i saw in australia,must be a job for ang mo trying to understand their non english speaking ass kissers.</p>
              <p>so u see.,,its not over if u voted the PAP out in 2040 or 2050.the tremendous revamp and corrrections of 40 years or more of neglect is about to begin from that vote out point. if all corrections are not done by every singaporean....all investors will pull out and everyone suffers unless u have inventors n genius who can build things up from nothing .spore has some but not much.u wanna do the voting out and work to build a stronger nation after that?its the job for millions of sporeans who are dedicated,intelligent and creative.and if u dont do it correctly spore might become a pol pot cambodia or degenerate into a land populated by unthinking violent convicts with murderous cowboys n cowgirls.</p>
              <p>i may be back in spore maybe i will not.it depends on the people in spore thats driving away the rest of the other sporeans from name calling to poor behaviour from ill bred coolies insisting their way on everyone.</p>
