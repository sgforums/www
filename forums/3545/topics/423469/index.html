              <p>Always dare not ask manager when not sure, always wait for me. So that manager assume he knows.</p>

              <p>Hi ManCha, thanks for your insight. Yes, trying to get me send the emails and he sit there keep quiet. Very stupid of me to do this unknowingly. That is one his best evil weapons. As it saying: "Push you down the bridge, he get the cossing safety"</p>
              <p>He wont ask mgr questions cos he dont want mgr to know that he dont know his work. That is why he will wait for me. Kind of very cunning colleague..</p>
              <p>Sometimes very tiried facing him whole day. You nvr know when he backstab you. Unknowingly.</p>

              <p>when task completed they will show face again but if the task fail, they dont know go where and hide liao and they can even say that not their problem one.</p>
              <p>if i see this type of pple, the most i will only say good morning to them only, i dont waste my time talking to them one. if they dont know i will also wont teach them and i wont share any info with them, when the boss want them to work, i will ask the boss to confirm that the person really know the work cos i dont want to teach them again and again or in the end clearing up their mess.</p>
