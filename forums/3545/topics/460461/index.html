              <p><br>ignorant and assumptions are mainly from u.</p>
              <p>if u care to dwell seriously deeper instead of having a shallow one dimensional sporean innocent approach.....it appears they intend to work and underpay almost everyone in the near future.if they can stake a claim on your cpf $,put their kids with preferential treatement in ns......making u werk 20 hrs a day everyday and underpaying u would be almost easy,i suppose it would pay only enough to support u and not old ageing parents.</p>
              <p>if a political unit says they need old faolk..have n habe nots etc etc to be housed in death camps then its pretty obvious what they intend to do.</p>
              <p>being shallow is bad....and not knowing the full intentions is worse.not fighting for whaqt is right and wrong is good as not writing anything in any forum.for this u need engineers,architects and practical people to see where its going for those in spore.</p>
              <p>if u cant figure whats goin to happen like a red blooded american......then thats too bad.</p>

              <p>I fully understand where you are coming from.. it's not wrong.. but it's not what the old folks want either...</p>
              <p>I used to live with my grandparents..they are now gone....both my grandparents suffered from old folks illnesses... they go to the doctors a lot... and they are always taking medicines.... we need to ensure old folks have plenty of health care support.</p>
              <p>May I know, do you live with your grandparents ? Are they still alive ? Are they in good health ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think it is important we look at the NEEDS of old folks... what they want and what they hope to have ...</p>
              <p>Senior people needs are very <strong>different</strong> from young people...young people cannot dictate what old people need or how they should live.</p>
              <p>You should be asking the old folks themselves...and give them a choice. Not force them to live by your standards simply because you want to be fillial.</p>
              <p>Of cors it is very noble for young people to want to care for their old folks.. but I tell you... unless you are talking about old folks with NO health issues... those are easy...but they simply do not exist... ALL old people have some form of health issues.</p>
              <p>SO, most old folks need special care... and some times...even the most fillial of offsprings simply CANNOT provide sufficient help to ensure the old folks can be properly taken care of.</p>
              <p>Thats the reason why there is a category of health care under GERIATRICS.</p>

              <p><br> ignorant and assumptions are mainly from u.</p>
              <p>if u care to dwell seriously deeper instead of having a shallow
                  one dimensional sporean innocent approach.....it appears they
                  intend to work and underpay almost everyone in the
                  near future.if they can stake a claim on your cpf $,put their
                  kids with preferential treatement in ns......making u werk 20 hrs a
                  day everyday and underpaying u would be almost easy,i suppose
                  it would pay only enough to support u and not old ageing
                  parents.</p>
              <p>if a political unit says they need old faolk..have n habe nots
                  etc etc to be housed in death camps then its pretty obvious what
                  they intend to do.</p>
              <p>being shallow is bad....and not knowing the full intentions is
                  worse.not fighting for whaqt is right and wrong is good as not
                  writing anything in any forum.for this u need engineers,architects
                  and practical people to see where its going for those in spore.</p>
              <p>if u cant figure whats goin to happen like a red blooded
                  american......then thats too bad.</p>

              <p>It is interesting to note that you immdiately assume ALL USA are made up of people of White race.</p>
              <p>There's a total of 17 Million Asians living in USA. The population of Asians in USA alone is BIGGER than combine population of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Asians are minority because the total population of USA is about 300+ millions, not one digit 5 millions.</p>
              <p>So , if are simply assuming all whites put their old folks in hospice to die... you are indeed ignorant.</p>
              <p>Asians in USA are doing what you and our government are reluctant to do. Why ? Traditions? Culture ? Are you saying Asians in USA are not asians ?</p>
              <p>Or perhaps... You are simply  Another  narrow minded Singaporean ?</p>
              <p>So, fyi, my friend is Asian.. and her mom who lives in the retirement village is Asian.</p>

              <p><br>all whites put old folks in  hospice cuz they are irresponsible!and u sound like one giving assumptions on me.whats the diffeence between an animal and u?even domestic cats tend to stick to their family pack and cooperate from looking out for one another to sickness.some  cats even cry on the road when their fasmily member gets injured.</p>
              <p>the thing is.............are u an intelligent living thing or are u some kind of wild animal?i dont know if u get exposed to wild animals or most of u and friends are wild.</p>
              <p>of course usa isnt that white now ...whiuch decade are u living in?</p>
              <p>on the whole white people dont really care a rats ass about old folks..they got their own lives to lead as in fishing,mountaineering,job,fucking etc etc.....so old folks get in their way often.</p>
