              <p>one surprising side effect of the one child policy was it contributed greatly to gender equality.</p>
              <p>lots of families only had one girl so they focus their resources and sent that girl to school. rather then teach her all she has to do is find a husband.</p>

              <p>Are you talking about your parent ? Or are you refering to yourself as a parent ?</p>
              <p>The reason why we hang on to this idea is either, out of fear ( of our old age years).. or  to control their children.</p>
              <p>You have to know where's the parent stand on this .</p>
              <p> Now,</p>
              <p>Children are being used as crutches because old parents are handicapped. Financially, physically and emotionally.</p>
              <p>Financially, if we can be self-sufficient.. we can be independent.</p>
              <p>Physically, if we stay healthy and live active, we don't need our children as crutches. If we are physically handicapped, we need to rely on professional care, there's really nothing much our kids can do for us.</p>
              <p>Emotionally, parents just need to let go. We cannot control them forever, they have their own life to live. We need to have our own social life and not rely on our kids to keep us company .</p>
              <p>Our children are living in a very stressful world, they don't even have time for themselves and their immediate family, how can we expect them to have time for us ?</p>
              <p>what's the point of living so close to them ? When they are busy doing their stuff.. are we going to just sit around and wait to die ?</p>
              <p>So being independent in every aspect is important to attaining retirement freedom.</p>
              <p>Govt should be building senior active living villages.. nearby a good hospital with good GERIATRIC care services..</p>
              <p>Nearby a nice park where old people can socialise and do their daily exercise.</p>
              <p>Nearby convenient healthy grocery stores and shopping for elderly stuffs.</p>
              <p>Do I need to live near my kids ? I don;t and I don't want to. My able bodied offsprings can come and visit me.</p>
              <p>That's essentially how other countries have their senior independent/assisted living all set up.</p>
              <p>Our government is so good at constructing shiny buildings.. surely they are also capable of building a WORLD CLASS senior living resort, yes ?</p>

              <p>Are you talking about your parent ? Or are you refering to
              yourself as a parent ?</p>
              <p>The reason why we hang on to this idea is either, out of fear (
              of our old age years).. or  to control their children.</p>
              <p>You have to know where's the parent stand on this .</p>
              <p> Now,</p>
              <p>Children are being used as crutches because old parents are
              handicapped. Financially, physically and emotionally.</p>
              <p>Financially, if we can be self-sufficient.. we can be
              independent.</p>
              <p>Physically, if we stay healthy and live active, we don't need
              our children as crutches. If we are physically handicapped, we need
              to rely on professional care, there's really nothing much our kids
              can do for us.</p>
              <p>Emotionally, parents just need to let go. We cannot control them
              forever, they have their own life to live. We need to have our own
              social life and not rely on our kids to keep us company .</p>
              <p>Our children are living in a very stressful world, they don't
              even have time for themselves and their immediate family, how can
              we expect them to have time for us ?</p>
              <p>what's the point of living so close to them ? When they are busy
              doing their stuff.. are we going to just sit around and wait to die
              ?</p>
              <p>So being independent in every aspect is important to attaining
              retirement freedom.</p>
              <p>Govt should be building senior active living villages.. nearby a
              good hospital with good GERIATRIC care services..</p>
              <p>Nearby a nice park where old people can socialise and do their
              daily exercise.</p>
              <p>Nearby convenient healthy grocery stores and shopping for
              elderly stuffs.</p>
              <p>Do I need to live near my kids ? I don;t and I don't want to. My
              able bodied offsprings can come and visit me.</p>
              <p>That's essentially how other countries have their senior
              independent/assisted living all set up.</p>
              <p>Our government is so good at constructing shiny buildings..
              surely they are also capable of building a WORLD CLASS senior
              living resort, yes ?</p>

              <p>If they are squeezing you dry.. you need to find out why.</p>
              <p>Do you act/pretend like you are earning a LOT of money just to look successful ?</p>
              <p>Are you outwardly showing them you don't know how to manage your finances ?</p>
              <p>Are they aware of your true income and what are your expenses, what are your net savings if you have any.</p>
              <p>Why are they asking so much from you... are they socking the money away ? What are their income vs needs ?</p>
              <p>A lot of parents exert control and manipulation over their offsprings with MONEY.  </p>
              <p>If you are a girl.. it's likely they are " harvesting " your income now , because they are worried all your income will go to your partner once you get attached.</p>

              <p>There ain't no prisoners here.</p>
              <p>They cannot make you a victim unless you are willing. No one point a gun to your head and demand money from you.</p>
              <p>If they are squeezing you dry.. you need to find out why.</p>
              <p>Do you act/pretend like you are earning a LOT of money just to look successful ?</p>
              <p>Are you outwardly showing them you don't know how to manage your finances ?</p>
              <p>Are they aware of your true income and what are your expenses, what are your net savings if you have any.</p>
              <p>Why are they asking so much from you... are they socking the money away ? What are their income vs needs ?</p>
              <p>A lot of parents exert control and manipulation over their offsprings with MONEY.  </p>
              <p>If you are a girl.. it's likely they are " harvesting " your income now , because they are worried all your income will go to your partner once you get attached.</p>
              <p>So there's a lot of possible reasons why your parents are squeezing you dry.</p>

              <p>basically they resorted to moral blackmail, no i dont earn alot, i dont flaunt my money, i dont act rich and they are well aware of how much im earning. But no they dont treat my money as my money, yes they treat my money as their money, no they dont care about me(at least thats what i tink), yes they incur loans cant pay back and expect children to take personal loans from banks to cover their loans. Basically, my feel is, they have children so that 1) children supposed to take care of them when they are old so they can spend what they want then come back take our money, 2) so that they look good have face, 3) they see our money as their money.</p>
