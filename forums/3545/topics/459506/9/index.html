              <p>basically they resorted to moral blackmail, no i dont earn alot,
              i dont flaunt my money, i dont act rich and they are well aware of
              how much im earning. But no they dont treat my money as my money,
              yes they treat my money as their money, no they dont care about
              me(at least thats what i tink), yes they incur loans cant pay back
              and expect children to take personal loans from banks to cover
              their loans. Basically, my feel is, they have children so that 1)
              children supposed to take care of them when they are old so they
              can spend what they want then come back take our money, 2) so that
              they look good have face, 3) they see our money as their money.</p>

              <p>To put it simply.. your parents are manipulative.</p>
              <p>They guilt you into giving them your money or whatever they want to take from you.</p>
              <p>Guilt is a very powerful tool... and a lot of parents use that on their kids. A more subtle form of passive aggression. </p>
              <p>In Asian culture, it's very prevalent.</p>
              <p>However, as long as you understand and see it as it is.. <strong>a manipulative act.</strong> You can actually stand up against it.. and be a victim no more.</p>
              <p>As
               children we do owe our parents some payback..it's undeniable that they 
              raised us with their time, effort and money... but the payback can be in a 
              different currency.</p>
              <p>Apparently, your parents only wants money. The question is ... WHEN does it end ???</p>
              <p>Can they accept affections as an alternative form of return ?</p>
              <p>If
               you are in financial hardship due to their demands, you should make it 
              very clear to your parents.... you are unable to give them what they 
              want... rather... give them what you can afford.</p>
              <p>They cannot force you to take a loan... because you can say NO.</p>
              <p>As adults, your parents need to take personal responsibility for their own finances. It's time your parents behave like an adult...</p>
              <p>And you need to stop behaving like a scapegoat.</p>
              <p>While I understand we as children, really try our best to not disappoint our parents... we need to recognise that.. not all parents do what is in the best interest for their kids.</p>
              <p>And when a parent start to abuse or exploit you (the child).. it's time to put your feet down.. HARD.</p>
              <p>If your parents still insist in making you financially drained with no regards for your well being... then it's time to accept they don't love you enough to care about you .</p>
              <p>That said it's time to <strong>cut them out</strong> of your life.</p>

              <p>No Mr John your prescription won't work.</p>
              <p>The only way for singapore to increase birth rate is</p>
              <p>1) More land = people will only multiply when they are in the country side. You see, in india, indonesia, china, nigeria and brazil, people get married n hv kids because the countryside encourage them to do so.</p>
              <p>So for singapore to have more land is to merge with malaysia so they can have access to the countryside</p>
              <p>2) go back to poverty = if you notice those countries like pakistan and india, why their birth rates so high is because they are poor. When people are rich, got careers and property, materialism tend to make them postpone marriage. When chinese couples get married at 30s, they find it hard to make babies, because of impotency or as you know the older the woman the harder to conceive babies.</p>
              <p>If you look at countries in poverty, they get married at age 18 to 22. This is ripe age to make babies.</p>
              <p>So singapore should go back to subsistence farming, fishing, collecting scraps, salvage microchip garbage and dismantling old cruise liner ships. Demolish all high rise office towers and tell the foreign MNC to move away.</p>
              <p>3)  Encourage arrange marriage and discourage women from taking up careers. ALl parents should quickly marry off their daughters when they are teenage years to adult hamsap uncle men. Thsi way the women cannot have proper education and then have to stay at home to take care of the family.</p>
              <p>Also allow men to be able to marry 4 wives.</p>
              <p>Allow poligamy.</p>
              <p>4) Ban condoms and bring in porn industry. Encourage teenage pregnancy. Mediacorp set up a porn channel division. Bring in husler, playboy and sweedish porn magazines publications to the country. Singapore become new tax shelter for japanese, swedish, american and eastern europe porn industry to film in the country. Open minds of the youth, for free sex.</p>
              <p>Ban abortion.</p>
              <p>5) Give tax rebates for every new born baby. Give tax deductions for purchase of diapers, schooling and kid's clothings. Give tax rebates to newlyweds in their first year of marriage</p>
              <p>6) Govt give free fertilisation therapy for infertile couples. Bring in baby mamas from impoverish countries to help become surrogate mothers for infertile couples.</p>
              <p>7) Provide more housing for couples. Each housing have extra room build, called the love room, equip with sexy music, with pornstar posters, whips and candlesticks.</p>
              <p>8) Decriminalise public sex. Encourage more couples to form blog sites to show their sex scenes in public.</p>
              <p>9) Set up forums for swingers.</p>

              members you show my post to..... what they say has no effect nor
              does it in-validate on my opinion.</p>
              <p>Here's why... because it's their job to SUPPORT you the fool..
              no matter what you say or do...right or wrong... they have the
              <strong>fiduciary duty</strong> to back you up. That's what friends
              do, and that's what family do.</p>
              <p>So yah... go ahead.... and show it to everyone you know... their
              answer will be.. " oh she's crazy dude.. just ignore her... why get
              all worked up ? not worth it de"... right ?</p>
              <p>Well.. that's what I'd do to my friend too... even tho in my
              heart.. I think the other party is right.. and my friend is
              nuts.</p>
              <p>Because when my friend come ask me for support.. I know they
              really just need to feel validated... so they feel good about
              themselves... now why would I deprive them of that.... it will be
              just cruel.. especially to a stubborn old man like you.</p>
              <p>So there there... go live in your little bubble.... Mr right..

              <p>eh, how old are you really. It's quite strenuous to explain
              things to a child pretending to know adult stuff.</p>
              <p>Actually, most part of your post is BS. I really don't know what
              you have been taught.. perhaps by your very selfish parents.</p>
              <p>A parent who uses their children as retirement insurance is
              SELFISH.</p>
              <p>I am a working adult... and I am socking away a lot of money for
              my reitrement. I have no intention at all to rely on my children to
              take care of me when I am old.</p>
              <p>If they do stay close by for my sake.. well.. that will be
              because they WANT to.. not because they HAVE to.. and I will be
              grateful for that.</p>
              <p>The true teaching of Filial piety is a two way street.. along
              the generations... self serving parents exploited this teaching and
              distorted it for their own convenience...get yourself properly
              educated please.</p>
              <p>Not only am I planning for my retirement.. I am also putting
              money away for my children to send them to top schools..so they may
              acquire skill/knowledge/ability to take care of themselves when I
              can no longer take care of them. And at the mean time.. I am
              spending a lot of money on my children to make sure they are living
              a comfortable life.</p>
              <p>Do I expect them to take care of their children, yes . Do I
              expect them to rely on my grandchildren to take care of them ?
              Hopefully NOT.</p>
              <p>"<em>How about those who did not have children? They are relying
              on OTHER PEOPLE children to support. other people children will
              have to work very very hard, pay a lot lot of tax to pay for the
              hospital, doctor, nursing home, etc of the previous
              generation."</em></p>
              <p>This you have mentioned... is a PONZI scheme. Google it.. if you
              dont' know what it means.</p>
              <p>It will never work.. and it is the MAIN reason why we have HUGE
              INFLUX of immigrants.. which our govt has used to justify their
              open leg policy.</p>

              <p>I'm actually trying to work towards a point when if say my work takes off I don't have to retire on my children.</p>
              <p>But I still can't help but feel my parents should rely on me, and I would be considered a failure in life if I can't provide for my parents should they require it.</p>
              <p>not all rely on other's "children" indirectly, one of my customers, an 80+year old came in and check out prices and then came back with a friend to pay for him.</p>

              <p>If your reason for stimatising women is based on your stupid
              fear of them being a freaking burden, then you can shut up now...
              it's rubbish in rubbish out.</p>
              <p><em>"INSTEAD. we COMPLAIN when people go for maternity leave.
              AIYA must fill in for their duties, NOT FAIR."</em></p>
              <p>Again, you are stabbing yourself in your own feet. Obviously you
              are just merely a student with obsolutely ZERO working experience.
              And you have ZERO appreciation for what your parents had to do for
              you... to raised you into the idiot that you are pounding away
              mindlessly on the keyboard.</p>
              <p>When I was a single working female, I was glad I didn't hav to
              deal with the "difficult  family life most of my female
              married co-workers had to live with. The pressure and many "family
              emergencies"...goosh... I told myself maybe I'll stay single
              forever.</p>
              <p>A working mother takes a LOT of leave days... not only during
              and after pregnancy... also along the way till their children
              attain adulthood.</p>
              <p>Children get sick very easily...whenever they get sick.. parents
              take time off.. and when they need to go see doctor for maintenance
              checkup.. someone has to bring them there.... and when the school
              call.. we have to be there... when the school got holidays... who
              take care of you ?</p>
              <p>So single women with no children are actually MORE productive
              than a single man with NS obligation... If you are too stupid to
              understand this.. you should climb back into your mother's womb
              forever.</p>
              <p> "SO all I am saying is. We should tell the truth.
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which is woman
              without children are SELFISH. and should be stigmatised that
              way."</span></strong></p>
              <p>Now if you insist .. sure.. why don't we make sure ALL women no
              need to work.. if they no need to contribute to the working
              society..because they don't have to worry about paying their bills
                   and their SOLE responsibility is to be a
              INCUBATOR.... OK.. shame them if they don't produce babies. Since
              having babies become the SOLE purpose for their existence.. yes ?
              Feasible.</p>
              <p>Now in order for that to work... we need the government to issue
              all women who hit puberty (child bearing age)  with a
              monthly  stipend , sufficient to let women enjoy an acceptable
              standard of living... so they need not rely on individual men nor
              themselves to provide for them... rather from a pool paid by
              working men and managed by a centralised agency.......MEn  go
              work... and pay into the resource pool to be distributed equally to
              the women.  Do you agree with this idea ???</p>
              <p>But YOU AS A GUY.. dare to complain when a woman doesn't want
              babies.. when YOU are UNABLE TO BE PREGNANT... and you are unable
              to SUPPORT/provide for  your girlfriend or wife without her
              going to work and bringing home the dough...now that's a shame
              isn't it... shame on you dude.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> All I am saying is...
              currently our women need to go work to help pay the bills , give
              birth, raise babies, take care of family, be faithful..make you
              feel like a real man.... do you want them to wipe your ass for you
              too ?</span></p>

                      their loans. Basically, my feel is, they have children so that 1)
                      children supposed to take care of them when they are old so they
                      can spend what they want then come back take our money, 2) so that

              <p>maybe you don't really understand the part about taking care of your parents?</p>
              <p>maybe you should run out of money and let your parents know? and see how they react. might harden your heart a bit.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in a more traditional country.... you might be condemn for speaking out. and even to dare suggest you feel unhappy about supporting your parents</p>
              <p>that being said I don't think your parents are right, logically they aren't . but given 
                  the social circumstances they grew up in they might think they're 
                  correct. it's hard to say who's right or wrong when it comes to this 
                  kind of personal belief.</p>
              <p>but with family members you'll need a softer and firmer approach. and someone else to blame for not having enough money to give to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>plus I noticed girls tend to want to give more compared to guys.</p>

              <p>I think you have a very skewed idea of what Fillial Piety is...your "culture" probably taught you the lopsided/distorted form... and because you don't know any better.. you accepted it and that distorted idea became part of your belief.</p>
              <p>Fillial piety is a natural flow of love and respect between parents and children.</p>
              <p>It doesn't have to be guilt pounded into the child, nor needed any laws to MAKE children be fillial.</p>
              <p>PROVIDED... the parents earnd that love and respect.. because the child came from the parent.. the parent is the beginning....the starting line...</p>
              <p>After the child become adult... the child out of love and respect... give back the love and respect his/her parent showered them during the growing up process...</p>
              <p>What confucious had in mind back then.. wasnt a law... it was meant as a GUIDE on how to carry out fillial piety. He was a TEACHER... not a law maker.</p>
              <p>If your parents took great care.. and love you earned your respect... NATURALLY.. you will WANT to treat them well during their vulnerable years....</p>
              <p>In a perfect world ( assuming)... children are naturally loving... we love our parents who loved us... even if Confucious never existed... children would have done the same anyway.</p>
              <p>So, I NEVER say you should not be filial... I am just saying if my children treats me well.. it's because they WANT to.. not because they HAVE to.</p>
              <p>If you force a child to give... is that the child's will.. or is it your will ? It's your will.. and you simply MANIPULATED the child into giving. So we cannot say the child is loving..because it was never his idea.</p>
              <p>I ascibe to a NATURAL version of fillial piety... You probably.. in your "CULTURE" ascribed to a FORCED version of fillial piety.... So we shall agree to disagree on this topic.</p>

              <p>To put it simply.. your parents are manipulative.</p>
              <p>They guilt you into giving them your money or whatever they want
              to take from you.</p>
              <p>Guilt is a very powerful tool... and a lot of parents use that
              on their kids. A more subtle form of passive aggression. </p>
              <p>In Asian culture, it's very prevalent.</p>
              <p>However, as long as you understand and see it as it is..
              <strong>a manipulative act.</strong> You can actually stand up
              against it.. and be a victim no more.</p>
              <p>As children we do owe our parents some payback..it's undeniable
              that they raised us with their time, effort and money... but the
              payback can be in a different currency.</p>
              <p>Apparently, your parents only wants money. The question is ...
              WHEN does it end ???</p>
              <p>Can they accept affections as an alternative form of return
              ?</p>
              <p>If you are in financial hardship due to their demands, you
              should make it very clear to your parents.... you are unable to
              give them what they want... rather... give them what you can
              afford.</p>
              <p>They cannot force you to take a loan... because you can say
              NO.</p>
              <p>As adults, your parents need to take personal responsibility for
              their own finances. It's time your parents behave like an
              adult...</p>
              <p>And you need to stop behaving like a scapegoat.</p>
              <p>While I understand we as children, really try our best to not
              disappoint our parents... we need to recognise that.. not all
              parents do what is in the best interest for their kids.</p>
              <p>And when a parent start to abuse or exploit you (the child)..
              it's time to put your feet down.. HARD.</p>
              <p>If your parents still insist in making you financially drained
              with no regards for your well being... then it's time to accept
              they don't love you enough to care about you .</p>
