              <p>jojo, of course not. but please try to open your brain a bit to see more path.</p>
              <p>you see, to have children is mostly the woman choice.</p>
              <p>why?</p>
              <p>because the woman body is the one that carry the baby for 9 month and give birth.</p>
              <p>For example, if a guy say, woman, let me put baby in your stomach, when woman say no, bopian. cos woman will think, who is this guy, will he take care of me, got money to take care of me and baby, got money send baby to yale or harvard, got money pay for international school, can he afford condo or landed property, etc etc...</p>
              <p>on the other hand. if woman say boy... come put sperm in me... most guys will say... OK!</p>
              <p>or should I say,  if woman want baby, they can also just go sperm bank and ejaculate into themself.</p>

              <p>Well, it didn't work in India, ain't gonna work here dude.</p>
              <p>Why don't we stigmatize all men who refuse to take care of their
              baby, instead ask their girlfriend to go abort ?</p>
              <p>Force men to marry the pregnant girlfriend or go to jail plus
              big fat fine ?</p>
              <p>Will that solve the problem ?</p>
              <p>Stimatising is wrong. Please throw your stupid idea out the
              window.</p>
              <p>Instead of forcing women to mate with you, why don't u just make
              yourself more attractive to women ? Lazy isn't an excuse, Mr

              <p>it "worked" in india, in a bad way but it worked. it created a society where women were forced to get married. and despite being beaten/burned/scolded/raped in the marriage they still find it a better alternative.</p>

              <p>Well, calling them names doesn't do much. Labeling is useless.

              <p>Anyway.. U haven't answer my question, why don't men make

              <p>Is it so difficult for men to step up and show they are worth

              <p>Sure, guys go ahead and stigmatize women, call them names, spit
              in their face. That's men's prerogative to force women to marry
              them? How backwards can u be?</p>
              <p>And u forgetting half the world is women, do u expect women to
              stigmatize ourselves?  U must be nuts. Why don't u cut your
              own nose Mr. Wong. </p>
              <p>If you are really for having more babies for our society, why
              not fight for better rights and inclusion for single mothers ?
              These women were used by men, abandoned and left to fend for
              themselves , they choose to be pro life, yet they were punished by
              our society. May I know what will be your solution on this
              issue?</p>
              <p>Then what about women who Can't have babies? Do u want to
              stigmatize them too? </p>

              <p>when a girl goes for an abortion, usually she or her family think that they can't afford to have the baby, maybe financially or the girl thinks it'll be better for the relationship?</p>
              <p>beyond those reasons, I can only say the girl's taken advantage off? it's a situation unlikely to lead to marriage, or a stable marriage. even if you force it through.</p>
              <p>don't blame the guys on this one. I always advocate the girls should take care of themselves.  The ladies in question might have gone pro life(I'm pro choice so maybe same thing here? maybe not?)</p>
              <p>but you need to remember, society is not punishing her for being pro-life, but their life choices. you don't see the same treatment for married ladies do you?</p>
              <p>fact remains , she didn't protect herself. she thinks it's love and it's a modern society when she wants to do it.</p>
              <p>if you think more about it, it's the same situation as when some old lady gets conned into buying magic stones that cures illnesses. then society labels them old dumb and senile.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>personally I feel that something has to be done for single mothers but my stand aligns with the govt on some point. the subsidies were there to encourage marriage and a "wholesome" family</p>
              <p>so that arguement will not work if someone thinks like me. it's not punishment, it's a "reward" that they don't, frankly speaking qualify for.</p>
              <p>beyond sercuring housing for them. anything else would be punishing the rest of society for their hour of fun.</p>
              <p>I rather the govt jail the fathers and make them pay alimony.</p>

              <p>It is against nature to force matings .</p>
              <p>People should stigmatise loser males who are lazy, weak, stupid

              <p>It's men's own fault for becoming undesirable.</p>
              <p>The strongest and fittest should have offsprings. To ensure

              <p>We must enact laws to ensure our males are strong and
              attractive.</p>
              <p>Men must wake up every morning at 5 am to start a rigorous
              exercise routine staring at age 15. They can only be discharge of

              <p>Routine.</p>
              <p>Run 5 km.</p>
              <p>Do 100 push ups</p>
              <p>Do 200 start jumps</p>
              <p>Pump 100 lbs of iron</p>
              <p>If they are unable to do so, they go to jail for one week.</p>
              <p>All men must go for fertility checks, if got low sperm count,
              send him to jail.</p>
              <p>Men must go for 3 month grooming classes and complete with
              distinction. Or they will pay a penalty of $3000.</p>
              <p> Every month. Men must parade themselves in community
              centers, all eligible women will go there to pick out their
              mate.</p>
              <p>Any male who refused to accept the woman must be canned 50

              <p>jojo, of course not. but please try to open your brain a bit to
              see more path.</p>
              <p>you see, to have children is mostly the woman choice.</p>
              <p>why?</p>
              <p>because the woman body is the one that carry the baby for 9
              month and give birth.</p>
              <p>For example, if a guy say, woman, let me put baby in your
              stomach, when woman say no, bopian. cos woman will think, who is
              this guy, will he take care of me, got money to take care of me and
              baby, got money send baby to yale or harvard, got money pay for
              international school, can he afford condo or landed property, etc
              etc...</p>
              <p>on the other hand. if woman say boy... come put sperm in me...
              most guys will say... OK!</p>
              <p>or should I say,  if woman want baby, they can also just go
              sperm bank and ejaculate into themself.</p>

              <p>OK. I can open my "brain".. can you open yours ?</p>
              <p>Good to know you actually agree , that a woman can have a baby without being married to a man.</p>
              <p>So this stigmatising women to have babies.. is not exactly about marriage.</p>
              <p>It's about having babies , yes ?</p>
              <p>Now , then we should do away with single mother stigmas.</p>
              <p>As long as a woman is willing to have a baby... it doesn't matter if she is married or not.</p>
              <p>A child from a single mother is just as important as a child from a married mother.</p>
              <p>If you want to argue that child from married family is better off... that is rubbish.</p>
              <p>As long as a man is not willing to help care for the child... with marriage or without marriage.. they are the same. Because mothers will be mothers with or without the father.</p>
              <p>Ofcors.. if a single father is willing to care for his child.. he is no different from a married father.. same logic.</p>
              <p>Marriage is just a status... it's acutally quite meaningless in the debate of increasing birth rates.</p>
              <p>What is important is to make sure their bloodlines are properly recorded so siblings do not end up having children together.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Women should be encouraged to have babies.. single mother or married mother... And as long as our society is willing to provide adequate support and acceptance... it can be done.</p>

              <p>when a girl goes for an abortion, usually she or her family
                  think that they can't afford to have the baby, maybe financially or
                  the girl thinks it'll be better for the relationship?</p>
              <p>beyond those reasons, I can only say the girl's taken advantage
                  off? it's a situation unlikely to lead to marriage, or a stable
                  marriage. even if you force it through.</p>
              <p>don't blame the guys on this one. I always advocate the girls
                  should take care of themselves.  The ladies in question might
                  have gone pro life(I'm pro choice so maybe same thing here? maybe
                  not?)</p>
              <p>but you need to remember, society is not punishing her for being
                  pro-life, but their life choices. you don't see the same treatment
                  for married ladies do you?</p>
              <p>fact remains , she didn't protect herself. she thinks it's love
                  and it's a modern society when she wants to do it.</p>
              <p>if you think more about it, it's the same situation as when some
                  old lady gets conned into buying magic stones that cures illnesses.
                  then society labels them old dumb and senile.</p>

              <p>personally I feel that something has to be done for single
                  mothers but my stand aligns with the govt on some point. the
                  subsidies were there to encourage marriage and a "wholesome"
                  family</p>
              <p>so that arguement will not work if someone thinks like me. it's
                  not punishment, it's a "reward" that they don't, frankly speaking
                  qualify for.</p>
              <p>beyond sercuring housing for them. anything else would be
                  punishing the rest of society for their hour of fun.</p>
              <p>I rather the govt jail the fathers and make them pay
                  alimony.</p>

              <p>You are assuming that ALL marriage is the result of a "good" choice. In reality, that is not the case. There's good marriage, then theres the mediocre and bad ones.</p>
              <p>To qualify for the "reward" ?</p>
              <p>By depriving the rights given to another person, you are essentially punishing.</p>
              <p>A mother is a mother.. no matter what her marital status is.</p>
              <p>A single mother is no less important than a married mother, so why do we need them to "qualify" for that reward ? They should automatically qualify the moment she is pregnant.</p>
              <p>Punish for her life choices... ? Then should we also punish those women who married lousy men  ? I think its about time.. we stop "punishing". Because punishing is just a tool of manipulation to favor one side.</p>
              <p><strong>ALL mothers should be treated the same</strong>. Married or not.</p>

              <p>and according to scientists, animals invented rape as a tool to
                  ensure their genes would get passed on. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>besides..... we're surrounded by countries that have men who
                  married their wives and then send them over here to work. then stay
                  home and shake leg.</p>
              <p>by nature... lol we are already a better choice here by actually
                  wanting to work to feed a family.</p>
              <p>if not for the law protecting women, things would be a lot
                  worse.</p>

              <p>Oh please... the scientists are laughing at you.</p>
              <p>Animals didn't invent rape...</p>
              <p>Animal males are required to show their power in order to earn rights to mate with a female.</p>
              <p>When was the last time you watched Animal planet ? Maybe never ? Gosh...</p>
              <p>Peacocks show off their feathers, many species of animals duel to be alpha males.., penguins/birds build nests to impress their females....</p>
              <p>Men/boys... i donno... they sit around moping and whining females are too hard to please.</p>
              <p>If you are talking about those maids with indonesian husbands... that's the result of social stigmas on women. Those women are forced to marry good for nothing males because they do have social persecutions.</p>
              <p>And you guys want the same in Singapore ?</p>
