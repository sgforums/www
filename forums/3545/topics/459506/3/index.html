              <p>i <strong>STRONGLY  </strong>disagree with stigmatising women to force them into marriage or motherhood.</p>
              <p>Men should make themselves more desirable and attractive so women to WANT to marry them.</p>
              <p>It is against nature to force matings .</p>
              <p>People should stigmatise loser males who are lazy, weak, stupid and refused to be attractive for women.  They should be sterilised and exiled into pulau kosong where they belong.</p>
              <p>It's men's own fault for becoming undesirable.</p>
              <p>The strongest and fittest should have offsprings. To ensure human beings continue to thrive and flourish.</p>
              <p>We must enact laws to ensure our males are strong and attractive.</p>
              <p>Men must wake up every morning at 5 am to start a rigorous exercise routine staring at age 15. They can only be discharge of routine after he has fathered 5 children.</p>
              <p>Routine.</p>
              <p>Run 5 km.</p>
              <p>Do 100 push ups</p>
              <p>Do 200 start jumps</p>
              <p>Pump 100 lbs of iron</p>
              <p>If they are unable to do so, they go to jail for one week.</p>
              <p>All men must go for fertility checks, if got low sperm count, send him to jail.</p>
              <p>Men must go for 3 month grooming classes and complete with distinction. Or they will pay a penalty of $3000.</p>
              <p> Every month. Men must parade themselves in community centers, all eligible women will go there to pick out their mate.</p>
              <p>Any male who refused to accept the woman must be canned 50 strokes and made to eat dog shit.</p>
              <p>that way, I guarantee our birth rate will shoot through the roof.. and govt will have to renact the 2 children rule all over again.</p>

              <p>I think it's very important men go for fertility check to ensure their reproductive organs are fully functional and sperm count at acceptable levels.</p>
              <p>Those who CMI should not be allowed to have a girlfriend and/orget married. It's a total waste of human resources.</p>
              <p>If a man can no longer produce quality sperm, he will need to divorce his wife with immediate effect so she can go find another healthy and able man.</p>
              <p>There must be rigorous quality standards to ensure our babies are fit, strong and smart.</p>
              <p>My plan confirm work, our sg men will be world class standard, parents from other countries will pay big money to our govt to marry their daughters into SG, thereby increasing our birthrate, productivity and prosperity.</p>

              <p>I am saying low birth rate is due to social issues. 1 side is women more educated, more gender equality, more choices for women. men also more educated. 2 side is society values $$$, big house, big car, got children must send to expensive school, ivy league university. so everybody chasing that big houses big cars, glam lifestyle, fine dining and monthly maldives holidays. 3 side is therefore society actually promote and encourage woman to chase big house big car and all these sort of thing and making baby and building family is frankly, not important.</p>
