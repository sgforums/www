              <p>so until now you do not understand the difference between a govt and a bank?</p>
              <p>but for the sake of giving you an answer, you actually technically get to choose the govt you want to represent you. and assuming they were choosen based on how you want things to be done, the money would actually be spent that way.</p>
              <p>which apparently also means 60.1% of this nation thinks quite differently from you.</p>
              <p>I supposed I'm the 39%.......ah....... but I also appear to have a different view from yours.</p>

              <p>A single mother does not have more rights... and I never
              advocate them getting more than a married mother... I have made

              vs  a Unmarried single mother ???  Oh.. i guess one had a
              man willing to marry her but left her... and the other had a man
              who refused to marry her and left her....</p>
              <p>Do you really believe more women will jump in the marital wagon
              simply becuase of the Govt"Rewards"... that's an outright

              won't say no to men when they propose just becase the Govt decided
              to stop giving it...</p>
              <p>Worst is if we know the reward was at the expense of someone
              else who needs it. Then no.. we really DONT want it.</p>

              <p>if you have ever read law documents before, you'll noticed the words used are darn detailed if they want it to be. when they feel like taking a stand. </p>

              <p>do your kids know how mommy behave online? probably not right? on the other hand I actually show what I post here to my friends though labeling you as crazy seems a little too much.  but it's not like you can blame me if you've read your own posts.</p>

              <p>lots of families only had one girl so they focus their resources and sent that girl to school. rather then teach her all she has to do is find a husband.</p>

              <p>eh, how old are you really. It's quite strenuous to explain things to a child pretending to know adult stuff.</p>
              <p>Actually, most part of your post is BS. I really don't know what you have been taught.. perhaps by your very selfish parents.</p>
              <p>A parent who uses their children as retirement insurance is SELFISH.</p>
              <p>I am a working adult... and I am socking away a lot of money for my reitrement. I have no intention at all to rely on my children to take care of me when I am old.</p>
              <p>If they do stay close by for my sake.. well.. that will be because they WANT to.. not because they HAVE to.. and I will be grateful for that.</p>
              <p>The true teaching of Filial piety is a two way street.. along the generations... self serving parents exploited this teaching and distorted it for their own convenience...get yourself properly educated please.</p>
              <p>Not only am I planning for my retirement.. I am also putting money away for my children to send them to top schools..so they may acquire skill/knowledge/ability to take care of themselves when I can no longer take care of them. And at the mean time.. I am spending a lot of money on my children to make sure they are living a comfortable life.</p>
              <p>Do I expect them to take care of their children, yes . Do I expect them to rely on my grandchildren to take care of them ? Hopefully NOT.</p>

              <p>Again, you are stabbing yourself in your own feet. Obviously you are just merely a student with obsolutely ZERO working experience. And you have ZERO appreciation for what your parents had to do for you... to raised you into the idiot that you are pounding away mindlessly on the keyboard.</p>
              <p>When I was a single working female, I was glad I didn't hav to deal with the "difficult  family life most of my female married co-workers had to live with. The pressure and many "family emergencies"...goosh... I told myself maybe I'll stay single forever.</p>
              <p>A working mother takes a LOT of leave days... not only during and after pregnancy... also along the way till their children attain adulthood.</p>
              <p>Children get sick very easily...whenever they get sick.. parents take time off.. and when they need to go see doctor for maintenance checkup.. someone has to bring them there.... and when the school call.. we have to be there... when the school got holidays... who take care of you ?</p>
              <p>So single women with no children are actually MORE productive than a single man with NS obligation... If you are too stupid to understand this.. you should climb back into your mother's womb forever.</p>
              <p> "SO all I am saying is. We should tell the truth.

              <p>Now if you insist .. sure.. why don't we make sure ALL women no need to work.. if they no need to contribute to the working society..because they don't have to worry about paying their bills      and their SOLE responsibility is to be a INCUBATOR.... OK.. shame them if they don't produce babies. Since having babies become the SOLE purpose for their existence.. yes ? Feasible.</p>
              <p>Now in order for that to work... we need the government to issue all women who hit puberty (child bearing age)  with a monthly  stipend , sufficient to let women enjoy an acceptable standard of living... so they need not rely on individual men nor themselves to provide for them... rather from a pool paid by working men and managed by a centralised agency.......MEn  go work... and pay into the resource pool to be distributed equally to the women.  Do you agree with this idea ???</p>
              <p>But YOU AS A GUY.. dare to complain when a woman doesn't want babies.. when YOU are UNABLE TO BE PREGNANT... and you are unable to SUPPORT/provide for  your girlfriend or wife without her going to work and bringing home the dough...now that's a shame isn't it... shame on you dude.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> All I am saying is... currently our women need to go work to help pay the bills , give birth, raise babies, take care of family, be faithful..make you feel like a real man.... do you want them to wipe your ass for you too ?</span></p>

              <p>do your kids know how mommy behave online? probably not right?
                          on the other hand I actually show what I post here to my friends
                          though labeling you as crazy seems a little too much.  but
                          it's not like you can blame me if you've read your own posts.</p>

              <p>the problem with democracy here in singapore.......... is it's
                          simply a facist form of liberalism. people claim to be liberals ,
                          democrats so long as the other side follows lol.  </p>
              <p>once they don't get their way the other side must be evil.
                           like how you perceive the world in an 80s cartoon.</p>
              <p>I appreciate it when politicians do that to brainwash people.
                          but the average person? plain dumb? dropped as a kid?</p>

              <p>oooohhh.. now you wanna rope in your whole CLAN and supporters...I am shaking in fear...</p>
              <p>Well actually no... you see.. it doesnt matter how many clan members you show my post to..... what they say has no effect nor does it in-validate on my opinion.</p>
              <p>Here's why... because it's their job to SUPPORT you the fool.. no matter what you say or do...right or wrong... they have the <strong>fiduciary duty</strong> to back you up. That's what friends do, and that's what family do.</p>
              <p>So yah... go ahead.... and show it to everyone you know... their answer will be.. " oh she's crazy dude.. just ignore her... why get all worked up ? not worth it de"... right ?</p>
              <p>Well.. that's what I'd do to my friend too... even tho in my heart.. I think the other party is right.. and my friend is nuts.</p>
              <p>Because when my friend come ask me for support.. I know they really just need to feel validated... so they feel good about themselves... now why would I deprive them of that.... it will be just cruel.. especially to a stubborn old man like you.</p>
              <p>So there there... go live in your little bubble.... Mr right.. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>However, the China government is very generous with pensions and retirement safety nets... thats why they are not too worried about the one child policy.</p>
              <p>So her main concern is that it's already difficult for her son to find a good wife.. because the ratio of men out numbers the women....</p>

              <p>eh, how old are you really. It's quite strenuous to explain
              things to a child pretending to know adult stuff.</p>
              <p>Actually, most part of your post is BS. I really don't know what
              you have been taught.. perhaps by your very selfish parents.</p>
              <p>A parent who uses their children as retirement insurance is
              SELFISH.</p>
              <p>I am a working adult... and I am socking away a lot of money for
              my reitrement. I have no intention at all to rely on my children to
              take care of me when I am old.</p>
              <p>If they do stay close by for my sake.. well.. that will be
              because they WANT to.. not because they HAVE to.. and I will be
              grateful for that.</p>
              <p>The true teaching of Filial piety is a two way street.. along
              the generations... self serving parents exploited this teaching and
              distorted it for their own convenience...get yourself properly
              educated please.</p>
              <p>Not only am I planning for my retirement.. I am also putting
              money away for my children to send them to top schools..so they may
              acquire skill/knowledge/ability to take care of themselves when I
              can no longer take care of them. And at the mean time.. I am
              spending a lot of money on my children to make sure they are living
              a comfortable life.</p>
              <p>Do I expect them to take care of their children, yes . Do I
              expect them to rely on my grandchildren to take care of them ?
              Hopefully NOT.</p>
              <p>"<em>How about those who did not have children? They are relying
              on OTHER PEOPLE children to support. other people children will
              have to work very very hard, pay a lot lot of tax to pay for the
              hospital, doctor, nursing home, etc of the previous
              generation."</em></p>
              <p>This you have mentioned... is a PONZI scheme. Google it.. if you
              dont' know what it means.</p>
              <p>It will never work.. and it is the MAIN reason why we have HUGE
              INFLUX of immigrants.. which our govt has used to justify their
              open leg policy.</p>
              <p>You have been brain washed.. fool.</p>
              <p>If your reason for stimatising women is based on your stupid
              fear of them being a freaking burden, then you can shut up now...
              it's rubbish in rubbish out.</p>
              <p><em>"INSTEAD. we COMPLAIN when people go for maternity leave.
              AIYA must fill in for their duties, NOT FAIR."</em></p>
              <p>Again, you are stabbing yourself in your own feet. Obviously you
              are just merely a student with obsolutely ZERO working experience.
              And you have ZERO appreciation for what your parents had to do for
              you... to raised you into the idiot that you are pounding away
              mindlessly on the keyboard.</p>
              <p>When I was a single working female, I was glad I didn't hav to
              deal with the "difficult  family life most of my female
              married co-workers had to live with. The pressure and many "family
              emergencies"...goosh... I told myself maybe I'll stay single
              forever.</p>
              <p>A working mother takes a LOT of leave days... not only during
              and after pregnancy... also along the way till their children
              attain adulthood.</p>
              <p>Children get sick very easily...whenever they get sick.. parents
              take time off.. and when they need to go see doctor for maintenance
              checkup.. someone has to bring them there.... and when the school
              call.. we have to be there... when the school got holidays... who
              take care of you ?</p>
              <p>So single women with no children are actually MORE productive
              than a single man with NS obligation... If you are too stupid to
              understand this.. you should climb back into your mother's womb
              forever.</p>
              <p> "SO all I am saying is. We should tell the truth.
              <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">which is woman
              without children are SELFISH. and should be stigmatised that
              way."</span></strong></p>
              <p>Now if you insist .. sure.. why don't we make sure ALL women no
              need to work.. if they no need to contribute to the working
              society..because they don't have to worry about paying their bills
                   and their SOLE responsibility is to be a
              INCUBATOR.... OK.. shame them if they don't produce babies. Since
              having babies become the SOLE purpose for their existence.. yes ?
              Feasible.</p>
              <p>Now in order for that to work... we need the government to issue
              all women who hit puberty (child bearing age)  with a
              monthly  stipend , sufficient to let women enjoy an acceptable
              standard of living... so they need not rely on individual men nor
              themselves to provide for them... rather from a pool paid by
              working men and managed by a centralised agency.......MEn  go
              work... and pay into the resource pool to be distributed equally to
              the women.  Do you agree with this idea ???</p>
              <p>But YOU AS A GUY.. dare to complain when a woman doesn't want
              babies.. when YOU are UNABLE TO BE PREGNANT... and you are unable
              to SUPPORT/provide for  your girlfriend or wife without her
              going to work and bringing home the dough...now that's a shame
              isn't it... shame on you dude.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;"> All I am saying is...
              currently our women need to go work to help pay the bills , give
              birth, raise babies, take care of family, be faithful..make you
              feel like a real man.... do you want them to wipe your ass for you
              too ?</span></p>
