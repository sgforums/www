              <p>as for equal rights when you're advocating an unequal situation,

              <p>it would be easier to pass off as equal rights for all

              <p>The root cause of such culture.. is related to your demand and supply theory.</p>
              <p>It is simply because there isn't enough attractive, desirable and family friendly males around , that's why a male who is such is able to be lofty.</p>
              <p>Now , if the supply of attractive, desirable and family friendly males... becomes the majority.... the ratio of women wanting to marry such men will be more balanced.</p>
              <p>Hence I advocate raising the QUALITY of our boys... so as to help encourage more couples to be created.</p>

              <p>don't be a dick and always start with nonsensical statements you
              know the other side don't subcribe to.</p>
              <p>obviously not all marriages are the results of a "good " choice.
              sometimes good mariages arise from bad choices, others end up badly
              even though both sides made a "good" choice.</p>
              <p>what we have here is a political system that decides
              good/acceptable versus bad/unacceptable and then 
              systematically rewards those who participates.</p>
              <p>not personal moral values.</p>
              <p>just like I personally don't give a shit whether gays are
              married or not, just don't force it down my throat and proclaim in
              the name of freedom I must support you.</p>
              <p>but obviously the govt does. hence 377A</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but yes as a single mother you get "punished" for your choice. .
              like you get "punished" for all other wrong choices in your
              life.</p>
              <p>women who married lousy men are already punished for their
              choices. as for all mothers should be treated the same. nope
              sorry</p>
              <p>I'll still disagree. like as mentioned. I believe they should
              have housing covered and the chance to provide necessities. beyond
              that you are punishing the rest who made the "correct" choice in
              the govt's eyes</p>

              <p>Govt eyes ? Govt not my lao peh.</p>
              <p>You think married women see it as a punishment if Single mothers get what we get ? That's rubbish.</p>
              <p>Getting married is our personal lifestyle choice... and the "reward" is not what compels us to get married anyway...</p>
              <p>We only see it as govt ploy to make life HARDER for single women because they choose to have babies without the legal liabilities of an irresponsible man.</p>

              <p>don't do that, please. there's a difference between pro-choice.
              and people who want a get out of jail free card.</p>
              <p>being pro-choice means you're allowed to make your own choices.
              it doesn't mean the rest of us have to be supportive. at the end of
              the day it's to do with personal choice. the law allows it. unlike
              euthanasia.</p>
              <p>there will always be people who support single mothers, likewise
              people who don't.. others like me who are neutral. <br> there are contraceptives. this is not the 16th century where people
              are using fish skin. either you make the guy wear something, pop a
              pill or go for a vasectomy</p>
              <p>don't screw up and blame the rest of us when society as a whole
              will always go for a conservative choice.</p>
              <p>there's isn't that many situations where a lady or a very young
              girl ends up single and with a child.  and how many do you
              think ends up with public sympathy?</p>

              <p>So how do you propose we should argue a liberal cause to he general public ?</p>
              <p>Maybe all liberal ideas should be shunt under the carpet ?</p>
              <p>How can we, as a progressive nation.. move away from oppression and obsolete conservatism so we may head towards a more liberated existence ?</p>

              <p>It's kinda obvious you havn't had a serious relationship
                  yet.</p>
              <p>Do you think an unmarried couple cannot enjoy sex and emotional
                  satisfaction ?</p>
              <p>Sex, companionship, emotional satisfaction does not increase or
                  decrease after marriage.</p>
              <p>The question here is... why is marriage so special. What does it
                  provide, that a unmarried relationship cannot provide ? The answer
                  is only.. Legal status.</p>
              <p>The promise of exclusivity. Which can be easily broken in our
                  current society, doesnt work anymore.. and we ALL know that.</p>
              <p>As for NS.. I had in my many previous posts.. mentioned that NS
                  is an obsolete requirement. I think it's now just a reform exercise
                  to train our boys to become more obedient for easier control.</p>
              <p>I always questioned.. why do we need so many years of NS ? Other
                  countries only need 1 year. Is it because our boys are dumb and
                  need more time compared to other countries ?</p>

              unless by that you mean having more than one family?"</p>
              <p>The root cause of such culture.. is related to your demand and
              supply theory.</p>
              <p>It is simply because there isn't enough attractive, desirable
              and family friendly males around , that's why a male who is such is
              able to be lofty.</p>
              <p>Now , if the supply of attractive, desirable and family friendly
              males... becomes the majority.... the ratio of women wanting to
              marry such men will be more balanced.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>And if such a supply of men were to be avaliable, I doubt they'll marry local women.</p>
              <p>your ideal men seem more like what I can find in female soft core fiction. "the alpha male conquered by the female protagonist through true love"</p>
              <p>Again I must state, should a man become attractive and desirable, the last thing he would do is to start a family.  it's more likely he'll contribute to the growing numbers of single mothers.</p>
              <p>at last count, women already outnumber men. and men far outstrips women in numbers when it comes to marrying foreigners.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>unless women are so desirable here that men have no choice but to helplessly turn themselves into soft core porn novel versions just to get one; where supply and demand are concerned.</p>

              <p>uh huh.. so you are saying good men don't marry.... only
              loserish, lame , lousy men will marry local girls ? Really ?</p>
              <p>Then I guess single local women are condemned to marrying good
              for nothing local guys.</p>
              <p>No wonder the single women are staying single !</p>

              <p>nope, I'm saying local women have interesting decisions.</p>
              <p>And good does not equal to attractive and desirable.</p>
              <p>like what happened with my friend's choice of men. I can only warn if I know what's going on. and with relationships, you can't comment too much. </p>
              <p>if you knew that there're warning bells and you still kept quiet and refused to move on then come to me crying that he hurt you...... I really do think you deserve it. </p>
              <p>or marrying a guy you don't like and think is trouble?</p>
              <p>god.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and some of the weird stories I heard.... the guy don't have a job or don't have a well paying job and wants a car..... the GF after kenna poloso decides to finance it for him.</p>
              <p>and ends up crying when she realises she can't keep up with the loans. and if the BF decides to move on to a better target?  obvious GG liao</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all of these stuff happens to guys too.... and we call these guys dumb farks. been there myself and I still feel that I deserve it.</p>

              <p>the only way a single mother can appear is to take a path less

              status quo</p>
              <p>you basically want society to bear the cost of personal choices.
              I do believe in the right to housing but maternity rights , no.</p>

              <p>thing is, assuming there isn't a govt and a couple is living in the wilderness will have no support at all having children might actually threaten their chances of survival.</p>

              <p>when poor couples get married. if they are willing to cut back on certain things and at least one of them (assuming they are good parents) has to find work to support the family and feed the kids. it's actually possible to raise a family with kids with less than 2k total household income. but there'll be a lot less luxuries.</p>
              <p>I came from a single income family, not much spare income but I was well fed, had my own bed. my parents did at least save up to let us go on trips.  pass down clothing and toys. same shirt shared by three kids.</p>
              <p>this was during the stop at 2 era. but my parents felt whether they had kids have nothing to do with the govt and the subsidies.  they just made sure they could afford us.</p>

              <p>Pop comes the baby ? LOL !!!</p>
              <p>If only it is that simple.</p>
              <p>In case you missed biology class... it takes a MAN an a WOMAN to have a baby. THE BABY HAS A FATHER !!!</p>
              <p>Now.. I would totally agree with you if making a baby only require a woman to will it. No man needed.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, thats not the case...</p>
              <p>If
                       the father of the baby actually stepped up and marry that mother.. they
                       would have a CORE unit. Baby before or after.. is irrelevant.  It's a piece of paper, you sign your name on the dotted line.</p>
              <p>The
                       problem here is... the IRRESPONSIBLE man... impregnant that woman... 
                      and decide to ABANDON her.... is that her fault ?Takes two to clap 
                      remember ?</p>
              <p>It is NO different from a man divorcing a wife and 
                      left the children with her... the only difference is..she cannot shove 
                      the kids back inside her womb and decide if she wants to keep them there
                       or kill them.</p>
              <p>While a pregnant single mother have to make a 
                      decision between KILLING her child in-vitro or giving him/her LIFE "pop 
                      them out" . The man.. simply .. take off.,, pretend nothing happend.. if
                       she decides to keep that baby... she takes FULL responsibility and then
                       more. That's the<strong> sick culture </strong>we have now.</p>
              <p>I think it's about time these irresponsible men take responsibility. If a man impregnate a woman.. he is <strong>automatically</strong> the LEGAL Husband and should be treated like one in govt eyes. The mother will become legally a married woman.</p>
              <p>If
                       a man get a woman pregnant... that's their marriage certificate.  If 
                      either of them do not want to continue the marriage.. they file for 
                      divorce later. And the mother becomes legally a divorced woman.</p>
              <p>So marital status is established upon conception or DNA paternity confirmation.</p>
              <p>So if a man don';t want to be a husband.. he shouldn't shoot sperm inside a vagina. It's THAT simple.</p>

              <p>Do you give your money to the bank.. and let the bank decide HOW and WHEN you are allowed to use your money ? I don;t think so...</p>
              <p>So why are you letting the treasury aka Govt... dictate your life for you , using TAX PAYERS money ????</p>
              <p>I don't mind Govt "rewarding" good couples.... as long as they use THEIR own pocket money....like from a  Private Charity. Call it an "award" from THe Core Unit Encouragement FUnd, funded by private entities.</p>
              <p>If they want to play favourites... DON"T TOUCH OUR MONEY. </p>

              <p>A single mother does not have more rights... and I never advocate them getting more than a married mother... I have made myself very very clear that they should be given EQUAL rights AS A MOTHER.</p>
              <p>Yet you keep harping on MARITAL STATUS.</p>
              <p>What is the difference between a DIVORCED single mother.. vs  a Unmarried single mother ???  Oh.. i guess one had a man willing to marry her but left her... and the other had a man who refused to marry her and left her....</p>
              <p>Do you really believe more women will jump in the marital wagon simply becuase of the Govt"Rewards"... that's an outright <strong>insult </strong>to women folks.</p>
              <p>We arn't gonna die if we don't get it , understand ?And no we won't say no to men when they propose just becase the Govt decided to stop giving it...</p>
              <p>Worst is if we know the reward was at the expense of someone else who needs it. Then no.. we really DONT want it.</p>

              <p>Jump through hoops ??? Old man... are you getting everything all muddled up.</p>
              <p>It is current GOVT policy that's making it harder for couples.. nothing to do with single mothers.</p>
              <p>Why are you punishing single mothers for the bad shit our incompetent government is imposing on couples ?????</p>
              <p>Oh wait.. are you saying that ... single mothers had it easy.. as she does not have to jump through hoops like married couples ????? What the.... seriously.. dude... are you getting senile... surely you are not that old yet.</p>

              <p>Pop comes the baby ? LOL !!!</p>
              <p>If only it is that simple.</p>
              <p>In case you missed biology class... it takes a MAN an a WOMAN to
              have a baby. THE BABY HAS A FATHER !!!</p>
              <p>Now.. I would totally agree with you if making a baby only
              require a woman to will it. No man needed.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, thats not the case...</p>
              <p>If the father of the baby actually stepped up and marry that
              mother.. they would have a CORE unit. Baby before or after.. is
              irrelevant.  It's a piece of paper, you sign your name on the
              dotted line.</p>
              <p>The problem here is... the IRRESPONSIBLE man... impregnant that
              woman... and decide to ABANDON her.... is that her fault ?Takes two
              to clap remember ?</p>
              <p>It is NO different from a man divorcing a wife and left the
              children with her... the only difference is..she cannot shove the
              kids back inside her womb and decide if she wants to keep them
              there or kill them.</p>
              <p>While a pregnant single mother have to make a decision between
              KILLING her child in-vitro or giving him/her LIFE "pop them out" .
              The man.. simply .. take off.,, pretend nothing happend.. if she
              decides to keep that baby... she takes FULL responsibility and then
              more. That's the <strong>sick culture</strong> we have now.</p>
              <p>I think it's about time these irresponsible men take
              responsibility. If a man impregnate a woman.. he is
              <strong>automatically</strong> the LEGAL Husband and should be
              treated like one in govt eyes. The mother will become legally a
              married woman.</p>
              <p>If a man get a woman pregnant... that's their marriage
              certificate.  If either of them do not want to continue the
              marriage.. they file for divorce later. And the mother becomes
              legally a divorced woman.</p>
              <p>So marital status is established upon conception or DNA
              paternity confirmation.</p>
              <p>So if a man don';t want to be a husband.. he shouldn't shoot
              sperm inside a vagina. It's THAT simple.</p>

              <p>which is why I am very supportive of punishing people by law should they try stuns like these. as stated earlier.  I'm against people abanddoning their own offsprings.</p>
              <p>you keep bringing this up like for? to show that you're crazy? can't read? I'm the govt and you want to vent your anger on me?</p>
              <p>any logical explainations?</p>
              <p>and yes if you still don't know by now, marriage in singapore means you are legally registered.</p>
              <p>if someone makes you pregnant, that makes him a father and you a mother of that particular child should you choose to give birth to him/her. </p>
              <p>not married. </p>
              <p>Unmarried couples, like you said, it takes two hands to clap, if the girl sees that the guy isn't using protection and decides she's not using any either. what? hang the guy?</p>
              <p>both side are irresponsible. </p>
              <p>the <strong>sick culture</strong> we have actually hurts men more, but if you don't do anything legally the men gets off. simple as that. </p>
              <p>how about the guys who get married, caught the wives red handed in bed with someone else, or when the babies came out they look really different, as in different col skin from the parents. then have to pay alimony. why? because the judges say, sorry lah no choice cos law says so. </p>
              <p>if you're unmarried and didn't use protection, hard luck. but you can still claim child care IF you have decided to let the child come into this world.</p>
              <p>if married you are legally allowed to claim alimony AND childcare.</p>
              <p>IF you farking decided to do it alone. the fark do you want to claim? you stepped into a hole totally planned, and let society pay the bill?</p>

              <p>I ..... after reading this, think you have no idea how many women in singapore don't want to become wives yet want to have men shoot sperm inside.</p>

              <p>that's why you actually get to vote and his official title isn't emperor. I've never met him, can't say I loved, him doubt he's running my life. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and the payment thing, depends on where your  " she" thinks where her money is going. police force? army? other govt services? what if the money for the maternal benefits don't come from her taxes?</p>
              <p>what? pay GST and you want their lives? what about workfare bonuses? why's there an age limit? I pay taxes too! the hell I paid income taxes! so if I don't get married I don't enjoy anything! </p>
              <p>........ ah... and apparently even if you're a responsible man and not abbandon your women , both of you won't get to use the benefits as long as you're <strong>NOT</strong> legally married.</p>
