              <p>I was watching this Indian movie called <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240200/">Water which is about widows in India</a> and it gave me a super good idea on how to increase our birthrate in Singapore. We need to stigmatize the whole idea of single women and women not having kids. You see, in India, widows are treated so badly by society: they have to shave head bald, cannot wear colourful clothes, usually abandoned by their families, force to beg or prostitute themselves to survive, etc. See some picture here:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2006/may2006/saral.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NBmMeQ1fKSk/SeKBCLCGX0I/AAAAAAAAAD0/4f0M2Mkvnk4/s320/widow.jpg" alt=""></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.wunrn.com/news/2009/02_09/02_09_09/020909_widows2_files/image001.jpg" alt=""> So my idea is simple, the end state is where society treats single and women without children so badly that everybody wants to have children just to avoid that treatment.</p>
              <p>Any women who is above the age of 30 and not married: shave head bald</p>
              <p>Any women above age of 35 and no kids: cannot wear colour clothes</p>
              <p>Any women above age of 40 and still no kids: abandon by family and force to beg or prostitute to survive.</p>
              <p>So how do we get to this state? Simple, progressive social engineering, You see, if Hitler can get a whole Germany to be like holocaust, I am sure Singapore can do this too since it is so much smaller scale.</p>
              <p>Maybe start with some subtle campaigns to cast unmarried women or women without kids as selfish, then slowly progress from that.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think???</p>

It will also be leaving an indelible err and trauma for the future society and future daughters to be.  There is no issue on birth rate as the Malay communities have been doing finely. Most parents or granny era has no such issue as the politic support the peace loving of its people through kind, wise education and promote community bounding of love and gracious society.

              <p>hi jojobeach. thank you for your discussion.</p>
              <p>As a society, we already do stigmatise men who refuse to take care of their baby and ask gf to abort. we call them bastards, etc etc. they are seen as selfish and evil.</p>
              <p>so this is exactly what I am saying. we should stigmatise women who don't have children in the same way.</p>

              Really. Hmm...then they know its a joke you are trying to pull. Hmmm...lets say you forward this to the Singapore Conversation forum or Yahoo Singapore or the Straits Times Forum you think you would get the support for your idea? I think if your idea is forwarded to Sg Coversation or Yahoo Singapore you will get alot of exposure, like good and bad remarks..like the LETTER TO SINGAPORE by Zing...then SG FORUM will be very famous. Admit it you are joking right to have some fun or else why not try your suggestion to the general public in the mass media in Singapore....you want to know right whether this suggestion of yours is worthy to improve the birth rate in Singapore. You have some flaw in this suggestion though...you forgotten about the men who are singles or not fertile or impotent.
