              <p>I think you have a very skewed idea of what Fillial Piety
              is...your "culture" probably taught you the lopsided/distorted
              form... and because you don't know any better.. you accepted it and
              that distorted idea became part of your belief.</p>
              <p>Fillial piety is a natural flow of love and respect between
              parents and children.</p>
              <p>It doesn't have to be guilt pounded into the child, nor needed
              any laws to MAKE children be fillial.</p>
              <p>PROVIDED... the parents earnd that love and respect.. because
              the child came from the parent.. the parent is the beginning....the
              starting line...</p>
              <p>After the child become adult... the child out of love and
              respect... give back the love and respect his/her parent showered
              them during the growing up process...</p>
              <p>What confucious had in mind back then.. wasnt a law... it was
              meant as a GUIDE on how to carry out fillial piety. He was a
              TEACHER... not a law maker.</p>
              <p>If your parents took great care.. and love you earned your
              respect... NATURALLY.. you will WANT to treat them well during
              their vulnerable years....</p>
              <p>In a perfect world ( assuming)... children are naturally
              loving... we love our parents who loved us... even if Confucious
              never existed... children would have done the same anyway.</p>
              <p>So, I NEVER say you should not be filial... I am just saying if
              my children treats me well.. it's because they WANT to.. not
              because they HAVE to.</p>
              <p>If you force a child to give... is that the child's will.. or is
              it your will ? It's your will.. and you simply MANIPULATED the
              child into giving. So we cannot say the child is loving..because it
              was never his idea.</p>
              <p>I ascibe to a NATURAL version of fillial piety... You probably..
              in your "CULTURE" ascribed to a FORCED version of fillial piety....
              So we shall agree to disagree on this topic.</p>

              <p>Do you know there is such a thing as an unfillial PARENT ? Does unfillial Parent deserves fillial piety from their children ? ABSOLUTELY NOT..if the child wants to be fillial anyway.. it's a gift.. to the unfillial parent. </p>
              <p>Fillial piety is a GIFT to the parent .....NOT an entitlement.</p>

              <p>her character is what led to the current situation. cutting parents out of her life would be too extreme in her case. likely hurting her more. </p>
              <p>most situations like these tend to arise because the "victim" is unwilling to take proactive steps to resolve the problem. somethings are "inborn" or what I felt was drummed into the person as a child. </p>
              <p>and I think you're referring to unloving or uncaring parents..... unfilial implies they in turn didn't treat their parents well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one thing about these situations I've seen /experienced. particularly from ladies is they tend to "enjoy" playing the role of victims. given two choices they would choose the more f*** up one to show they care about their own family. some of which made no sense at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> particular incidents stood out in my memory, a young lady (young at that point) broke up with the boyfriend, because he had to do ot as an outdoor salesman. reason being they don't see each other that much and she's doing for his good so he could concentrate on his career. the guy protested of course, he claims it's not like they don't love each other or he's unfaithful and he's actually working towards their future</p>
              <p>then I recalled......."I thought you live with each other? don't you see each other everynight?"</p>
              <p>"it's not the same as going out. it's for everyone's good"</p>
              <p>and it totally blew my mind to combine the facts with the actual situation of her crying her heart out so pitifully(I was really young then, didn't realise for the next decade.... they generally tend to behave this way)</p>
              <p>another one when I got used to this behavior.... there was a lady who kept pumping money towards her parents' upkeep and housing(flat wasn't paid for) her (older)brother doesn't work,hardly works. and her husband's pissed with this but she insisted on paying in the name of fillial piety. yet complained if her parents were to pass away the flat despite her being the one paying would be given to her brother. her parents prefer boys that sort of thing. best outcome is the parents share 50% between the kids. </p>
              <p>I told her, make a choice and be happy with it, your parents happy with your brother and you suffering with it. OR suffering together but your wallet suffers less.  you don't have to be happy with your choice , just accept it as the one you made. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>her parents aren't "evil" or  your types of "unfillial parents"</p>
              <p>they'll get around to accepting their daughter has a family of her own now. but it's the daughter who can't let go. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but really rather then cutting off the parents she should access whether she belongs to that type, and then whether her parents truly require that much from her. </p>
              <p>if her parents felt that they have to scale down they would, in her own words, it's the moral blackmail she can't take. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> I observe the belief that like it or not my parents brought me into this world. and by that, I owe a debt of fillial piety. (a view I think you disagree with) my parents weren't shitty towards me so I guess it helps. I noticed that came up often in your arguements against east asian fillial piety. anyway, another thing that I noticed , the older generation..... were extremely fillial especially the ones who were horrible to their children. . daughters seem to care and forgave more compared to sons. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yet when newer values come from the west in the name of empowerment of the individual. I also understand if I were to have children they would likely subscribe to this view.  love or not if they don't succeed in life the parents would become a burden they can dispose off easily. quite a few I talked to told me why they still work in low end jobs is because they know times are hard and they don't want to increase the burden on their kids. </p>

              <p>culturally and socially there are certain norms to observe. and unless you really have really really horrible parents who tried to murder you. it is expected that you take care of your parents even if they were shitty. because they did bring you up. yes it's actually expected. labeled under fillial "piety"</p>
              <p>don't believe me? try to mouth your views in the "states times" with your pictures and see how that affects your life and how people view you.  no matter how fillial you are , views like that instantly paint you as an evil selfish unfillial bitch. and no number of picture of you feeding your parents would help. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yes, if it haven't occured to you by now, some things come with living in a society. and the issue is with your crackpot advice. not your fillialness towards your parents. </p>
              <p> your advice to every situation is to "confront and fight it out" "not happy f*** off lah" do you actually do that in real life as well?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've been there and I can tell you, with most things it's best to find a common ground to talk things out. confrontation and cutting off hurts everyone and makes enemies. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but personally I'm not quite sure if I was ever <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">indoctrinate, I seem to disagree with my parents over everything except for religion. then again my parents were free thinkers. </span></p>

              <p>another one when I got used to this behavior.... there was a
              lady who kept pumping money towards her parents' upkeep and
              housing(flat wasn't paid for) her (older)brother doesn't
              work,hardly works. and her husband's pissed with this but she
              insisted on paying in the name of fillial piety. yet complained if
              her parents were to pass away the flat despite her being the one
              paying would be given to her brother. her parents prefer boys that
              sort of thing. best outcome is the parents share 50% between the
              kids. </p>
              <p>I told her, make a choice and be happy with it, your parents
              happy with your brother and you suffering with it. OR suffering
              together but your wallet suffers less.  you don't have to be
              happy with your choice , just accept it as the one you
              made. </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>but really rather then cutting off the parents she should access
              whether she belongs to that type, and then whether her parents
              truly require that much from her. </p>
              <p>if her parents felt that they have to scale down they would, in

              brought me into this world. and by that, I owe a debt of fillial

              thing that I noticed , the older generation..... were extremely

              <p>her character is what led to the current situation. cutting
              parents out of her life would be too extreme in her case. likely
              hurting her more. </p>
              <p>most situations like these tend to arise because the "victim" is
              unwilling to take proactive steps to resolve the problem.
              somethings are "inborn" or what I felt was drummed into the person
              as a child. </p>
              <p>and I think you're referring to unloving or uncaring
              parents..... unfilial implies they in turn didn't treat their
              parents well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one thing about these situations I've seen /experienced.
              particularly from ladies is they tend to "enjoy" playing the role
              of victims. given two choices they would choose the more f*** up
              one to show they care about their own family. some of which made no
              sense at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> particular incidents stood out in my memory, a young lady
              (young at that point) broke up with the boyfriend, because he had
              to do ot as an outdoor salesman. reason being they don't see each
              other that much and she's doing for his good so he could
              concentrate on his career. the guy protested of course, he claims
              it's not like they don't love each other or he's unfaithful and
              he's actually working towards their future</p>
              <p>then I recalled......."I thought you live with each other? don't
              you see each other everynight?"</p>
              <p>"it's not the same as going out. it's for everyone's good"</p>
              <p>and it totally blew my mind to combine the facts with the actual
              situation of her crying her heart out so pitifully(I was really
              young then, didn't realise for the next decade.... they generally
              tend to behave this way)</p>
              <p>another one when I got used to this behavior.... there was a

              But if taxi driver say it, then it is not correct. right?</p>
              <p>huh?</p>

              <p>Actually you are right... Words from Taxi Drivers do NOT carry more <strong>weight</strong> than LKY.</p>
              <p>If LKY say you die... it means you die.</p>
              <p>If Unker taxi driver say you die... you laugh at him.</p>
              <p>You dont seem so stupid afterall.... smart boi.</p>
              <p>So OMGWTF.... now I know you just acting stupid for the attention.</p>

              <p>and in case you haven't realised this, people without kids are more rational when it comes to dealing with them. especially those not belonging to their families</p>

              <p>actually by anyone's logic.... at least on the outside, LKY makes it correct when he says it.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry to intrude. But the idea is totally sexist. Singapore is not a dictatorial country like back in nazi germany. Plus given this day and age, people can voice out, migrate and choose not to vote for the government who implemented this. And the difference between germany under hitler and singapore is that the government does not hold us at gunpoint. We can choose what we want to do and what we don't want to do. We are a democratic nation, excuse you.</div>
