              <p>jojo, of course not. but please try to open your brain a bit to see more path.</p>
              <p>you see, to have children is mostly the woman choice.</p>
              <p>why?</p>
              <p>because the woman body is the one that carry the baby for 9 month and give birth.</p>
              <p>For example, if a guy say, woman, let me put baby in your stomach, when woman say no, bopian. cos woman will think, who is this guy, will he take care of me, got money to take care of me and baby, got money send baby to yale or harvard, got money pay for international school, can he afford condo or landed property, etc etc...</p>
              <p>on the other hand. if woman say boy... come put sperm in me... most guys will say... OK!</p>
              <p>or should I say,  if woman want baby, they can also just go sperm bank and ejaculate into themself.</p>

              <p>If you are truly pro-choice.. then you should accept and respect , not just her decision to abort... You must also respect and accept her decision to NOT abort.</p>

              <p>OK. I can open my "brain".. can you open yours ?</p>
              <p>Good to know you actually agree , that a woman can have a baby
              without being married to a man.</p>
              <p>So this stigmatising women to have babies.. is not exactly about
              marriage.</p>
              <p>It's about having babies , yes ?</p>
              <p>Now , then we should do away with single mother stigmas.</p>
              <p>As long as a woman is willing to have a baby... it doesn't
              matter if she is married or not.</p>
              <p>A child from a single mother is just as important as a child
              from a married mother.</p>
              <p>If you want to argue that child from married family is better
              off... that is rubbish.</p>
              <p>As long as a man is not willing to help care for the child...
              with marriage or without marriage.. they are the same. Because
              mothers will be mothers with or without the father.</p>
              <p>Ofcors.. if a single father is willing to care for his child..
              he is no different from a married father.. same logic.</p>
              <p>Marriage is just a status... it's acutally quite meaningless in
              the debate of increasing birth rates.</p>
              <p>What is important is to make sure their bloodlines are properly
              recorded so siblings do not end up having children together.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Women should be encouraged to have babies.. single
              mother or married mother... And as long as our society is willing
              to provide adequate support and acceptance... it can be done.</p>

              <p>What I am saying is relevant what.. Can't u just connect the dots ?</p>
              <p>Women are built to have babies. We want to nurture something. It's in our DNA to want to grow something in our womb . I mean babies, not just fibroids and polyps.</p>
              <p>Yes, a lot of single women want to have a baby. But, they couldn't find a suitable man good enough to get married to.  </p>
              <p>If they don't want babies, then why get married ? For a HDB ? Get real lah.</p>
              <p>Given our society's anti single mother stance, no woman wants to be disafvantaged, so they choose to not have a baby and remain single, instead of a baby, they get a pet. Let their womb self-destruct over time.</p>
              <p>Now, if u remove the social stigma and provide single women with equal rights as a married woman, then a lot of women will be having babies on their own.  Birth rate confirm go up. </p>
              <p>The other alternative is, as I mentioned before... Guys need to become more attractive , desirable.. , and family friendly. Right now, our boys are NOT family friendly at all. </p>

              <p>Women are built to have babies. We want to nurture something.
              It's in our DNA to want to grow something in our womb . I mean
              babies, not just fibroids and polyps.</p>
              <p>Yes, a lot of single women want to have a baby. But, they
              couldn't find a suitable man good enough to get married to.
               </p>
              <p>If they don't want babies, then why get married ? For a HDB ?
              Get real lah.</p>
              <p>Given our society's anti single mother stance, no woman wants to
              be disafvantaged, so they choose to not have a baby and remain
              single, instead of a baby, they get a pet. Let their womb
              self-destruct over time.</p>
              <p>Now, if u remove the social stigma and provide single women with
              equal rights as a married woman, then a lot of women will be having
              babies on their own.  Birth rate confirm go up. </p>
              <p>The other alternative is, as I mentioned before... Guys need to
              become more attractive , desirable.. , and family friendly. Right
              now, our boys are NOT family friendly at all. </p>

              <p>You are assuming that ALL marriage is the result of a "good"
                  choice. In reality, that is not the case. There's good marriage,
                  then theres the mediocre and bad ones.</p>
              <p>To qualify for the "reward" ?</p>
              <p>By depriving the rights given to another person, you are
                  essentially punishing.</p>
              <p>A mother is a mother.. no matter what her marital status is.</p>
              <p>A single mother is no less important than a married mother, so
                  why do we need them to "qualify" for that reward ? They should
                  automatically qualify the moment she is pregnant.</p>
              <p>Punish for her life choices... ? Then should we also punish
                  those women who married lousy men  ? I think its about time..
                  we stop "punishing". Because punishing is just a tool of
                  manipulation to favor one side.</p>
              <p><strong>ALL mothers should be treated the same</strong>. Married

              <p>don't be a dick and always start with nonsensical statements you know the other side don't subcribe to.</p>
              <p>obviously not all marriages are the results of a "good " choice. sometimes good mariages arise from bad choices, others end up badly even though both sides made a "good" choice.</p>
              <p>what we have here is a political system that decides good/acceptable versus bad/unacceptable and then  systematically rewards those who participates.</p>
              <p>not personal moral values.</p>
              <p>just like I personally don't give a shit whether gays are married or not, just don't force it down my throat and proclaim in the name of freedom I must support you.</p>
              <p>but obviously the govt does. hence 377A</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but yes as a single mother you get "punished" for your choice. . like you get "punished" for all other wrong choices in your life.</p>
              <p>women who married lousy men are already punished for their choices. as for all mothers should be treated the same. nope sorry</p>
              <p>I'll still disagree. like as mentioned. I believe they should have housing covered and the chance to provide necessities. beyond that you are punishing the rest who made the "correct" choice in the govt's eyes</p>

              <p>being pro-choice means you're allowed to make your own choices. it doesn't mean the rest of us have to be supportive. at the end of the day it's to do with personal choice. the law allows it. unlike euthanasia.</p>
              <p>there will always be people who support single mothers, likewise people who don't.. others like me who are neutral.  <br>there are contraceptives. this is not the 16th century where people are using fish skin. either you make the guy wear something, pop a pill or go for a vasectomy</p>
              <p>don't screw up and blame the rest of us when society as a whole will always go for a conservative choice.</p>
              <p>there's isn't that many situations where a lady or a very young girl ends up single and with a child.  and how many do you think ends up with public sympathy?</p>

              babies, not just fibroids and polyps.</p>
              <p>Yes, a lot of single women want to have a baby. But, they
              couldn't find a suitable man good enough to get married to.
               </p>
              <p>If they don't want babies, then why get married ? For a HDB ?
              Get real lah.</p>
              <p>Given our society's anti single mother stance, no woman wants to
              be disafvantaged, so they choose to not have a baby and remain
              single, instead of a baby, they get a pet. Let their womb
              self-destruct over time.</p>
              <p>Now, if u remove the social stigma and provide single women with
              equal rights as a married woman, then a lot of women will be having
              babies on their own.  Birth rate confirm go up. </p>
              <p>The other alternative is, as I mentioned before... Guys need to
              become more attractive , desirable.. , and family friendly. Right
              now, our boys are NOT family friendly at all. </p>

              <p>the idea itself will be shot down ... even the opposition would not dare to raise it up.  current system , either you do really well and buy private property or wait for 35yrs old to start queuing or share a flat with your parents.</p>
              <p>as for equal rights when you're advocating an unequal situation, highly unlikely.</p>
              <p>it would be easier to pass off as equal rights for all singaporean children, rather then advocate equal rights for mothers..</p>
              <p>our culture lol...... if guys are more attractive, desirable..... usually do not end up being family friendly.  unless by that you mean having more than one family?</p>

              <p>It's kinda obvious you havn't had a serious relationship yet.</p>
              <p>Do you think an unmarried couple cannot enjoy sex and emotional satisfaction ?</p>
              <p>Sex, companionship, emotional satisfaction does not increase or decrease after marriage.</p>
              <p>The question here is... why is marriage so special. What does it provide, that a unmarried relationship cannot provide ? The answer is only.. Legal status.</p>
              <p>The promise of exclusivity. Which can be easily broken in our current society, doesnt work anymore.. and we ALL know that.</p>
              <p>As for NS.. I had in my many previous posts.. mentioned that NS is an obsolete requirement. I think it's now just a reform exercise to train our boys to become more obedient for easier control.</p>
              <p>I always questioned.. why do we need so many years of NS ? Other countries only need 1 year. Is it because our boys are dumb and need more time compared to other countries ?</p>

              <p>Well, the number of women who wish to become single mothers is relative to the number of lousy men .</p>
              <p>More lousy men  = more women wants to be single mothers.</p>
              <p>So if you decrease lousy men, = more married women...simple equation lah.</p>
              <p>And you think by punishing single mothers... all women will flock to the marriage registry with whoever they can grab off the street ? LOL !!! Thats just wishful thinking.</p>
              <p>On the contrary.. many will choose to remain single and no babies.</p>
