              <p>hi jojobeach. thank you for your discussion.</p>
              <p>As a society, we already do stigmatise men who refuse to take
              care of their baby and ask gf to abort. we call them bastards, etc
              etc. they are seen as selfish and evil.</p>
              <p>so this is exactly what I am saying. we should stigmatise women
              who don't have children in the same way.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Well, calling them names doesn't do much. Labeling is useless. Yet, Every year we lost hundreds or thousands to abortion.<span style="-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.292969);  "> They could just marry the girls they impregnate. Problem solved ?</span></p>
              <p>Anyway.. U haven't answer my question, why don't men make themselves more attractive to women, so more women WANT to marry men ? </p>
              <p>Is it so difficult for men to step up and show they are worth their keeps? </p>
              <p>Sure, guys go ahead and stigmatize women, call them names, spit in their face. That's men's prerogative to force women to marry them? How backwards can u be?</p>
              <p>And u forgetting half the world is women, do u expect women to stigmatize ourselves?  U must be nuts. Why don't u cut your own nose Mr. Wong. </p>
              <p>If you are really for having more babies for our society, why not fight for better rights and inclusion for single mothers ? These women were used by men, abandoned and left to fend for themselves , they choose to be pro life, yet they were punished by our society. May I know what will be your solution on this issue?</p>
              <p>Then what about women who Can't have babies? Do u want to stigmatize them too? </p>

              <p><br> Really. Hmm...then they know its a joke you are trying to pull.
              Hmmm...lets say you forward this to the Singapore Conversation
              forum or Yahoo Singapore or the Straits Times Forum you think you
              would get the support for your idea? I think if your idea is
              forwarded to Sg Coversation or Yahoo Singapore you will get alot of
              exposure, like good and bad remarks..like the LETTER TO SINGAPORE
              by Zing...then SG FORUM will be very famous. Admit it you are
              joking right to have some fun or else why not try your suggestion
              to the general public in the mass media in Singapore....you want to
              know right whether this suggestion of yours is worthy to improve
              the birth rate in Singapore. You have some flaw in this suggestion
              though...you forgotten about the men who are singles or not fertile
              or impotent.</p>

              <p>ah zulkifli, thank you for the discussion.</p>
              <p>i admit my idea as in the first post is not 100% serious. and yet i am trying to think from another angle and see if people can see it or not.</p>
              <p>gahmen response to birthrate is always $ incentive. they trying to use fiscal measure like fixing economy like that. i think the fix needs to be social.</p>
              <p>the whole reason for lower birthrate is social dysfunction caused by chase for $. so to try and fix this by using people motivation to chase for $ is self-defeating and a bit disingenious. in fact i would say almost inevitable it will not work.</p>

              <p>jojobeach exactly what i am saying calling them names actually makes a lot of difference. can you imagine if it is ACCEPTED  by society or even ENCOURAGED that men go f*ck every woman and make them pregnant then bochup them?!?!?</p>
              <p>But yet this is what it is in SG society now where woman are ACCEPTED and ENCOURAGED to not marry, not have baby, chase career, chase $.</p>
