              <p>I have to be a parent first  and knowing how they think
                  before practicing fillial piety?</p>
              <p>what happened to your "do it because you love your parents 1
                  page ago?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and in case you haven't realised this, people without kids are
                  more rational when it comes to dealing with them. especially those
                  not belonging to their families</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>based on what you've posted here I say you're both a shitty

              <p>I think you are taking a very narrow minded approach to this topic. Given you are only a CHILD to your parents.. and not being a parent yourself... your view on this subject is ONE sided.. that's from a child point of view ONLY.</p>
              <p>Mine is from a PARENT point of view. When I retire.. where will I want to be, what will I want to do., how do I want to live as a retired PARENT.</p>
              <p>So I think it's important you understand this topic from a DIFFERENT point of view.. not just yours as a child.</p>
              <p>May I ask, HOW would you want to retire ?</p>
              <p>Regards to fillial piety.. all I have to say is this.... fillial piety takes on a whole different meaning the moment you become a parent. Sadly, this is something you as a childless person will never get to understand.</p>

              <p>fillial piety has the same meaning , involving the same things with or without children. the meaning doesn't change. you do feel differently but the meaning does not change.</p>

              <p>We can argue until the cow comes home.. as long as you are stuck in your current mindset and unable to see the world from a different perspective... your expectations will remain as it is..</p>
              <p>It is indeed a shame you choose to not have kids... life takes on a different dimension onces you become a parent. Even my husband realised it.. and he admits that being a parent is a life changing experience.</p>
              <p>Yes, the color of the sky does change .. into different shades and hues.. it is still blue.. but you see different types of blue... that is something you will not get to see until you walked in my shoes.</p>

              <p>Sorry to intrude. But the idea is totally sexist. Singapore is
              not a dictatorial country like back in nazi germany. Plus given
              this day and age, people can voice out, migrate and choose not to
              vote for the government who implemented this. And the difference
              between germany under hitler and singapore is that the government
              does not hold us at gunpoint. We can choose what we want to do and
              what we don’t want to do. We are a democratic nation, excuse
