              <p id="articlecontent"><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has formed a committee to review ministerial salaries. <br><br>The committee will be headed by National Kidney Foundation (NKF) chairman Gerard Ee.<br><br>Prime Minister Lee revealed this in his speech at the swearing-in ceremony of the new Cabinet on Saturday.<br><br>He
               said: "One important area for review is political salaries. We will 
              always need committed and capable ministers. Politics is not a job or a 
              career promotion. It is a calling to serve the larger good of Singapore.
               <br><br>"But ministers should also be paid properly in order that 
              Singapore can have honest, competent leadership over the long term. I 
              know that Singaporeans have genuine concerns over the present salaries. <br><br>"Hence
               I am appointing a committee to review the basis and level of political 
              salaries. The committee will be chaired by Mr Gerard Ee, Chairman of 
              Changi General Hospital and Chairman of NKF."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span> </span></p>

              <p>This is the same guy who approved the increase in transport fee after forming a committee.</p>
              <p>His committee still think the transport company have provided good service even though all of them dun take public transport.</p>
              <p>If the boss is sincere about the pay issue, there is no need to set up a wayang committee.</p>
              <p>The committee will end up with "reasons" to justify the salary using the economic growth as a justification.</p>

              <p><strong>Ministerial salaries review committee to adopt very different model: Gerard Ee</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 22 May 2011 1417 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Chairman of the committee that's undertaking a review of ministerial 
              salaries in Singapore, Mr Gerard Ee said his committee will adopt a very
               different model to assess how much ministers should be paid.<br><br>It will use job specifications of ministers as a starting point.<br><br>Currently,
               the salaries are benchmarked to two thirds of the median income of the 
              top eight earners from six professions such as lawyers, in the private 
              sector. <br><br>Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, Mr Ee said there should also be other points of reference, such as a general wage level.<br><br>This means when the economy goes up or down, the salaries should also have a mechanism to reflect this.<br><br>"The
               big difference is that this (model), you look at the work and you say 
              'for this work, for this skill, for this knowledge in the private 
              sector, how much will you have to pay to have someone perform such a 
              work?'," said Mr Ee.<br><br>"It's a very different model altogether."<br><br>Mr
               Ee said he accepted the role after he was approached by Deputy Prime 
              Minister and Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam less than a week 
              ago.<br><br>The 61-year-old, who's a familiar face in the charity 
              sector, is Chairman of the National Kidney Foundation and Changi General
               Hospital.<br><br>He was also a former Nominated MP.<br><br>He said his committee will comprise of independent-minded people, who are known to speak their minds.<br><br>He added that they also have the intellect to tackle such a major task.<br><br>Mr Ee said the committee will need to collect a lot of data involving experts in human resource.<br><br>It will come up with recommendations that still need to be robustly debated in Parliament.<br><br>Mr Ee added that the committee will not rush matters.<br><br>However, any changes to the salary scales will take effect retrospectively from the day the ministers were sworn in. <br><br>"You can expect, that in all probability it will be a cut," added Mr Ee. <br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
