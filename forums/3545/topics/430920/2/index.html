              <p><strong>Singapore to cut huge salaries of President and Cabinet</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 22 May 2011 1740 hr</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The Prime
               Minister's Office (PMO) has spelt out the terms of reference for the 
              review of salaries for the President and political appointment holders. 
               <br><br>It issued a statement on Sunday, a day after Prime Minister Lee
               Hsien Loong announced the formation of a committee to review political 
              salaries.<br><br>The PMO statement said the review will cover the 
              President, Prime Minister, political appointment holders and Members of 
              Parliament (MPs).  <br><br>The committee's terms of reference will be to
               review the basis and level of salaries "to help ensure honest and 
              competent government".<br><br>The committee should take into account 
              salaries of comparable jobs in the private sector and also other 
              reference points such as the general wage levels in Singapore.<br><br>The statement added: "The committee should also take into account the following guidelines:<br><br>a.
               while the salary of the President should reflect the President's high 
              status as the head of state and his critical custodial role as holder of
               the second key, it should also take into account the fact that unlike 
              the Prime Minister he does not have direct executive responsibilities 
              except as they relate to his custodial role;<br><br>b. the salary of 
              ministers should have a significant discount to comparable 
              private-sector salaries to signify the value and ethos of political 
              service." <br><br>The government will base its new salaries on these recommendations.<br><br>Prime
               Minister Lee has decided that the new salaries will take effect from 
              the day the new government took office, which is 21 May. <br><br>As for the President's salary, the statement said it will commence from the new term of the President.<br><br>However President S R Nathan has informed Prime Minister Lee that he, too, will adopt the new salary from 21 May.<br><br>Singapore
               ministers are among the highest paid in the world. Their salaries are 
              currently pegged to two-thirds of the median salary of the top eight 
              earners in six professions in the private sector. <br><br>This meant 
              ministers' pay could still rise despite economic recessions, stoking 
              public anger as the income gap between rich and poor Singaporeans 
              widened through the years.<br><br>Singapore has long justified the 
              salaries as necessary to attract talent and prevent corruption but they 
              became one of the hottest issues in the May 7 General Election.<br><br>At
               the swearing-in ceremony for the new Cabinet on Saturday, Prime 
              Minister Lee said that "politics is not a job or a career promotion" but
               "a calling to serve the larger good of Singapore". He noted that 
              Singaporeans have genuine concerns over the present ministerial 
              salaries.<br><br>"Hence I am appointing a committee to review the basis 
              and level of political salaries. The committee will be chaired by Mr 
              Gerard Ee, Chairman of Changi General Hospital and Chairman of NKF," he 
              said. <br><br>"The inclination, obviously, once the PM says to reflect 
              the ethos and values of the political appointments, you can expect that 
              in all probability it (salary) would be a cut," said Mr Ee on Sunday.<br><br>Together
               with Mr Ee, the committee will have eight members from the private 
              sector, labour movement and social sector. The seven other members are:<br><br>Mr John De Payva, president of the National Trades Union Congress;<br><br>Ms Fang Ai Lian, chairman of the Charity Council and chairman of Methodist Girls' School Board of Management;<br><br>Mr Stephen Lee Ching Yen, president of Singapore National Employers Federation;<br><br>Mr Po'ad Shaik Abu Bakar Mattar, a member of the Council of Presidential Advisers and a member of the Public Service Commission;<br><br>Mr
               George Quek, founder and chairman of Breadtalk Group Ltd, 
              vice-president of Teochew Poit Ip Huay Kuan, chairman of Xinmin 
              Secondary School Advisory Committee;<br><br>Mr Lucien Wong, managing partner of Allen &amp; Gledhill LLP and chairman of Maritime and Port Authority; and<br><br>Mr
               Wong Ngit Liong, chairman of the National University of Singapore Board
               of Trustees and chairman &amp; CEO of Venture Corporation Limited.<br><br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>Last time, one minister said around $300 per month per person is enough for those under social assistance to survive in Singapore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I hope the committee can take this into account when they formulate ministers' salaries.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The committee needs to ask themselves: does a minister need $1000, $10,000 or $100,000 a month to survive in Singapore? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
