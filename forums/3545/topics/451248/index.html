              <p>the experts still don't get it...</p>
              <p>it is the cause and not the answer to the problems which plague Singapore</p>

              <p>as the pressure mounts due to competition for scarce resources in Singapore, the couples are squeezed if they want to have any children...</p>
              <p>at the moment, in order to have a roof over their heads, citizens are selling their future in order to have some semblance of a life in the present... with the housing prices rising into the sky while the gabrament debates and drags their feet over increasing stagnant wages to keep pace.. all the time inflation is killing everyone, the average couple would have to think about 200 times before they have a child... much less two</p>
              <p>so far, a 4-room HDB (mind you.. it is supposed to be subsidised) in a god-forsakened area on our little island would set one back about $320k? that is if you are fortunate enough to be selected... if you are not, you have to go into the open market (open market for subsidised housing.. now isn't that insane?) and purchase one at over $400k.. if you are lucky... those in nice neighbourhoods are worth about $650k or more.. i've had people quote me 5-room flats (they did not maintain it, it's a wreck) for $800k...</p>
              <p>without the most basic of needs (not wants.. NEEDS), which is priced too insanely high and eats away almost all our CPF (the premise was that it was for our retirement), we are supposed to have a family? when we can't afford one?</p>
              <p>dear politicians and lea-duhs... in the past, you did tell us that you wanted quality and not quantity...</p>
              <p>looks like you forgot... anything to feed the statistical monster which lies and increase the GDP? looks like it...</p>
              <p>and you have sold your country which you have sworn to serve and protect down the river... for a handful of silver...</p>
              <p>it is a wonder the citizens have not come marching up with torches and pitchforks... but if you keep up with the financial, political, social, mental and economic sodomy, don't be surprised if the citizens do...</p>

              <p>The problem here is lky policy of 2 child is enough in the 60 and 70s. Also PAP policy of looking for talent to run singapore and PAP. Education policy in singapore put student like boxes of apples, good and better one in one box bad one in another in the 70 80 and 90s. look at what happen now? Parents borth from the good apple box of cos want the young to as good as them be a good apple. while bad apple parents young ones some can make some cannot. Also why singaporean population decrease is due to pressure on edcation and policy of PAP force people to good apple or even better apple or best apple so best that many young people cannot make it or give up or leave this singapore to other green place to bulid a family outside.</p>

              Simply the education policy is not well covered. They never realised there's people who are more acad incline, some more hands on.

              I read your grumbles and I hear your woes but really what can you do for yourselves? Having gone thro the system  my uncles and grand aunts all tell me , there are ways to beat the system and succeed. They have, so I don't see why you can't? Of course if you are going ot tell me that you  cannot do anything for yourself , then what is there to say,  right?
              
              For those of you who are young- you have ample choices  going for you.  YOu listen to what the government says  first , then make your own decision as to what is good for you and simply work hard towards your goal. If you think this place sucks  and you can't succeed here , then make plans to leave to wherever you think you have a better chance to succeed. Logical?

                  Politicians will give you all kinds of statistics to tell you they are looking at the BIG picture for your benefit, not theirs. But you got to make your decision if their BIG picture co-relates and complements your own picture lah! If the picture don't match, well you still have options when you are young, fit and energetic . It is when you are old or sick and worse  poor , then you have very little options ...even then there is still Batam Bintan and some say JB.
