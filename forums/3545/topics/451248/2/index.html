              The study is simply flawed!   There are many other factors to consider  in the whole equation. The assumptions ar e  also flawed! But it certainly serves a political purpose. It is like when they tell you that in all their statistics PRs are considered TOGETHER  WITH SINGAPOREANS  under one catagory.  So they go on and say actually foreigners do not account for the increase demand  and sales of property  but  actually it is locals that are buying  up  properties. BUT "their " definition of  locals meaning PRs are included. Or they say Singaporeans are the ones buying  high end properties and landed properties these days  as foreigner can't buy. But  the Singapore citizen could be some Tng swah  rich bug from China who had just paid  for a Sentosa bungalow  which included a  citizenship thrown in, and therefore now as a NEW Singapore citizen there is nothing stopping him from speculating  inland whether landed or condos! and they also convenient  forget to tell you tha tforeigners can't buy outright landed properties BUT they can apply for permission to buy.,and if granted they do buy!

                  <p>Besides.</p>
                  <p>The study might be biased.</p>
                  <p>And why not? </p>
                  <p>But if you feel that you can do a study better with the given

              Let me assure you that  some of us do understand  what  is being presented and also the coments/conditional exclusion stated by Leong. But I think most people have become very skeptical of such  surveys/study  presented, as they often do tend to serve a purpose obviously. And that is alright  of course,  and so are counter criticisms!  Depending on the statistics and figures  and assumptions one chooses, different consequential results can  be elicited to justify polices to be adapted.
               As to your challenge to do  a survey, it is  typical of  how the government once used to challenge well meaning critics to stand for elections rather than being in an armchair. Well, my answer to that is : We have all our own different roles to play, to improve the system, lest it becomes tardy like the MRT  lines!

              <p>So that's all you have to say in response to my challenge?<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You think that I have the time to sieve out information and know what's there to know.</p>
              <p>Because you do not want to have the time, but to be sceptical of everything <em>others around you</em> have to say.</p>
              <p>It takes only 1 minute to copy and paste data and click "Insert Line" on Excel.</p>
              <p>That's sad.</p>
              <p>Do check out singstat websites though...as well as data reports (if you can) with regards to Singapore.</p>
              <p>It might surprise you.</p>
              <p>Nah. Doubt you would even bother trying.</p>
              <p>Its far easier to be an arm-chair critic like you.</p>
