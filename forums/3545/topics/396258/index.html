              <p><strong>It is healthy that there's political contest in S'pore: Ng Eng Hen</strong><br> <span class="update">By Lynda Hong | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 11 April 2010 1940 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Education Minister Ng Eng Hen on Sunday said it is 
              healthy that there is political contest in Singapore.
              <br> <br> He was responding to reporters who asked him about the recent activity 
              by opposition parties in various constituencies.
              <br> <br> Dr Ng joined 300 residents in Toa Payoh for some Sunday morning 
              exercise.
              <br> <br> Elaborating on his point that political contest is healthy, Dr Ng said 
              he would encourage would-be candidates and opposition parties to meet 
              residents so that residents could ask them questions about what they 
              stood for.
              <br> <br> He said: "I think it is healthier for Singapore, rather than just 
              appearing before the elections and then not continuing. I have noticed 
              that opposition parties are doing this more regularly and I think 
              all-in-all it is good for politics in Singapore."
              <br> <br> Dr Ng said PAP MPs assume that there would be a contest each time and so
               the MPs have been working the ground to improve the lives of residents.
              <br> <br> This point was also emphasised by Manpower Minister Gan Kim Yong at a 
              separate community event.
              <br> <br> Mr Gan also told reporters that there has not been a shortage of ideas 
              within the ruling party.
              <br> <br> He was asked to respond to Reform Party leader Kenneth Jeyaretnam's 
              comments in a TODAY interview that a one-party system will lead to a 
              society closed to new ideas.
              <br> <br> Mr Gan said that PAP MPs have been proactive in implementing their 
              ideas.
              <br> <br> He said: "During the last recession, you also see that we have rolled 
              out many initiatives, including the Jobs Credit, SPUR and so on. They 
              were very effective in helping our companies and workers cope with the 
              recession and allowing our economy to recover very strongly, very 
              quickly since the second half of last year."
              <br> <br> Mr Gan added that the PAP MPs have also been focused on serving the 
              residents and improving their estates. - CNA/ms </span></p>
