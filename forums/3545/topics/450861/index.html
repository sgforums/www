              <p>Apr 18, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>MR DAVID Lim urges Singaporeans to readily accept permanent residents
               (PRs) and other foreigners so as to build an inclusive Singapore, which
               in turn will make for a stronger nation ('Make this a stronger nation 
              by making all feel they belong'; last Thursday).</p>
              <p>His appeal may be easier said 
              than done, given that Singapore is far more complex now because of the 
              influx of immigrants of diverse nationalities within a few short years.</p>
              <p>It is understandable that certain segments 
              among Singaporeans are not prepared, mentally and socially, to accept so
               many newcomers in such a short span.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim's analogy of assembling 
              the best team, comprising citizens and foreigners, to achieve a stronger
               Singapore may not be realistic.</p>
              <p>Many foreigners and some PRs are here for 
              purely economic reasons. Among first-generation PRs, the ties to their 
              home countries are still strong.</p>
              <p>So, to take up citizenship may not be as 
              simple as it seems because of emotional ties. When it comes to certain 
              national issues, loyalty to Singapore may be divided in such a team. If a
               war breaks out in Singapore, how many of the foreigners and PRs would 
              stay and fight?</p>
              <p>If Mr Lim feels that Singaporeans will not 
              readily accept him because he is a PR and is worried he may be asked to 
              leave, he should take up citizenship, as his children have.</p>
              <p>A household with a mix of Singaporeans and 
              foreigners like Mr Lim's may also result in a conflict of views on 
              certain national issues.</p>

              Our forefathers came for economic reasons sure, but did our forefathers  take away jobs from the Orang Laut and the  aborigines of Malaya? Did our forefathers  get similar priorities as the Raja rajas and the orang putehs to get into village schools? Did the colonial masters integrate with our forefathers so well? I thought they had they own sperate staircase and entrance and our fore fathers went thro the back doors or side doors.Did our forefathers attap hut suddenly cost 900,000 thousand?
              OH! and basically our forefathers were the ones who stay on! They didn't go back to Swatow or Fukkien or Canton after amassing their great fortunes in the Straits Settlements. Any one including politicians  who says let's accept and integrate  - please open their home to at least accept one Bangla family or one PRcian  to live play and work side by side in their home- then come and talk! Walk their talk ! instead of just sing a song of 6 pence a pocket full of rye!

              Indeed! Indeed! The kinds of Prcians these import are from God  knows where! all those far north or north west or north east  types even Hei long jiang  - that speak with the northern type accented tongue stiffening Mandarin! The majority of the Chinese here are from the south which very unfrotunately some politicians here deem them to be of weaker stock!( probably just because Mao was from the north) 
              
              Little do they realise that  the belligerent northern stock type  not only makes it difficult for acceptance and integration, they will be the ones in the longer run who probably will upstage  the powers that are that brought them in! They have that wildness and erratic emotional bochap madness to go on a emotional rampage if they need to! Just look at those construction workers who protest...and the ones who threaten to throw themselves off buildings if not paid certain sums  etc..they are not from the south..they are from the north!

              Couple of facts that you did not get it right, Mao is not from the North, he is from Hunan.  Most of the communist in the early china come from Hunan and Sichun, which is consider central and south.  As for you impression that only the north create problem.  Recall the cases that the gal get run off and not one person raise a finger to help.  It happen in the South.  If you been to china long enough, not much different between their south and north, they behave different many due to culture revolution which make them not so easy to understand.  Of cos not to mention they open their door so fast that the whole culture of traditional chinese is gone.

              How can you cut and paste only part of my post, <p>"they behave different many due to culture revolution which make them not so easy to understand. Of cos not to mention they open their door so fast that the whole culture of traditional chinese is gone." </p><p>
              
              I had already state that part of the reason is due to culture revolution, though i dun see singaporean chinese actually protecting traditional chinese culture too.  At least not at the present moment.
