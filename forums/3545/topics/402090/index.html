              <div class="kicker"><br></div>
              <p>LIVING in China, I have been following the recent debate surrounding 
              the victorious women paddlers' country of origin. It seems we, 
              Singaporeans, have forgotten, within just four decades, that our 
              forefathers were immigrants too.</p>
              <p>Our great grandfathers came from China, India and Malaya to 
              build this country. No one questioned their countries of origin. Many of
               our first-generation leaders, including the highly respected Dr Goh 
              Keng Swee, were not born in Singapore. Did we ever question their 
              loyalty or what they had done for Singapore?</p>
              <p>If our national football team were made up of David Beckham,
               Michael Owen and Kaka and if we had won the World Cup, would we be as 
              critical of their countries of origin? I suspect not. We seem to have 
              dealt harshly with the paddlers because they are of Chinese origin.</p>
              <p>It is indeed true that many of our national sportsmen and 
              sportswomen are foreign imports. And, yes, we could probably do a lot 
              more to support the development of local sports talent. But, let's take 
              an objective and pragmatic view of this.</p>
              <p>Are our local sportsmen and sportswomen willing to sacrifice
               the time to achieve the results? Take a look at our national football 
              team. Talent is not lacking, but discipline is. Don't we feel 
              embarrassed when we hear of our national team losing to a weaker 
              opponent because some players were out partying the night before and had
               overslept? What has happened to the vision for Singapore to qualify for
               the 2010 World Cup Finals?</p>
              <p>It is not the lack of financial resources that is inhibiting
               our sports development. It is the lack of leadership in the major 
              sports associations. The football association cannot get its act 
              together. The athletics association is constantly involved in internal 
              squabbles.</p>
              <p>A sporting career is short-lived. Most professional 
              sportspeople have to retire by the age of 30. Is there a second career 
              for them here? Would Singaporean sportspeople be willing to live with 
              the uncertainty of having to retire by 30 without a job?</p>
              <p>Foreign talent are paid to do something which few 
              Singaporeans want to do. We pay them to deliver the gold. Once their 
              time is up, they have to take care of themselves.</p>
              <p>Until the local sports associations can get their act 
              together and our local sportspeople are disciplined enough to put in 110
               per cent effort, relying on foreign imports to win medals for us may be
               the best way to put Singapore on the world sporting map.</p>
