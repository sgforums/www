              <p>By 
                      																				Khushwant Singh</p>
              <p>ARMED with a knife, Goh Kar Wai would wait at car parks in Serangoon 
                      Central, Hougang, Sim's Drive and Pasir Ris for women getting out of 
                      their cars at night.</p>
              <p>Forcing them back in, the 39-year-old would drive off to rob
                       them of the cash they were carrying before leaving them at deserted 
                      locations. He even withdrew cash amounting to $4,500 with the ATM cards 
                      of two victims. He would then leave the cars at the same car parks he 
                      took them from.</p>
              <p>On Friday, he pleaded guilty to armed robbery and was jailed
                       a total of seven years and ordered to be caned 24 times. He also 
                      admitted to driving without insurance coverage.</p>
              <p>A district court heard that Goh committed four carjackings 
                      between July 3 and 30, taking in more than $2,600 in cash.</p>
              <p>Goh would also take anything of value and he admitted to 
                      robbing the four women of valuables amounting to $3,300. These included 
                      cell phones, ez-link cards, a camera and a pen.</p>
              <p>While his first three victims had followed his orders, the 
                      robbery at the car park at Potong Pasir Avenue 1 at 10pm on July 30 did 
                      not go according to plan. Fearing for her life, the victim jumped out of
                       the moving car.</p>
              <p>Police found her white Proton Perodua Kenari in a car park 
                      in Serangoon Central at 10am the next morning. Through fingerprints in 
                      the car, police managed to track down RMED with a knife, Goh Kar Wai would wait at car parks in Serangoon
