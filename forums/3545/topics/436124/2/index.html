              <p>This is a simple and really meaningful way to put our point across: you either live with our culture, or get the hell outta here.</p>

              <p>if you do that we will sort it out ourselves.  we can mediate, fight, go to court etc. right?  will anyone bring it up and make it an issue like the above case? no right?</p>
