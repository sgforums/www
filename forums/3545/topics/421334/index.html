              <p>Dealers at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&amp;q=Marina+Bay+Sands&amp;m=text">Marina Bay Sands (MBS)</a> casino will have to pay the price if they fall ill during the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Chinese%20New%20Year&amp;w=all">Chinese New Year (CNY)</a> period.</p>
              <p>In a report by <em>The Straits Times, </em>anyone who fails to turn 
              up for work at the casino during this time — regardless of whether they 
              have a valid sick leave (MC) — will receive two demerit points. Staff 
              who do not take leave during this period will receive four merit points.</p>
              <p>This comes as the casino braces itself for a flood of patrons during CNY, which has its first day on Thursday next week.</p>
              <p>The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ministry+of+Manpower&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry of Manpower (MOM)</a> is not too pleased with this move, telling <em>ST </em>that
               employers “should not require employees to compromise their right to 
              take legitimate medical leave, or be penalised if they do so”.</p>
              <p>It added that employees can seek its help or advice if they feel that
               they have been unfairly treated for taking an MC by sending an email 
              message to mom_lrwd@mom.gov.sg.</p>
              <p><strong>Negative reaction</strong></p>
              <p>Dealers are obviously upset about the MBS’ decision.</p>
              <p>Dealer Edwin Lee, who is in his late 30s, said, “What if someone is 
              genuinely sick during that time? It doesn’t seem like such a fair thing 
              to do.”</p>
              <p>Croupiers were informed of the rule in a memo last Friday. The casino
               said that the rule was enforced to ensure they were adequately staffed 
              during the CNY peak period from February 2 to February 10.</p>
              <p>Madam Halimah Yacob, deputy secretary-general of the National Trade 
              Union Congress, believes that a sick worker should not be forced to 
              work.</p>
              <p>“If, despite being sick and having a valid MC, a worker still decides
               to go to work, who is going to be responsible if something happens to 
              him?” she told <em>ST.</em></p>
              <p>While the move by MBS may seem harsh, industry and human resource 
              experts say they understand why the casino made such a drastic move to 
              ensure dealers show up.</p>
              <p>Mr Tony Compton, who has been in the gambling industry for over 20 
              years, said this is the first time he has heard of such an action.</p>
              <p>“This is MBS’ first CNY, and they will be very very busy. It’s up to 
              the company to do what they have to, to ensure that it is well-staffed 
              during that period,” said the Boston Business School lecturer in casino 
              management.</p>
              <p>Ms Jacqueline Thoo, a lecturer in human resource management at 
              Singapore Polytechnic, felt the move was too harsh. However, she 
              admitted that “medical leave taken during that time would affect 
              operations very significantly”.</p>
              <p><em>ST </em>discovered that 250 out of 1,500 MBS dealers took medical leave on New Year’s Eve last month.</p>
              <p><strong>Rewards suggested</strong></p>
              <p>“The situation may have pushed the company to resort to such 
              measures. However there should be more consideration for employees who 
              may get sick during that period,” said Ms Thoo.</p>
              <p>Perhaps giving staff an additional day off or paying them more for working during CNY might help, suggested Ms Thoo.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Resorts+World+Sentosa">Resorts World Sentosa (RWS)</a>, for example, is paying its staff more than the usual overtime pay and public holiday rates to work over the CNY period.</p>
              <p>An MBS spokesman was tight-lipped when asked about the reason behind 
              the casino’s  demerit points system. He only revealed that it allows 
              them to identify and reward worthy employees based on their performance 
              and attendance.</p>
              <p>Although this ruling is designed to target the less-hardworking bunch
               of dealers, it has not gone down well with those who have put in their 
              blood and sweat to the job.</p>
              <p>“I was quite okay about working during the CNY period, but after 
              seeing the memo, I feel like taking MC to challenge them,” said a 
              33-year-old dealer, who is scheduled to work on eight straight days from
               Feb 2.</p>
              <p>He also worked on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.</p>
