              If they work in Singapore...no CPF. If they work in Malaysia...they have 12 per cent. EPF like CPF too. In Malaysia, male and female of 18 years old serve 6 months NS only. Those wealthy Chinese Malaysian family or those who are willing to spend money on education for their sons or daughters will send them in Singapore or other countries.Some of them will work and study at the same time. Yes, they are in the advantage in the matter of NS which is very short period for them. But many of them not wealthy too and prefer to start work in their early age to build their careers, fend for themselves and at the same time support their families back at their own hometown. They don't waste their time for paper chasing...for them at the end...having plenty of money in their bank account and possession of wealth is regarded as success and respectful...rather than having a good academic qualification but no money and no wealth. How many Singapore youth start work as early as 17 years old before NS and after serving NS continue to work to build a career and their CPF, support themselves and their families...in other word independent. Most of them still depended on their parents to support them until in their mid twenties, late 20s or even in their 30s too.
