              In 2000, Chou released his first album, titled Jay (2000), under the record company Alfa Music. Since then his music has gained recognition throughout Asia, most notably in regions such as Taiwan, Mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia and in western Asian communities such as in the United States and Australia. He has sold more than 30 million albums since his debut. Chou continues to write songs for other artists, work on his album and went on to win numerous awards in the music industry.[4] In 2003, he was the cover story of Time magazine (Asia version),[5] acknowledging his influence on popular culture. He has since held five world tours, performing in cities around the world to more than 10 million people.[5]

              Early life[edit]
              
              Jay Chou grew up in Linkou, Taipei County in Republic of China.[6] Both his parents were secondary school teachers: his mother, Yeh Hui-Mei (simplified Chinese: å�¶æƒ ç¾Ž; traditional Chinese: è‘‰æƒ ç¾Ž; pinyin: YÃ¨ HuÃ¬mÄ›i), taught fine arts, while his father, Chou Yao-Chung (Chinese: å‘¨è€€ä¸­; pinyin: ZhÅ�u YÃ ozhÅ�ng), was a biomedical researcher. His mother noticed his sensitivity to music and took him to piano lessons at the age of four.[6] During his childhood, he was fascinated with capturing sounds and songs with his tape recorder, which he carried everywhere with him. In the third grade, he became interested in music theory and also started cello lessons. He is an only child and loved to play piano, imitate TV actors, and perform magic tricks. His favorite composer was, and still is to this day, Chopin. His parents divorced when he was 13, which caused him to become reclusive and introverted. Although he had friends, he often preferred to be alone, listening to music, contemplating and daydreaming. At Tamkang Senior High School, he majored in piano and minored in cello. He showed talent for improvisation, became fond of pop music and began to write songs.[5][7]
              
              Chou graduated from high school with inadequate grades for university, so he prepared for mandatory military service. However, a sports injury triggered by an unexplainable and severe back pain eventually led to the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis, a hereditary spine inflammation disease; as a result, he was exempted from conscription.[8][9] Meanwhile, he found himself a job as a waiter.
              
              Early career[edit]
              
              Chou's mother initially aspired Chou to become a music teacher, while Chou remained relatively clueless on what to do with his life. Without his knowing, a friend of his had entered both their names in a talent show called Super New Talent King in 1998. Chou played the piano accompaniment for his friend, whose singing was described as "lousy". Although they did not win, the show's host Jacky Wuâ€”an influential character in Taiwan's entertainment businessâ€”happened to glance at the music score and was impressed with its complexity. Wu then asked who wrote it, discovered Chou and hired him as a contract composer and paired him with the novice lyricist Vincent Fang.[5] for his then record company Alfa Music. Chou then spent most of his time in Wu's studio learning music producing, sound mixing, recording and writing songs. Although he was trained in classical music, Chou combines Chinese and Western music styles to produce songs that fuse R&amp;B, rock and pop genres. However Wu told Chou that he will help Chou to release an album after he wrote 100 songs and he will pick ten from there. Chou already had an arsenal of songs he wrote for others but had been rejected, so among those he chose 10 for his debut CD album Jay that was released in 2000. The album established his reputation as a musically gifted singer-songwriter whose style is a fusion of R&amp;B, rap, classical music, and yet distinctly Chinese. His fame spread quickly in Chinese-speaking regions throughout Southeast Asia.[10][11][12]
              
              Music career[edit]
              
              2000 to 2002[edit]
              
              Jay Chou launched his debut album "Jay" under Alfa Music in 2000. The album was promoted heavily by Jacky Wu in the entertainment shows he hosted. Jay also appeared in some of the shows himself. He frequently wears a cap and leave his head hanging low in the early days, which gives him a unique image and piques the curiosity of viewers. The debut album and Jay himself was marketed as a talented singer-composer album with a unique tune. With his collaboration with Vincent Fang and Vivian Hsu in the album, it also brought about a few hits.
              
              After promoting the debut album shortly, Jay went into the studio for next 12 months to record and produce the next album "Fantasy". This album released in September 2001 became a big hit and sold an estimated 2 million copies in Taiwan alone. Other than being a commercial success, the album also garnered Jay 5 awards out of being nominated 10 at the much-coveted 13th Golden Melody Awards in 2002. This established Jay in the music industry. Hits such as "ç°¡å–®æ„›" (simple love) which brings out the simplicity of love in youth with a very catchy tune, "æ„›åœ¨è¥¿å…ƒå‰�" which talks about love before B.C. won Chou the Best Composer award, and "é–‹ä¸�äº†å�£" talks about a person leaving on a space mission while he didn't get to profess his love to his loved one. All these songs are Chou's signature songs and are being sung in concerts even till today.
              
              Chou's music became much-discussed topic because it is different from mainstream popular Chinese music at that time. It infuses themes of ancient past, futuristic space ship, and his music invokes very clear and vivid imagery to its listeners. A characteristic of his singing was also being brought up that with his rapping or singing, people often could not decipher what he is singing until they look at the lyrics. Chou says this is his signature style or infusing his singing with the music in the song to "make it blend" well together. Critics refer to his singing as "mumbling". This garnered a lot of attention and reporters often quiz Chou on his singing style. Another reason Chou came up with is that he wants the listeners to look at the lyrics because the lyrics written by Vincent Fang are very deep. All these prompted many to start listening to Chou's music in the music world. Up till this point in time, his music is mainly within the R&amp;B genre. This album is to be looked back, the most significant part of his career which catapulted Jay into stardom.
              
              Chou followed the formula that works for his third album, with songs that invoke imagery, collaborating with lyricist Vincent Fang, "mumbling" singing and mainly R&amp;B tunes. His third album "Eighth Dimensions" is still a commercial success. With it, he held the world concert tour "The One".
              
              2003 to 2004[edit]
              
              In 2003, Chou released his fourth album 'Ye Hui Mei" named after his own mother. After the release of this album, he attended the Golden Melody Awards for his previous album's nomination. The album "Eighth Dimension" was nominated for 5 categories but won none. Chou didn't take this too lightly, as he wrote on his next album the song "å¤–å©†" that he actually takes the Golden Melody Awards too seriously. Ironically, his then-current album "Ye Hui Mei" will win a Golden Melody "Best Album of the year" award in 2004.
              
              "Ye Hui Mei" was both a commercial and musical success. The album features songs on Mafia and drug lords "ä»¥çˆ¶ä¹‹å��" which at first hearing was very unorthodox but it displays Jay's creative writing and producing ability. This album can be seen as Jay's second milestone because it gained extremely positive reaction from both critics of his music and supporters of his music. Jay also wanted to prove that he is a versatile artist and not only writes R&amp;B songs, he ventured into more rock-flavoured tunes such as "æ™´å¤©" which is one of the most played songs of the year. This song gained widespread popularity and high school students started learning guitar to play the drift of the song's intro.

              Chou's compositions are loosely categorized as pop music. While many of his works fall into contemporary R&amp;B, rap, and rock genres, the term "Chou Style" (Chinese: å‘¨æ°�é¢¨æ ¼; pinyin: zhÅ�u shÃ¬ fÄ“nggÃ©)[13] has been popularized to describe his trademark cross-cultural music and his insistence on singing with slurred enunciation. Taipei Times once described the meaning of "Chou Style": "In what has become the archetypal Chou style, Taiwan's favorite son blends pop, rap, blues and a smorgasbord of esthetic elements of world music to create his dream-like never-never land ..."[14]
              
              He regularly fuses traditional Chinese instruments and styles with R&amp;B or rock to form a new genre called "Zhongguo feng" (simplified Chinese: ä¸­å›½é£Ž; traditional Chinese: ä¸­åœ‹é¢¨; pinyin: ZhÅ�ngguÃ³ fÄ“ng), which literally means "Chinese Style Music",[a] some of which are written in the Pentatonic Scale as opposed to the more common seven-note scale (Diatonic Scale) to accentuate an oriental style. Besides his own culture, he also incorporated Spanish guitar in "Red Imitation" (Chinese: ç´…æ¨¡ä»¿; pinyin: hÃ³ng mÃ³fÇŽng), American techno/electronica in "Herbalist's Manual" (Chinese: æœ¬è�‰ç¶±ç›®; pinyin: BÄ›ncÇŽo GÄ�ngmÃ¹), rap with subtle classical music undertones in "Reverse Scales" (Chinese: é€†é±—; pinyin: nÃ¬lÃ­n), Blues style in "Free Tutorial Video" (Chinese: å…�è²»æ•™å­¸éŒ„å½±å¸¶; pinyin: Mian Fei Jiao Xue Lu Ying Dai) and Bossanova style in "Rosemary" (Chinese: è¿·è¿­é¦™; pinyin: mÃ­diÃ©xiÄ�ng), to name a few. Sound effects from everyday life are frequently woven into his music, such as bouncing ping pong balls, touch tone phone dialing, helicopter blades, dripping rain, and radio static noise (Musique ConcrÃ¨te).[b]
              
              His formal musical training is evident by the use of classical textures in his compositions. For example, counterpoint was used in "Perfection" (Chinese: å®Œç¾Žä¸»ç¾©; pinyin: wÃ¡nmÄ›izhÇ”yÃ¬) and "Sorry" (Chinese: å°�ä¸�èµ·; pinyin: duÃ¬buqÇ�), while polyphony can be found in "The Wound That Ends War" (Chinese: æ­¢æˆ°ä¹‹æ®¤; pinyin: zhÇ� zhÃ n zhÄ« shÄ�ng) and "Twilight's Chapter Seven" (Chinese: å¤œçš„ç¬¬ä¸ƒç« ; pinyin: yÃ¨ de dÃ¬-qÄ« zhÄ�ng).
              
              Chou's albums have been noted for the lack of change compared to his earlier works, yet he firmly stated that he will not alter his style: "They say I've been standing still ... but this is the music I want, and I don't see what I want by moving ahead."[15] To demonstrate his point, he named his 2006 album Still Fantasy after his 2001 album Fantasy. His use of relaxed enunciation has been criticized as "mumbling"[16] which he also insisted will not change;[17] however, recently he has adopted clearer pronunciation for certain songs, particularly more traditional Chinese style songs, such as "Faraway" (Chinese: å�ƒé‡Œä¹‹å¤–; pinyin: qiÄ�nlÇ� zhÄ«wÃ i) which features Fei Yu-ching and "Chrysanthemum Terrace" (Chinese: è�ŠèŠ±å�°; pinyin: jÃºhuÄ� tÃ¡i).[18]
              
              Lyrics[edit]
              
              Chou is more often a singer-composer than a lyricist. Several "regulars" write the lyrics for most of his music, but the content and style is unified with his own personality and image, covering a diverse range of topics and ideas. Vincent Fang accounts for more than half of the lyrics in his albums, helping to establish an important element in Chou's music: the use of meaningful, imagery- and emotionally rich lyrics, sometimes written in the form of ancient Chinese poetry with reference to Chinese history or folklore.[c] In addition to writing romantic hits,[d] he also touches on war, the Bible, sports, and martial arts.[e] Vivian Hsu is a singer herself and has helped with Chou's earlier hits,[f] while Huang Jun Lang (Chinese: é»ƒä¿ŠéƒŽ; pinyin: HuÃ¡ng JÃ¹nlÃ¡ng) is noted for his work surrounding unusual themes (such as a detective story and chess game).[g][citation needed]
              
              Chou himself has written lyrics for many ballads,[h] but has also discussed societal ills such as drug addiction in "Coward" (Chinese: æ‡¦å¤«; pinyin: nuÃ²fÅ«) and loss of the rural countryside to urbanization in "Terrace fields" (Chinese: æ¢¯ç”°; pinyin: tÄ«tiÃ¡n). Domestic violence discussed in "Dad, I am back" (Chinese: çˆ¸,æˆ‘å›žä¾†äº†; pinyin: bÃ , wÇ’ huÃ­lai le) received a great deal of commotion since he was the first to bring up this taboo subject in Sanscript music,[19] which helped solidify his status as a pioneer and a unique pop singer capable of approaching serious issues. In the songs "Maternal grandmother" (Chinese: å¤–å©†; pinyin: wÃ ipÃ³) and "Listen to Mother" (Chinese: è�½åª½åª½çš„è©±; pinyin: tÄ«ng mÄ�ma de huÃ ), he voiced his high regard for family values. He addressed personal issues about his failure to enter university in "Split" (Chinese: åˆ†è£‚; pinyin: fÄ“nliÃ¨), his resentment towards the paparazzi in "Besieged From All Sides" (Chinese: å››é�¢æ¥šæ­Œ; pinyin: sÃ¬miÃ nchÇ”gÄ“), "Rice Fragrance" (Chinese: ç¨»é¦™; pinyin: dÃ o xiÄ�ng), a song from his 9th album Capricorn encourages people not to give up their dreams even when facing difficulties in life, the sadness of becoming a clown in "Uncle Joker"(Chinese: å–¬å…‹å�”å�”; pinyin: Qiao Ke Shu Shu) and highlighted the importance of individuality in "Popular Imitation" (Chinese: ç´…æ¨¡ä»¿; pinyin: hÃ³ng mÃ³fÇŽng).[citation needed]
              
              Chinese cultural elements[edit]
              
              Chou leads a new trend of music which combines western musical elements and Chinese literature terms. Because of this unique combination, he makes distinction between himself and other musicians by leading a "China Wind"[20] in Asian music history. The success of his Western-Chinese musical combination is built on his marketing strategies and the musical elements involved in his works.
              
              In early 21st century, the People's Republic of China was in an economic transition model. The new generation was looking for a consumption pop culture which would reflect individual uniqueness in the social circumstance.[21]
              
              The traditional Chinese cultural elements involved in Chou's music contribute to his status in Asian popular music culture. The blowing "China Wind" in his music leads a new trend of Chinese
