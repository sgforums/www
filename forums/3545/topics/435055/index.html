              <p>The expression may not exact...yes, these values are represented in almost every culture as well...but they are reflected on Chinese in a special way (of course, those are always in a different way in different contexts, and that is the culture)...for example, with regard to filial piety, we're sure that everyone respects and loves their parents, but for traditional Chinese, it is far from enough. They highly appreciate male child since "there are three ways to be unfilial, the worst is to not produce son"...that is one of the Chinese values...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i made that statement to investigate how Chinese culture is maintained in this land rather than judging or something...i did not intend to offend anyone...</p>

              <p>There is always a contradiction that I cannot answer. How about you?  I share here:</p>
              <p>I often hear people around me say, they want to earn lots of money so they can give their parent good life. Eg, they want to bring parent eat the best lobster, best seafood, get the best electronic leg massager.</p>
              <p>But I think, what if you know (in our modern knowledge, in 2011, we cannot feign ignorance) that the best lobster and best seafood has the most unhealthy cholestrol that will kill them?  But in parent's mind, this is what they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">want</span> to eat.   Which is more filial?   To educate them to stop eating unhealthy food (<strong>which they decide not to listen because tasty food is more savoury than thinking about heart-attacks and cancer</strong>)  or  suit them (meaning if you can afford giving them such food, by all means go ahead).</p>

              <p>I know what you mean. Filial piety is not that we should satisfy all the demands of parents. And it does not mean we don't love them or respect them. We just express our love and affection in our own way they may not expect. But one could not say it is not filial piety, after all, our intention is really for their sake.</p>

              <p>   In those cases, it is hard to get along well with their parents. As an independent human   being, one should be capable of making decision for his/her life and responsible for it     when taking parents' suggestions into account. </p>

              <p>Ya. These are the intricate issues that are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">real</span> burning issues over filial piety, loyalty, when parents themselves are stubborn, naive or cannot be helped themselves.  I do feel that Confucian ethics has its share of limitations, and one cannot apply without compromising some of the issues at hand.</p>
