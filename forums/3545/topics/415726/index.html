              <p>By Bea Johnson – November 11th, 2010</p>
              <p>I  was sitting down at Boat Quay one morning, shortly after my arrival 
              in Singapore, and overheard two young Asian girls chatting at the table 
              next to us.</p>
              <p>When I didn’t immediately understand what they were saying, I assumed
               they were speaking Mandarin. However, after a few more minutes, I 
              realised I could understand a few words, and then to my astonishment, I 
              realised that they were in fact speaking English. I was even more amazed
               when I realised that this must be their first language. How then could 
              they speak it with such a funny accent?</p>
              <p>Before I came to Singapore, I had of course heard of Singlish, but 
              had assumed it was more a case of sprinkling the official language of 
              English with a dash of Chinese or Malay slang. I had not realised that 
              it is actually a stable, fully-fledged language and more recently, 
              rather a controversial topic.</p>
              <p>This very local dialect is viewed with pride and affection by most 
              Singaporeans, and considered to be an important part of local heritage.</p>
              <p>However, in recent years, the government has become increasingly 
              concerned that the popularity of Singlish could lead to deterioration in
               the population’s “proper” English, thus limiting Singapore’s trading 
              opportunities with the outside world and denigrating their appearance 
              abroad.</p>
              <p>As a result, not only is Singlish banned on television, but somewhat 
              amusingly the<em> </em>Speak Good English Movement’s latest campaign 
              suggests that the next time you see a sign written in poor English, you 
              should whip out your post it notes and paste a sticky note over it, 
              correcting the error. The
               idea has been described as guerrilla by some, and seems a tad excessive
               (not to mention at odds with the strict rules on vandalism).</p>
              <p>On launching this year’s campaign the Minister for Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan replaced the 
              ubiquitous and perfectly comprehensible sign at the Xin Food Court 
              saying, “No outside food allowed” with one which reads “No food from 
              elsewhere, please”. Seriously, the original was fine.</p>
              <p>Taxi drivers are one of the best sources of Singlish and are a 
              constant source of amusement for us “ang mohs” and, sometimes, of 
              frustration. We wonder why when we say an address, the taxi driver will 
              sit and ponder for a few minutes until repeating it seemingly 
              identically.</p>
              <p>On one occasion, a friend got a bit tongue-tied when asking for an 
              address and it came out as “Reonie Hir”. As we looked at each other in 
              horror at this unintentional faux pas, the taxi driver merely repeated 
              “Ah, Reonie Hill lah, OK.” Apparently no offense was taken, and off we 
              went.</p>
              <p>On one occasion, my lack of Singlish was a serious hindrance. I had 
              received a voucher for a facial, which I duly tried out. The next day I 
              received a call from an unknown number and, assuming it was the beauty 
              salon calling to harass me about future treatments, was a tad curt. 
              However, after a few minutes, to my horror, I realised it was a 
              telephone job interview!</p>
              <p>By this point, I had no idea who the company was or even what the 
              role was, and spent the next ten minutes alternately cringing every time
               I had to ask the interviewee to repeat herself, and wondering what the 
              heck we were talking about! Aiyo! Needless to say I never heard back 
              about that one.</p>
              <p>Someone who seems to straddle both worlds with ease is the YouTube 
              wonder kid, aka the “Singaporean White Guy”, a hybrid expat 
              Singaporean/American high school boy, well worth checking out.</p>
              <p>In my ongoing quest to improve my Singlish, I have just been informed
               of a fascinating word: “kiasu”.</p>
              <p>It is not just a Hokkien adjective meaning literally “afraid of 
              losing” but most interestingly of all, TalkingCock.com (not a porn site 
              but an excellent tool for Singlish enthusiasts) calls “kiasu-ism” 
              Singapore’s most defining national characteristic. It is this attitude 
              that leads Singaporeans to join a queue, even if they don’t what it is 
              for — just in case they might be missing out.</p>
              <p>Most educated Singaporeans realise when to use Singlish and when to 
              use “proper” English, and a blogger summed it up perfectly when he 
              wrote: “Ban Singlish cannot but must learn when to use, lah.”</p>
              <p>A little taste of Singlish I’ve managed to decode in my short time 
              here:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>You see ang moh go eats so much, leh! – Look at the foreigner eating
               so much!</li>

              very warm.</li>
              <li>Dat person there cannot trust. – That person over there is not 
              trustworthy.</li>
              <li>Tomorrow dun need bring camera. – You don’t need to bring a camera 
              tomorrow.</li>
              <li>He play soccer also very good one leh. – He’s very good at playing 
              soccer too.</li>
              <li>Walau, I want eat chicken rice  – I am craving for chicken rice.</li>
              <li>I go bus-stop wait you  – I will be at the bus stop waiting for you.</li>
              <li>No good lah. – This isn’t good.</li>
              <li>Cannot anihow go liddat one leh. – You/it can’t go just like that.</li>
              <li>How come never show up? – Why didn’t you/he/it show up?</li>
              </ul>
