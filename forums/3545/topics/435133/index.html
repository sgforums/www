              <h3 class="date_story">Jul 29, 2011- ST Forum</h3>
              <p>LAST weekend's Saturday Special report ('Late (great) expectations') 
              was disappointing as it blamed couples, especially the woman, for 
              Singapore's declining birth rate and delayed parenthood.</p>
              <p>Couples delay parenthood for good reason.</p>
              <p>A young Singaporean will complete junior college only at the age of 18 and tertiary education at probably 23.</p>
              <p>Add two more years for the young man to do national service.</p>
              <p>Will a rational individual think of marriage and parenthood when he probably cannot even support himself?</p>
              <p>An average Singaporean who takes a student loan must also 
              add two more years to settle it, assuming he finds a job immediately 
              after graduation.</p>
              <p>By the time he is financially stable to support a spouse, he will be in his late 20s.</p>
              <p>Then there is the search for a partner and the courtship process, which also takes time.</p>
              <p>After that comes the question of setting up home, perhaps by applying for a build-to-order flat.</p>
              <p>They must get the flat if they intend to marry or they may 
              not be able to afford one by the time they do, given the atrocious 
              cash-over-valuation demand of the resale market.</p>
              <p>They must wait three or more years for balloting results, 
              construction of the flat, acquiring keys and flat renovation. Having 
              children can come only after a couple have a roof over their heads. As 
              responsible parents, they want to ensure a proper home to care for 
              another precious life.</p>
              <p>Will couples even consider having babies if they must live apart, without a proper home to call their own?</p>
              <p>Not all couples can live with their in-laws, taking into account that most of us live in small flats.</p>
              <p>Having babies is more than just about satisfying statistics and we should not blame couples for delaying parenthood.</p>

              <p>The two collumists have presented their views on the issue.</p>
              <p>I am saying the couples want hand holding from the government,
              this is in response to the Miss Jenna Cai article. I also mentioned
              that many couples have exercised prudence in planning their lives.
              What enlightenment do you want?</p>
              <p>So Miss Cai say the couples are not to be blamed, then? She is
              writing in response to the article in ST Saturday forum.</p>
              <p>If I seemed to be making it a rule that couples must have babies
              early, they I am also entitled to say that you seemed to be saying
              that the government is responsible to see to it that the couples
              have babies. This is called putting words into peoples mouth.</p>
              <p>If you have animosity with the government, thats your
              perogative, but please don't let that colour your judgment of other
              people's view that are not amiable with your's.</p>

              <p>So who is making noise? The columnist or Ms Cai?</p>
              <p>Is it not true that the columnist is blaming couples for the low birth rates?</p>
              <p>When did I say that the government is responsible for this issue? I merely mentioned the fact that Ms Cai is saying couples are not to be blamed for this, contrary to the columnist. What we are talking about is whether <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>couples</strong></span> are to blamed for this, we are not trying to find someone else to take the blame.</p>
              <p>Please read my post again before making judgements. Putting words in your mouth? Quote those words.</p>

              <p>It is because a lot of sg woman want to have career like us guys. What to do?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If we guys can get pregnant then maybe lifestyle can change but this is how it is, woman is the childbearer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So many woman who want career normaly postpone marriage and childbirth. To make matters worse, they become so successful that it basically nullifies men who earn less than them, as potentual suitors. So they have to seek men who are equally or more successful than them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the real reason why birth rates are falling. Not like the time of our forefathers - when our fathers work, mothers stay at home to care and nurture the children. People that time marry at 21, easier to give birth unlike today people give birth at 28 and above, make it harded to childbirth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don';t blame the government la, we have ourselves to blame.</p>
