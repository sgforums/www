              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Town council investments, which came under scrutiny 
              and took a beating during the recent global financial crisis, have seen 
              values recover in tandem with the financial markets. And those that 
              invested in toxic structured products recovered some amounts recently.<br><br>The
               Pasir Ris-Punggol Town Council, which wrote off its $4 million 
              Minibonds investments in the financial year 2008/09, recovered $2.3 
              million in February. This "represents a write-back" into its balance 
              sheet, said chairman Ahmad Magad.<br><br>"While we're glad to have 
              recovered part of our Minibonds investment, we would continue to manage 
              our funds in a prudent manner," the Member of Parliament wrote in the 
              town council's annual report.<br><br>The Holland-Bukit Panjang Town 
              Council told MediaCorp it had recovered $1.68 million, or 56 per cent of
               the $3 million invested in Minibonds Series 3 Notes, during the last 
              financial year.<br><br>As for its $5 million invested in Jubilee Series 3
               Link Earner Notes, the town council said it "lost the full invested 
              sum".<br><br>But it made a net investment income of $3.67 million when 
              the global financial market recovered, said chairman Teo Ho Pin. "The 
              value of our investment has also recovered to par or above par value."<br><br>The
               Sembawang Town Council, meanwhile, reported recovering the fair value 
              loss in its investment income and made $20 million. The Ang Mo Kio-Yio 
              Chu Kang Town Council achieved a similar rate of return: 6.2 per cent 
              over the 2008/09 financial year. <br><br>The town council annual reports
               were submitted to Parliament on Sept 28. Some were made available on 
              the town council websites in recent days, while MediaCorp requested for 
              the others.<br><br>Their overall financial positions were healthy and 
              most cited prudent financial management.<br><br>While Hougang recorded a
               $101,820 deficit in the last financial year, the rest achieved 
              surpluses between $1.06 million and $7.35 million during the same 
              period.<br><br>The Potong Pasir Town Council's $1.06-million operating 
              surplus boosted its accumulated surplus to about $3 million. 
              "Considering the size of our estate, the accumulated surplus is 
              substantial," chairman Chiam See Tong wrote.<br><br>Some town councils 
              flagged financial pressures to residents, though. Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu 
              Kang expects maintenance costs to rise in the future as the town 
              installs more lifts, covered link-ways and other facilities, wrote 
              chairman Inderjit Singh.<br><br>But the annual reports do not indicate 
              if service and conservancy charges (S&amp;CC) - the primary source of 
              income - will increase. The town councils cited efforts to keep a lid on
               operating costs, with the installation of energy-saving lights as a 
              common approach.<br><br>Arrears management was another area flagged by 
              some town councils. West Coast, for example, has been "expending much 
              effort in arrears management and rendering assistance to needy 
              residents".<br><br>At the end of the last financial year, it was owed 
              $1.21 million in arrears.<br><br>It has taken steps to recover arrears 
              from residents who are not in any financial hardship by imposing late 
              payment penalties and administrative charges and by initiating court 
              action.<br><br>Better S&amp;CC collection has helped Hougang to buffer 
              its operating deficit. These efforts led to a 14-per-cent drop in 
              arrears compared to the 2008/09 financial year, said town council 
              chairman Low Thia Khiang.<br><br>He attributed its deficit to the 
              demolition of six Housing and Development Board blocks for estate 
              redevelopment, which meant a reduction of S&amp;CC collected, and to 
              higher operating costs charged by suppliers and service vendors.<br><br>While
               financial markets have recovered, town councils stressed they are being
               prudent in their investments, considering the markets' volatility.<br><br>"We
               manage our funds as a diversified portfolio with risks that are well 
              spread," Holland-Bukit Panjang's Dr Teo told MediaCorp.<br><br>"Whilst 
              it's not possible to avoid short-term diminution ... we aim to provide 
              long-term healthy returns for our residents." - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a> </span></p>
