              <h1 class="storyheadline">Questions about town council fee hikes</h1>
              <p>I AM glad that most town councils will not be raising conservancy fees,
               other than Aljunied and Jurong (Most town councils not raising fees', 
              Monday). Some town councils manage to avoid raising fees thanks to 
              budget surpluses or prudent cash flow management or because they 
              switched to energy-saving lights.</p>
              <p>I am grateful to Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang Town Council 
              chairman Inderjit Singh as the town council held back its intention to 
              raise fees due to a goods and services tax increase.</p>
              <p>I have lived in Jurong since 1987. My flat is about 29 years
               old. We have waited so long for lift upgrading and recently our MP 
              announced that finally we would have our turn.</p>
              <p>Aljunied and Jurong town councils announced two weeks ago 
              that they would increase their service and conservancy fees from next 
              month, due to high operating and maintenance costs. If other town 
              councils were able to arrange lift upgrading earlier and so avoid higher
               maintenance costs, why the delay in Jurong? If other town councils can 
              delay their fee increases considering the economic situation, why not 
              Aljunied and Jurong? Perhaps these two town councils should review their
               operational management and efficiency.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">We're financially healthy, affirm three town councils</h1>
              <p>WE REFER to Mr Thomas Tan's letter on Tuesday, 'Conservancy charges: 
              Bite bullet, raise them'. The financial status of East Coast, 
              Holland-Bukit Panjang and Tanjong Pagar town councils is healthy.</p>
              <p>In the financial year 2008-2009, East Coast, Holland-Bukit 
              Panjang and Tanjong Pagar town councils achieved healthy accumulated 
              surpluses. Our total funds stood at $82.7 million, $96.16 million and 
              $166.28 million respectively.</p>
              <p>The three separate accounts for the maintenance of HDB 
              estates, which Mr Tan referred to, are funds established according to 
              the various types of properties, namely residential, commercial and 
              carpark, within the operating fund.</p>
              <p>This is for the presentation of the accounts in accordance 
              with the Town Councils Act. Under the Act, town councils can make good 
              any deficit in the funds by making transfer between funds while the 
              total operating funds remain positive.</p>
              <p>East Coast and Tanjong Pagar town councils did just that. 
              For the town improvement project funds, they are set up by transferring 
              from the accumulated operating surplus to fund specific town improvement
               projects.</p>
              <p>In the respective town council websites, the audited 
              accounts for the past financial year presented to residents show the 
              following:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li>East Coast Town Council has an accumulated operating
               surplus of $4.71 million, sinking fund of $77.3 million and town 
              improvement project fund of $0.66 million. </li>
              <li>Holland Bukit-Panjang Town Council has an 
              accumulated operating surplus of $1.8 million, sinking fund of $93.7 
              million and town improvement project fund of $0.56 million. </li>
              <li>Tanjong Pagar Town Council has an accumulated 
              operating surplus of $3.24 million, sinking fund of $162.7 million and 
              town improvement project fund of $ 0.17 million.
              <p>A comprehensive cyclical work programme is also put in place
               to upkeep the conditions of building components and infrastructure.</p>
