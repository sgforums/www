              <h1 class="storyheadline">Barrage working well</h1>
              <p>by Sue-ann Chia</p>
              <p>THE Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Environment and Water Resources
               on Sunday sought to dispel talk that it was futile to build the Marina 
              Barrage as it did nothing to prevent the flood in Orchard Road last 
              month.</p>
              <p>Dr Amy Khor said it was working well. Otherwise, other areas
               in Singapore might have flooded too.</p>
              <p>She was responding to a resident's question on how to 
              prevent further floods, during a dialogue at Bukit Gombak ward in Hong 
              Kah GRC. Dr Khor is one of the five MPs in the constituency.</p>
              <p>While the role of Marina Barrage in alleviating floods was 
              not raised by the resident, Dr Khor felt it was important to clear the 
              air on some lingering concerns, even after detailed explanations by 
              national water agency PUB and her ministry.</p>
              <p>'There have been question raised...Is the Marina Barrage not
               working? What is the problem with our maintenance system, our cleaning 
              regime?' she said.</p>
              <p>The Marina Barrage was built to boost water supply and 
              alleviate flooding in low-lying parts of the island. It 'did help', said
               Dr Khor, referring to that Wednesday morning last month when 
              Singapore's premier shopping belt was flooded.</p>

              <p> here is what i notice and .....</p>
              <p>On the day with heavy rain the water level did go down at Geylang and Kalling river....I figure they must have let the water out into the sea.</p>
              <p>But what i also notice is that why are there tides? i thought the river already been enclosed.?</p>
              <p>Water is supposed to be converting to fresh water rather than seawater.</p>
