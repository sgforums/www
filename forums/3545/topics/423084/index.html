              <div class="yn-story-content">
              <p>SINGAPORE – Singaporean Ramzi Mohamed is tired of 
              sleeping in the living room of the two-bedroom apartment he shares with 
              his mother and older brother.</p>
              <p>His problem is that housing prices in the city-state 
              are up almost 70 percent since 2006 while the 29-year-old gym 
              administrator's monthly salary of 1,200 Singapore dollars ($938) hasn't 
              budged in five years.</p>
              <p>"When I was 20, I thought I'd have my own place by 30," Ramzi said. "Now that I'm almost 30, I wonder if that will ever happen."</p>
              <p>Like tens of thousands of others living in the tiny 
              island nation that boasts one of the world's highest levels of GDP per 
              person, Ramzi's failure to realize his modest ambitions is no accident.</p>
              <p>A flood of cheap immigrant labor — and stiff 
              competition for manufacturing jobs from Asian neighbors like China and 
              Vietnam — has kept wages stagnant for many and widened the gulf between a
               very wealthy minority and the island's poorest. Housing prices have 
              skyrocketed as rapid population growth outstrips supply.</p>
              <p>At the same time, ostentatious signs of the wealth 
              enjoyed by the elite have multiplied. That has put the government under 
              pressure to loosen its tightfisted stance on welfare in the next 
              national budget Friday as it tries to defuse criticism its policies have
               worsened the plight of ordinary Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The government must also call general elections by 
              February 2012. Analysts expect the ruling People's Action Party, which 
              has held power since independence in 1965, to maintain its overwhelming 
              majority in parliament. But if poorer Singaporeans who feel left out of 
              the country's prosperity bring their discontent to the polls, the 
              government could find itself with a weaker mandate and the beginnings of
               a stronger opposition.</p>
              <p>"The lowest income group has struggled to stay 
              afloat," said Irvin Seah, an analyst at Singapore's biggest bank DBS. 
              "Plainly, not everyone has benefited equally from the economic growth 
              that has occurred over the past decade."</p>
              <p><span class="kLink"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">Singapore's </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">economy</span></span></span> — which relies on manufacturing, finance and tourism — grew a record 14.5 percent last year.</p>
              <p>Despite rapid economic growth, the U.N says <span class="kLink"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">income </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">inequality</span></span></span> in Singapore has risen steadily over the last decade and is the second 
              highest behind Hong Kong among developed nations. From 1998 to 2008, the
               bottom 20 percent of households saw their income drop an average of 2.7
               percent while the salaries of the richest 20 percent rose by more than 
              half.</p>
              <p>To be sure, the poor in Singapore as a whole are 
              better off than their counterparts elsewhere in Southeast Asia — 
              homelessness and hunger are almost nonexistent. The richest 20 percent 
              of Singaporeans mostly live in private developments, and the rest of the
               population lives in housing built by the government, so slum areas of 
              concentrated poverty don't exist.</p>
              <p>The few opposition figures in tightly scripted 
              Singapore are calling for more housing construction, a minimum wage — 
              and fewer foreigners.</p>
              <p>"We've had over a million new people come to live in 
              Singapore in the last 10 years with very little increase in the stock of
               public housing, so it's inevitable that prices have risen sharply," 
              said Kenneth Jeyaretnam, son of Singapore's best known opposition 
              politician J.B. Jeyaretnam, who died in 2008.</p>
              <p>"We need to slow the intake of foreign workers and 
              concentrate on raising the productivity and incomes of Singaporean 
              workers instead," he said.</p>
              <p>The government in recent years has also courted 
              events such as Formula 1 — a predominantly European sport with little 
              local following — and allowed two casino resorts, where citizens must 
              pay a $78 fee per day to gamble, while foreigners enter for free.</p>
              <p>"Some feel that we're creating this place to be a 
              playground for the rich," said Eugene Tan, assistant professor at 
              Singapore Management University. "There are people who genuinely feel 
              that Singaporeans don't come first."</p>
              <p>The PAP has long rejected policies such as a minimum 
              wage or public retirement pensions, arguing welfare state-style policies
               would undermine competitiveness, foreign investment and economic 
              growth. But it increasingly recognizes its hold on power will be 
              undermined if a large section of society is left behind.</p>
              <p>"Economic growth must benefit all members of the 
              community," top government adviser and former Prime Minister Goh Chok 
              Tong said last month. "Otherwise, our community may be divided by 
              differences in income levels within it."</p>
              <p>Analysts expect the government — whose coffers are flush with last 
              year's budget surplus estimated at about 7 percent of GDP — to announce 
              Friday increased retirement fund contributions, training for low-income 
              workers, tax cuts, rebates and <span class="kLink"><span style="color: #366388;"><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">cash </span><span class="kLink" style="color: #366388 ! important; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; font-weight: 400; font-size: 13px; position: static;">handouts</span></span></span>.</p>
              <p>Part of the reason for the jump in income inequality has been the 
              success of Singapore's richest — billionaires whose fortunes largely 
              stem from banking and real estate development. According to Forbes' list
               of richest Singaporeans last year, eight of its 11 billionaires made 
              their money in banking or real estate.</p>
              <p>The island also has the world's highest percentage of millionaires — 
              households with at least $1 million in liquid assets — at 11.4 percent 
              of the country's 5 million population, according to a survey last year 
              by Boston Consulting Group. Rolls Royce, whose least expensive model in 
              Singapore costs about $850,000, said sales in the city-state soared 171 
              percent in 2010.</p>
              <p>"The PAP has made it a central plank that it is a party for all," said 
              Tan, the assistant professor. "Once enough people feel that is just 
              rhetoric, then that would really undermine the government's legitimacy."</p>

              <p>Wages are ALWAYS price sticky downwards, the only way PAP could suppress Singaporean's wages is to bring in more foreigner to upset the labour market equilibrium. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>This tantamount to banging one's head against a brick wall, but then again, if the PAP Ministers know some head banging WuShu, they could break the walls with their heads. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              singaporeans...are like soldiers in a battlefield.
              
              they fight with china.malaysia etc. for the ultimate victory.
              
              the generals know in order to win they must use sporeans as cannon fodder at all cost as as much as possible.
              why?thats the only way they know.
              
              china and malaysia wont turn their people into cannon fodder because their people will fight back by the thousands.
              
              singaporeans on the other hand are pitiful rreally...and coupled with a lack of courage and lack of sound stable  strategy in life and with lack of progress in their future,they can be much likened to being the "suicide bomber" equivalent in the industrialised civilised world.
              
              and as humans it is normal that those who do not improve themselves in spore n stand on their 2 feet will be the hardest hit....possibly end up in prisons or mental homes as being unable to compete technologically and also not gearwed up for tomorrows or even todays progressive world.
