              <p>i've seen upper secondary students going to JC who have never taken public transport in their lives...</p>
              <p>that aside, bonding over the drive, see lizzy's post.. i'm betting that happens...</p>
              <p>still, i'm one of those affected by a bunch of idiot parents parking their cars everywhere causing obstruction to my neighbourhood by blocking up the only road in and out of the whole estate...</p>
              <p>it is a mess when it rains.. it takes me about 20 minutes just to drive out of the intersection where they all cluster... and each one will drive up to the gate then let their brat out of their car... multiply that by hundreds of brats, you have a very angry bunch of people trying to get out of the estate to go to work</p>

              <p>dude, some people work very long hours and whenever they're

              bonding and what's not.</p>

              </blockquote>
              <p>About the healthy eye contact, I wonder if you had experience with drivers who miss their turns, stops when in deep conversation. Well, some people can manage. Some people can't. Some have their eyes on the road, and then to listen only parts of the conversation.</p>
              <p>I can understand convenience but I believe bonding isn't about whether the car is there or not. It only serves its purpose when comparing to the school bus.</p>
              <p>The priceless moments, well, I wonder, does it really justify anything? You can have it when you are walking from carpark to school. Are you telling me that you cannot bond when walking from carpark to school? You cannot have priceless moments there?</p>
              <p>So the "bonding" is just an invalid excuse. Of course, if they are talking about time, talking about convenience, distance etc, I can understand their point. Bonding, really doesn't sell. I don't follow your logic that "bonding" is a justification of driving to school.</p>
              <p>I am not saying they should not drive. In fact, I never even question their need to drive into school compound. I can cut that slack, but I just wonder what makes bonding so difficult elsewhere outside the car.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, maybe in their opinion, bonding only occurs when they isolate their child from others.</p>

              <p>I don't think ferrying your kids to and from school if they are in the lower primary ages unreasonable.</p>
              <p>I see many parents in my estate cycling with their kids sitting behind them on the bicycles, ferrying them to schools this way. The schools are probably slightly beyond walking distance, and school buses are expensive if you need to pay for such a distance. I have even seen a pakcik ferrying his children to school in a bicycle while they sit in an attached 'wagon'! It's simply a utilitarian way of getting ur kids to school safely using whatever tools you have instead of addition cost. I also do think that it is 'bonding' to cycle with ur kids to school EVEN if you don't talk along the way! You don't have to chat to bond!</p>
              <p>But I guess the moment people think of parents ferrying their kids to school in a CAR .. then the CAR makes all the difference. Suddenly the kids become pampered children - even if the intention of the parents remain the same.</p>
              <p>However, once the kid reaches Upper primary - then its time for him to learn some independence!!</p>

              <p>Some people think walking 50m is far. Some people think walking 1km is okay.</p>
              <p>Some people think the child should be independent from 6. Some people think the child should be independent from 16.</p>
              <p>Most of the drivers' concern is about the traffic jam due to the cars queuing to enter the school compound when the drivers can just let the little ones drop off by the roadside or a carpark, say a short trip of 15m.</p>
              <p>Well, I believe that is more or less their ideal of "pampering" or I assume too much.</p>
              <p>Rainy days, it doesn't matter whether you are ferrying a 2 year old or a 30 year old, you will want to drop off the passengers under shelter. (Unless you are "special", you will want drop off your passenger in the rain).</p>
              <p>I suppose this is the norm.</p>

              <p>i think these kind of things can't be helped la.....primary schools crowding up estates with cars. It's really up to the school principal to impose rules like dropping kids at a designated area and they walk in. School marshalls or teachers can be assigned stations outside the school to ensure traffic is smooth and the kids walk to school safely.</p>
              <p>And nelstar, i don't buy your theory at all. To each his own and everyone has their own definiton of bonding. Every family has their own language of love. Period.</p>

              <p>I read thru ts post again.</p>
              <p>I wonder why must talk with your children while driving? Isnt it
              dangerous esp the concentration is not there on the road?</p>
              <p>Why cant ts talk to their children evening time or over the
              dinner? Are u saying you have no time at all for your children?</p>
              <p>I feel that ts is very selfish parent generally.</p>

              <p>The bottom line is simple, really.</p>
              <p>If you want to send your kids to school, fine. But if they're old enough and they still don't know how to take the bus, then it's time to teach them some independence.</p>
              <p>Also, if you behave like a KNN jackass while sending your kids to school, then it's also not fine. When you do things like hog the bus lane just so that little Ah Boy will only need to walk 5m instead of 10 m to the school gate, then you need to examine your head as a parent.</p>
              <p>Case in point? I was once waiting for the bus at a bus stop outside a SECONDARY school. It was raining very heavily, and the bus bay was flooded. The public buses that came into the bus bay had to slowly drive in and out to prevent spraying water.</p>
              <p>Then this filthy mongrel driving a Merc ZOOMED into the bus bay, spraying water all over the people waiting at the bus stop. He dropped off his son and ZOOMED off again.</p>
              <p>I swear, I was walking in the rain all the way to that bus stop and hardly got wet until that stupid car zoomed into the bus bay so that the driver could drop off his precious little secondary school boy.</p>
              <p>What manners were that parent teaching the kid?</p>

              <p><br>I think parents who are 'nature-phobic'and over pampering probably won't bother sending their kids there! I mean ... why do that when you have elite preschools offering structured curriculum, educational toys, facilitated play?!</p>
              <p>So that's the lucky thing :D</p>
              <p>But as this is very unlikely to realise, I guess it's moot.</p>
