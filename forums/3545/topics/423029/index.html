              <p>I AM one of the motorists who ferry my children to and from school 
              ('Illegal parking causing traffic headache' by Ms Sylvia Tan; Monday).</p>
              <p>I drive my child to and from school as she would have to 
              wake up far earlier and spend a considerably longer time travelling to 
              school if she were to take a school bus.</p>
              <p>During our journey home from school, she lets me know how 
              her day in school has been. I share her joy when she's had a good day in
               school and offer advice when she faces challenges. These moments are 
              priceless.</p>
              <p>I disagree that parents pamper their children by driving 
              them to and from school and I am surprised that parents like me should 
              be faulted for undertaking the responsibility of taking their children 
              to school safely.</p>
              <p>There are other ways to toughen up our children. Compromising on their safety is not one of them.</p>
              <p>I hope the authorities and other motorists would understand 
              the predicament of parents and the school management, and appreciate 
              that they are trying their best to manage the situation, given the space
               constraints.</p>
              <p>Traffic conditions may be challenging at times but a little patience goes a long way.</p>
              <p>Should one demand that convenience and ease of driving should take priority over the safety and well-being of our children?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is pampering if your child is already in primary 4 to 6.   I can understand if the child is in lower primary ie from one to three.  But once you are in upper class in primary school, he or she should be independent to go and return from  school, either in school bus or take public transport.   Parents,  please grow up yourself.

              <p>However, if it gets in the way of letting them becoming more independent, then it's wrong.</p>
              <p>I also don't understand why some parents can't let their own kids carry their own schoolbags or drop them off a slightly further distance from the schoolgate to prevent a clusterf**k.</p>

              <p>actually what's wrong with this parent? lol. Benefit of the
              doubt, she could be a busy working mother who has to juggle between
              home and workplace. And seriously, time in the car is probably for
              them the best place to communicate with both of them in the same
              place.</p>

              <p>The problem is not so much about the parent sending the kids in the car.</p>
              <p>The problem is when parents inconsiderately park anyhow so that their precious little kids would not have to walk so far.</p>
              <p>It is also a problem when the parent can't even give the kids freedom to take public transport when they're old enough.</p>

              <p>I think the act of sending kids to school is actually ok, especially 
              if the children study at a school that is quite a distance away from 
              home, or if there is no direct public transport to the school.</p>
              <p>What
               i find ridiculous are parents who still send their kids to school, when
               they just live down the street, maybe 1 or 2 bus stops away from the 
              school. these are the inconsiderate people who contribute unneedlessly 
              to the traffic jam at peak hours.</p>

              <p>I thought bonding is possible when you have time to listen to your child and talk with your child?</p>
              <p>I thought good communication is when you can maintain eye contact?</p>
              <p>Now, driving and maintaining zero eye contact with kids playing in the seats (probably not talking) is bonding?</p>
              <p>So public transport cannot bond? I can understand school bus are for students and no parents allowed.</p>
              <p>But taxis, MRT, LRT and SMRT/SBS buses cannot bond?</p>

              <p>Yeh agreed on the part where they shouldn't park their cars inconsiderately but then it's human nature unless the school liase with the police to do something about it, albeit to a limited extent. So often, singaporeans drop by the roadside to buy papers or just to da pao some hawker food. That causes congestion especially during peak hours?</p>
              <p>And on the issue of kids being given freedom to take public transport, that is subjective from family to family. Many families are affluent enough to afford cars and their way of love is to fetch the kids. Every family has a different language of love. Can't fault that.</p>

              <p>dude, some people work very long hours and whenever they're home, the kid's in a horizontal bed position. Many bring work home to do. Driving and bonding with the kid, I don't see how healthy eye contact and conversation cannot be maintained while driving safely unless one's driving sucks.</p>
              <p><br>Hmm...and public transport? Well if they have a car, who wants to squeeze in crowded SBS buses and MRTs? lol.</p>
              <p>Give them a break la :) who are we to tell other families what's bonding and what's not.</p>
