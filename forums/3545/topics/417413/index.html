              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: An employer was fined on Thursday for a worker's 
              death due to heatstroke.<br><br>Cheang Heong Lan, the sole proprietor of
               Chin Kong Trading Construction, was fined S$20,000 for her failure as 
              an employer to ensure workplace safety and health measures that 
              contributed to a foreign worker death on April 25, 2009.<br><br>Two days
               after his arrival from China, Tian Wei begun fabrication work in 
              Cheang's open yard where he collapsed and died.<br><br>Tian, who came 
              from Liaoning in north-east China, where the average temperature is 
              between six and 11 degrees Celsius, succumbed to heatstroke after 
              working in the sun for five hours in the yard in Kranji Loop.<br><br>The
               average temperature that day was 32.9 degrees Celsius.<br><br>Cheang is
               the first employer to be fined under the Workplace Safety and Health 
              Act for such an offence. She could have been fined up to S$200,000 or 
              jailed up to two years or both.<br><br>Tian had not undergone any 
              acclimatisation before commencing work, the court heard.<br><br>Cheang's
               company did not have an acclimatisation programme, which would require,
               among other measures, new workers to be acclimatised over at least one 
              week by gradually increasing the workload and time spent in the hot 
              environment, the court heard.<br><br></span> </span></p>

              <p>I always support the need for more safety measures</p>
              <p>But can't help but wonder if the guy informed his boss of which part of China he came from and their weather patterns there. And I'm sure he would have felt the impact of the heat each day. Wonder if he complained to his boss or just kept quiet ...</p>

              <p>silly. this type of job sure will ask for contractor. those contractor who submiited their offer of servic ei wonder the businesses got audit them or not. like their workforce skill and training, whether they iso certified have safety and proper processes in place or not. siao you know why people look down and forever construction industry the manual worker no one wants to work anymore? because any tom hairy dick also can join and be selected as long as it s low ball to the base and cheaper than the stinking trash.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>also it sthe worker's own repossibility to ensure their own safety at work, know the weather and environment of the pace they work in before they commit. if they go into the site without safety shoes issued they should ask for it. if they staep on nails they happy claim MC and sleep? what if the foot and wounds infected they can jolly well lose a leg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>irresponsible employer, silly employee, all dumped int one. fr the glory of lowball cheapness</p>
