              <h1 class="storyheadline">Banks must consolidate: MM</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Fiona Chan &amp; Gabriel Chen</p>
              <p>TWO local banks - not three - may be the right number for Singapore, 
              so that they can expand both locally and overseas in a meaningful way, 
              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said last night.</p>
              <p>'I would have preferred personally that there be only two 
              banks, because I don't think Singapore is big enough for three banks,' 
              he told 600 bankers gathered at the Shangri-La ballroom for the 37th 
              annual Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) dinner.</p>
              <p>'But neither OCBC nor UOB was going to combine or be taken 
              over by DBS, so we're left with (three) but I think in the end, there 
              must be further consolidation.' He added: 'You can't go abroad in a big 
              way because there's a limit to what you can do in the Singapore market, 
              and you need a big solid bank with the capabilities and the capital to 
              debt ratios to go abroad.'</p>
              <p>Identifying China and India as huge potential markets in 
              which Singaporean banks can grow, as well as smaller markets in 
              Indonesia and Malaysia, Mr Lee said: 'I don't see three banks as capable
               of making that foray as two banks, maybe eventually one bank.'</p>
              <p>'I mean, you just look at the capitalisation of the big 
              banks in the US and then you look here,' he added.</p>
              <p>Singapore's banking scene already underwent a period of 
              consolidation in the late 1990s, when the number of local banks dwindled
               from seven to the present three. This came after the Government decided
               to let foreign banks have greater freedom to operate in the local 
              market, in order to increase the standards of the banking industry.</p>

              Times.</p>

              <p>Yes, why not merge M1, starhub and singtel?   Guess Temasek earns convenient quick big bucks from these.  For this he will never want to suggest consolidation for these, indirectly under him.     </p>
              <p>He is too free as he said these days he has nothing much to do only do some forecasting.    With so much free time he is now focusing on the banks.   The bankers and others working in the banks are going to hate him for this if the consolidation materialises.     pi shang ni de wu ya mouth, old lee !</p>
              <p>Time for him to bid farewell and rest in peace forever!</p>

              <p>Why is this old man so keen to comment about these local banks?   Is he aiming to get DBS to take over OCBC and UOB?   If he opens his mouth to get UOB and OCBC merge with DBS, die die OCBC and UOB may have to obey him.    He never changes his nuisance lol, that time he was not happy about having 2 TV stations mediacorpse and mediawork in Singapore stating that sg is too small to have two TV stations compete with each other and as such there is no more mediawork by SPH.    Now I guess he is going to do the same to OCBC and UOB.    </p>
              <p>Better learn to mind his own business and shut up.   </p>
              <p>Perhaps, OCBC and UOB should just contribute part of their profit to him to shut his mouth.     Everything is money to him.   </p>

              <p>It was reported a few months ago that DBS profits down and UOB and OCBC were doing better than DBS, probably this old man is jealous of UOB and OCBC and want to have a hand to control these two banks.  People make money he jealous.</p>
              <p>Always like to tell others what to do.   Actually, it is always what he wants people to do not what people want to do themselves.    I hope king of hell is getting ready to counterattack him when this old lee reports to hell to tell him what to do.</p>
