              <p><span class="update">By Patwant Singh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 24 April 2011 1610 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Environment and Water Resources Minster Yaacob Ibrahim said he is not 
              worried, but disappointed by the negative reactions to his remarks on 
              the teaching of the Malay language as a foreign language.<br><br>Dr 
              Yaacob made the remarks while addressing 200 Malay-Muslim pre-university
               students at a dialogue session in Ang Mo Kio last Tuesday.<br><br>The 
              minister was responding to a question from the media at the unveiling of
               the upgrading plans for Geylang West Community Club.<br><br>Dr Yaacob 
              had at a dialogue session, suggested that methods used in teaching 
              foreign languages could be explored, to find out if these offer more 
              ideas in teaching Malay to children who do not use Malay as a primary 
              language at home.<br><br>Joining Dr Yaacob at the event at Kallang 
              Heights was Dr Lee Boon Yang, advisor to the Jalan Besar Grass Roots 
              Organisations, who is retiring from politics.<br><br>Also present were Minister Lui Tuck Yew, Ms Denise Phua and new PAP candidate Edwin Tong.<br><br>The proposed upgraded community centre will have new facilities and be WIFI-enabled.<br><br>The event also saw activities to promote and cultivate recycling and environment-friendly habits.<br><br>Dr
               Yaacob, who is also Minister-in-Charge of Muslim Affairs, said that he 
              was quoted out of context as far as the Malay Language issue is 
              concerned.<br><br>"The clarification by MENDAKI both in English and 
              Malay - I hope will clarify the matter as much as possible what I 
              actually said about Malay language. There are certain elements that 
              continue to stoke the language issue for whatever gains and motives that
               they might have in mind. <br><br>"But I am confident that our community
               is stronger than that and they can see through all of these things. 
              Rest assured that our support for the Malay language will continue and 
              at the end of the day, we want the language to remain relevant and 
              vibrant not only for the current generation, but for generations to 
              come."<br><br>MENDAKI had in a letter elaborated on what was said at the
               dialogue session. The letter said that "Minister-in-Charge of Muslim 
              Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim, who replied, clearly shared a common concern in 
              improving and evolving the teaching of Malay to maintain its 
              functionality."<br><br>Promoting the use of the Malay language was a key
               concern among the participants at the forum which is part of the 
              continuing outreach by MENDAKI to engage youth on issues concerning the 
              community.<br><br>Dr Yaacob's remarks were made in reply to a question on the use of formal Malay and colloquial Malay.<br><br>He
               noted that as the use of English at home becomes more prevalent, more 
              creative ways must be found to keep Malay vibrant and relevant.<br><br>He
               also stated that Singapore is unlike, for instance, the rural northern 
              states of Malaysia where Malay is the predominant language compared with
               the more urbanised Malaysian cities like Kuala Lumpur or Johor Baru, 
              where English usage is also rising.<br><br>He cited the use of the 
              movies of the late P. Ramlee (an evergreen Malay entertainment icon), 
              Malay adventure stories and Malay classical literature as content that 
              could be made to teach Malay contextually and creatively to the young.<br><br>To
               spur further discussion, he suggested that methods used in teaching 
              foreign languages could be explored, to find out if these offer more 
              ideas in teaching Malay to children who do not use Malay as a primary 
              language at home.<br><br>- CNA </span></span></p>
