              <div class="byline">THE National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological 
              University (NTU) on Thursday announced fee hikes of 4 to nearly 18 per 
              cent for this year's cohorts.
              <p>Singaporean undergraduates enrolling in NUS's Architecture 
              and Business courses this academic year will pay 7 per cent more, while 
              fees for Law and Pharmacy will go up by 10 per cent. Tuition fees for 
              all other NUS undergraduate courses will rise by 4 per cent for local 
              students.</p>
              <p>At NTU, those entering non-business undergraduate courses 
              will pay about 8 per cent more, while business programme students will 
              have to fork out almost 18 per cent more.</p>
              <p>Explaining that the fee adjustments are to help defray 
              operating costs, Professor Tan Eng Chye, NUS Provost and Deputy 
              President (Academic Affairs), said: 'The new fees remain very 
              competitive with international programmes of distinction. The Ministry 
              of Education will continue to subsidise the larger part of the 
              University's operating and capital costs.'</p>
              <p>Differentiated fee increases for Permanent Residents (PRs) 
              and International Students will also kick in this year. Fees for PRs at 
              the two universities will increase by between $720 and $2,810, while 
              International Student fees will go up by between $800 and $3,120.</p>
              <p>NTU has also introduced different fees for Business and 
              non-Business undergraduates starting from their freshman year. 
              Previously, first year undergraduates in NTU paid the same fees 
              regardless of their course, with higher fees for Accountancy and 
              Business students only taking effect in the second year.</p>
              <p>The university fee hike comes after Polytechnics and ITEs 
              raised their fees for this academic year, with further increases for PRs
               and international students as well.</p>

              <p><strong>Singapore's 3 public universities, NUS, NTU, SMU to raise tuition fees</strong><br> <span class="update">By Satish Cheney, Zul Othman, Saifulbahri Ismail

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore three public universities, NUS, NTU and SMU 
              are raising tuition fees for the incoming cohort of students in August.
              <br> <br> The increase will be sharper for permanent residents and foreign 
              students, compared to Singapore citizens.
              <br> <br> Universities said this is in line with the government's policy of 
              reflecting the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.
              <br> <br> Undergraduate fees for freshmen at SMU will go up by three per cent.
              <br> <br> Singaporeans enrolling into NUS will pay four per cent more.
              <br> <br> But those doing Architecture, Business, Law and Pharmacy will see an 
              increase of between seven and ten per cent.
              <br> <br> For Permanent Residents, it will go up by between S$720 and S$2,810 with
               foreign students paying more between S$800 and S$3,120 more.
              <br> <br> Over at NTU, Singapore citizens will pay 1.6 per cent more, annualised 
              over four years for non-business programmes to hit S$6,890.
              <br> <br> For business programmes, it will be 3.4 per cent up, annualised over 
              three years to hit $7,490.
              <br> <br> PRs and foreign students will pay more.
              <br> <br> For NTU, all PRs for the incoming cohort receiving tuition grants will 
              be charged 20 per cent more than Singapore Citizens, up from the current
               10 per cent.
              <br> <br> International Students will be charged 60 per cent more, up from the 
              current 50 per cent.
              <br> <br> 19-year-old Dawn Poh just graduated from Anderson Junior College while 
              her elder brother is studying in the UK, she's keen on enrolling in 
              NTU's arts faculty.
              <br> <br> She said: "Of course, none of us are too glad about the fee hike because
               it will mean we have to pay more but as a whole I think we're not 
              affected that much.  Compared to most other places like Australia or UK,
               Singapore actually has low fees."
              <br> <br> And it's not just students like Dawn who will be affected.
              <br> <br> The universities will also be lifting the one-year fee increase 
              deferment that last year's cohort enjoyed.
              <br> <br> Their fee hike structure will be different from that of the incoming 
              students.
              <br> <br> There will also be fee increases for post-graduate students.
              <br> <br> The university fee hike comes after Polytechnics and ITEs raised their 
              fees for this academic year, with PRs and foreign students paying more 
              as well.  - CNA/vm </span></p>
