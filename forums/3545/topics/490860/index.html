              <p>I am 19 years old, a citizen of Singapore. I have done some part-time jobs (self-sought &amp; personal) and one internship (via Polytechnic's 4 credit-unit ITP). I believe I can represent my age group to answer the questions.</p>
                  <p>1. It really depends on working hours and the number of hours. Because most of us are studying full-time. It's not that we like to work "shift work" (part-time?) or what. We cannot work full-time, otherwise we will compromise our studies (ie. our GPA). Sometimes, if we really cannot make it, we really cannot work. This explains why I have done some part-time jobs, and not only one; I "jump around".</p>
                  <p>2. I do not understand what you mean by "start early". Well, after we achieve our academic goals (eg. Graduate from the University) and complete our National Service (for the boys), we start working.</p>
                   <p>2. Everyone starts from entry level, and progress upwards over time. I do not know how many actually want to take on a position in the management level, because the higher the level, the greater the risks. Of course, the greater the risks, the higher the pay. It's not only the young people. I believe everyone is aware of this, or at least most people. I do not know how many people are aware of the risks AND want to take on a position in the management level. For me, I would see how first. If I can handle, then I will consider a management position - if it is offered to me.</p>

              <p>Hi Jurongresident.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your response.</p>
              <p>Nice and I wish you all the best. </p>
              <p>I hope you don't defer your NS. Many applied for deferment because they are worried about NS life and give the excuses because of their studies. They are wasting time. If they have just served that full-time NS and then continue their studies after full NS, then probably they can start their career early, especially for those who really not interested to continue their studies or really not interested to pursue a diploma/degree, they just want to work for a livelihood. They are able to start early with working experience and climb up the ladder. They can take up courses that are relevant to their work or they can also continue studying part-time after work to upgrade their academic qualification.</p>
              <p>By starting early at least they can build their CPF, Savings, settle down, own a home for themselves or even start a business for themselves. Their working experience will be an advantage to give them some ideas what they want to do in their lives. </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">About shift works. Sadly to say this but majority of young Singaporeans do not like to work shifts or long hours especially in the service industry.  And many young Singaporeans want to start immediately as management staffs after they graduated from Polytechnics or University unlike the older Singaporeans.</span></p>
              <p>I see you have a passion for public buses and mrt train in Singapore. I hope you go for that profession with SMRT after you have completed your studies and full NS. SMRT really need young Singaporeans in this transport industry. </p>

              BEYOND THE PAPER CHASE? 
              
              Is a degree really a prerequisite to success in Singapore? Can students, parents and employers move beyond a fixation with paper qualifications? How will the latest proposals help polytechnic and ITE graduates seize the opportunities and good jobs of tomorrow?

              <p>Thats the problem. They need to review the work and family balance life? Just like in the western world I guess. Since we regard ourselves as a 1st world, most Singaporeans too would like to have those work and family balance lifestyle like in the western world isn't it? If not, just get the foreign workers to do those shift works and don't complaint about them.</p>
              <p>In the past, ah boy and ah girl, age around 6 could take care of themselves. Those with siblings would be better of course. They knew how to wash their own clothings and shoes, iron their own clothings, cooked simple meal for themselves and clean the house too until their parent returned home from work. They knew how to take care of one another. Infants and those todlers age about 5 without siblings were being taken care by their grandparents or friends/neighbours. Those got money engaged maids.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In Australia and New Zealand, shopping centres close very early like 6pm or 6pm plus, and they still attracted many tourists.</span></p>
              <p>And NS too. Most of the young Singaporeans work force are serving NS. So they need to look at it too. Shorten the NS period or Serve 1 time, no more reservist or abolish that NS totally. </p>

              <p>I am a 14 and a half boy who is still studying in a Secondary school. To answer your question, it begs another question too. What will change in the future? Our (youths') opinion would change accordingly to the changes in the workforce and economy. Some might not want to work in singapore anymore. So, they would migrate. Some might want to stay and persevere working in singapore.</p>
              <p>For me? I would continue studying in singapore and complete my NS. By that time, I would have already be 27 or 28. I plan to work overseas but continue being a singaporean and serve my reservice. Although I'm a pure singaporean, I would also want the best for my country and decide to work in another country for a better paying job so that I could support my family better and at the same time commit to helping the communities in Singapore.</p>

              <p>For male Singaporeans who wish to work and migrate completely to another country, they have to wait at least they are 41 years old because at that age, you would be ORD from reservist.</p>
              <p>And pertaining to your intention to work abroad, for male Singaporeans could be quite difficult because foreign companies would not see and would not agree about your obligation/commitment as NSMen. It would be difficult for you to apply leaves and most of them ended up being rejected from working in that foreign companies. These foreign companies abroad are not obligated to let you go on leave to return to Singapore for Reservist ICT. Probably, you could only have a very stable job, good career and high income overseas after you have ORD from Reservist.</p>

              <p>Thats the problem. They need to review the work and family
              balance life? Just like in the western world I guess. Since we
              regard ourselves as a 1st world, most Singaporeans too would like
              to have those work and family balance lifestyle like in the western
              world isn't it? If not, just get the foreign workers to do those
              shift works and don't complaint about them.</p>
              <p>In the past, ah boy and ah girl, age around 6 could take care of
              themselves. Those with siblings would be better of course. They
              knew how to wash their own clothings and shoes, iron their own
              clothings, cooked simple meal for themselves and clean the house
              too until their parent returned home from work. They knew how to
              take care of one another. Infants and those todlers age about 5
              without siblings were being taken care by their grandparents or
              friends/neighbours. Those got money engaged maids.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In Australia and New Zealand,
              shopping centres close very early like 6pm or 6pm plus, and they
              still attracted many tourists.</span></p>
              <p>And NS too. Most of the young Singaporeans work force are
              serving NS. So they need to look at it too. Shorten the NS period
              or Serve 1 time, no more reservist or abolish that NS
              totally. </p>

              <p>The in the past you indicated should be referring those living from the 60s to the 80s. <br><br>Regarding to NS, I think you can forget about the idea. They will never change. What I suggest for the younger generation is study aboard, get a job there and don't come back. Serve that 2 years NS before graduate studies. Then don't come back. <br><br>In regards to the topic, maybe you would like to ask in another point of view, how much harder young Singaporeans have to work to fulfill their dreams and aspirations? <br>Every generation that works harder, the reaches of basic living needs <span style="line-height: 19.696px;">(i.e. house, car)</span><span style="line-height: 19.696px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">becomes more expensive to another level after they worked hard to achieve the higher income to achieve these aspirations.</span></p>

              <p>21 this year, started my rotating shift work 2 years ago not a nurse/doctor. Not easy to do night shift in a hospital to be wide awake for 11 hours with a midget pay of basic 1.3+k without shift allowance. Plus and minus take home pay 1.2k or 1.3k if you're lucky.</p>
              <p>What I've gotten this 2 year? Loads of sickness and weight gained.</p>
              <p>At any age, any generation if you need money you're willing to do that job no matter what and then accumulate money to upgrade yourself to get more basic pay.</p>
