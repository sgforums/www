              <p><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">Andrew Loh</span> | <span class="provider org">SingaporeScene</span> – <abbr title="2012-07-04T14:14:17Z">Wed, Jul 4, 2012</abbr></cite></p>
              <p><strong>COMMENT</strong></p>
              <p>Since the release of the first part of the video recording on the 
              forum on xenophobia, some have questioned why the bloggers involved did 
              not outright condemn xenophobic expression online and offline. The 
              forum, called "Online|Offline", is an initiative by several bloggers to 
              discuss the hot issues of the day. <span style="color: #000000;">Xenophobia</span><strong> </strong>was the topic chosen for the inaugural forum.</p>
              <p>First, there is a misunderstanding that the forum is some sort of 
              "movement" against xenophobia. It was never intended to be. The purpose 
              of the dialogue was to kickstart discussion on the matter, especially 
              online, on the issues related to the topic. Also, the bloggers each have
               their own views on the matter, and they do not — whether individually 
              or collectively — represent other bloggers or the blogging community as a
               whole.</p>
              <p>But what about the topic itself, which has raised concern among 
              government ministers and members of the public? I do not believe we are 
              at the stage where xenophobia — the irrational fear or hatred for 
              foreigners or things foreign — is a serious matter for the moment. I do,
               however, believe that we are headed in that direction, if we do nothing
               to look into it and fix the root cause or causes.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans, as filmmaker Martyn See
               said at the forum, have always welcomed foreigners. Singaporeans, as 
              indeed people anywhere, were not born xenophobic. In our island, 
              especially, which has always been opened to foreign influences, 
              Singaporeans are by and large accepting of foreigners and things 
              foreign. Just look around you — in entertainment, at work, etc. We have 
              and enjoy pleasures from many different and diverse nations and 
              cultures.</p>
              <p>That is not to say, however, that there is no unhappiness about the 
              number of foreigners in our midst, or that there is no fear of how this 
              has influenced the way we live, work and play. It has affected our way 
              of life, there are no doubts about it. Just look at the public transport
               system, the prices of public housing flats, the weekend at the parks, 
              or even your neighbourhood.</p>
              <p>There is unhappiness and most of us recognise this.</p>
              <p>And this has led to the expression, online and offline, of anger 
              towards members of the expat or foreign community. Some irrational while
               others more measured. All, however, are an extension of a deeper 
              malaise — which, to put it bluntly, has emerged from a government policy
               which was ill-conceived.</p>
              <p>While the government has explained that the influx of 2 million 
              foreigners onto our shores was an economic necessity — we either take 
              advantage of the opportunities which come our way or we will lose out — 
              questions of the wisdom of allowing such an open-door policy, especially
               on the consequences for our social cohesion and infrastructural 
              readiness, is now being raised.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister has tweaked some of his government's policies to 
              "put Singaporeans first". And so we see certain policies tilted to weigh
               more in favour of Singaporeans. While these are welcomed, the more 
              important issue is the presence of the 2 million foreigners which the 
              government has said little about, except to reiterate that we need them 
              for our economic progress. "More investments leads to more jobs which means more foreigners", a Straits Times headline said.</p>
              <p>That is all well and good, except that the everyday reality of life 
              here is causing social friction and unhappiness. And these are not 
              limited to Singaporeans alone. The foreigners themselves are 
              increasingly feeling it too. In the end, we may end up with both sides 
              being unhappy and suspicious of each other. We may have economic growth —
               but we will be a society divided. And that is a tinderbox waiting for a
               match.</p>
              <p>Where do we go from here then?</p>
              <p>First, we need to go beyond the labelling of expression of 
              unhappiness as xenophobic or xenophobia. These negative sentiments did 
              not arise because Singaporeans were born with them. They are more 
              pronounced now, in the last few years especially, because of national 
              policies. While we may condemn xenophobic expression, it would be folly 
              to think that that is all that we need to do to rein in xenophobia, or 
              even these negative sentiments.</p>
              <p>Second, we do seriously need a national dialogue on our economic 
              strategy, going forward. If the presence of 2 million foreigners is 
              directly linked to our economic growth, as the government has constantly
               insisted, then we need to decide — as a nation — if this is what we 
              want to continue to do, or if there is another way forward.</p>
              <p>Third, we must, despite all the unhappiness, realise the great 
              potential that Singapore has to truly become a great city. The 
              fundamental pre-requisites to be one are already there. We will next 
              need to adopt a more global mindset to accept the presence of 
              foreigners, as our city continues to evolve into something greater.</p>
              <p>The crux of the matter then is how do we strike that sweet spot where
               we have a good balance between the number of foreigners and economic 
              growth. Both are important. The unhappiness is that we have missed that 
              spot and have veered towards an irrational dependence on foreign talent 
              and labour.</p>
              <p>To resolve this whole conundrum, we will need for everyone to have a 
              say, and for the government to heed the voices which are coming from the
               ground.</p>
              <p>It is unacceptable that almost 40 per cent of our population is made 
              up of foreigners. No other country on earth, besides Dubai, has such a 
              large proportion of foreigners. Is it then any surprise that this has 
              led to fear of or expression of xenophobia?</p>
              <p>Instead of looking at the irrational outbursts of unhappiness in some
               quarters, we should instead look at the irrational policies which have 
              given rise to them. How else will we root out such sentiments if not to 
              look at the root cause?</p>
              <p>And that, in a nutshell, was something which all the bloggers at the forum agreed on.</p>
