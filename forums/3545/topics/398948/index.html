              <p>A VETERAN dive instructor died on a recreational dive at a wreck off 
              the South China Sea last Saturday.</p>
              <p>Mr Khoo Soo Seng, 68, suffered a heart attack while on a 
              recreational dive at the Seven Skies wreck - a popular dive site off 
              Pulau Aur on Malaysia's east coast.</p>
              <p>His family told The Straits Times that Mr Khoo was familiar 
              with the popular dive spot. He lost consciousness while surfacing from 
              his dive and was surfaced by his dive buddy.</p>
              <p>He was resuscitated on the dive boat. His breathing and 
              pulse resumed for a while but eventually faded away. Mr Khoo was 
              declared dead at Mersing Hospital.</p>
              <p>Mr Khoo was well-known as a pioneer and veteran of the 
              diving industry. He was a former president of the Singapore Underwater 
              Federation. Since the late 1970s, he had been promoting ecological 
              awareness and educational programmes for divers here and in the region, 
              said his family in a statement.</p>
              <p>His projects included conducting an archaeological and 
              scientific expedition with Russian divers in 2004 on one of Russia's 
              famous wrecks, the Cheluskin, which sank in 1934.</p>
