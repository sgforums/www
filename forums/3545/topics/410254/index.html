              <p>WHILE I agree with the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports that there is a broad base of active agers ("Many ways to make 
              active ageing golden"; Aug 26), more can be done to engage the elderly.</p>
              <p>People born in the 1930s and 1940s went through life in a 
              very different Singapore. Retirement planning was not a priority then 
              and very few were adequately prepared when it came time for them to 
              retire. Longer lifespans, the rising cost of living, poor health and 
              little savings pose challenges to this cohort of elderly Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As a senior, I am not surprised that only 5.5 per cent of 
              the elderly here take part in clubs or group activities ("Not-so-golden 
              years for the elderly in Singapore"; Aug 23). The urge to participate in
               mass line dancing and singing is simply not in the DNA of some elderly 
              folk.</p>
              <p>Perhaps they are more attuned to leisure activities close to
               their hearts and they are happy with the simple pleasures in life. Can 
              society help them to fulfil their wishes with more tangible measures?</p>
              <p>The Government should consider initiatives to enhance active
               ageing, perhaps by raising subsidies for health-care services and 
              introducing free public transport for those aged above 70. Cumbersome 
              restrictions on bus rides and movie tickets should also be removed.</p>
              <p>There are many alternatives to structured group activities 
              for seniors. They can derive joy from simple things like meeting friends
               for a meal at a hawker centre, watching movies, going to the library, 
              taking short trips and cruises or simply strolling in the park with 
              loved ones.</p>

              <p>Group activities are organised by the young and the elderly don't really have the same stamina as they do. After one such hectic "herding", most of the elderly will take weeks to recuperate if at all.</p>
              <p>I pity those who believe in MCYS.</p>
