              <div class="kicker">VICTIMISED MIGRANT WORKERS</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Protect, don't punish, them</h1>
              <p>THE Ministry of Home Affairs, in its reply on Monday ('Wilful breach 
              of border security can't be condoned') may have misinterpreted the crux 
              of the letter from Home, the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration 
              Economics ('Prosecute human traffickers and protect scam victims'; Aug 
              10).</p>
              <p>The point of Home's letter was about a greater need to 
              protect migrant workers who have been victims of scam agents and punish 
              those who deliberately deceive them. Instead, the ministry emphasised 
              the need to protect Singapore's borders about which there is no dispute.
               Singapore must protect its borders, and this includes thorough 
              investigations to prosecute human traffickers.</p>
              <p>However, it is not always the case that humans are smuggled 
              covertly in the boot of cars or in small speedboats.</p>
              <p>A critical distinction needs to be made between immigration 
              offenders who may have breached immigration law as a result of the 
              wilful deception of others, and criminals who are a proven threat to the
               community and national security.</p>
              <p>The first situation may arise when migrant workers are 
              coerced or deceived into accepting and paying for jobs overseas, only to
               realise after their arrival that:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li> The jobs don't exist; </li>
              <li> The working conditions are not as promised; </li>
              <li> Their work passes are not legitimate; and </li>
              <li> Their jobs are not legal.
              <p>Often in debt after having paid thousands of dollars in 
              recruitment fees, such victims may choose to stay in such situations for
               fear of further punishment and deportation.</p>
              <p>The current tendency towards criminalising all immigration 
              offenders without discrimination results in such workers being punished,
               despite the fact that it is the scam agents and unethical employers who
               deceived them who should be fined and jailed.</p>
              <p>Authorities tasked with protecting our borders and keeping 
              Singapore safe should also offer protection to those who have been 
              cheated and exploited and currently reside in Singapore, regardless of 
              their immigration status.</p>
              <p>With our efficient networks and technological prowess, 
              enhanced coordination between the immigration authorities and the 
              Ministry of Manpower can lead to greater improvements on both fronts.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">MHA: We didn't misinterpret letter</h1>
              <p>WE REFER to Ms Stephanie Chok's letter ('Protect, don't punish, them';
               Aug 21). We have not misunderstood or misinterpreted the letter from 
              Home, the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics ('Prosecute 
              human traffickers and protect scam victims'; Aug 10).</p>
              <p>Indeed, we have no disagreement with Home. As our reply 
              ('Wilful breach of border security can't be condoned'; Aug 16) pointed 
              out, we should treat foreign workers who have been cheated or deceived, 
              like we do all victims of crime and provide protection of the law and 
              investigate to prosecute the offender.</p>
              <p>If Ms Chok or Home has evidence and information to share in 
              such cases, we welcome it so that we can investigate and charge the 
              offenders.</p>
              <p>What we cannot agree with is Home's assertion that all 
              illegal workers in Singapore should be treated as 'undocumented 
              migrants' and that they should be exempt from liability for offences 
              they may have committed under the Immigration Act. No one should be 
              above the law whether he is a foreigner or local, worker or employer.</p>
              <p>Those who breach our border security by illegally entering 
              the country pose a serious security threat and will be prosecuted. Those
               who enter the country legally but disregard our laws and overstay must 
              also be accountable for their actions under the law, even though 
              consideration may be given to the mitigating circumstances relevant to 
              their cases in determining eventual prosecution outcomes.</p>
              <p>This includes their being victims of deception, cheating and
               the cooperation they provide to the authorities to apprehend those who 
              have exploited them.</p>
              <p>Many of such syndicates operate in the countries of these 
              illegal workers. Even though they may be outside our jurisdiction, we 
              are prepared to work with the law enforcement and immigration 
              authorities of these countries and provide all information which we may 
              have to assist in their investigation against such syndicates which 
              exploit migrant workers.</p>
