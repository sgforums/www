              <p>WRITER Chong Zi Liang said he could not take part in conversations
              with 50-year-old members of his extended family because he could not
              speak Cantonese, which prevented him from bonding with them
              ("Confessions of a Canto flop"; last Saturday). He was also unable to
              order roast duck in a Cantonese restaurant in New York.</p>
              <p>These are really the least of our Chinese language worries.</p>
              <p>In 30 years' time, Cantonese will be extinct in Singapore. We are allowing a beautiful language to die in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Listen
              to a pop song that is sung in Cantonese, then in Mandarin, and you can
              hear the difference.The Cantonese version sounds so elegant and
              sonorous, the Mandarin one, clinical and flat.</p>
              <p>When
              I visited Shantou last year, it was joyous to hear my mother tongue,
              Teochew, spoken everywhere. It was such a culturally enriching
              experience. Street life was just that much more colourful, because of
              the use of that language.</p>
              <p>The death of the major
              Chinese dialects here (Cantonese, Teochew, Hokkien, Hainanese) would
              mean their respective operas would be dead here too.</p>
              <p>A big part of our collective culture is dying.</p>

              <p>how sad indeed to see the different chinese languages becoming extinct in SG...</p>
              <p>to be technically correct, i read somewhere in the past that the mandarin that we now speak and learn in schools originates as a court language in beijing... the other so called dialects are just as authentic as any languages, and not a variant of mandarin...</p>
              <p>i also saw this book in the national geographic shop at viviocity sometime back which talks about dying languages around the world, and how we are in danger of losing entire cultures, different worldviews, religious views etc. which are contained in the language words and grammer...</p>
              <p>don't let these languages die out in SG... the experiences of young children will be much "poorer" when that happens</p>

              are allowing a beautiful language to die in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Listen to a pop song that is sung in Cantonese, then in
              Mandarin, and you can hear the difference.The Cantonese version
              sounds so elegant and sonorous, the Mandarin one, clinical and
              flat.</p>
              <p>When I visited Shantou last year, it was joyous to hear my
              mother tongue, Teochew, spoken everywhere. It was such a culturally
              enriching experience. Street life was just that much more
              colourful, because of the use of that language.</p>
              <p>The death of the major Chinese dialects here (Cantonese,
              Teochew, Hokkien, Hainanese) would mean their respective operas
              would be dead here too.</p>
              <p>A big part of our collective culture is dying.</p>

              <p>Although some people are still using the dialects now, I would say they are neither the same as the current corresponding dialect at China side nor the same as they were when they first implanted here by our ancestor.</p>
              <p>Singapore dialects has become a different breed altogether, so no point reviving by learning from China directly, I feel it's better for it to be passed down from our own native people (rather than learning from Cantonese movies or Taiwanese Hokkien shows with their non-Singaporean accents and usage).</p>

              <p>When talking to people around me, they can't even say the Hokkien words for eg.: "claws", "ladel"  (of course a lot more, but recently these people intrigued me recently with their inability to say these common words)</p>

              <p>i also saw this book in the national geographic shop at
              viviocity sometime back which talks about dying languages around
              the world, and how we are in danger of losing entire cultures,
              different worldviews, religious views etc. which are contained in
              the language words and grammer...</p>
              <p>don't let these languages die out in SG... the experiences

              <p>Ya actually all languages are dialects of some mother languages, it's always Political aspect to determine which language become official which languages becomes dialects (sub-status).  Therefore, there is no such thing as one language "higher" than the other one.</p>

              <p>Yes. In many countries, the purpose of reducing languages is as simple as reducing cost to publish materials in many languages, reducing cost in signages in many languages, reducing cost in official documents in many languages, reducing cost in education to hire and train and support the education in many languages , reducing cost in media to open TV channels, radio broadcasts, and newspapers in many languages</p>

              <p><br>Maybe what you said is true. But China is a big country and I believe there are still pockets of dialect speaking people there who can communicate dialects in their pure forms.</p>
              <p>The Teochew I heard from these two China students was indeed in its pure form - not diluted with Mandarin. I know because I wasn't eavesdropping but with them and heard them spoke Teochew among themselves for a long time in its pure form - a rarity I never encounter for a long time.   </p>
