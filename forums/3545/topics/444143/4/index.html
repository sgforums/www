              <p>Their mindset is as long as the basement of the towers is dry, they dun care whether the rest of the orchard road is flooded.</p>
              <p>You wet, your busines.</p>
              <p>But, Singapore have already water taxi in place to address the issue of transporation during ponding at orchard road.</p>
              <p>Their findings is the floodgate did not fail as it stopped the water from flowing from the walkway to the basement but they did not look into the possibility of the channel being full and causing a backflow of the water into the basement.</p>

              <p><strong>PUB should not have used the word "ponding": Balakrishnan</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 09 January 2012 1504 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              capacity of Stamford Canal will be increased by at least a third to 
              reduce the risk of flooding along Singapore's shopping belt of Orchard 
              Road.<br><br>Environment Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in Parliament
               on Monday, that a consultancy study is underway and is expected to be 
              completed by May.<br><br>He said such projects can be costly, but his ministry is prepared to undertake longer term investments.<br><br>But he cautioned that Singapore faces constraints.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said said: "I think many members will be familiar that whenever PUB has a drain, we have a drainage reserve.<br><br>"In
               other words, we always have space where if we need to deepen or widen a
               drain, we will take land from the owners or public utilities.<br><br>"Well
               in the case of Stamford Canal, which lies under Orchard Road, we've run
               out of drainage capacity. Secondly, to now embark on further surgery on
               Stamford Canal, would cost enormous disruption to services and the 
              operations, pedestrian flow and vehicular flow along Orchard Road. I put
               all this because I want you all to understand that we are constrained."<br><br>The
               Stamford Canal starts upstream at the Botanic Gardens and Dempsey Hill,
               passes through Bras Basah and City Hall areas, before draining into the
               Marina Reservoir. <br><br>The area of special concern is a basin between Cuscaden and Cairnhill Roads at Orchard Road.<br><br>There have been three episodes of flooding in this area over the past eighteen months. <br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said the episodes are part of a larger pattern of rainfall change in Singapore over the past decades.<br><br>On
               16 June 2010, some 100mm of rain fell in the area over two hours, 
              causing Orchard Road between Cuscaden and Cairnhill Roads to flood to a 
              depth of 300mm.<br><br>On 5 June 2011, some 124mm of rain fell over about four hours, and caused the Tanglin area to be flooded to a depth of 100mm.<br><br>Compared
               to the incidents on 16 June 2010 and 5 June 2011, the latest incident 
              on 23 December 2011, saw the heaviest rainfall of 153 mm recorded over 
              three hours.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan noted that Orchard Road remained passable to traffic due to the completion of road raising works in June 2011. <br><br>But he noted that any form of flooding needs to be addressed.<br><br>Dr
               Balakrishnan said: "The technical difference between a flood, a flash 
              flood and a pond - let me just say that as far as I'm concerned. <br><br>"PUB should not have used the word, "ponding". <br><br>"As far as I'm concerned, I call a spade a spade, a flood is a flood.<br><br>"As
               long as there is water accumulating somewhere, where it is not supposed
               to be, as long as it has implications on human safety, on business 
              operations, that is a flood, that is a problem that needs to be 
              resolved, PUB and the building owners must resolve it."<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said PUB is evaluating various options.<br><br>This
               include storm water detention ponds in the upstream section, or a new 
              canal to divert storm water from upstream portions of the catchment to 
              the Singapore River.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said: "These detention ponds
               are not going to be cheap, to give you an idea of scale, they have a 
              capacity of 40 to 50 Olympic sized pools. <br><br>"We will need land two
               to three times of a football pitch, putting aside land like that in a 
              precious real estate in the Orchard Road area, I think members will 
              agree, (it) is something we don't enter into likely.<br><br>"I set this 
              very simple challenge to PUB. Let's us assume that we will continue to 
              have storms, exactly similar to what we have in the last three episodes.
               In fact, let us assume further.<br><br>"Let us assume that it may be 
              even worse than that. The reply that the engineers came back to me is, 
              is that "if we want to able to be almost guaranteed that we can cope 
              with similar storms of the last eighteen months, then in the long run we
               need to increase the capacity of Stamford Canal by 30 per cent."<br><br>Dr
               Balakrishnan said flood protection measures undertaken by building 
              owners in Orchard Road over the past 18 months were generally effective,
               except for the basements of Liat Towers and Lucky Plaza that were 
              overwhelmed by the heavy downpour on 23 December. <br><br>PUB is already
               working closely with the building owners at Liat Towers and Lucky Plaza
               to fine tune their flood protection measures, and review operating 
              procedures.<br><br>Minister Vivian Balakrishnan has met the building 
              owners of Liat Towers and Lucky Plaza, and is reassured that they will 
              do their best to collaborate with PUB in resolving localised flooding 
              problems."<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan said the panel of experts appointed 
              middle of last year to review the overall drainage design and flood 
              protection measures, is expected to complete its work by this week. <br><br>Their findings and recommendations will be shared with the public.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Upsizing Stamford Canal not best solution: expert panel</strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">By Evelyn Choo/Tan Qiuyi | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 10 January 2012 1515 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE:  The 
              panel of experts appointed to review Singapore's flood protection 
              measures submitted its report on Tuesday, after a six-month consultation
               period.<br><br>It proposed that national water agency PUB collect 
              high-resolution data to get a better idea of Singapore's flood modelling
               profile, and the government look into new ways to tackle the surface 
              runoff upstream rather than focus all efforts on the downstream.<br><br>The
               panel said a general widening of drains and canals in Singapore is not 
              the best long-term solution for flood prevention. This holds true for 
              the Stamford Canal which, the panel noted, had been designed to the 
              standards in place at that time rather than standards more typical 
              today. <br><br>It said the canal no longer has the capacity to drain 
              away the volume of rainfall generated by storms like those in June 2010 
              and June 2011.<br><br>The panel does not believe that the whole-scale 
              upsizing of the Stamford Canal is the best long-term solution to 
              addressing flood risks on Orchard Road.<br><br>It suggested the 
              government look into ways to store water in the Orchard Road area 
              further upstream, such as through the use of roof tops, a water 
              retention pond, storage tanks along the Stamford Canal's route to 
              relieve its burden or a diversion canal to bring the water elsewhere.<br><br>New
               buildings should have water-retention roofs to make up for increased 
              urbanisation and existing buildings should be retrofitted, said the 
              panel.<br><br>Pavements could also be made porous to absorb some water 
              and preventing all of it from rushing into canals, added the 12-member 
              panel comprising local and international experts.<br><br>These measures control flooding at the source, said a member of the panel, Professor David Balmforth. <br><br>The
               panel acknowledged that these measures and the gathering of more 
              accurate higher-resolution data on water drainage will require 
              significant investment. <br><br>But Professor Balmforth, MWH UK's 
              executive technical director, said: "What the experience in the rest of 
              the world shows...is that the overall cost of doing it that way is 
              generally significantly less than if you concentrate on trying to 
              increase conveyance capacity all the time."<br><br>The panel said 
              Singapore should also look into drainage systems that can deliver 
              multiple benefits, for instance, water storage solutions that can serve 
              as a source of water in times of drought.<br><br>The panel was appointed
               on June 30 last year to review drainage design and flood protection 
              measures that will be implemented in Singapore over the next decade. It 
              is chaired by Professor Chan Eng Soon, dean of the faculty of 
              engineering at the National University of Singapore (NUS). </span></span></p>
