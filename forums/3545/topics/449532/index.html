              <div class="font10">By Romesh Navaratnarajah</div>
              <div class="font10"><br></div>
              <div class="font10">Housing and Development Board (HDB) resale homes in Singapore are more unaffordable than private homes, <em>PropertyGuru</em> can exclusively reveal. They are also classed as being ‘severely unaffordable’.<br><br>Using
               a globally-recognised formula where the Median Multiple (median house 
              price divided by the annual median household income) is used to 
              calculate housing affordability, <a href="http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/singapore-property-listing/hdb">HDB resale flats</a> are also classed as being severely unaffordable using a scale which was
               most recently published in the 8th Annual Demographia International 
              Housing Affordability Survey.<br><br>Housing affordability is evaluated 
              based on the quotient deduced from the given formula, where a result of 
              3.0 and below would imply that houses are affordable, 3.1 to 4.0 
              (moderately unaffordable), 4.1 to 5.0 (seriously unaffordable), and 5.1 
              and over (severely unaffordable).<br><br>Given that the international report centred on the mid-end market, <em>PropertyGuru</em> focused its attention on <a href="http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/condo-directory">private apartments and condominiums</a> within the Outside Central Region (OCR) and Rest of Central Region 
              (RCR), as these areas are home to most of the mid- to high-end 
              properties. <br><br>The median multiple is based on calculations using 
              the median household income from Singstat’s Key Household 
              Characteristics and Household Income Trends, 2011, and the median price 
              for all types of resale HDBs, ranging from one- to five-room and 
              executive flats, according to data from the HDB and <em>PropertyGuru</em>. <br><br>The
               median multiple for private properties is 6.03 which means they are 
              ‘severely unaffordable’ but for HDB resale flats, the result is arguably
               shocking. The median multiple was found to be at a high of around 6.7, 
              which lies within the ‘severely unaffordable’ bracket – and even more 
              unaffordable than private properties.<br> <br>While private properties 
              and HDB resale flats hit the ‘severely unaffordable’ mark, it has to be 
              noted that the monthly household income for HDB dwellers is considerably
               lower than that of private homeowners. <br><br>Tejaswi Chunduri, Regional Analyst at <em>PropertyGuru</em>,
               offered her insights on the findings. She said: “The data is reflective
               of the housing affordability issues the country has been facing the 
              past few years. In the last five years the median household income in 
              Singapore has increased by 42 percent whereas HDB resale prices have 
              shot up by 84 percent according to the HDB price index. Private property
               has risen 58 percent when we look at the <a href="http://www.propertyguru.com.sg/markettools">private property price index</a>.”<br><br>She
               added: “This is a great contradiction to HDB's role which is to offer 
              affordable housing to the masses,” however she was quick to add that 
              homes in Singapore are more affordable than Hong Kong which earned a 
              rating of 12.6. <br><br>Despite the high prices, private home sales in 
              Singapore continue to skyrocket, rising 29 percent in February from the 
              previous month. “It is yet to be seen if the multiple rounds of cooling 
              measures and other policies introduced by the government will prove 
              effective in making home prices more affordable,” added Chunduri. <br> <br>The HDB was contacted for an official statement but were unable to issue any comment prior to publication.</div>

              <p>Do you all know Malaysians, even at lower wages, can BETTER afford a roof over their head? Let's just take their earnings to be $500 and Singaporeans earnings to be $1000.</p>
              <p>Given that you can get a nice 3 room apartment in Malaysia for $20k vs Singaporeans needing AT LEAST $100k for a 2 room flat, the affordability ratio based on salary to pay off having a roof over your head is 40 months for Malaysians vs 100 months for Singaporeans. That obviously is assuming you're using the entire salary to pay off the loan.</p>
              <p>Let's not talk about what CPF money therefore no money upfront/outlay kind of nonsense because CPF is by right the citizens money except the government take it and release some to give back to you to pay for the house. Put it this way, will you be grateful to me if every month I DEMAND (no you cannot refuse!) from you $500 of your salary, then if you want to buy something, I say ok lah since you no money, I pay $300 for your home purchase so that you no need to spend any money from your salary. That is a fallacy because I already took your money, that $300 is YOUR MONEY, but I took it, so it looks like it's my money. But that's how the government works at the moment.</p>
              <p>Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the CPF scheme. I'm just complaining when they claim that's a BENEFIT and claiming CREDITS for it. In this case, they are claiming this as a BENEFIT when you purchase a house. Fuck lah, it's your money in the first place! How come they can twist the whole idea until it seems like they are helping you like that? Like what I said, will you be grateful if every month I take $500 from you and take $300 to help you pay off something so you no need to use your remaining salary to pay for it?</p>

              <p>At 1k/mth, you definitely have<span style="font-family: Arial;"> Additional CPF Housing Grant (AHG) of $40,000 and Special CPF Housing Grant (SHG) of $20,000 </span></p>
              <p>Let's say after all the grants, the average flat will cost $30k (minimum is $23k from BTO)</p>
              <p>If you borrow the full $30k over 30 years (highly unlikely because you will definitely have some CPF savings), at HDB's 2.6% interest (bank is 1.2% now), you will need to pay $110.89 per month.</p>
