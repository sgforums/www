              <p><strong>Casino games prove popular in shops as parents worry over influence</strong><br> <span class="update">By Ng Jing Yng, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">TODAY</span></a> | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 03 March 2010 0626 hrs </span></p>
              <p id="articlecontent"><span>SINGAPORE: With casino games such as roulette flying off the
              shelves, some parents are worried about the influence games of chance
              might have on their kids. <br> <br> Cashing in on the casino hype, some major toy stores are offering games
              resembling those played at casinos, such as roulette and poker with the
              full works - money chips, cards and dice. <br> <br> Major toy chain Toys "R" Us sells these items in the "family fun and
              games" section while OG department stores and Mustafa Centre carry
              mini-roulette sets in their toy sections. <br> <br> Parents whom MediaCorp spoke to had mixed responses about the sale of
              these items in toy shops but all said they would not buy them for their
              children. <br> <br> Ms Anita Fam, mother of two school-going children, said she was deeply
              disturbed to see roulette sets being displayed prominently when she
              visited a Toy "R" Us outlet over the weekend. <br> <br> Ms Fam, 46, said it sends a signal that gambling is acceptable.
              "Children are very impressionable and this could be the start of a
              slippery slope," she said. <br> <br> But Ms Sharon Yeo, who has a five-year-old son, said exposing children to these games might be useful.   
              <br> <br> "Instead of restricting his knowledge, I'd rather teach my son the
              rights and wrongs of gambling," said Ms Yeo, 33, who was at a Toys "R"
              Us outlet on Tuesday. <br> <br> MediaCorp, which visited three Toys "R" Us outlets over the past two
              days, found that stocks for both casino game sets were running low. <br> <br> The roulette sets, which have been on promotion since early this year,
              are placed near the entrance of some outlets. According to sales staff,
              the majority of buyers for both items are adults and older teens. <br> <br> At OG stores, staff said that the mini-roulette sets were brought in
              during Christmas and sales have been positive, with a complete sell-out
              at one outlet. Mustafa Centre, on the other hand, said it has been
              selling the item for some time now. <br> <br> But child experts are not too alarmed. Dr Daniel Fung, head of child
              psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health, pointed out that toy
              shops also sell items like toy guns which encourage kids to play
              shooting and killing games. He said it is up to parents to decide what
              they want for their children. <br> <br> Psychiatrist Dr Chou Mei Ling likens casino games to board games such as Monopoly, in which fake bank notes are used.   
              <br> <br> "Through roulette or poker, children can learn the concepts of chance
              and risk playing, but parents must also teach them the consequences of
              incurring debt," said Dr Chou, director of Centre for Creative
              Development. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a></p>
