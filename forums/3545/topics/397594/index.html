              <h1 class="storyheadline">Have TV debates before election</h1>
              <p>ALTHOUGH the next general election is not due until early 2012, there 
              are signs that political parties are already gearing up to do battle. 
              Now may be the time to consider and prepare for a television debate as 
              part of the anticipated political contest.</p>
              <p>What I have in mind is Britain's unprecedented series of 
              American-style television debates in which leaders of the Labour, 
              Conservative and Liberal Democratic parties stood toe to toe in front of
               a studio audience debating issues of national importance.</p>
              <p>By all accounts, the 90-minute sessions were a resounding 
              success and one more will follow before polling day on May 6, by which 
              time Britons will be better informed about the parties' manifestoes, 
              their strengths and weakness, and the calibre of their leaders.</p>
              <p>We could do something similar to complement the usual 
              campaigning. To be held under a similar format and with rules agreed  by
               all major contesting parties, each debate could be presided over by a 
              moderator to ensure orderliness.</p>
              <p>The proposed TV debate would reach out to a far larger 
              audience and put all the rhetoric of the campaign trail into sharp 
              focus. What the parties stand for, their thoughts on the road ahead for 
              Singapore, and their views on issues such as the cost of living, 
              health-care costs, the ageing population and national assets would all 
              provide the basis for the voters' decision on Polling Day.</p>
              <p>Let's first dispatch a team to Britain to study how to 
              organise such an event that could well turn out to be a watershed in our
               election history.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">TV debates good for Singapore</h1>
              <p>ALTHOUGH Mr Dennis Tan ('Election debates on TV all style and no 
              substance, so not for us', May 3) may be right in believing that the 
              British election television debates have led to a greater emphasis on 
              style over substance, he has neglected to mention the most important 
              change these debates have created.</p>
              <p>The British election debates on television gave the Liberal 
              Democrats an opportunity to shine, and to break the traditional 
              two-party dominance of the British elections.</p>
              <p>During an election, it is important that Singaporeans make 
              an informed choice, and that we are exposed as much as possible to the 
              viewpoints of all the involved parties so as to make such a choice.</p>
              <p>A televised debate is an excellent chance to place two or 
              more parties side by side for comparison and to see alternative 
              viewpoints in an otherwise almost homogeneous political playing field.</p>
              <p>This positive outcome, in my opinion, far outweighs the 
              'style over substance' argument.</p>
              <p>Moreover, Mr Tan's worry is precisely what the cooling-off 
              period is for. After the televised debate, Singaporeans will have one 
              day to carefully weigh their options and vote rationally.</p>
              <p>Considering that we have, over the years, consistently voted
               in a government that has performed well, this should not be a major 
              worry.</p>
