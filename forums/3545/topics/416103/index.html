Her body was discovered at the foot of the block she lived in. -- ST PHOTO: TED CHEN</span><br><br>AN INDONESIAN domestic helper has been arrested and will be charged in court on Friday with the murder of a 12-year-old girl, said police on Thursday.<br><br>The maid was taken away for questioning on Wednesday, after Linda Lee Yee Lin, a physically and mentally disabled girl, was found at the foot of her block of flats in Hougang Street 51, at about 6am. She was wearing a pair of pink and white pyjamas.<br><br>If convicted of murder, the Indonesian maid faces the death penalty. She started working for the family only last month.<br><br>Neighbours said the maid appeared to be in her 20s and was 'small-sized' and 'skinny.'<br><br>Linda's mother only found out about her death hours later, when she woke up and discovered that her only child was missing from the family's fourth-floor Housing Board flat.<br><br>Linda attended a special school and could speak only simple words. Neighbours remembered her as a cheerful girl who smiled a lot.</p>

              <p>How come 12 years old is tall enough to fall over the window?</p>
              <p>How come her maid got so much strength like a guy to throw her over the window?</p>
              <p>Why would the maid convict herself to murder a retarded 12 years old?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I say the maid's employers must have financially secured the maid's future in secret in exchange for her imprisonment then they threw the 12 years old over the window while she was asleep.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That's just my deduction.</p>
