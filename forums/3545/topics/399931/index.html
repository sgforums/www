              <h1 class="storyheadline">About that train squeeze out West</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Mr Krishnan Muralidharan for his Forum Online letter, 'The 
              train squeeze out West, (May 8) and suggestions to ease congestion 
              during peak hour</p>
              <p>During the morning peak period, SMRT operates some 
              north-bound train services that travel to Jurong East interchange 
              station and continue on to the east-bound towards Pasir Ris.</p>
              <p>Many passengers take these trains as they connect to the 
              city directly without any transfers. Should Mr Muralidharan find it 
              difficult to board the train, he may wish to consider boarding at a less
               crowded area of the platform, or wait for the next train, which runs at
               an average frequency of about three minutes.</p>
              <p>With regard to the suggestion to skip Jurong East station, 
              we will not be implementing it as this would inconvenience passengers at
               the station and within the train who wish to board and alight 
              respectively at Jurong East.</p>
              <p>The writer also suggested that the direct train service be 
              extended in the reverse direction during evening peak hours. We would 
              like to clarify that this would require the west-bound train from Pasir 
              Ris to use the middle track at Jurong East interchange station.</p>
              <p>As there is only one track available, the track would have 
              to accommodate trains that are entering from the depot, as well as 
              north-bound trains that use the middle track to turn around for 
              south-bound service. It is therefore not feasible to implement this 
              direct service during evening peak.</p>
              <p>Mr Muralidharan commented that the trains arrive at 
              different frequencies. This is because north-bound train services that 
              continue on the east-bound share the same platform at Jurong East 
              interchange station with east-bound trains coming from Joo Koon station.
               Due to the use of a common platform, train frequencies are planned to 
              ensure optimal use of the platform.</p>
              <p>As for synchronising different-direction-bound train 
              services at Jurong East interchange station, this is not always possible
               as the train services operate at different frequencies.</p>
              <p>During peak period, the North-South Line at Jurong East 
              interchange station can support a train frequency of only three and a 
              half minutes, while the East-West line operates at a frequency of about 
              two minutes. This is due to infrastructural constraints at the station.</p>
              <p>The situation will improve with the construction of an 
              additional station platform and railway track by the Land Transport 
              Authority, which will be completed by 2012. This, together with the 
              delivery of 17 additional trains, will give us the flexibility to 
              increase train trips on the existing lines.</p>
              <p>Lastly, we wish to share that more than half of our trains 
              have been upgraded since 2006. In these upgraded trains, the train cars 
              contain two rows of overhead horizontal handrails with hand straps 
              placed along each row. There are also vertical handrails installed near 
              the train doors and seven three-way grab poles in each car for 
              passengers to hold on to.</p>
