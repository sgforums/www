              <p>By 
              																				Khushwant Singh</p>
              <p>A CAT-LOVER who stole seven bags of second-hand clothes from the 
              Salvation Army's headquarters in Bishan Street 22 was fined $2,000 on 
              Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Neo Chuan Seng, 54, a newspaper vendor had committed the 
              offence in January last year. He pleaded guilty and told investigators 
              that he had hoped to sell the clothes and use the proceeds to take care 
              of stray and injured cats.</p>
              <p>Before passing sentence, District Judge Kessler Soh noted 
              that Neo was doing a good deed but had also broken the law. 'Since you 
              committed theft, you must now pay the punishment,' said the judge.</p>
              <p>The court heard police were called by a resident living 
              opposite the Salvation Army's headquarters who saw Neo drive up in his 
              van and take some items from the donation corner. There were English and
               Mandarin signs there that warned that donated items were the property 
              of the Salvation Army and stealing them was an offence punishable by 
              law.</p>
              <p>Neo was arrested later that day and the stolen clothes were 
              recovered from his van. These were estimated to be worth $150 by a 
              Salvation Army's executive.</p>
              <p>Arguing that a fine was an appropriate punishment in this 
              case, defence counsel M. Mahendran said that Neo was not stealing for 
              himself but to get extra money to pay the costs of helping injured and 
              stray cats. The divorcee lives with his mother, 80, and a paralysed 
              82-year-old father, both of whom he supports on his monthly income of 
              $700.</p>

              robin hood? haha
              
              anyway Asromanista, i agree with what you are saying. but ill like to say that not all Christians are like that. do not be put off by these false preachers and false followers. God himself predicted it in the bible 
              
              
              Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheepâ€™s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. (16) You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles? (17) Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. (18) A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. (19) Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (20) Therefore by their fruits you will know them. Matthew 7:15-20
              
              please keep this in mind as u go along ur daily observation of the happenings of the world of 'christianity' . thank you [:
