              <h3 class="date_story">Jun 23, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>ON JUNE 9, my family and I went to Jack's Place to celebrate my 
              husband's birthday. We arrived there at 7.30pm and placed our order. 
              Thereafter, four couples strolled in.</p>
              <p>Thirty minutes after we had our soup, we were still waiting 
              for our main course of NZ striploin steak and baked codfish. On the 
              other hand, the four couples were already digging into their steaks.</p>
              <p>We asked a waiter to check on our order but he did not 
              update us. We then approached the manager, who said the food we had 
              ordered would normally take a longer time to prepare.</p>
              <p>I am not convinced this was the reason. I believe the staff forgot the order.</p>
              <p>Ironically, the bill came before we asked for it.</p>
              <p>Is this the type of service to expect from Jack's Place? Why
               wasn't there any follow-up from the manager when we were the only table
               left waiting?</p>

              <p>As a matter of bliss, celebrating your husband birthday by maintaining a gracious joys throughout the meal is more important than throwing out this nitty-gritty.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.emagazine.com/archive/4264">http://www.emagazine.com/archive/4264</a><br>The latter method has been adopted by several Vermont dairy farms and works well. Cow manure is stored in the digesters (huge tanks) at 100 degrees Fahrenheit and deprived of oxygen. That encourages the bacteria to break the manure down, releasing biogas that is 90 percent methane. This fuel is captured and burned in an engine to generate electricity. Unfortunately, the equipment is expensive—$200,000 to $1 million, depending on the size of the farm. Only 32 farms in the U.S. were using digesters at press time, so only a tiny amount of methane production has been mitigated in this way.</p>
              <p id="para_25" class="articleText">It takes seven pounds of corn to add a pound of weight to a cow, and that's why 200 million acres of land in the U.S. are devoted to raising grains, oilseeds, pasture and hay for livestock. That land requires 181 billion pounds of pesticides, 22 billion pounds of fertilizer and 17 trillion gallons of irrigation water (not to mention billions of gallons of global warming-aggravating fossil fuel for farm equipment).</p>

              <p>I guess you'll never know whether the truth was because they forgot or delayed your order(s), or whether the dishes you ordered did actually need more time to cook. Baked fish sounds like something that might take awhile.....</p>
              <p>Either way, it sounds like the service was not up to standard and as mentioned by others, the best reaction is to not go back. Getting annoyed, angry and worked up with negativity during the b'day dinner just kills the moment.</p>

              <p>Tony Tan is a PAP man thru and thru. How did a university academic become the chairman of GIC eventually? Only god knows. Just like Wong Kan Seng, a school teacher who became a heavyweight minister. A very tall order fulfilled :)</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Jack's Place addresses diner's unhappy experience</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Ms Stacey Ng for her feedback last Thursday ('Unhappy about 
              experience at restaurant'). I have since written the following e-mail to
               her and she has responded accordingly.</p>
              <p>'Sorry for the late reply. I reply personally to all 
              feedback but was outstation from June 10 to last Tuesday. Once feedback 
              is received, our operations team would have looked into the matter and 
              reported back to me. I have read the report, and am sorry and apologise 
              that my team has failed to satisfy your dining needs.</p>
              <p>From what I understand, our staff did make mistakes, but it 
              was not about forgetting to key in your orders because our terminal is 
              linked to the kitchen printer. Sometimes, during peak periods, we have a
               rash of orders and time is required to cook the meals accordingly. Our 
              standard operating procedure is that 15 minutes after the soup is 
              cleared and if the order is still not ready due to the peak period, our 
              wait staff has to inform the guest. They might have forgotten to offer 
              you more garlic bread or a small complimentary dish. We are sorry.</p>
              <p>As for the presentation of the bill before you finished your
               meal, it was the mistake of the cashier as we close at 10pm and she was
               in a hurry to close the till. She has been reprimanded for her mistake.
               There is no denying that training and educating people is the hardest 
              job. I hope you can allow us to learn from our mistake.</p>
              <p>I do not know what is your objective in writing to us. If it
               is to let us know how well or badly we have fared, we greatly 
              appreciate it. But if you think we had ruined your evening by the poor 
              service, then tell us how we can compensate you. Our main objective is 
              to strive to provide consistently superior service and quality food to 
              every customer, therefore your feedback is very important to us.</p>
              <p>Please rest assured that we are taking the appropriate measures to address the problem and prevent future occurrences.'</p>
