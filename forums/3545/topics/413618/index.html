              <p>By 
              																				Ang Yiying</p>
              <p>THE number of cases of violence against spouses involving immigrants 
              here has gone up, a leading anti-domestic violence agency said on 
              Thursday.</p>
              <p>Providing Alternatives to Violence (Pave) has handled about 
              240 new spousal abuse cases a year for the past two financial years. Of 
              these, the proportion of cases involving those born overseas has risen 
              from 12 per cent to 22 per cent.</p>
              <p>There were a total of 85 such cases over the two years. The 
              bulk of them - 70 - involved the agency counselling abused wives. In one
               case it helped an abused husband, and it also counselled 14 husbands 
              who had abused their wives.</p>
              <p>Pave defines immigrants as those who were born overseas, 
              regardless of how long they have been living here or whether they have 
              attained Singapore permanent resident or citizen status. They could be 
              married to foreign-born or Singapore-born spouses.</p>
              <p>It presented the data on Thursday during a half-day 
              symposium which it jointly organised with the Centre for Social 
              Development Asia, which is based at the National University of 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>It said that the dynamics of abuse are similar whether 
              victims are born locally or overseas, but the latter group may face more
               barriers in getting help.</p>
              <p>They may perceive that there is discrimination against them 
              as they are not born here, or face isolation or the lack of a social 
              support network. One particularly vulnerable group are wives on social 
              visit passes who may be threatened with deportation by their husbands.</p>
              <p>Pave's head of family development and senior social worker 
              Seah Kheng Yeow said at the event on NUS' Kent Ridge Campus that there 
              was a need to make public education and outreach more accessible to 
              immigrants. This could include translation of resource materials into 
              their native languages or reaching out to them through existing 
              activities held by residents' committees.</p>
