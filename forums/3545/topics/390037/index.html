              <h1 class="storyheadline">Having more single seats will help the PAP</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the opposition's interest in contesting at least two
              group representation constituencies (GRCs) in the next General
              Election. The People's Action Party (PAP) may wish to reconsider which
              of the constituencies should remain as GRCs while redrawing the rest as
              single-member constituencies (SMCs) for three reasons.</p>
              <p>First,
              the opposition seems confident of winning the Tampines and Bishan- Toa
              Payoh GRCs. The opposition almost won the Eunos GRC in the 1988 General
              Election with 49.1 per cent of the votes. In subsequent general
              elections, the opposition garnered more than 40 per cent of the votes
              in a few GRCs. And judging from ground and online sentiments, a GRC
              victory or two for the opposition is a strong possibility.</p>
              <p>Second,
              such a loss may mean losing 10 seats in Parliament altogether. If,
              however, the 10 constituencies are redrawn as SMCs, the ruling party
              may still keep more than half the SMCs.</p>
              <p>Third, many citizens are unhappy that some MPs entered Parliament by piggybacking on party heavyweights through the GRC format.</p>
              <p>The
              PAP should consider having more SMCs so that more of their fresh
              candidates can prove their worth by winning a seat on their own steam.</p>
              <p>How many SMCs? At least half of the total parliamentary seats.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">More single seats may disadvantage PAP</h1>
              <p>   </p>
              <p>I
                      REFER to Thursday's letter by Dr Jason Wong, 'Having more single seats
                      will help the PAP'. I feel his reasoning is somewhat myopic and he has
                      made certain assumptions which may not be accurate, stemming from
                      observations of polling results in Singapore in the past.</p>
              <p>First,
                      he mentioned that maintaining 'vulnerable' group representation
                      constituencies (GRCs) such as Bishan-Toa Payoh and Tampines may be
                      detrimental to the People's Action Party (PAP), as opposed to
                      converting the 10 seats in these GRCs to single member constituencies
                      (SMCs).</p>
              <p>Even though in the next general election,
                      Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC may be led by Mr Chiam See Tong (unanimously the
                      strongest opposition figure based on his track record in Potong Pasir
                      over the past 25 years), an opposition victory is unlikely. In 1997,
                      led by the late Mr J.B. Jeyaretnam, the Workers' Party still lost in
                      Cheng San GRC. Moreover, the opposition has not come close to winning
                      Tampines GRC in the past 20 years, bearing in mind that the greatest
                      opposition threat in the east was in Eunos GRC 22 years ago.</p>
              <p>Second,
                      Dr Wong seems to suggest the PAP may have a better chance of winning
                      SMCs when this may not be the case as younger and less experienced PAP
                      candidates may be pitted against opposition heavyweights who have
                      worked the ground over the years. If the number of SMCs is expanded,
                      these less experienced PAP candidates may no longer have the 'shield'
                      of contesting a GRC led by a PAP heavyweight.</p>
              <p>However,
                      I agree with Dr Wong's suggestion to increase the number of SMCs as
                      this will aid the ruling party in quashing criticism that many PAP
                      newcomers become ministers without a proper 'fight'. More important, it
                      will also address the age-old criticism of the GRC system being just an
                      excuse to win more seats by the winning party, as a multiracial nation
                      like Malaysia does not resort to GRCs to ensure that minority MPs are
                      represented in Parliament.</p>
