              <p><strong>COMMENT</strong><br><br>In yet another worrying sign that 
              Singapore is close to bursting at the seams, an elderly retiree was left
               with a fractured eye socket after a parking scuffle in a private estate
               turned ugly.<br><br>Goh Poh Ket, 65, claimed he was punched and 
              assaulted by a man and his two sons after he parked his car outside 
              their home along Jalan Chulek inside the Serangoon Gardens estate, 
              reported <em>The Straits Times. </em><br><br>Hit by a remote control, a plastic bottle and a sock filled with a hard substance, no less. <br><br>All four men in the ugly brawl have been arrested by police.<br><br>Frustration,
               anger, rage, uncivil -- increasingly, these are the ugly emotions that 
              are bubbling forth, online and offline, as Singapore copes with its burgeoning 5.1 million population.<br><br>The current Singapore Kindness Movement campaign to inculcate social graces among all living on this island is proving to be an uphill battle. <br><br>Just last month, a spat caught on video between a young lady and an auntie -- both Singaporean -- over an MRT seat went viral. A few days later, two uncles are caught on tape again brawling on a bus. <br><br>Latest statistics from SBS Transit revealed that disputes between 
              passengers on SBS buses have risen by 68 per cent in the last two years.<br><br>In a thought-provoking opinion piece back in May,
               Straits Times editor Warren Fernandez challenged the government and 
              policy-makers to come out and say just how many people it thought can 
              live on this island. <br><br>6.5 million? Or how about 8 million?<br><br>And he is right.<br><br>Because no matter how many open spaces or sprawling "green gardens"
               you plant, if Singapore's infrastructure -- roads, public and private 
              housing, public transport, education system -- cannot cope quickly 
              enough, Singapore is going to be an uglier, nastier place for our 
              children to live in.      </p>

But the truth is, human population growth and overcrowding are the cause of many of today’s problems.<a style="background-color: inherit; color: #1f1f8f; padding: 2px; border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: solid; border-bottom-color: #0055aa; " title="population.jpg" href="http://www.amateurbrainsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/population.jpg"><img style="border-width: 0pt; border-style: none; margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; " src="http://www.amateurbrainsurgery.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/population.jpg" alt="population.jpg"></a></p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">The solution is simple – stop having babies. The world’s human population should be decreased, gradually, by encouraging people to abstain from parenthood. Remaining childless should be encouraged with significant incentives. Reduced tax rates for middle-aged childless couples and individuals would be a start.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">There is only so much space and so much resource that the earth can provide. We are already in a situation where it would be impossible to raise the standard of living of every person in developing countries, including China and India, to the standard enjoyed by people in the west. There simply isn’t enough resource to go round.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">A well known experiment was once conducted in which mice were kept in an enclosed space and provided with plenty of food and water. Their numbers increased and they quickly became overcrowded. Their food and water levels were maintained to keep them alive but the overcrowding resulted in males fighting over females, or over nothing at all, <span style="color: #ff0000;">homosexual activity increased</span>, eating of the young became commonplace and mental issues were observed wherein mice would perform repeated pointless actions. Does any of this sound familiar?</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">Every day we hear stories of increasingly extreme violence, we are surrounded by people suffering from mental health issues of one sort or another and everybody and their dog appears to be gay these days.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">It’s about time that people woke up to the fact that the state of the planet and the state of society is largely down to over-crowding. The equation is simple. Fewer people would mean more space and less demand upon the planets limited resources.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 24px; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">Instead of encouraging parenthood it should be actively discouraged. People who manage to resist the strong biological drive towards becoming a parent should be rewarded for their strength and children should be educated towards leading a life without offspring. These are tough times and tough measures are required if the human race is to survive.</p>

              There are disgusting selfish  people who live in, 2000 af feet  terrace landed houses, 4000square feet semi detach houses and even 10,000 square feet bungalows but park all their 3 or 4 cars along the public road in the estate.  And members of the public who drive thro such estates have to navigate very carefully along such tight narrow stretches of roads with cars parked on both sides!  The answer is simple  make all these peoiple pay  a season ticket for parking overnite along the public roads.  Do that!and they'll all make room to park within their compounds!

              By Tan Qiuyi | Posted: 26 July 2012 1406 hrs 
              
              SINGAPORE: The National Population and Talent Division (NPTD) has released an Issues Paper to ramp up its public engagement on Singapore's population challenges going forward.
              
              The paper, which is available online, aims to help Singaporeans understand the choices and trade-offs the country has to make.
              
              NPTD said it's important that Singaporeans develop a shared understanding of these issues, which can go towards finding the right balance to build a sustainable population.
              
              Director of Policy &amp; Planning at National Population &amp; Talent Division, Ngiam Siew Ying, said: "We are engaging the public extensively this year to hear their views, because we think it's an important issue that affects all of us. We have to look at the issue comprehensively, to achieve a population that is strong and cohesive, living in a good quality environment, with an economy that provides for good jobs and opportunities for all of us."
              
              Labour economist Associate Professor Randolph Tan, head of UniSIM Business Programme, said the release of the Issues Paper is timely.
              
              "It's good that we're getting this process of public consultation about population policy started now. But I don't think the public should be hasty in trying to come to a determination on what policies we should fix, until we have actually gone through a whole process of analysing the different possible scenarios. That could be a few years down the road, but it's not too early to start now," he said.
              
              The paper is part of an ongoing consultation as NPTD prepares a White Paper on Population, scheduled for release at the end of the year.
              
              The NPTD paper, entitled "Our Population, Our Future", lays out Singapore's demographic challenges in the face of declining birth rates, a shrinking workforce, and an ageing population.
              
              As at December 2011, Singapore had 3.27 million Singapore citizens (SCs), and 0.54 million Permanent Residents (PRs). Together, they made up the resident population of 3.81 million.
              
              Singapore also had a non-resident population of 1.46 million who are working, studying or living in Singapore on a non-permanent basis.
              
              Singapore's total population was 5.26 million as at December 2011.
              
              Of the non-resident population, the majority (46 per cent) are work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers) and 14 per cent are foreign domestic workers.
              
              The others are: dependants of citizens and PRs as well as work pass holders (15 per cent); students (6 per cent); Employment Pass holders (12 per cent); S Pass holders (8 per cent).
              
              The majority 43 per cent of foreign manpower work in services while 30 per cent work in construction.
              
              Manufacturing takes 27 per cent and a minority 0.4 per cent work in other sectors.
              
              The paper spells out the future implications of a shrinking and ageing workforce - fewer working people to support every elderly person; a less vibrant, less innovative economy; and eventually, a hollowing out of the population as young people leave for more exciting cities.
              
              Associate Professor Randolph Tan said: "One of the things that we've learnt about demographic projections this far into the future is that they're notoriously unreliable. In fact over the last 15 years or so, Singapore and Hong Kong have had a remarkably similar experience in this regard. Total fertility rate has actually gone up in times of economic downturns, and has gone down when there is strong economic revival.
              
              "You can't actually say that this is stylised fact that you can apply to all countries, but on a case-by-case basis, economists have actually observed that there is a counter-cyclical attribute between the total fertility rate and the economic growth cycle."
              
              It's also possible that high immigration is depressing the fertility rate, Professor Tan said, so future population studies could look at the relationship between the two.
              
              Authorities are reviewing existing policies to encourage more Singaporeans to get married and have children.
              
              The authorities are also looking at the number of new citizens Singapore takes in, as well as the make-up of its non-resident workforce to support its needs.
              
              Experts said there is a key difference between meeting short-term economic needs like manpower and answering Singapore's demographic challenges.
              
              Professor Tan said: "Short-term economic priorities have to do with, for instance, the manpower shortages that we meet at a time when we need to take advantage of certain growth opportunities.
              
              "Long-term demographic challenges have to do with whether you are actually setting up families that could give rise to a nurturing environment, so that you don't necessarily get a productive workforce out of it immediately, but at least you get a healthy, happy nation out of it."
              
              The discussion continues as Singapore reaches a demographic turning point. More than 900,000 post-war baby boomers will hit 65 - the retirement age - from this year onward. That's over a quarter of the current citizen population.
              
              NPTD is seeking public feedback through its newly launched population website at www.population.sg.
              
              The public can also send their feedback by email: nptd_contact@nptd.gov.sg, fax: 6325-3240, or post.
