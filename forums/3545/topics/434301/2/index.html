              <p>My son had GCE ‘A’ 4 straight As with ‘S’ papers in his
              ‘A’-level but was rejected by NUS medicine. He applied and was
              accepted by many medical schools in the UK, Australia and Ireland.
              He finally accepted one of the top medical schools in the UK.</p>
              <p>I sold my house to support him and have the never regretted
              doing that. He is now in his clinical year and is happy with his
              pace and style in UK teaching. He has also settled down well and
              has decided not to come back as he does not owe the govt anything.
              We have the f..king PAP government to thank for losing my only son
              to a foreign country in place of its f..king foreign trash
              policy.</p>
              <p>We will never never vote for the PAP again. Thank you once again
              f..king PAP!</p>

              <p>This is one of those stupid comments that don't deserve reading. So what if his son has straight A's and such? He's just another dime in a dozen. Another fact is that the intake cohort for NUS medicine is extremely low, so chances of getting in is drastically reduced without taking into account of merit. Want to enter dentistry? That's like less than 20 people from NUS medicine able to get in. If its so easy to be practice medicine, everyfarkingmotherson will be a farking doctor.</p>

              <p>Will agree with you on this. In the first place, the article doesn't furnish enough information, e.g. his GP grade and subject combination.</p>
              <p>NUS Medicine is really difficult to get in due to limited places. I also have a local friend with four straight As (Maths C + Triple Science) who couldn't get in.</p>
              <p>Why? Because he got B3 for GP. Tough luck. Another friend with four straight As got in.... because he also got A1 for GP. Simply put, there were so many candidates with straight As that they had to look at other criteria (GP, CCA records, etc).</p>
              <p>As an illustration, if there are 150 applicants for only 100 places, then only the top 100 applicants will get in. If this fella is no.101 because of his GP grades, or because he took double science instead of triple science, then tough luck to him. Meeting the minimum admission standards is no longer enough these days; it is also about being among the best of the applicants. If the competition is strong, then you need to be stronger than them in order to get ahead.</p>
              <p>And as for why they limit the number of applicants is simple. They want to ensure that they produce doctors of good standard, and for that to happen, small class sizes are needed.</p>
              <p>So, yeah, this example is FAIL. Give me an example involving the Science or Engineering or Arts faculties, then we'll talk.</p>
