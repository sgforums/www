              <p>According to the NTU report 2010 released recently, 56 percent of NTU faculty are foreigners from 56 countries worldwide including Singapore PRs:</p>
              <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" style="border-width: 0px;" title="ntufaculty" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/ntufaculty.jpg" alt="" width="251" height="364"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>[Source: <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/AboutNTU/Documents/AR10%2020110221%20-%20AR%20%28without%20financial%29.pdf"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">NTU report 2010</span></a>]</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens including new citizens form only 44 percent of the faculty.</p>
              <p>The result is not surprising as there are an increasing number of foreigners being scouted from overseas as lecturers in both NUS and NTU in recent years.</p>
              <p>The Temasek Review had earlier published stories about how Singapore PhD holders are being discriminated and disadvantaged by the local universities’ pro-foreigner hiring policies though the foreigners employed may not be necessarily better than them.</p>
              <p>The emphasis on research and producing papers which are important criteria in the universities’ yearly rankings may have prompted them to cast their net overseas for established researchers who may not necessarily be good teachers.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Associate Professor Michael Heng, from NTU’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, wrote to the Straits Times alleging ’serious lapses’ in the process of awarding tenures to lecturers.</p>
              <p>He said that in internal school meetings, faculty members were told by their Chairs that only research counted in the tenure review. They were told teaching and service to the university were not important, he said.</p>
              <p><strong>‘This is taxpayers’ money we are talking about, so this is of public interest,’</strong> he added. (read more <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090220-123438.html"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, a NTU student wrote to us complaining about the heavy accent of some foreign lecturers:</p>
              <p><strong>“When I attend lectures, I want to understand the lecturers. Tell me, how can I understand if the lecturers cannot speak a proper English sentence without slaughtering the language? I pay to learn, not to be entertained by comical lecturers with funny accent and laughable grammar….I cannot understand why I have to repeat an extra year of schooling if I fail English and yet, NTU lecturers who fail English get paid 10-digit salaries to teach me.”</strong></p>

              <p>This comes from the mouth of a <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">PRC student on scholarship - they are paid a monthly allowance of Sing$1,500.00 for their expenses.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Oh mine, some of our locals don't even earn that much.   </p>
              <p>It is puzzling as to why the govt are investing so much of the taxpayers' $$$$ on these people.    Does it mean our local students are hopeless in study?</p>

              <p>According to the NTU report 2010 released recently, 56 percent
                  of NTU faculty are foreigners from 56 countries worldwide including
                  Singapore PRs:</p>

              <p>[Source: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/AboutNTU/Documents/AR10%2020110221%20-%20AR%20%28without%20financial%29.pdf"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">NTU report
                  2010</span></a>]</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens including new citizens form only 44 percent
                  of the faculty.</p>
              <p>The result is not surprising as there are an increasing number
                  of foreigners being scouted from overseas as lecturers in both NUS
                  and NTU in recent years.</p>
              <p>The Temasek Review had earlier published stories about how
                  Singapore PhD holders are being discriminated and disadvantaged by
                  the local universities’ pro-foreigner hiring policies though the
                  foreigners employed may not be necessarily better than them.</p>
              <p>The emphasis on research and producing papers which are
                  important criteria in the universities’ yearly rankings may have
                  prompted them to cast their net overseas for established
                  researchers who may not necessarily be good teachers.</p>
              <p>In 2009, Associate Professor Michael Heng, from NTU’s School of
                  Electrical and Electronic Engineering, wrote to the Straits Times
                  alleging ’serious lapses’ in the process of awarding tenures to
                  lecturers.</p>
              <p>He said that in internal school meetings, faculty members were
                  told by their Chairs that only research counted in the tenure
                  review. They were told teaching and service to the university were
                  not important, he said.</p>
              <p><strong>‘This is taxpayers’ money we are talking about, so this
                  is of public interest,’</strong> he added. (read more <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.asiaone.com/News/Education/Story/A1Story20090220-123438.html"><span style="color: #ab6f07;">here</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Not too long ago, a NTU student wrote to us complaining about
                  the heavy accent of some foreign lecturers:</p>
              <p><strong>“When I attend lectures, I want to understand the
                  lecturers. Tell me, how can I understand if the lecturers cannot
                  speak a proper English sentence without slaughtering the language?
                  I pay to learn, not to be entertained by comical lecturers with
                  funny accent and laughable grammar….I cannot understand why I have
                  to repeat an extra year of schooling if I fail English and yet, NTU
                  lecturers who fail English get paid 10-digit salaries to teach
                  me.”</strong></p>
              </div>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>It is always a practice for university to hire overseas foreigner. This is to prevent inbreeding. Even Singaporean lecturers need to have their cert from overseas. University not hire their own student. </p>
