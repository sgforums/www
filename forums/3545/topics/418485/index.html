              <p>'I am happy to read that Pasir Ris-Punggol GRC has 
              recognised 32 local cleaners for their exemplary work attitude and 
              rewarded them ('Model local cleaners get cash rewards'; Dec 13). These 
              workers have a hard job, worsened by inconsiderate residents who leave 
              their trash along the common corridor. Besides low wages, which have 
              stagnated for the past 10 years, many have no medical benefits or 
              bonuses. I appeal to employers who bid for cleaning contracts to factor 
              in their workers' pay. Local cleaners deserve better.</p>

              <p><br>gahmen cpf only allows people to pay loans up to age 55. if you are 45 or anywhere near 55 the loan period and amount will decrease. to the extend sometimes people of this age cannot buy anymore as loan too high. gahmen on cpf rules will ensure that any loan will be cleareed by age 55 and thereafter cannot be used anymore to set aside for retirement account.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>on the cleaning contractors clearly its contract jobs so the businesses really want to push the employment things to contract stuff agencies. they don;t want to add cost to their own. contract agencies of course also want to earn on their own buisnesses os like that its clear they can only depend on foreign workers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that's why for this type of job categories gahmen should employ minimum wage.</p>
