              <p><strong>Call for more measures to strengthen families &amp; enable more self reliance<br></strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid, Channel NewsAsia | </span><span class="update">Posted: 21 February 2010 0001 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: More measures must be in place to strengthen families and enable greater self-reliance, say those in the social service sector. They also say that the first line of defence is to ensure everyone stays employed. <br><br>Food rations come in handy for Madam Nor Habibah, who has been hit by the economic downturn. For months, her family of eight has been staying in a one-room flat with four other relatives. She said her flat was repossessed by the bank, after they defaulted on payments. <br><br>Her husband, who works as a cleaner, is the sole breadwinner, earning less than $1,000 a month. She said: "I hope we will get a house, better for my children. To buy (a house)....CPF also not enough. Actually I want to be working, but (you) see how my children (I have)? Nobody takes care (of them if I work)." <br><br>As Singapore recovers economically, some MPs say extending more support to such families must be a priority. <br><br>Seah Kian Peng, chairman of GPC for Community Development, Youth and Sports, said: "My concern will be people who are unable to get a job or lose jobs. I think that really triggers a burden on the family. This is why there is a need to grow the economic pie and to create jobs. The need to place Singaporeans in jobs is very important. <br><br>"First level of social support is if we can find everyone a job, it takes care of a huge set of problems. <br><br>"If we have strong families, it must necessarily mean that there are fewer families that can be broken up for a variety of reasons....but when such situations occur, it must lead to more support that is subsequently required, more resources required, to look after this group of people." <br><br>Zainudin Nordin, mayor of Central Community Development Council, said: "If a person has a problem at home, how can you send him to upgrade and improve himself, so we need to solve that too. So that is the kind of network that we want to strengthen, which I have mentioned earlier. <br><br>"At the end of the day, we have to make sure they get a job, because social support and financial assistance will just be the first level of assistance. <br><br>"In the long run, you need to get them more employable, get them a job so that they can strengthen their family." <br><br>The many-helping-hands approach in building a social safety net must therefore be more comprehensive to ensure no one falls through the cracks. <br><br>Mohd Ali Mahmood, executive director of PPIS Jurong Family Service Centre, said: "I see the possibility of having more FSCs (family service centres) to address issues, especially not just financial but also basic family dysfunctionality." <br><br>There's also the need to address the shortage of social workers and retain those already in the sector. <br><br>Mr Seah said: "The strengthening of the social service sector....what I call the support enablers. There is this big group of social workers...I think they are under-rated, they are under-appreciated. So I think the schemes are not in place to credit them, to professionalise them...." <br><br>Halimah Mohamed Ibrahim, a programme coordinator at Tanjong Pagar Family Service Centre, said: "Because of the limited number of Malay-Muslims social workers who are conversant in Malay language, we have to take up more Malay-Muslim cases. So our caseload becomes higher." <br><br>Separately, with Singapore's ageing population, providing more day care centres and effective programmes to engage senior citizens is also important. <br><br>Stakeholders believe that when it comes to social support, assistance schemes, by and large, they are doing quite well. <br><br>But they say it is important to constantly review the relevance of the schemes as what works today may not necessarily work in the future. <br><br>- CNA/ir</span></p>
