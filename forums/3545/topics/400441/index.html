              <h1 class="storyheadline">Compulsory community service is wrong</h1>
              <p>I AGREE in part with Ms Ann Medlock's view that the 'compulsory' 
              approach to community service or service learning is wrong ('Don't force
               students to do good', May 5).</p>
              <p>While a certain amount of compulsion is necessary to provide
               a platform for children to perform these deeds, I agree with Ms Medlock
               that leading by inspiration should be encouraged. This is so that 
              children realise good deeds should be done out of kindness and 
              compassion, not for points or rewards.</p>
              <p>That is why in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when I was a 
              coordinator for the Being &amp; Becoming programme in a secondary 
              school, a team embarked on a project to collect and collate stories of 
              good deeds highlighted in newspapers and compiled them into a booklet 
              for all students.</p>
              <p>We collected so many articles from teachers and students 
              that we were able to come up with three booklets.</p>
              <p>The results of such projects cannot be easily quantified, 
              but I am sure the values embedded in them seeped into the majority of 
              students through the best way possible - by example and through stories.</p>
              <p>Dishing up violence day after day in great detail in 
              newspapers and on television just serves to glorify crime, violence and 
              the negative aspects of society.</p>
              <p>Newspaper reports should be toned down and the kinder, more 
              positive face of society should be highlighted more often. This can only
               serve to uplift our society.</p>

              <p>I REFER to the report, 'Don't force students to do good,' on May 5. 
              While I agree with the view that community service is important, I would
               like to highlight that the nature of the act matters too.</p>
              <p>Often, we see students at MRT stations approaching 
              passers-by for monetary donations. Although organisations for the needy 
              benefit from this, these students may fail to comprehend the real 
              meaning of community service: developing care and concern for our 
              society while serving with compassion.</p>
              <p>One of the key concerns is to connect our students with the 
              real needs of our society and develop their sense of belonging to our 
              nation. Suitable community activities include volunteering at MPs' 
              weekly Meet-the-People sessions, participating in youth forums and 
              initiating long-lasting community projects that meet the real needs of 
              our society.</p>
              <p>Student-initiated community projects that are ephemeral and 
              serve solely to benefit students' curriculum vitae should be 
              discouraged. I have seen many student-initiated projects that have 
              lasted for more than five years; so devoted were the students that they 
              continued their pursuits even after graduation. This is the true spirit 
              of community service.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Don't kill the passion to volunteer</h1>
              <p>I AM writing to share my experience as an e-filing volunteer with the 
              Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras).</p>
              <p>It was my first time volunteering and it may be my last.</p>
              <p>On the day of volunteering my service at the Fuchun 
              Community Club, I reached the centre at the arranged time but there was 
              no one to advise me and another two student volunteers what to do. No 
              sign boards were placed outside the centre to advise the public either.</p>
              <p>I called Iras to inform them and it was only after a few 
              hours that someone came over. Next, I was shocked to discover that the 
              student volunteers were ill-equipped to handle the tax queries residents
               had.</p>
              <p>Later, when we were invited via mass e-mail to attend a 
              ceremony for e-filing volunteers, I asked when we would get our 
              certificate of appreciation. I was told that the centre manager should 
              have given it to us after our last volunteer session. The centre manager
               told me that I would get it at the ceremony. An Iras officer 
              subsequently told me that it was not the case.</p>
              <p>The whole process was very disorganised and very 
              unprofessional.</p>
