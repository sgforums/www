              <p class="header"><span>SINGAPORE: A list of 11 conditions laid down by the newly formed 
              Reform Party for the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) to consider 
              before the Reform Party joins the alliance has been abandoned after a 
              meeting of the SDA's central executive committee on Friday night.
              <br> <br> This was confirmed to MediaCorp by the SDA Secretary General, Desmond 
              Lim.
              <br> <br> Among the conditions laid down by the Reform Party, led by Kenneth 
              Jeyaretnam, include selected GRCs which the party wants the SDA Chief 
              Chiam See Tong to contest in and the allocation of key posts in the 
              alliance to leaders of the Reform Party.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim adds that he has been appointed by the SDA to be the spokesperson
               on discussions to re-look at the conditions for a possible alliance.
              <br> <br> He has proposed that both the SDA and the Reform Party meet again on the
               15th of this month.
              <br> <br> Mr Lim however adds that in an email reply received today, the Reform 
              Party has indicated that it would be able to meet again only after its 
              central executive committee convenes a meeting and that is scheduled to 
              take place only next month.
              <br> <br> Meanwhile, the Reform Party will be having its news conference today and
               is scheduled to introduce its batch of candidates for the coming 
              General Election. 
              <br> <br> There is no confirmation if opposition MP Chiam See Tong will attend the
               Reform Party's news conference, something which Mr Kenneth had hoped 
              will happen today.

              <p>THE fate of a prospective alliance between an opposition veteran and a
               rookie with a pedigree name to fight in the next general election hangs
               in the balance.</p>
              <p>By press time last night, 12 leaders of the Singapore 
              Democratic Alliance (SDA), chaired by Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong, 
              had yet to decide on whether or not to admit the Reform Party into the 
              opposition grouping.</p>
              <p>At the heart of the impasse was a list of 11 conditions for 
              joining made by the Reform Party, which is led by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam,
               its secretary-general.</p>

              <p><strong>Reform Party-SDA alliance off for now, says Reform Party's Kenneth 
              Jeyaretnam</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 08 May 2010 1117 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The much-touted alliance between the opposition Reform 
              Party and the Singapore Democratic Alliance is off for now.
              <br> <br> Reform Party leader, Kenneth Jeyaretnam, said this in an interview with 
              MediaCorp, after the party's first annual conference on Saturday 
              evening.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Democratic Alliance's central executive committee led by 
              Chiam See Tong held a meeting on Friday evening.
              <br> <br> They reportedly discussed what's said to be 11 conditions laid down by 
              the Reform Party before it joined the alliance with SDA.
              <br> <br> And on Saturday, the Reform Party's members gave their in-principle 
              approval to push ahead with negotiations.
              <br> <br> But it seems talks will now be put on hold after the SDA said it was 
              abandoning the list of 11 conditions.
              <br> <br> This was confirmed by the Secretary General of the Singapore Democratic 
              Alliance, Desmond Lim.
              <br> <br> On this, Mr Jeyaretnam said he was completely mystified as to what has 
              happened.
              <br> <br> He claims the 11 points had actually been agreed with the SDA and its 
              leader Chiam See Tong.
              <br> <br> He said: "I can only conclude that Mr Chiam did not have the agreement 
              of the SDA when he entered into negotiations with me. We won't be 
              conducting any further negotiations with the SDA because we're not 
              entering into negotiations with an organisation that leaks confidential 
              documents to the press."
              <br> <br> But Mr Jeyeratnam said such an alliance is still “possible” though “not 
              very likely”.
              <br> <br> And that without the alliance, the Reform Party can stand on its own.
              <br> <br> The Reform Party also unveiled its first batch of candidates for the 
              next General Election due by February 2012.
              <br> <br> Most were fresh faces except for 53-year-old Abdul Rahim Osman, who has 
              contested in two elections under different parties.
              <br> <br> He's also the sole non-graduate among the group which consists of two 
              former civil servants Tony Tan and Hazel Poa.
              <br> <br> The others are Alec Tok, artistic director for a New York-based theatre 
              company, and Jeisilan Sivalingam, a process improvement manager.
              <br> <br> The party said it's targeting to contest in two Group Representation 
              Constituencies and two Single Member Constituency.
              <br> <br> Among those on its primary list are West Coast GRC, Hong Kah GRC and Toa
               Payoh-Bishan GRC.
              <br> <br> The party said it will wait for the election boundaries report before 
              making a clear decision in which wards to contest.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Reform Party chief on impasse with SDA</h1>
              <p>I WISH to correct Monday's report, 'SDA-Reform Party alliance: On or 
              off?'. What I said was that our members had given us the go-ahead to 
              enter into an alliance if negotiation reached that stage.</p>
              <p>That is not the same as saying a tie-up has been agreed, nor
               is it asking us to push ahead with negotiation.</p>
              <p>It is simply a vote of confidence in the secretary-general 
              and the central executive committee to take that decision should it 
              arise.</p>
              <p>It would appear that the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA)
               has thrown out the baby with the bath water in deciding to treat the 
              summary of broad areas of agreement already reached by both parties as a
               list of demands.</p>
              <p>Normally, in a negotiation, it would be seen as a starting 
              point for entering serious and final negotiations.</p>
              <p>We have written to the SDA informing it that it may contact 
              us about the possibility of continuing talks only after two conditions 
              have been met:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li>It needs to settle its internal disputes, and; </li>
              <li>It needs to take steps to trace and deal with 
              the source of the leaked documents as all negotiation must begin with a 
              presumption of trust between the parties.
              <p>At our next central executive committee meeting, the Reform 
              Party will make a decision on what action to take should the SDA satisfy
               both those conditions and come back to us. But it will not be high on 
              our list of priorities.</p>
              <p>My respect and admiration for Mr Chiam See Tong remains 
              unblemished, and I sincerely hope that he is able to bring them to their
               senses, although we will concentrate on our own candidates now.</p>
