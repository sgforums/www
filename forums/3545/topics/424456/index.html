              <h3 class="date_story">Mar 7, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>I FULLY agree with Mr James Ang ("'Foreign' doesn't always mean 'talent'"; last Tuesday).</p>
              <p>I was with a foreign derivatives brokerage from 1998, 
              building up a solid portfolio of customers over more than a decade. In 
              2009, there was a restructuring engineered by talent from outside 
              Singapore, leading to foreign Asia-Pacific heads being located here.</p>
              <p>While it was good for the Singapore economy and property 
              market, it was detrimental to talented Singaporeans. Why? The so-called 
              foreign talent who came in were not cheap, commanding high salaries and 
              housing allowances.</p>
              <p>If they had brought in new business and customers, one could have appreciated their value. But most did not.</p>
              <p>In fairness, there were a few good foreign talent whom I 
              really respected because I found meaning and motivation in working with 
              or for them.</p>
              <p>I also concur with Ms Laurelle Ho ("Employment enclaves"; 
              also last Tuesday). A foreigner tends to hire staff from his own 
              country. My previous Australian head hired two other Australians as 
              supervisors. I have since tendered my resignation in frustration.</p>
              <p>When one is above 50 years of age, where can one find a job in another industry that will pay the same level of benefits?</p>
              <p>I am a middle-income Singaporean with a wife and three 
              children to support. Furthermore, my older children are entering higher 
              institutes of learning, whose fees are not cheap.</p>
              <p>I feel that our policy of attracting "foreign talent" needs 
              to be properly managed. There must be an avenue for recourse if 
              Singaporeans are unfairly disadvantaged.</p>

              <p>there 2 types of foreign talent</p>
              <p>1  the high class that really contribute to the country that they work in</p>
              <p>mostly work in big company and doesnt effect the mid class / lower class paid</p>
              <p>they do have their fair share of work and bring in experience</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2  the common foreign talent that willing to take lower paid and lower lifestyle just to fight a ricebowl again singapore middle and lower class incomers</p>
              <p>its the 2nd type of foreign that is killing those singaporean.</p>
              <p>example : myself</p>
              <p>my job use to receive about a average paid of $3k to $4k in the past. since the goverment allow all those chinaman and banganish to come in. my job paid have drop to 2.5k because all it take to employ them is just $1.6K. and company doesnt really care who can perform better, just deploy those idiot to site stay there and they receive the $$$ from client monthly will do for them. they get extra amount when they just use a 1.6k vs a 2.5k.</p>
              <p>heng my client know how to choose better worker right now at this moment.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Enclaves come in different forms</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">I AGREE with Ms Laurelle Ho ('Employment enclaves'; last Tuesday) but 
              would like to make one thing clear: employment enclaves form 
              irrespective of whether they are foreigners or locals.</h1>
              <p>Such enclaves do exist and grow particularly when the 
              selection panel or senior management of a company or organisation is 
              made up mostly of people from the same race, religion, religious subset 
              or nationality.</p>
              <p>To cite my own experience, I used to work for an American 
              multinational company where it was common to see a Chinese manager with a
               Malay secretary or Indian manager with a Chinese secretary and vice 
              versa. When the American chief executive officer retired and the MNC 
              hired a local CEO to run the company, the whole permutation changed 
              instantly.</p>
              <p>The majority of the new hires for senior and middle-level 
              positions were from the same race, same religion and same religious 
              subset. To my dismay, I also learnt that some of them belonged to the 
              same worship group.</p>
              <p>I am sure Ms Ho's Indian Singaporean friend would feel out 
              of place if she were to go for an interview before a panel dominated by 
              any other ethnic group, be it local or foreign.</p>
              <p>We should bear in mind that the quota for ethnic mix in 
              housing estates for locals was introduced long before a quota was 
              introduced for foreigners. If we impose a quota to prevent employment 
              enclaves, it should be not only for foreigners but also for locals as 
              well.</p>

              <p>i am confused... i am assuming this guy is talking about the professional level people, not the construction worker, waiter or maids...</p>
              <p>for professional levels, i thought it is up to the company to decide who they want to hire.. whether it is singaporean, australian, china chinese or whatever... as long as the company thinks the person hired fit their requirements and if foreigner, as long as they don't mind paying extra on housing benefits or whatever they negotiate with the person as their salary package...</p>
              <p>so whats there to manage or regulate? do we want the government to stop companies from hiring the foreigner professional or for companies to give prefeerence to singapore people? </p>
              <p>or do we want the government to enforce cultural diversity in all companies, so like hdb... you need certain percent chinese in the company and certain percent malay, etc?</p>
              <p>how do manage that? a bit unrealistic right?</p>

              <p>for professional levels, i thought it is up to the company to
              decide who they want to hire.. whether it is singaporean,
              australian, china chinese or whatever... as long as the company
              thinks the person hired fit their requirements and if foreigner, as
              long as they don't mind paying extra on housing benefits or
              whatever they negotiate with the person as their salary
              package...</p>
              <p>so whats there to manage or regulate? do we want the government
              to stop companies from hiring the foreigner professional or for
              companies to give prefeerence to singapore people? </p>
              <p>or do we want the government to enforce cultural diversity in
              all companies, so like hdb... you need certain percent chinese in

              <p>there 2 types of foreign talent</p>
              <p>1  the high class that really contribute to the country that they work in</p>
              <p>mostly work in big company and doesnt effect the mid class / lower class paid</p>
              <p>they do have their fair share of work and bring in experience</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2  the common foreign talent that willing to take lower paid and lower lifestyle just to fight a ricebowl again singapore middle and lower class incomers</p>
              <p>its the 2nd type of foreign that is killing those singaporean.</p>
              <p>example : myself</p>
              <p>my job use to receive about a average paid of $3k to $4k in the past. since the goverment allow all those chinaman and banganish to come in. my job paid have drop to 2.5k because all it take to employ them is just $1.6K. and company doesnt really care who can perform better, just deploy those idiot to site stay there and they receive the $$$ from client monthly will do for them. they get extra amount when they just use a 1.6k vs a 2.5k.</p>
              <p>heng my client know how to choose better worker right now at this moment.</p>

              <p><br>Actually, other than sg, most countries do control foreigner professional.  Some countries will expect the company to prove to them that they can't hire a local to do the job, (some do it by need to adveristed for like 6 mths and no suitable person etc).  Then some countries issue work visa when the profeesional package hit a certain level (which is quite high) as it just show that company can get a local to perform the task thus company have to pay a high pay to get foreigner in. </p>

              <p>But i thought the majority of the singaporean agree with the policy as the govt had already claim this before, "They have the mandate of the plp" and they are not wrong in this as abt 66% of the singaporean agree with the policy.</p>
