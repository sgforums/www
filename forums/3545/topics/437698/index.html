              <p><strong>my paper - Thursday, Jul 28, 2011 </strong></p>
              <p><strong>By Low Minmin </strong></p>
              <p>A man irked patrons of the crowded Golden Shoe Food Centre in Raffles
               Place on Tuesday afternoon, telling a number of them not to reserve 
              seats by placing packets of tissue paper on tabletops.</p>
              <p>"He was pointing at seats and asking why people were using tissue 
              packets (to reserve seats)," said manager Tan Li-Lin, 28, who was among 
              those approached by the man.</p>
              <p>Ms Tan had been eating alone, seated beside two empty seats which were "reserved" with tissue packets.</p>
              <p>"My first thought was that this guy had obviously never had to deal with the lunch-time rush before," said Ms Tan.</p>
              <p>The food centre is popular with office workers in the Central 
              Business District who throng the place at lunch-time as it offers a 
              cheaper variety of food.</p>
              <p>The practice of "reserving" seats with tissue packets has been a bugbear of office workers there for years.</p>
              <p>The man, Ms Tan said, had identified himself as a National 
              Environment Agency (NEA) officer and flashed what appeared to be a 
              warrant card.</p>
              <p>He is believed to be in his 30s and was dressed in jeans. "His tone 
              sounded a little irritated and he was speaking quite loudly," she said.</p>
              <p>Riled patrons were overheard complaining about his audacity as they had never encountered a similar incident before.</p>
              <p>In a statement yesterday, an NEA spokesman clarified that the man is 
              an environmental-health officer in charge of the food centre and was 
              doing his routine check during lunch hour that day.</p>
              <p>He added that the officer had acted on "public feedback" that patrons
               were reserving seats at the food centre with tissue packets and, "out 
              of good intention", had "advised patrons to be considerate to others".</p>
              <p>But the spokesman pointed out that NEA does not have a policy against
               patrons reserving seats in hawker centres as this is on a first-come, 
              first-served basis.</p>
              <p>"However, patrons should always be considerate to others when sharing the facilities,"he added.</p>
              <p>While NEA did not clarify the specifics of the officer's job scope, 
              Singapore Kindness Movement general secretary William Wan said: "The 
              fact that the gentleman took ownership of the problem and tried to make a
               difference is commendable.</p>
              <p>"But we have to be very careful that we distinguish between our 
              personal capacity and our capacity as an officer of a particular 
              organisation or ministry."</p>

              <p>Very shity one lah~ Does it mean that I have to carry my bowl of laksa and find a seat? What if the laksa accidentally spill onto other people? It's also quite heavy to carry your food while walking around to find seat.</p>
              <p>This is epic discrimination against Singles. Singles also need to eat right? The practice of reserving seats using tissue paper is not wrong. It means that I see the seats first, and I reserve it with my tissue paper. So that after I purchase my food, I have a place to seat.</p>
              <p>Those people that are against reserve system is totally unreasonable because of the fact that</p>
              <ol>
              <li>Others had already found and secure the seat</li>
              <li>Others just need to leave for a while to purchase food</li>
              </ol>
              <p>The characteristic of people that are against the reserve system are usually those big groups of people (3 or more). When they see the seats are taken, they gets angry and living in the state of senile and self-denial.</p>
