              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A 
              Filipino service engineer was sentenced on Monday to 18 months jail for 
              being part of a conspiracy, cheating Standard Chartered Bank of 
              S$317,100.<br><br>Mark Robert Fajilan Landicho had worked with a 
              syndicate that illegally helped foreigners obtain unsecured credit 
              facilities from the bank even though they were not eligible.<br><br>The 
              group did so by forging its clients' pay slips, inflating the salaries 
              so that their annual pay would appear to meet the bank's minimum income 
              requirement.<br><br>According to court documents, Landicho had worked 
              with two former employees from telemarketing company, Touch &amp; Tech, 
              to cheat the bank between July and October 2009.<br><br>One of them is, 26-year-old Charon Legaspi Dimpas, a fellow Filipino.<br><br>Dimpas,
               who used to be one of the firm's direct sales agents, was sentenced to 
              45 months behind bars after admitting last November that she was part of
               the scam.<br><br>Her then-boss, 60-year-old Singaporean Abdul Karim Baba, has not been dealt with in court.<br><br>Touch
               &amp; Tech was engaged by Standard Chartered to market the unsecured 
              credit facilities the bank offered to prospective clients.<br><br>Landicho's
               colleagues first referred him to Dimpas in June 2009 as he wanted to 
              apply for such services even though his salary did not meet the minimum 
              requirement.<br><br>His application was approved after she doctored his pay slips.<br><br>Soon
               after this, 28-year-old Landicho started to help the syndicate solicit 
              for customers by advertising its illicit services on pinoysg.com, a 
              Singapore-based Filipino portal.<br><br>Interested parties would forward him their genuine payslips via email.<br><br>He would send them over to his accomplices, earning S$75 for each successful application.<br><br>Defence Counsel Manoj Nandwani told the court that Landicho did not falsify the documents which led to the deception.<br><br>Mr
               Nandwani stressed that his client's role in the whole affair was "to 
              forward information to the perpetrators" without taking part in the 
              falsification itself.<br><br>In response to these, Deputy Public 
              Prosecutor, Magdalene Huang told District Judge Jill Tan than the acts 
              of forgery would not have taken place without Landicho's soliciting.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
