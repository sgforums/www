              <p>Actually your karma has nothing to do with your next generation. However, due to a person's bad karma, it will "attract" children who have bad karma or of the same bad karma  to be born in that person's family. It is also called collective karma. That explains why some families have diseases that pass down from generation to generation and explains why some are unfortunately born in the families with medical history and some are not.</p>

              <p>I was surprised that my spouse brought up this topic last night.</p>
              <p>My spouse said "Japan got the retribution from what their past generation did during ww2. and sadly today generation has to suffer due to that."</p>
              <p>I replied : Shouldnt their grandparent generation get the retribution instead of today generation? It is really unfair."</p>
              <p>My s pouse replied "Nowadays when one do evil things, retribution might not fall on them doesnt mean that he will be free from his evil mind and deeds. His children or grandchildren or the next generation will pay for the price of his evil deeds."</p>
              <p>I replied: We should be humble, treat pple kindly, fairly, dont break pple's rice bowl, have a golden heart. To save yourself and your children and our future generation.</p>

              <p>One of the Ven. (monk) said as a Buddhist we shall not talk about karma or retribution when people are already in a very sorry state. He told us we Buddhists cannot talk about karma or retribution in regard to Japan natural disaster, just pray for them. Buddhism is always very compassionate.</p>

              <p>It is a matter of time he will have his retribution.ä¸�æ˜¯ä¸�æŠ¥ï¼Œå�ªæ˜¯æ—¶è¾°æœªåˆ°. It means it is not that he will not have his retribution, it is the timing is not right yet. Unless he repents before his time comes. I've seen people like him.</p>
              <p>There is an immediate retribution if anyone ever laugh or ridicule a person who is always ill. The person who laugh will have his retribution within a short period of time.</p>
              <p>There was this colleague who laughed and commented at another colleague who had long term sickness and was always hospitalised. Luckily I learnt from the Dharma not to laugh at anybody with sickness. I just listened and did not make any comment. Not long after, this colleague who laughed was hospitalised for a month and the doctor did not know what was wrong with him. After his discharge, he was unable to tell us exactly what made him hospitalised because doctor also unable to tell. This is not an isolated case. Anybody dare to challenge karma on this ?</p>
