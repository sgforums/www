              <p>I was surprised that my spouse brought up this topic last night.</p>
              <p>My spouse said "Japan got the retribution from what their past generation did during ww2. and sadly today generation has to suffer due to that."</p>
              <p>I replied : Shouldnt their grandparent generation get the retribution instead of today generation? It is really unfair."</p>
              <p>My s pouse replied "Nowadays when one do evil things, retribution might not fall on them doesnt mean that he will be free from his evil mind and deeds. His children or grandchildren or the next generation will pay for the price of his evil deeds."</p>
              <p>I replied: We should be humble, treat pple kindly, fairly, dont break pple's rice bowl, have a golden heart. To save yourself and your children and our future generation.</p>

              <h2><span id="Western_interpretation" class="mw-headline">Western interpretation</span></h2>
              <p>An academic and religious definition was mentioned above. The concept of karma is part of the world view of many millions of people throughout the world. Many in western cultures or with a Christian upbringing have incorporated a notion of karma. The Christian concept of reaping what you sow from Galatians 6:7 can be considered equivalent to Karma.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>According to karma, performing positive actions results in a good condition in one's experience, whereas a negative action results in a bad effect. The effects may be seen immediately or delayed. Delay can be until later in the present life or in the next. Thus, meritorious acts may mean rebirth into a higher station, such as a superior human or a godlike being, while evil acts result in rebirth as a human living in less desirable circumstances, or as a lower animal. Some observers<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space: nowrap;" title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. from March 2009"><span style="font-size: x-small;">[<em><a class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">who?</span></a></em>]</span></sup> have compared the action of karma to <a title="Western world" href="/wiki/Western_world"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Western</span></span></a> notions of <a href="/wiki/Sin"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">sin</span></span></a> and judgment by <a href="/wiki/God"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">God</span></span></a> or Gods, while others understand karma as an inherent principle of the universe without the intervention of any supernatural Being. In Hinduism, God does play a role and is seen as a dispenser of karma; see <a href="/wiki/Karma_in_Hinduism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Karma in Hinduism</span></span></a> for more details. The non-interventionist view is that of <a href="/wiki/Buddhism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Buddhism</span></span></a> and <a href="/wiki/Jainism"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Jainism</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>Most teachings say that for common mortals, being involved with karma is an unavoidable part of daily living. However, in light of the Hindu philosophical school of <a href="/wiki/Vedanta"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Vedanta</span></span></a>, as well as <a href="/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">Gautama Buddha</span></span></a>'s teachings, one is advised to either avoid, control or become mindful of the effects of desires and aversions as a way to moderate or change one's karma (or, more accurately, one's karmic results or destiny).</p>

              <p>If you believe in retribution then why sometimes good people die of cancer? why sometimes innocent children get raped n murdered? Just today I read about a court case in Australia where they trial a Aust guy for the murder of his 2 year old daughter by tossing her off a 50 foot bridge because he was frustrated wif his divorce. Innocent 2 year old gal killed by her father, what has she done to deserve tis?</p>
              <p>U still believe in retribution?</p>
              <p>I tell u, sometimes evil people get away wif doing bad things. Sometimes gud people get bad things happening to them.</p>

This attachment, which can take the form of greed, hatred, and ignorance in this life and past lives, can, unless mitigated, return as more suffering (karma). According to the Dhammapada, "By oneself the evil is done, and it is oneself who suffers: by oneself the evil is not done, and by one's Self one becomes pure."

              <p>Have you heard of ä¸‰ä¸–å›  ? Retribution or cause and effect can stretch for 3 life times or even more life times. The effect needs condition(ç¼˜or ratheræ�¶ç¼˜) to arise. Cause and effect is a complicated process. Only the enlightened ones can discern it.</p>
              <p>There are individual karma and collective karmaï¼ˆå…±ä¸šï¼‰. For instance, sometimes you read in the newspaper that the passengers in a car met an accident and passed away together. This is an example of collective karma. If you don't have the collective karma as them, for some reason you will not be in that car even though you are supposed to. May be someone more expert from wisdom bliss can explain better what is collective karma.</p>
              <p>A group of people committed murder together is a simple example of collective karma.</p>
