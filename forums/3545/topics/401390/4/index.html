              <h1 class="storyheadline">More twists to the MRT tale</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Maria Almenoar, Sujin Thomas &amp; Teh Joo Lin</p>
              <p>THE tale of the security breach at an MRT depot here took several 
              twists yesterday: Police were told of it only two days after it 
              occurred, and the Swiss national who left his mark on a train might not 
              have been working alone.</p>
              <p>In a statement last night, police said the breach took place
               on the night of May 16 or early the next morning.</p>
              <p>It added that police were informed only on May 19, at 
              7.15pm.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported yesterday that a YouTube video of
               the incident was posted online on May 18.</p>
              <p>That timeline of events meant the graffiti on the train, and
               the breach, went unnoticed for close to 48 hours.</p>
              <p>In its statement yesterday, police said the 33-year-old 
              Swiss national who was arrested on May 25 will be hauled to court today 
              to face charges of vandalism and trespass.</p>
              <p>It did not say why there was a time lapse between the breach
               and the police report.</p>

              <p><strong>Swiss national charged with vandalising SMRT train</strong><br> <span class="update">By Lynda Hong | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 05 June 2010 1035 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A Swiss national has been charged with trespassing 
              into an MRT depot and vandalising an SMRT train.
              <br> <br> 33-year-old Oliver Fricker was working in a Swiss company and had 
              planned to leave on May 27. 
              <br> <br> Instead, he was arrested on May 25, and was sent to court in a police 
              van on Saturday morning to face three charges.
              <br> <br> He is accused of trespassing into Changi depot on the late night of May 
              16 and early hours of May 17 this year.
              <br> <br> He also faces two charges - for vandalising an MRT train by spraying 
              paint, and damaging public property by cutting a wired fence belonging 
              to the Land Transport Authority.
              <br> <br> Police believe he was not alone; another man, a Briton named Lloyd Dane 
              Alexander, is also allegedly involved.
              <br> <br> It is not known if he is still in Singapore.
              <br> <br> The accused was offered bail of S$100,000. But he said he could not come
               up with the amount and asked for the bail to be reduced to S$40,000.
              <br> <br> His case will be heard again in two weeks on June 21.
              <br> <br> The alleged breach of security has prompted SMRT to step up security at 
              all its depots.
              <br> <br> SMRT is also working closely with the authorities to strengthen security
               at its perimeters, including additional surveillance and intrusion 
              detection systems. - CNA/jy/ms</span></p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>A SWISS national who works in Singapore was charged in court yesterday with trespass and the vandalism of an MRT train at the Changi depot.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, 32, a business consultant, was charged with cutting the fence of the depot and damaging public property.</p>
              <p>He was also charged with vandalism by spraying paint on two carriages of an SMRT train, and trespass for entering the Changi depot without permission some time between the late night of May 16 and the early hours of May 17.</p>
              <p>Also named on the charge sheet was British citizen Lloyd Dane Alexander. It is not known if he is still in Singapore, and the police are still investigating.</p>
              <p>The duo is believed to have cut through the fence of the depot along Xilin Avenue, although it was topped with barbed wire.</p>
              <p>Once inside the depot, they spray-painted graffiti on one side of a train. The graffiti had the words 'McKoy Banos', which is believed to be the signature of two persons who have vandalised trains in other countries too.</p>

              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You know what I feel? They should toss this bugger in jail and cane his backside to the consistency of Swiss cheese.</p>
              <p>Then he should be given a bouquet of flowers and a certificate of commendation for exposing SMRT's pathetic security arrangements at its depots.</p>

              <p>AT LAST.Â  The PAP has decided to treat WHITES the same as they treat Singaporeans.Â  I am SO HAPPY.</p>
              <p>1. For the first time, a white foreign talent doesn't get special treatment</p>
              <p>2. For the first time, the government made this white criminal FRONT PAGE NEWS. Usually, reports of whites criminals are TUCKED snugly inside an obscure page of the Straits Times in a little smallÂ  column</p>
              <p>3. For the first time, an ang mo may receive the maximum jail sentence.</p>
              <p>4. For the first time, an angmo will not get special privileges in court.Â  Remember, NICK LEESON stole US$800,000,000,000.00 and got 6.5 years jail. A LOCAL CHINESE ACCOUNTS CLERK stole $1,500.00 and received 18 years jail.</p>
              <p>5. Remember the ang mo woman who knocked down and killed a Korean woman was able to argue that Singapore street lamps are dim and she could not see the Korean. And the sycophantic Singapore judge actually believed and acquitted her</p>
              <p>6. At last, Singaporeans are not treated like 2nd class citizens.</p>
              <p>7. I hope this swiss guy gets hantum, clobbered and whallopped in Changi Prison by his soon-to-be Changi inmates. The inmates just can't wait to get their hands on him and screw him</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Briton may have left for HK</h1>
              <p>Â THE Briton named in court documents for his involvement in spray- 
              painting graffiti on an MRT train is believed to have left Singapore for
               Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>It is not known exactly when British citizen Lloyd Dane 
              Alexander left, but it was before SMRT reported the incident to the 
              police on the evening of May 19.</p>
              <p>Police said the break-in at SMRT's Changi depot, located 
              opposite the Singapore Expo, occurred some time late on May 16 into 
              early the next morning. The train went into service for two days in full
               view of commuters before the mischief was reported.</p>
              <p>Mr Alexander is said to have arrived here a few days before 
              the incident.</p>
              <p>A Swiss national was arrested about a week later.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, 32, a business consultant working in 
              Singapore, was charged in court last Saturday with trespassing and 
              vandalism.</p>

              <div class="kicker">MRT GRAFFITI CASE</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Swiss govt monitoring graffiti case</h1>
              <p>SINGAPORE - THE Swiss embassy said on Monday it plans to observe the 
              court case of a citizen facing prison and caning for allegedly 
              spray-painting graffiti on a Singapore metro train.</p>
              <p>Business consultant Oliver Fricker, 32, will appear for a 
              second time in court on June 21 on charges of trespassing in a metro 
              depot and vandalising a train, for which he could be jailed, fined and 
              whipped with a wooden cane.</p>
              <p>Peter Zimmerli, counsellor and deputy head of mission, told 
              AFP the embassy would inform Fricker's family of the case, help him find
               a lawyer and visit him. 'Also, it is possible that this embassy attends
               court hearings as an observer,' the diplomat said. 'We do not, however,
               pay bails for our fellow citizens or interfere actively in a running 
              law case.'</p>
              <p>A judge has impounded Fricker's passport and set bail at 
              S$100,000, rejecting bis plea for a lower amount because prosecutors 
              consider him a flight risk. Zimmerli declined to confirm whether 
              Fricker's family would be flying to Singapore.</p>
              <p>The court was told during the first session on Saturday that
               Fricker was with a Briton identified as Lloyd Dane Alexander when he 
              broke into the depot, a restricted zone surrounded by fences topped with
               barbed wire. Sources familiar with the case told AFP that Alexander was
               in Singapore on a tourist visa and left before a police report was 
              filed on May 19.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times newspaper reported Monday that Fricker and
               Alexander spray-painted the words 'McKoy Banos' on one side of a train -
               believed to be the signature of two shadowy graffiti artists who have 
              left similar marks on trains around the world. The train has been 
              scrubbed clean but the clip taken by a commuter can still be viewed on 
              YouTube. -- AFP</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Swiss man free on bail</h1>
              <p>THE Swiss man arrested for allegedly vandalising a Singapore metro 
              train with spray paint has been released on bail.</p>
              <p>Oliver Fricker, 32, posted $100,000 to be released but his 
              passport is still impounded to prevent him leaving the country.</p>
              <p>According to reports, the deputy head of the Swiss embassy 
              in Singapore, Peter Zimmerli, knew that Fricker was to be released. Mr 
              Zimmerli also stressed that Switzerland would not interfere in the court
               case.</p>
              <p>In previous The Straits Times reports, it has been suggested
               that Fricker and a British accomplice, who left days after the incident
               in mid-May, could be part of a group of underground graffiti artists 
              targeting metro trains around the world.</p>
              <p>Vandalism is punishable by up to three years' jail or a 
              maximum fine of $2,000, plus three to eight strokes of the cane. Fricker
               is scheduled to appear in court on June 21 on charges of trespass and 
              vandalism. In addition to the vandalism charge, trespassing in a 
              protected place carries a fine of $1,000 dollars or two years' jail, or 
              both.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, the court was told that Fricker was with 
              another man, identified as British citizen Lloyd Dane Alexander, when he
               broke into a train depot, a restricted zone surrounded by fences topped
               with barbed wire.</p>

              <p><strong>Arrest warrant out for second MRT vandal suspect</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 07 June 2010 2300 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A warrant of arrest has been issued for Briton Lloyd 
              Dane Alexander, the man suspected to be an accomplice of the Swiss 
              national charged with vandalising an MRT train in Singapore.
              <br> <br> In a statement released late Monday evening, the Police said that, in 
              consultation with the Attorney-General's Chambers, it applied for the 
              arrest warrant and this was granted by the Subordinate Courts.
              <br> <br> It added that Alexander remains at large.
              <br> <br> It has been revealed that he left Singapore before the incident was 
              reported to the Police.
              <br> <br> Swiss national, 33-year-old Oliver Fricker, has been charged with 
              vandalising an MRT train by spraying graffiti on it and damaging public 
              property by cutting a wired fence.
              <br> <br> He was released on Monday after posting a S$100,000 bail.
              <br> <br> It is believed his passport is still impounded to prevent him from 
              leaving the country.
              <br> <br> The incident was said to have taken place between late 16 May night and 
              early 17 May morning at the Changi Depot.
              <br> <br> SMRT reported the incident to Police only on 19 May.
              <br> <br> Fricker, a business consultant who worked in Singapore, was arrested on 
              25 May.
              <br> <br> Reports say his accomplice, Alexander, may have fled to Hong Kong.
              <br> <br> Vandalism is punishable by up to three years' jail or a maximum fine of 
              $2,000, plus three to eight strokes of the cane.
              <br> <br> Fricker is scheduled to appear in court again on June 21.
