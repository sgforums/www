              <h1>Singapore graffiti Briton sought</h1>
              <p>Singapore says it wants to extradite a British man accused of 
              spray-painting a tube train with graffiti.</p>
              <p>An arrest warrant has been issued for Lloyd Dane Alexander, for
               vandalism after allegedly breaking into a depot. A Swiss man has 
              already been charged.</p>
              <p>Singapore police said Mr Alexander fled Singapore after the 
              incident in May. Newspapers said he was in Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Vandalism in Singapore carries a fine of up to £978.63 or three
               years in jail and three to eight strokes of a cane.</p>
              <p>Police did not give details of his age, work or whereabouts.</p>
              <p>They have already charged a man they claim was his accomplice. 
              Oliver Fricker, 33, from Switzerland, faces one count of trespassing and
               two counts of vandalism</p>
              <p>He has been bailed and a hearing is set for 21 June.</p>
              <p><span class="cross-head">Rare sight</span></p>
              <p>Police said: "There is an accomplice at large. The identity has
               been established to be Lloyd Dane Alexander.</p>
              <p>"He is a British national and left Singapore before the 
              incident was reported to the police.</p>
              <p>The elaborate graffiti is a rare sight on the Singapore tube 
              and footage of it has been posted on websites and blogs.</p>
              <p>In 1994, Singapore caned US teenager Michael Fey for vandalism,
               ignoring leniency pleas by then President Bill Clinton.</p>

              <p><strong>SMRT says staff mistook graffiti on train for advert</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 08 June 2010 1844 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: SMRT has explained why there was a lapse of two days 
              before a police report was made about the train that was vandalised with
               graffiti.
              <br> <br> The company said its staff noticed the graffiti on the train on 17 May 
              but did not sound the alarm as it was done artistically and they mistook
               it for an advertisement. 
              <br> <br> The alarm was raised two days later on 19 May at 4pm by maintenance 
              staff when the train was recalled to the workshop for scheduled 
              maintenance. 
              <br> <br> A police report was made then and investigations led to a discovery of 
              the security breach at Changi depot. 
              <br> <br> SMRT said it immediately reviewed security measures in all its depots. 
              <br> <br> The number of security personnel and patrols at each depot has 
              increased.
              <br> <br> The security agency employed by SMRT at Changi depot has also been 
              reprimanded for the breach, and security personnel instructed to step up
               their vigilance. 
              <br> <br> Moving ahead, SMRT said it will improve visibility along the entire 
              perimeter of the Changi depot, which spans 3 kilometres. 
              <br> <br> The fence will also be reinforced with barbed coiled wires at the base. 
              <br> <br> The number of security cameras will also be more than doubled.
              <br> <br> There will be additional cameras installed at areas where the trains are
               launched daily at the depot.

              <p>That is a very poor excuse and if anything, is an admission of negligence.</p>
              <p>What they're saying is that they can't even keep track of which trains have what advertisements. I mean, surely at the very least they should have a checklist of the train's general condition upon entering and leaving the depot...... right?</p>
              <p>They are also saying that it took them a full two days to realize that the fence had been breached. Needless to say, this is <em>not</em> good security.</p>
