              <p>Unclerexy does not need a girlfriend on paper. On theory, if I do not get a girlfriend now, I stand to save at least $5 to 8k per year, depending on the profile of the</p>
              <p>girl. If I start searching at 35, I can save around $50k, and this is more than 1 entire year of my salary. Besides, if I start searching at 35, some girls may be so</p>
              <p>desperate, I can get two for the budget of one, i.e. one in Singapore, one in China assuming that budget airline tickets to China remain affordable in face of rising</p>
              <p>fuel prices.</p>
              <p>But uncle has made a decision. After several months of Lunch Actually dating, Lovestruck, and also trying to know several Malaysia and China girls from my workplace,</p>
              <p>nobody really made me want to settle down.</p>
              <p>Still, one day after he got out from workplace and hit Harbourfront for shopping, he was at Seam Im Hawker Center when a very strange phenomenon caught his attention.</p>
              <p>Along the stretch of Muslim stalls, facing the main road, there was a Thai hawker stall selling Beef Pad Thai .. Fried Rice.. or what u got. The counter was a Malay</p>
              <p>girl collecting cash, behind the cashier, was a very fair Asian maiden at the wok, dishing up Thai food at super speed. Very very energetic.</p>
              <p>I walked around for a moment, because I was not hungry, BUT, I am curious about the girl!</p>
              <p>I called home, and my mother say home got cook, so I chose to head towards the MRT station.. and still.. 1 minute later, gut feeling took over and I called my mother</p>
              <p>and said I am not coming home for dinner.</p>
              <p>I went to the Thai stall, the Malay girl go toilet, and I asked the cook whom I thought she was Chiangmai-ese, whether can I order Beef Kway Teow without the Beef, and</p>
              <p>she replied in a PRC accent, yes you can. I will cook for you, without the Beef.</p>
              <p>A thought flashed across my head that very moment, can we have marriage without intimacy also? I can get my HDB flat, and you can get your Singapore citizenship if you</p>
              <p>desire.</p>
              <p>Still, with CNY the next day, I ate the kway teow without beef, and I totally enjoyed it. It was just so Bangkok International Airport, a taste I savour so much since</p>
              <p>my first trip to Thailand. It is spicy, hot, sour, and a bit chaotah. And when I eat with my Teh Tarik from the Malay corner stall, it had all the elements of love,</p>
              <p>including sweetness blended in under $5.</p>
              <p>Uncle wants to know the girl, but I do not know what is forbidding me. It could be that .. I have lost interest in love, I am finding a girlfriend because I am tired</p>
              <p>of searching, and the reason why I search is because life needs to carry on! My mother needs to feel jealous that she lost a son to a girl, yet she needs babies sooner</p>
              <p>or later to take care of her own emotional needs, I myself have no inclination to settle down since my career is not on track, YET, the chinese saying of æˆ�å®¶ç«‹ä¸šï¼Œyou</p>
              <p>set up the family first, then with the legendary (but untrustworthy) modern careerwoman supporting you, then you get yourself a career.</p>
              <p>Besides, can you actually trust a China wife? I swear to you, I think I could. But my mother may not, but u can have the son, I want the grandson nevertheless. And..</p>
              <p>can I actually afford a Singaporean wife in my lifetime? Something tells me, don't count on it. A Malaysian wife is the best of breed, with Asian gentleness, and an</p>
              <p>occasional education and family background that does not scare off the ordinary Joe like me. Still, where to find? They are across the Causeway, but the right one does</p>
              <p>not fall from skies.</p>
              <p>Still..</p>
              <p>.. the fried kway teow from Seah Im hawker center was the best any under 35 year old woman has cooked for me in the past 10 years.</p>
              <p>Love still travels via the stomach huh.</p>
              <p>Basically, I think I need help. Typically, I will write a story, then exchange it at a forum for some generic feelings so that I can get by another day without a</p>
              <p>girlfriend. But then.. social escort cheapest $300 per hour, no hidden expenses. If I need 1 per month, 12 per year, assuming my libido does not decrease with age,</p>
              <p>that is $3600 per year. And by the age of 35, I would have spent $18000 on supporting friendly hardware and software companies. And still, no family to speak of. If I</p>
              <p>marry a China girl, then divorce by 35, will I be incur more debt? Social escort services are not part of the GDP, the government will not give tax rebates if I choose to support them. They may even come a time when they will PAY ME to marry a Singaporean girl when I am 35 and they are left on the shelves.</p>
              <p>don't bother to read.</p>

              <p>I think, having something higher to strive for, is very important.</p>
              <p>I created my own niche religion, called the Pencil Case religion, is because in my pencil case, there are lots of stationery. Got blue color, red color, black color, green marker, then got staple bullets, and also ruler. In my religion, it does not matter whether I come from IMH, or you come from IMH, the point is, every pens got its own long and short.</p>
              <p>You like what color today?</p>
              <p>Take loh. If u use finish, remember to put back to pencil case. Somebody else may like it.</p>
              <p>Some pple like 2000 years of legacies, tried and tested, some like variety, who am I to judge? When I spit saliva from my mouth, the germs also head in 360 degrees, u decide what suits u best.</p>
              <p>Lee said before alot of things. But if I tell u what I learnt from myself, it is not what you do or do not do that is the problem, it is what i do or do not do that is <strong>my</strong> problem.</p>
              <p>so u believe when Lee ask u to marry a guy / gay? Well, by all means. When Lee tells u the window is open for u to jump, well, by all means.</p>
              <p>If it ain't fun, why do it?</p>

              <p>Poke what?</p>
              <p>hahahahahhahaa.</p>
              <p>my ex-boss, whom i happily worked with around 2-3 years.. i love her stories. She carries a LV bag, and everytime (I was an intern then), offered to help her carry her handbag, she'll say, Rex, no.</p>
              <p>I liked that 40-year old woman, and it is not because she wears two diamond earrings, one to represent each twin she gave birth, and a bunch of diamond rings, one for wedding, one for anniversary, one for cannot remember, it just kept getting bigger... and yet, it was not the diamond rings.</p>
              <p>She told me one simple thing. Rex, we are consultants. Look at our customers, our job is to skin their fur or wool and earn enough for ourselves, and also allow them enough life, so that they can grow back somemore fur, then we come back for round two.</p>
              <p>The 27-year old female colleague I had, could not take her style of work, and she quit within a year.</p>
              <p>She was using a Gucci. And my 34-year old supervisor, also a female married woman, was alternating between Chloe, Guess, I forgot that name.. is it burbery or what.. I bought one for my mother.</p>
              <p>Guess what they bought for me on Christmas in 2006. A $60 Zara tie. Dang! Who am I to blame women either! I just cannot join them when they go for brazilian waxing together on Saturdays, after they quarrel from Monday to Friday.... I... CANNOT CONDONE Brazilian waxing for males.</p>
              <p>We must have principles. Shaving armpit hair is fine, but brazilian waxing is a no no.</p>
              <p>But we have to take ONE woman home sooner or later to meet the parents right. My mother has a Burbery.. again, what's the name.. my girlfriend, must learn to respect elders. I will get her a Gucci perhaps..i dunno.</p>
              <p>But poketo? fill me in. It took me 4 years to get over my ex. That one was a Wallet Shop one.</p>

              <p>Rubbish.</p>
              <p>When I was earning &gt;$50k yesteryear pa, I also carried a leather wallet. Crocodile brand. Leather belt. Also Crocodile brand. Got smell one. You earn what you spend. Paisei, you spend what you earn.</p>
              <p>When retrenchment hit me in 2009, I am content now with my $14 Carvon Keno even though my Crocodile one is still in good shape. The point is, once a consultant, always a consultant. When all your peers are broke, you gotta pretend to look even broke-r.</p>
              <p>I gotta imagine you are a talking internet robot, if not I will not go for Thai dinner tonight. Bl**dy distractions.</p>
              <p>My other best friend still owes me $2000 which he borrowed to repay his brother's gambling debts. It's always the brother's fault. Either the one on the body or the one who lives with you. So much for friendship.</p>
              <p>have fun...</p>

              <p>I am unemployed now. Last time I met this tour guide who brought people from Sg to Taiwan, he tells me he like to do tour guiding because he can see the world, and when his people go back to hotel, he will check out the latest black shops in the Taiwan back alley. Then open ji ki (open one bottle), sit there look at colours of people.</p>
              <p>Maybe I am in his line.</p>

              <p>Yeah. First you take away the clothing, then the undergarment, then the skin. What you are left with is the skeleton, blood, urine, pus, body organs, an a sibei chio skull. You want to know what a girl is thinking? Fine. Open the skull, take out the brain, dissect the left and right hemisphere, what you left with? A bunch of sparks and blood and oxygen and fats. Still, I cannot find the girl who loves me. Where the f*** is she hiding!</p>

              <p><br>I once took this kiddo. He was a N-Level student, broken family, because he was a Malay, but orphaned, then a Chinese parents adopted him, thye were rich, they buy mp3 players, travel packages, and everything for him, but no time to take care cos the two chinese parents have to tour the world to earn money.</p>
              <p>This boy.. that time 15 years old iirc, did not even believe in marrying a guy.</p>
              <p>He told me, f*** religion, if you want to prove for me that hell exists, bring me there. I loved that kid.</p>
              <p>Especially when the last time I heard from him, he was thrown out of the school, because in the middle of in between lessons, he and another guy classmate, decided to have some fun and they stripped each others pants and performed anal sex in the classroom.</p>
              <p>Dang! He had the guts to do what I dare not do.</p>
