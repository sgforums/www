              <h1 class="storyheadline">What's in a public name? A lot</h1>
              <p>NAMING a public institution after an individual is one of the highest 
              tributes a nation can offer. So, it seems inappropriate for a 
              public-funded hospital to be named after its largest donor ('Family of 
              Ng Teng Fong gives $125m to hospital'; last Saturday).</p>
              <p>Singapore has maintained a tradition of naming public 
              institutions and important landmarks after those who have made sterling 
              contributions or great sacrifices for the country.</p>
              <p>For example, pioneer philanthropists Tan Tock Seng and Tan 
              Kah Kee, former president Benjamin Sheares and former health minister 
              Ahmad Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>The impact of their contributions has been widely felt in 
              Singapore. Naming important institutions and landmarks after them not 
              only shows the nation's gratitude for their services, but also serves to
               inspire future generations to follow in their footsteps.</p>
              <p>The future Jurong General Hospital will cost the Government 
              millions to build, and more public funds will be needed to operate it. 
              So, naming it after its largest donor is inappropriate.</p>
              <p>If the hospital were to be named after a deserving 
              Singaporean, it should carry former deputy prime minister Goh Keng 
              Swee's name.</p>
              <p>As one of Singapore's founding fathers, Dr Goh's manifold 
              contributions and unstinting selflessness in serving the country 
              resonates with Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>How can any Singaporean forget that it was Dr Goh who was 
              instrumental in turning Jurong from a swamp into the nation's industrial
               heartland?</p>
              <p>Naming the first major hospital there after Dr Goh would be a fitting tribute.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">ST poll: 80% against name change of Jurong hospital</h1>
              <p>A MAJORITY of Straits Times readers who participated in an online poll 
              felt that Jurong General Hospital should not have been renamed Ng Teng 
              Fong Hospital after its biggest donor.</p>
              <p>Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan had announced in Parliament 
              last Friday that Jurong General Hospital would be renamed Ng Teng Fong 
              Hospital, after the family of the late property tycoon donated $125 
              million to the hospital.</p>
              <p>Slated to open in 2014, the hospital is fully funded by the 
              Government but private donations provide additional assistance to needy 
              patients, among other services.</p>
              <p>The name change prompted our reader Andy Lim to <strong><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/STForum/Story/STIStory_643365.html">write</a></strong> in to The Straits Times Forum earlier this week, asking if it was 
              appropriate to name a public hospital after its largest donor, and 
              proposing that the hospital be renamed after the man credited with the 
              transformation of Jurong - Dr Goh Keng Swee - instead.</p>
              <p>Of the nearly 800 readers who responded to our online poll, 
              78.4 per cent agreed that Jurong General Hospital should not have been 
              renamed after its biggest donor.</p>
              <p>Here is a selection of the comments we received:</p>
              <p><strong>Non-supporters</strong></p>
              <p>'It would be more appropriate to have a wing/ward of the 
              hospital named after Ng Teng Fong in recognition of his sizeable 
              donation. The hospital itself should bear a different name - one that 
              reflects Singapore's medical history.' - tanxyme</p>
              <p>'We should be thankful that someone generously donated a large sum of money, but a plaque would do.' - Anonymous</p>
              <p>'A hospital's name must instantly reflect its location. 
              Imagine someone being taken by ambulance to Ng Teng Fong Hospital... 
              would the family know where it is at?' - Samuel Tiew</p>
              <p>'For public institutions, two characteristics need to be 
              fulfilled. Besides the donation, the life and work of the individual 
              must be consistent with the message and value of the institution. Money 
              alone does not carry naming rights at this level. Chair of a 
              professorship, yes. A public building, no.' - Anonymous</p>
              <p>'Public institutions should be named after national figures 
              and heroes, not just those with deep pockets. Dr Goh Keng Swee would be a
               good example of one such hero of the nation.' - Anonymous</p>
              <p>'If one were to secure the land, build the hospital and then
               hand it over to the government as a donation, then it would be OK to 
              name the hospital after the donor.' - Anonymous</p>
              <p>'If you donate out of sincerity, you shouldn't want it to be
               named after you. You should let the public vote for a name.' - Chris 
              Chan SC</p>
              <p>' I don't find it wrong to name the hospital after him. 
              $125m is a lot of money... Would you donate even a million just to have 
              your name on a building?' - Olivia Sin Leow</p>
              <p><strong>Supporters</strong></p>
              <p>'I think it's fine. It's also part of Singapore history. 50 
              years down the road, people will remember him the way they remember Tan 
              Kah Kee, Lim Boon Seng, etc. Better than Jurong. Zero meaning.' - Ivy 
              Teo</p>
              <p>'It's a way to remember the generosity of people who help in many different ways...' - Anonymous</p>
              <p>'Mr Ng Teng Fong is the King of Orchard Road. Without his 
              contributions, some parts of Orchard Road wouldn't be what it is today.
