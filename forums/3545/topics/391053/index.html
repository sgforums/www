              <h1>15 year old Singaporean started petition to ask Lee Kuan Yew to apologize to Singaporeans for disparaging remarks made on National Geographic magazine</h1>
              <p><strong>Written by Our Correspondent</strong></p>
              <p>A 15 year old Singaporean by the name of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/profile.php?id=742626270&amp;ref=ts"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Kenneth Lin</span></a> started an online <a href="http://www.ipetitions.com/petition/lkyapologise/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">petition</span></a> against Singapore’s strongman Lee Kuan Yew for his disparaging remarks on Singaporeans made during his interview with the National Geographic Magazine. He is currently studying in a secondary school in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The remarks in contention from the article are:</p>
              <p><strong>“Over time, Singaporeans have become “less hard-driving and hard-striving. That is why it  is a good thing that the nation has welcomed so many Chinese  immigrants (25 percent of the population is now foreign-born).</strong></p>
              <p>and</p>
              <p><strong>“But taking a  typically Darwinian stance, the MM describes the country’s new subjects as  “hungry,” with parents who “pushed the children very hard.” If native Singaporeans are falling behind because “the spurs are not stuck into the hide,” that is their problem.”</strong></p>
              <p>He added that it is especially deplorable that such insensitive remarks can be issued forth from the very person responsible for the social engineering of Singapore to the state of being it is today:</p>
              <p><em>“By forcing through dubious policies that have largely tanked, such as the Stop At 2 policy, Graduate Mothers scheme, Mr Lee<br>Kuan Yew’s irresponsible attempts at altering the demographics of our society have left the present leadership no choice but to import foreign workers in such large numbers in such a short period of time in order to make up for the  shortfall in labour requirements. This has led to widespread disgruntlement and social unrest in amongst the citizenry.”</em></p>
              <p>Kenneth wrote that he plans to attain a suitable quorum of about 500 signatures, and then CC the results of the petition via email to every MP, Minister by the next parliament seating. Following that, the results of the petition will also be compiled into a physical form to be sent via registered mail to Lee Kuan Yew’s home address, the Istana and the PM’s office.</p>
              <p>Though Lee is widely credited as the architect of modern Singapore by the older generation, young Singaporeans are becoming increasingly peeved off by his apparent arrogance and insensitivity at times.</p>
              <p>Currently nearing 87 years of age, he still calls the shots in the government despite his admission that he is not doing much work lately except “forecasting” which costs Singapore taxpayers nearly $3 million dollars a year.</p>
              <p>Lee still hasn’t announced if he would participate in the next general elections. There will be many Singaporeans like Kenneth who cannot wait to see the last of the “Old Man”.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>He did not mention about LKY did name calling to people who feed him “<span style="color: #0000ff;">Singaporeans are</span> <em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">champion grumblers</span></strong></span></em>.”</p>

              <p>I'm assuming it's the same group on facebook that is demanding for LKY's apology.</p>
              <p>Call it wise, mature, intelligent, ignorance, apathy or stupidity, but I think that though the 15 year old may have a "right" to criticise LKY for whatever reasons he feels just, he's still only a teenager, like myself.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it is with good reason that it is mainly the younger generation (i.e. my generation) that is "becoming increasingly peeved off by his apparent arrogance and insensitivity at times."</p>
              <p>As I said earlier, could be intelligence, ignorance, wisdom or maybe maturity of the youth (oh the irony) that could spark such a negative reaction from one of my peers?</p>
              <p>Just my two cents.</p>

              <p>the youngsters has really been complacent. Many dun have the hunger/ will/ focus to strive to improve this place one calls home already.</p>
              <p>Even improving infastrcuture discounting events like YOG, govt dept can shoot it down citing cost. It's as if contenting w/ current standards.</p>
              <p>Everyone has to remember we've no natural resources to survive on. The only way for this island to survive is to provide efficient, productivty and cutting edge services better than others to investors.</p>

              <p>Should have a link at Speaker's Corner to this thread.</p>
              <p>This 15 year should put to shame some supposedly mature ass at Speaker's Corner - who can hardly get over their fixated prejudice with some members from the Alternative Parties, but will prefer to maintain their political apathy by sitting on the fence - waiting for some political figure to appear on the scene instead of taking the initiative to be pro-active.</p>
              <p>All that these pathetic fence sitters can do is to criticise the performance of any Singaporean who will dare to stand up, and will be the first to lampoon these persons who will be unfortunate enough to be mercilessly mowed down by the unscrupulous acts of LKY and his PAP machinery.</p>

              <p>but what LKY says is true, if sporeans can't beat others on your homeground, can you really expect a small island country to survive in the global landscape? he's 87, he's definitely not always right, but on this count, he definitely is. </p>
              <p>i think kenneth lin just wants to bring up the point that LKY is responsible for the social flaws that he brought up, and LKY therefore shouldn't be screwing other people for his own mistakes.</p>
              <p>actually, why make so much noise? it's a survival game after all, and LKY is just trying his best to push singapore to survive. sometimes as a politician, he just has to make tough and unpopular choices. it's not easy to understand men in his position, why brew further conflict?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i just think the whole petition is unnecessary, and proves the old man's point even further </p>

              <p>It has to do with our education system.</p>
              <p>Parents all kaisu, go children to tuition, to play piano, to swimming, many many course.....until to a point where children only remember 1 thing: Rely on the tuitor and coaches for answers.</p>
              <p>Thus, they cannot fully able to think for themselves.</p>
              <p>They willl nvr have the hunger to strive forwards, afterall, I have lots of tuitors if I have problems. That attitude should change.</p>
              <p>Thus, Education system should be review.</p>
              <p>Dont stress and heavily rely on grading/marks, more should do on thinking skills and team working.</p>
              <p>You see our children now....all study like tomorrow no more.</p>

              <p>The parents can decide whether their kids to go for what tution.</p>
              <p>It is not the fault of education system.</p>
              <p>No one forced the parents to force their kids.</p>
              <p>If the parent cannot be responsible for the suffering of their children, no one else is.</p>

              <p>That is a good point Med.</p>
              <p>Parents have been deciding for their kids.</p>
              <p>But really, if you are a parents, you will feel how stressful the kids are.</p>
              <p>Every students want to be a top students.</p>
              <p>They study study until become like a bookworm. And the education system need to shift to have more interactive more discussion, more outing, more decision making to make a students ready to face the society.</p>
              <p>But seem like those are not met and everybody is study to get best results, nothing else.</p>
              <p>For me, I did not force my children at all. I let them be, ask them to be responsible and let them decide and make decision.</p>

              <p>Should have a link at Speaker's Corner to this thread.</p>
              <p>This 15 year should put to shame some supposedly mature ass at Speaker's Corner - who can hardly get over their fixated prejudice with some members from the Alternative Parties, but will prefer to maintain their political apathy by sitting on the fence - waiting for some political figure to appear on the scene instead of taking the initiative to be pro-active.</p>
              <p>All that these pathetic fence sitters can do is to criticise the performance of any Singaporean who will dare to stand up, and will be the first to lampoon these persons who will be unfortunate enough to be mercilessly mowed down by the unscrupulous acts of LKY and his PAP machinery.</p>

              <p>If your policy and your intention is pure and kind, the effect will speak for itself.</p>
              <p>When you need to use fear and defence for your policy, it meant that your policy does not work.</p>
              <p>Even if there is a need to explain your policy, there is no reason to belittle people who have contributed to your salary.</p>
              <p>There are still hardworking people in singapore and that is why you can happily stay up there to make such an accusations.</p>
