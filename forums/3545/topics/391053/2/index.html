              <p><br>The way you are that is no wonder people in Singapore are suffering from paying more and more.  If others want to bo chup does not mean this 15 year old needs to follow suit.</p>
              <p>The very fact that people praised this 15 year old for his action is because he is unlike what you said of the bochup people.</p>

              <p>i think kenneth lin just wants to bring up the point that LKY is responsible for the social flaws that he brought up, and LKY therefore shouldn't be screwing other people for his own mistakes.</p>
              <p>actually, why make so much noise? it's a survival game after all, and LKY is just trying his best to push singapore to survive. sometimes as a politician, he just has to make tough and unpopular choices. it's not easy to understand men in his position, why brew further conflict?</p>

              <p>The problem is not about beating others on our home turf - as it is more about the PAP opening the flood-gates and allowing a flood of foreigners to overwhelm us, and make us even more dependent on the PAP.</p>
              <p>Since the Colonial Days, Singapore was doing fine up until LKY entered the political scene in 1957, and embarked on his own ambitious social engineering.</p>
              <p>In the late 1960s, after being kicked out of Malaysia, LKY panicked with the challenges that faced him, and insisted in implementing population control as part of the means to defuse a political time bomb in finding sufficient jobs to placate a growing population. This was at a time when UK had also announced its plans to withdraw from her colonies East of Suez.</p>
              <p>In the process, he refused to listen to those advisers who tried to persuade him on the fine line of tinkering with social engineering in population control.</p>
              <p>He did not listen, and continued with his old strategy of creating an environment that made Singaporeans depend on the PAP for everything to survive.</p>
              <p>Has it not dawn on you that from the very beginning it has been LKY's strategy to control the future of Singaporeans, and in the process to control his own political future ?</p>
              <p>With the Government Linked Companies dominating the commercial scene and pushing aside large, medium and small enterprises, and monopolising all aspects of services required by Singaporeans - the Government Linked Companies had by the late-1970s, become the largest employer of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>By 2004, the NTUC policy of getting Singaporeans to accept the "no iron rice bowl" idea and to accept short term employment contracts - is to help the GLCs to lower their costs to retrench Singaporeans made redundant at every economic downturn cycle, that had become more regular every five to ten years since 1987.</p>
              <p>Can the enterprise of Singaporeans compete against the overwhelming Government Linked Companies ?</p>
              <p>By beating the foreigners on home ground - it is obvious that LKY is suggesting that Singaporeans accept the stupidity of Lim Swee Say's "cheaper, better and faster" - and accept the lower paying jobs now taken up by foreigners.</p>
              <p>The number of Foreign Talents that actually take up the higher paying jobs cannot be more then the large numbers of Bangladeshis, Myanmese, Filippinos and PRC Chinese taking up the many mid-level paying skilled jobs.</p>
              <p>The largest employer of these low paying foreigners are the many government linked companies such as shipyards, airport operations, engineering firms, super-markets, and medical sectors.</p>
              <p>The intention of the PAP Government as Singapore Inc - is to lower its own costs of operations so as to be in a better position to report its own super performance to Singaporeans, and all done at the expense of Singaporeans who pay their million dollar wages.</p>
              <p>The 15-year old showed the clarity of mind to be able to cut through the issues that clearly showed the ingrate in LKY, who having climbed the ladder of success, has now forgotten who helped him build and placed that ladder in position for him to climb</p>
              <p>This is the avarice shown in LKY, who dared to accuse JBJ for showing avarice in his persistent attempts to gain political success.</p>
              <p>Why will such a thought enter the mind of LKY ?</p>
              <p>Knowing the far-sighted ways of LKY, this was already part of his own thought process - way back in the 1980s; and which saw fruition in the million dollar wages being paid out in the late 1990s when all opposition is neutralised, retired, exiled, or dead.</p>
