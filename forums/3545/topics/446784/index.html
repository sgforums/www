              <p>A group of 200 disgruntled foreign workers went on a seven-hour sit-out

              <p>A group of 200 disgruntled <a href="http://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/Missing-migrant-workers-afpsg-3630633687.html">foreign workers</a> went on a seven-hour sit-out on Monday morning in Tampines over a dispute of unpaid salaries.<br><br>Instead
               of starting work at 8 am, Bangladeshi workers from Sunway Concrete Pte 
              Ltd and TechCom Construction gathered in an empty field at Tampines 
              Industrial Street 62.<br><br>Sunway is the main contractor and Techcom is the sub-contractor hired by HDB to fabricate building materials for flats.<br><br>The
               workers have not been paid for four months running, since November last
               year. They were also unhappy about the quality of the food served in 
              the canteen.<br><br>“All men same problem, all men no pay for four 
              months,” said K. Ravhkumar. According to the 35-year-old, his usual 
              working hours are from 8am to 10pm. <br><br>However, he said that 
              workers would be made to work till 12 am on busy days, without overtime 
              pay. An average worker earns a basic salary of $18 per day. <br><br>The 
              strike slowly dissipated at about 3pm as workers were told by 
              representatives of the company that they would receive their November 
              pay today, and their December pay next Friday.<br><br>It is not confirmed when they will receive their salary for January.<br><br>According to some workers, it is not the first time the company has fallen behind payments for its foreign workers.<br><br>In
               addition, the Bangladeshi workers also complained about the poor 
              quality of food served in the canteen. Said Samid Sikdek, 35: “Cow also 
              cannot <em>makan</em> (eat), we how to <em>makan</em>.”<br><br>Currently, about $150 is deducted each month from their salaries as food expenses, and another $20-50 for utilities.<br><br>A
               spokesman for Sunway, who declined to be named, claimed that the 
              sit-out originated from a core group of about 10 Bangladeshi workers.<br><br>“A
               few of them took some weapons and threatened the others. Some don’t 
              know what is going on but just joined in…Majority of the workers do not 
              dare to speak because they are scared they will get <em>hamtum </em>(beaten up),” he said. <br><br>Jolovan Wham, a representative from the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/foreign-workers-singapore-bear-brunt-021924424.html">Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics</a>,
               said: “From my experience, workers usually resort to such actions when 
              they are desperate and fed up. I believe they must have reached the 
              tipping point for them to decide not to work.”<br><br>According to a 
              Ministry of Manpower (MOM) spokesperson, its officers responded to the 
              incident immediately after they were alerted by the police and went down
               to the worksite.<br><br>MOM’s interim investigations revealed that the 
              employers had not paid their workers since November 2011. MOM 
              understands that by 8pm today (6 February 2012), the employers would 
              have paid out the November 2011 salaries to all the affected workers, 
              with MOM officers present on-site.<br><br>The employers have also 
              assured MOM that the affected workers will receive their outstanding 
              December 2011 salaries by this Friday (10 February). <br><br>"MOM will 
              continue investigations here and follow up with the workers to ensure 
              that they receive their December 2011 and January 2012 salaries 
              promptly. MOM officers will also interview workers on other 
              employment-related issues," said the spokesperson. <br><br>"MOM does not
               condone employers who fail to pay salaries on time, or fail to upkeep 
              and maintain the foreign workers they have brought in. MOM urges workers
               to report to MOM early if they have salary arrears."<br><br>When contacted by Yahoo! Singapore, TechCom declined to comment.</p>

              Owing foreign works 4 months of salary  is totally unacceptable! What are the authorities doing about this? It is not the first time that this has happened. Penalising the company is of no use as they can just registered another business name or company to repeat their offence!
              If the owner of anyone company does this, a court order forcing them to pay  must be made  or else bankcruptcy issued to them, they should also  be jailed if it is a repeat offence,  and then  be black listed by the Registrar of Companies and made to pay a hefty deposit  should they ever want to employ foreign workers again.These owners of big contracting businesses just have no compassion for workers.
