              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              problem of obesity is getting worse in Singapore.<br><br>The latest 
              National Health Survey shows the obesity rate has increased from 6.9 per
               cent in 2004 to 10.8 per cent this year.<br><br>This year's National 
              Healthy Lifestyle campaign is thus adopting a more holistic approach to 
              help Singaporeans fight the flab.<br><br>More than 1,000 people turned 
              up at the launch of the campaign by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.<br><br>They
               tried out the new Singapore Workout that includes traditional dance 
              moves.<br><br>The message is for Singaporeans to get healthy together 
              and combat obesity.<br><br>Health Promotion Board (HPB) CEO Lam Pin Woon
               said: "Based on the National Health Survey, the obesity rate is 
              definitely on the upturn.<br><br>"This is very alarming for us; we do 
              not want to be in the same situation like the other western countries 
              where the obesity rate is that one in three of the population is obese.<br><br>"For
               now, our obesity rate is (about) 10 per cent - that's already very 
              alarming, and we have to do something about it. <br><br>"This year, we 
              want to create a social movement (and) get everyone to see the value of 
              having a healthy weight (and) enjoy life by being healthy".<br><br>The 
              HPB attributes the rise in obesity here to a lack of physical activity 
              and a more sedentary lifestyle.<br><br>The National Health Survey found 
              that 45.9 per cent of Singaporeans do not exercise.<br><br>Mr Neville 
              Dotival, who lost about 18kg over three months to weigh 88.8kg, said: "I
               feel a lot better, I feel more energetic, I can play more with my kids.
               <br><br>He added that he is now fit enough to join his sons in 
              activities during school events such as Sports Day. <br><br>HPB's Youth 
              Health Division director K Vijaya said: "There is a growing body of 
              evidence to suggest that chronic disease including obesity has its roots
               in pre-natal and the early developmental stages of one's life. <br><br>"As
               a result of this evidence, we are shifting our obesity prevention 
              efforts further upstream, to the pre-natal and early years of one's 
              life.  <br><br>"We will be empowering parents to nurture health 
              lifestyles, among their children.<br><br>"We are coming up with 
              guidelines, strategies to provide a conducive environment for this 
              purpose such as baby friendly hospitals that support breast feeding. <br><br>"In
               addition, we will be coming up with guidelines to prevent 
              indiscriminate advertising of food and beverages to children".<br><br>Other
               efforts include getting those from the food industry to develop lower 
              calorie food products and meals, to cut some 25 billion kilocalories 
              from Singapore's food supply by 2013.<br><br>HPB also intends to roll 
              out a nationwide Body Mass Index survey every two to three years to 
              better monitor obesity trends.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
