              <div class="kicker">NEWSPAPERS, and television and radio stations should cool off on 
              election reporting on the eve of polls, which has now been designated a 
              campaign cooling-off day.
              <p>Three MPs - Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong, Non-Constituency
               MP Sylvia Lim and Nominated MP Viswa Sadasivan - yesterday wanted to 
              see curbs placed on the mainstream media on the day when voters are 
              expected to mull over their election choices.</p>
              <p>Under laws passed yesterday, mainstream media outlets would 
              still be allowed to carry election news on cooling-off day, even though 
              political parties would have to stop campaigning.</p>
              <p>Opposition members Mr Chiam and Ms Lim claimed that this 
              would present a loophole for the ruling party to continue to get its 
              message out. They accused the mainstream media of being biased towards 
              the People's Action Party (PAP).</p>
              <p>In a brief speech in Parliament, Mr Chiam described the 
              introduction of a cooling-off day as a move 'designed to disadvantage 
              the opposition'.</p>
              <p>'If the PAP really wants a cooling-off day, it should also 
              ban all newspaper reports on Polling Day,' he said.</p>

              <div class="kicker">COOLING OFF FOR POLLING DAY</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Media won't fan fever</h1>
              <p>WITH reference to yesterday's report ('Should media also cool off?') 
              on comments by Members of Parliament on the need for a cooling-off 
              period for the media on the eve of polling day, similar to that for 
              political parties, my sense is there is no need.</p>
              <p>Singapore's news media has always given an accurate picture 
              of current events. It prizes its credibility and objectivity, and so is 
              unlikely to fan the flames of election fever.</p>
              <p>A further plus is that Singapore's media companies are not 
              owned by political parties, unlike in other countries.</p>
              <p>But what matters most is that Singaporeans are better 
              educated and can judge for themselves where general elections are 
              concerned.</p>
              <p>They do not need last-minute information from any party to 
              influence their decision.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Media should observe cooling-off rules</h1>
              <p>I AGREE with Mr Jeffrey Law that readers should have faith in our news 
              media ('Media won't fan fever'; last Thursday). But I disagree that news
               media need not comply with complete blackouts of reporting any 
              politically sensitive content - comments by political heavyweights, 
              lawsuits against candidates, announcements of policy and rule changes, 
              and press statements and advertisements by government departments - 
              during the cooling-off period. Voters should not be bombarded with such 
              news.</p>
              <p>It is wrong to assume that Singaporeans are better educated,
               so they can exercise good judgment to make the right decision even when
               news media carries politically sensitive content favourable to one 
              political party on the cooling-off day. If these are the stable 
              conditions, why do we need the cooling-off day at all?</p>
              <p>The real test of this new cooling-off day lies in how the 
              ruling party observes the rules it has set. If the 24-hour window rules 
              were really designed to disadvantage the opposition parties, it may 
              boomerang back against the ruling party and voters may swing against it.
               Any abuse could cause it to cut both ways.</p>
              <p>The test also applies to mainstream multimedia to observe 
              the spirit of the cooling-off window, when no local radio and television
               stations, related websites and newspapers and their online platforms 
              should take advantage of the interpretations of the rules to report 
              political content. Blackout means blackout.</p>
              <p>The cooling-off day will truly be observed as a peaceful day
               where no politically sensitive content appears in any form. The truth 
              is that Singapore will continue to function without any political news 
              for one day, and voters having made up their minds over the cooling-off 
              day can go to the polls without distractions.</p>
