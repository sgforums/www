              <h1 class="storyheadline">How was the buggy missed?</h1>
              <p>By Frankie Chee</p>
              <p>SENTOSA Golf Club (SGC) is investigating how its end-of-day checks 
              missed out on the buggy used by businessman Heng Jui How, after the 
              65-year-old was found dead at its grounds on Friday morning.</p>
              <p>The club's director of golf, Peter Downie, said a check is 
              done of its 220 buggies after play ends at between 6.30 and 7.15pm 
              daily, but Thursday's check somehow did not show a buggy was unreturned 
              after a corporate tournament at its Serapong course.</p>
              <p>Mr Heng's family members had reported him missing when he 
              had not returned home the morning after the tournament. His body was 
              later found floating in a 4m-deep pond near the 18th hole of the course 
              by a worker, with the buggy submerged in the 2,000-sq metre pond.</p>
              <p>Mr Downie also shared that two marshallers - each clearing 
              one half of the 150-acre course - will sweep the area to ensure noone is
               left behind after play.</p>
              <p>In addition to that, workers will be on the course to do 
              maintenance work when all the players have left.</p>
              <p>'We did the clearance of the golf course, and the 
              maintenance work after that, and nothing was amiss,' Downie shared. 'Not
               only did they not see anything, the other players in his flight and 
              those in the other groups also did not see anything.'</p>

              <div class="kicker">GOLFER FOUND DEAD IN SENTOSA</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Partners thought he'd left</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Hoe Pei Shan</p>
              <p>THE two golfers playing in Mr Heng Jui How's flight of three had 
              assumed that the businessman had gone home.</p>
              <p>That was why they did not bother to look for the 65-year-old
               - who was found dead at Sentosa Golf Club's (SGC) Serapong course on 
              Friday morning - after they had finished their round.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that the pair, in statements 
              to the authorities, said that they had waited briefly for Mr Heng on the
               18th-hole fairway after all three had teed off minutes earlier.</p>
              <p>But he did not show up, and another flight was waiting to 
              tee off on the 18th tee. So the two, believed to be Caucasians, finished
               up their final hole, thinking that Mr Heng had left the course.</p>
              <p>Sources within the club said that the flight mates, who were
               using another buggy, and Mr Heng had become acquainted only on 
              Thursday. All three were playing in a 55-player corporate tournament.</p>
              <p>It was only hours later, early on Friday morning when Mr 
              Heng was found floating in a 2,000 sq m pond near the 18th hole, that it
               was discovered that he never left the course. A fully submerged golf 
              cart was also found in the 4m-deep water.</p>

              <h2>Did Sentosa golfer drown?</h2>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By yahoosingapore – June 5th, 2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p>The two golfers who were playing in the same flight with Mr Heng Jui 
              How – who was found dead at Sentosa Golf Club’s (SGC) Serapong course on
                Friday morning – had thought that the businessman had gone home.</p>
              <p>In their statements to the authorities, the pair had waited briefly 
              for Mr Heng on the 18th-hole fairway after they had teed off minutes 
              earlier.</p>
              <p>According to a <em>Straits Times</em> report, the flight mates, 
              believed to be Caucasians, finished their final hole after Mr Heng 
              didn’t show up, thinking he had left the course.</p>
              <p>A SGC spokesman said maintenance workers and marshals tasked with  
              ensuring no one is left behind did not encounter anything unusual as  
              they cleared the course on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Mr Peter Downie, the club’s director of golf, also said that checks 
              between 6.30pm and 7.15pm missed the fact that one of  the 220 buggies 
              had not been returned.</p>
              <p>Mr Heng’s friend told the <em>Straits Times</em> that the avid golfer
               should have been accounted for and reminded golfers of ethics on the 
              course.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Eric Song, “It’s frustrating not to know details. Surely, 
              someone should have  checked to see why he had not reported back.”</p>
              <p>“Flight mates should perhaps stay to make sure everyone completes the
                round,” he added.</p>
              <p>Police are investigating the incident.</p>
              <p><strong>Mystery surrounds golfer’s death at Sentosa Golf Club</strong></p>
              <p>Sentosa Golf Club (SGC) is investigating how the dead body of a 
              businessman ended up floating in a pond within its premises on Friday 
              morning.</p>
              <p><em>The Straits Times</em> reports that Heng Jui How, 65, had been 
              playing at a corporate tournament the day before and when he had still 
              not returned home at 530am, his family alerted the police.</p>
              <p>Mr Heng’s body was found floating in a 4-metre deep pond near the 
              18th hole of the Serapong course by a worker. The buggy was also 
              submerged in the pond.</p>
              <p>Mysteriously, the club’s end-of-day checks on Thursday evening failed
               to uncover the fact that the buggy he had been using during the 
              tournament had still not been returned.</p>
              <p>The club’s director of golf, Peter Downie, told the newspaper, “We 
              did the clearance of the golf course..and nothing was amiss. Not only 
              did they (the workers) not see anything, the other players in his flight
               and those in the other groups also did not see anything.”</p>
              <p>There has been a recent spate of deaths at Sentosa.</p>
              <p>In early May, a man was found dead at Resorts World Sentosa’s Hard 
              Rock Hotel. The man, in his 60s, who apparently committed suicide, was 
              found in his room by a staff member.</p>
              <p>And in March, a China woman’s naked body was found floating in one of
               the private swimming pools in Sentosa Cove.  Subsequent investigations 
              found that Li Hong Yan, 24, was moonlighting as a part-time karaoke 
              hostess in a number of KTV lounges in Havelock Road.</p>
