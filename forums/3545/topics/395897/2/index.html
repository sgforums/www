              <p><strong>SCDF carries out another round of inspections at Mustafa Centre</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 10 April 2010 2022 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: It's back to business as usual at Mustafa Centre after a
               prohibition order that was issued on its premises was lifted on 
              Saturday morning.
              <br> <br> But officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) conducted 
              another round of inspections on Saturday.
              <br> <br> SCDF officers arrived at Mustafa Centre at 8am. That's when the court 
              order imposed on the 24-hour shopping complex was lifted.
              <br> <br> It was ordered to stop all retail activity on level one of its main 
              building from 4pm on Thursday after the SCDF raised concerns about 
              overcrowding.
              <br> <br> And as staff got back to their routine, further inspections were carried
               out for less than half an hour.
              <br> <br> The officers declined to give comments.
              <br> <br> But with this handshake, it seemed they were satisfied with efforts to 
              address the safety issue.
              <br> <br> Shamim Ahmad, manager, Building Maintenance &amp; Safety, Mustafa 
              Centre, said: “We have widened some of these spaces and we have shown 
              them and we have tendered some actions plans to them and they are very 
              satisfied and we look forward to work with them. 
              <br> <br> “I have employed some extra people to control the overcrowding. I hope 
              this will work.”
              <br> <br> The management of Mustafa Centre was not able to disclose or give a 
              rough estimate of the losses suffered during the 40-hour closure of its 
              first floor. 
              <br> <br> But it said it will continue to step up on crowd control measures to 
              ensure a better shopping experience for customers. 
              <br> <br> But are customers themselves, seeing any difference now?
              <br> <br> One customer said: “Now I find it more spacious to walk the passageway 
              and we feel more safe.”
              <br> <br> The shopping centre will still make use of this monitoring system to 
              keep track of the number of people in the premises.
              <br> <br> Staff will also do a manual head count every 15 minutes during peak 
              periods.
              <br> <br> The management said shoppers may be denied entry once there are about 
              380 people on the first floor.
              <br> <br> There are also plans to make better use of a bigger shop space in the 
              future.
              <br> <br> Norrdin Mustaffa, business development manager, Mustafa Centre, said: 
              “We are going to remove certain departments to extend our merchandise to
               a new outlet.”
              <br> <br> The new extension is expected to be completed in August.
              <br> <br> In the meantime, SCDF will continue to monitor the situation at the 
              premises.  - CNA/vm </span></p>
