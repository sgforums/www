              <p>By 
              																				Low Yi Qian, Multimedia Journalist</p>
              <p>MARK and Audrey are getting married within the next few months and have yet to get their parents' blessings.</p>
              <p>Both Mark and Audrey's parents disapprove of the marriage 
              due to the 24-year age gap between the two. Mark is 23 years old, while 
              Audrey is 47.</p>
              <p>Their parents not only object violently to the relationship, they have also said they will not attend the wedding.</p>
              <p>In despair, the couple started a Facebook page to share 
              their love story as well as to garner support from the community at 
              large. Their story has garnered over 18,000 views online so far, and 
              more than 250 comments on citizen journalism website STOMP.</p>
              <p>We discuss this modern way of generating support for a cause, albeit a personal one, on this week's Ground Zero.</p>

              <p><br>I agree with your rationale. It's just being able to see what's ahead. Some people can't do that, they have short term thinking. That's why for example parents asks the kids to keep their money instead of spending them away on useless trinklets because the parents have better experience in handling money but the kids insists on short term thinking.</p>
              <p>It might be true love now, as what all married couples wanted, but where is the love when couples divorce?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I give my blessings to the couple but I seriously think the problem is going to come when the girl turns 60 granny and the guy is at 40s, most likely will go find prostitues to have sex than doing it with the 60 years old wife.</p>

              <p>1st rule of marketing:</p>
              <p>Never, ever do anything to make your customers p*ssed off or distrust whatever you say. '<em>Bad publicity is still publicity</em>' does not work when you damage your own brand equity.</p>
              <p>SingPost and Philips learnt that the hard way. Though it's hard to see why, when any bloody idiot who has ever taken a marketing module in university would know this.</p>
              <p>I guess whichever insurance company that led this idiotic campaign finally woke up their bloody ideas and doesn't want to claim ownership for fear of pwning themselves.</p>

              <p>Oh yeah..... now it gets better.</p>

              <p>The unusual love story of 23-year-old "Mark" and his 47-year-old fiancee, "Audrey", had captured the attention of the public and media here and across the causeway.</p>
              <p>Encouraging notes left on their Facebook page - where they declared their love and intention to marry - took an angry turn, when it was revealed that their 'forbidden love story', was actually a hoax.</p>
              <p>In a Facebook update last week, netizens were informed that the elaborate story was in fact, a viral marketing campaign for an insurance company.</p>
              <p>And at least one of the actors is now facing tremendous backlash from the public.</p>
              <p>In an interview with Wanbao, Audrey", who declined to give her real 
              name, says she is now afraid of leaving her house, for fear of being 
              recognised.</p>
              <p>Since the latest Facebook update, she said she has received unkind 
              comments and threats from anonymous netizens, one of whom threatened: 
              "don't let me find out where you live".</p>
              <p>"Audrey" says she now worries for her safety and the safety of her children.</p>
              <p>She is also uncertain if she can find work to support her family, after this debacle.</p>
              <p>In the interview, "Audrey" said she has been working as a freelance actress, and took up the assignment just like any other job.</p>
              <p>She signed a contract, which forbid her to reveal which company hired her, and the amount she was paid for the campaign.</p>
              <p>Asked if she regrets taking the job in the face of such backlash, 
              "Audrey" gave a resounding "Yes!", but adds that she cannot control what
               others will say of her.</p>
              <p>She said she hopes people will realise that it is just a job, and she did not intend to lie to them.</p>
              <p><strong>Which company is responsible?</strong></p>
              <p>To date, no company nor PR agency has claimed responsibiliy for creating this viral campaign.</p>
              <p>According to Wanbao, angry netizens say the company may fear reprisal after the public outcry.</p>
              <p>Some say the company has lost the public's trust, and they may 
              believe that the policies they buy from the company, could be fake, too.</p>
              <p>*******************************************************************</p>
              <p>Seriously, the insurance company and PR company in charge of this should do the right thing and just come forward.</p>
