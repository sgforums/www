              Wan</strong><br> <span class="update">By Lin Jiamei | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 30 March 2010 1517 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Keep politics out of healthcare and minimise market 
              distortions so as to create a sustainable healthcare system - this was 
              the Singapore Health Minister's prescription at the Healthcare in Asia 
              conference.
              <br> <br> Governments the world over are dealing with having to keep healthcare 
              costs down, and yet providing quality care.
              <br> <br> In Singapore, Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the principle is to 
              keep to the basics. This means recognising that healthcare can never be 
              free, making sure people take charge of their own health, and keeping 
              politics out.
              <br> <br> He said: "The more politicians do not speak the truth...for example, 
              'healthcare is free, vote for me, I will give you free 
              medicine'......(By saying this), you distort the market because you do 
              not allow facts and rational thinking to surface.
              <br> <br> "I gave a few examples of how healthcare need not fail. Not that it is 
              possible to achieve a perfect market, but as a stretched target, I 
              think, we must be clear which direction we must be going.
              <br> <br> "Today all our healthcare systems are heavily distorted, Singapore 
              included. But at least if you know the direction forward, I think each 
              time whoever is in charge, you try not to bring in new distortion and 
              try to remove as much distortion as you can."
              <br> <br> Vijay Vaitheeswaran, health correspondent, The Economist said: "The 
              thing to remember about Singapore is that it has an extraordinary value 
              conscious health system with a relatively low spending per GDP and a 
              high contribution by the individual.
              <br> <br> "These things, sometimes called "Skin in the game", mean that 
              individuals actually see the effects of cost increases and they are more
               likely to make smarter choices about what healthcare they want and what
               they don't want. 
              <br> <br> "So I think relative to other countries in the region, Singapore is well
               poised to manage health inflation."
              <br> <br> Singapore's total healthcare spending is currently less than four per 
              cent of its GDP, which is a relatively low figure compared to other 
              countries. But Health Minister Khaw Boon Wan said he expects the figure 
              to continue to go up, especially with Singapore's ageing population. 
              <br> <br> He added that it would be a remarkable achievement if Singapore could 
              sustain its healthcare spending at a single digit percentage of its GDP.
