              <p>By 
              																				Cai Haoxiang</p>
              <p>THE use of Chinese dialects has dropped sharply in one generation.</p>
              <p>The share of Chinese living here who speak mainly dialect at home has fallen to fewer than one in five.</p>
              <p>Just 30 years ago, the figure was close to four in five.</p>
              <p>Over the same period, the use of Mandarin and English has shot up.</p>
              <p>Mandarin is today the language most frequently spoken at 
              home for one in two Chinese residents. That places it in top spot, 
              followed by English, which is the main language at home for one in three
               Chinese, according to just-released data from Census 2010.</p>
              <p>But while growth in the share of English-speaking households
               has accelerated in the last decade, the growth of Mandarin-speaking 
              households has slowed.</p>

              <p>You are correct. My foreign friends told me that it is easy to tell who are the Singaporeans when we are abroad as only Singaporeans speak English to each other even though we are Chinese. Taiwanese, Hong Kongers and Chinese speak their own language to their own people even though they know how to speak English.</p>
              <p>May be in their eyes, we are fake ang moh or try to be ang moh. Really no face. So remember, when we are abroad, speak mandarin or dialects to our own people so as not to lose face.</p>
              <p>Ang moh also will think that we are trying to be them. Really no face.</p>

              <p>Mandarin is whose mother tongue?</p>
              <p>If a Chinese mother speaks Hokkien, or Cantonese, or TeowChew, what is the mother tongue of the children.</p>
              <p>What if the government decrees that Cantonese should be the language of the Chinese. The Hokkien, Hainanese, Teowchew, who then can't speak Cantonese are not fit to be Chinese?</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew was asked why not Cantonese, when the government embarked on the Speak Mandarin campaign. His reply was: Yes if it will be, if Cantonese, or Hokkien is the main stream language.</p>
              <p>So Mandarin is actually a chosen language, it is the language of the elite of ancient China, imposed on the minority, whose freedom to practice their own culture is "guaranteed" by the politicians.</p>

              <p>I never agreed that Mandarin is the mother tongue of Chinese from South China descent with Southern Chinese dialects as our original languages.</p>
              <p>I don't even agree that South China people's mother tongues are those Standardized varieties of the regional language, such as a vague term like "Cantonese" which only denotes the Cantonese spoken by the people of the Kwongchau region around the Chyuekong tributary.</p>
              <p>For Cantonese people, the mother tongue would be different types of Cantonese, for there are Sze-yap Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Sze-yap Cantonese, Kwong-Si Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Kwong-Si Cantonese, Shiu-kwan Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Shiu-kwan Cantonese, Tung-kwun Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Tung-kwun Cantonese, Hongkong Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Hongkong Cantonese, and Kwongchau Cantonese people whose mother tongue will be Kwongchau Cantonese.</p>
              <p>All these Cantonese regional varieties are not mutually intelligible to one another, therefore when people of different Cantonese regional varieties get together, they chose the "Cantonese" of Kwongchau region as the lingua franca to communicate with each other, but that doesn't mean the "Cantonese" of the Kwongchau region is their "Mother Tongue" and they do not use it as a means of daily communication at home nor in their region, unless with outsiders</p>
              <p>Similarly, when different groups of Chinese in Singapore chose "Mandarin" of the Beijing region as the lingua franca to communicate with each other, it doesn't mean that "Mandarin" is / should be the "Mother Tongue" of the Chinese. It is just a tool to facilitate communication, and our "Mother Tongue" is still the different regional varieties of the different South China dialects.</p>

              <p>I always pity our fellow Singaporeans who can acknowledge Mandarin as the mother tongue of the Chinese, Malay as the mother tongue of the Malays, or Tamil as the mother tongue of the Indians.  What rubbish.  It's simply a propaganda which is brainwashed into the minds of our goonless people who simply don't have any idea of their own.</p>

              <p><br> Well said.</p>
              <p>I frequently met with angmohs asking me why the local Chinese
              here so ang moh pai.   <br> <br> Even some ang moh care to respect the Chinese language,
              culture more than the Chinese. </p>

              <p>In old days, pasar Malay is the lingua franca but with time things change to English. Nothing ang moh about it.</p>
              <p>If one has to kowtow to mandarin becos some ang mohs care that would be very sad.That is a mentality of looking like Chinese but ang moh inside.</p>
              <p>I rather speak my dialect and be ignored by the world.</p>
