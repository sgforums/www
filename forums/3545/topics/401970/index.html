              <p><strong>He's a doctor but he keeps yelling at mum with baby seeking medical attention</strong></p>
              <p>STOMPer <strong>Irene</strong> came across this video in which a man, apparently a doctor, was shouting at a woman carrying a baby. The woman had barged into the treatment room while other patients were being attended to.<br><br>The woman seemed to have misunderstood instructions from the counter personnel and thought that the clinic was refusing her treatment.<br><br>In the video, the woman said in Mandarin that she thought the doctor was being very uncompassionate. She went on to admit her mistake.<br><br>The STOMPer commented:<br><br>"I'm totally disgusted by how the man behaved.<br><br>"It's unprofessional and unethical.<br><br>"He should have been a little more compassionate in the handling of this situation.<br><br>"It's none of her business that he hasn't had his dinner yet.<br><br>"I won't ever to go that clinic again if I were the one who witnessed this incident."<br><br>The STOMPer also highlighted this video to the authorities, but was disappointed that she received a bureaucratic reply asking her to do make a Statutory Declaration before the authorities would take any action:<br><br>"It's sad that the authorities manage feedback channels in this manner.<br><br>"It is not of my interest if action is taken against this clinic staff member.<br><br>"Bureaucracy and red tape are the last things I wish to be involved in."</p>

              <p>relief doctors are called Locum doctors. they are freelancers. their job is basically to fill in for the resident doctor at the clinic. they are paid an hourly rate from 50-70.</p>
              <p>This locum doctor should be complained to SMC, whose disciplinary committee will look into this matter. punishment can be meted out in the following: a fine, suspension of licence (from a few months to even for 1-2 years), censure etc.</p>

              <p>the video never show what was before the shouting....not quite fair to the locum...the grandmother could have just barged into the consultation room(with patient) and demanded treatment..</p>
              <p>I had my share of bad/disappointing service...I just take my business elsewhere...simple...now with the SMA guidelines removed...its basically a patient's market.</p>

              <p>I , too, had very bad experience with doctor.    A very cocky, unprofessional locum doctor.  Wish I have the name to provide here.  He has Thai name, looks a Chinese.    He was bragging and made things difficult.    i was furious and asked for his MCR No, he was still cocky and without hesitation gave me his MCR No and tell me go report him to Singapore Medical Association.   </p>

              <p>I totally agree with you.    Clinic will not sack him.  Doctors are protective over their own kind.   In Singapore, not often to come across nice, professional doctors.    I have witness their behaviour enough to say this besides my personal unpleasant encounters with them.</p>
