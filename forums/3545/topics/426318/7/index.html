              <p>I'm willing to believe that 'counselled' is exactly what it means. You know, political correctness....</p>
              <p>I get pretty pissed when someone does something wrong and all he gets is 'counselling'. The last time DBS screwed me over because several staff screwed up, I went berserk when the manager told me that the offending staff would be 'counselled'.</p>
              <p>Like I told the manager, 'counselling' is what you get when your pet dog dies or when your girlfriend runs off with your best friend. In the end, he agreed with me and promised that he would issue them with reprimand letters that would count against their bonuses and promotions.</p>
              <p>For something of this incident's magnitude, a few extras given by a berserk platoon sergeant should be the order of the day.</p>

              <p><strong>Maid for Our Army: Manhunt now on for individuals in the SAF Maid story</strong></p>

              Where
               did they go?: This is the footpath off Bedok Rise used by the Singapore
               Armed Forces (SAF) soldier, believed to be a full-time National 
              Serviceman (NSF), and a woman carrying a fullpack, believed to be his 
              domestic helper, who appeared in that iconic image (please scroll down).
               To the right of this footpath is the public housing estate which is 
              home to an NSF who made headlines in 2007, Dave Teo.<br> <br>
              <div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F16H1cfRG8I/TZkfY1MN-kI/AAAAAAAAAuo/k7BJns4yMdo/s1600/STOMP+27+Mar+2011.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-F16H1cfRG8I/TZkfY1MN-kI/AAAAAAAAAuo/k7BJns4yMdo/s400/STOMP+27+Mar+2011.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></div>
              <br> Plain clothes officers believed to be from the Singapore Armed Forces 
              (SAF) combed a housing estate in Bedok on Saturday (2 April'11) for the 
              individuals in the infamous picture of a maid carrying a fullpack - but 
              failed to find their targets.<br> <br> The officers gathered along Bedok Rise, which is near the Tanah Merah 
              MRT station, for a quick debrief yesterday evening and were observed by 
              this blogger. The group stood out in the quiet estate because I have 
              seen police surveillance teams in action and somehow sensed the group 
              did not fit in with the streetscape.<br> <br> One officer was overheard updating an unnamed party via mobilephone that
               there were x targets for the day and the maid at one premises was not 
              in.<br> <br> What gave the game away was an A4 size colour photocopy of two pictures 
              in a local newspaper story that compared the real picture with a fake 
              image of the anonymous soldier, believed to be a full-time National 
              Serviceman (NSF), and a woman whom netizens believe is his domestic 
              helper. Pictures in the 90C story were enlarged and printed in portrait 
              format, possibly to serve as a handy reference for the officers. (By 
              uncanny coincidence, I used the same picture as reference but saved an 
              image of the newspaper article on my mobilephone. I felt it was more 
              discrete as observers would think I was checking my SMS messages 
              whenever I looked at the image on the phone.)<br> <br> It was surreal being at the spot where the infamous images were taken 
              and the sense of frustration stemmed from not knowing where the soldier 
              was. A sense of being almost within reach, yet not quite there. That 
              said, I thank friends of this blog for all the tipoffs. :-)<br> <br> The pictures caused intense debate in Singapore this past week as they 
              showed how one soldier can sully the SAF's image by displaying behaviour
               which Singaporeans viewed as unsoldierly.<br> <br> As of late Saturday evening, Senang Diri believes the Singaporean 
              Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and SAF investigators had yet to verify the
               identities of the two individuals in the picture. The numberplates of 
              the private cars used by the suspected stakeout teams were noted by this
               blogger.<br> <br> It is interesting to note that the location of the stakeout is literally
               round the corner from the home of another infamous NSF, Dave Teo, who 
              ran away from camp with his SAR-21 assault rifle and some bullets in 
              2007. The Bedok South point block flat which he shared with his 
              grandmother and cousins can be seen from the footpath along which 
              MINDEF/SAF's latest bugbear was photographed. Dave Teo was tracked down 
              and arrested by police officers from the crack Special Tactics and 
              Rescue (STAR) unit. <br> <br> Manhunts in densely-populated Singapore are difficult to execute.<br> <br> In March 2004, hundreds of SAF soldiers and Singapore Police Force 
              officers were deployed to Pulau Tekong (Singapore's largest offshore 
              island) to hunt down three suspected robbers who landed on the island 
              from Malaysia's Johor state. The fugitives were eventually found by 
              Gurkha police officers.<br> <br> In February 2008, terror suspect Mas Selamat Kastari walked out of a 
              high security detention centre. He was apprehended by Malaysian police 
              in Johor in April the following year.</div>

              <h1>Remorseful soldier counselled: Mindef</h1>
              <p>THE Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has completed its investigation
              into the recent case of a serviceman who was photographed with his
              domestic helper carrying his field pack ('Deafening silence in army
              backpack saga' by Mr Patrick Tan; last Saturday).</p>
              <p>The serviceman concerned has identified himself to his
              commander.</p>
              <p>He was a recruit undergoing the Physical Training Preparatory
              phase prior to the Basic Military Training phase.</p>
              <p>The recruit is remorseful for his actions and realises that it
              was wrong for him to have allowed this.</p>
              <p>He has been counselled and continues his training. The SAF has
              reminded all servicemen to be mindful of their conduct in
              public.</p>
