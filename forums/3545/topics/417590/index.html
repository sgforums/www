              <p id="articlecontent"><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Retailers are ringing in a happier Christmas this 
                  season, with some projecting year-end sales to grow by up to 30 percent 
                  compared to the previous year.<br><br>From branded footwear, high-end 
                  coffee makers, serums that proclaim the promise of youth and even 
                  body-shape wear for men, shoppers are spending hundreds and even 
                  thousands of dollars on year-end gifts.<br><br>On the back of a stronger
                   economy and bigger bonuses this year, retailers said shoppers are more 
                  willing to splurge on big ticket items for themselves, family and 
                  friends.<br><br>In fact, the expectation is for year-end sales to hit 
                  pre-crisis levels.<br><br>Gerry Rezel, vice-president for group 
                  marketing &amp; communications at Tangs, said: "Everyone's saying, 'I've
                   worked very hard and so it's time to enjoy and spend a little bit more 
                  on the family and ourselves'. And we've seen it in the buying patterns 
                  for home products and the types of gifts."<br><br>"I have almost 
                  everything...I don't mind anything new to replace in the kitchen!" said a
                   shopper.<br><br>"I don't care about the price as long as I think it 
                  suits them and, yea, I just spend!" said another.<br><br>Ong Ying Hui, 
                  retail associate at Swarovski, said: "Some actually are buying for their
                   boss, they will choose (gifts) like necklace from our classic range and
                   some are even willing to top up more to get a free gift!"<br><br>And of
                   course there are the uber-cool gadgets that almost everyone is eyeing.<br><br>"Oooh!
                   I wanted to buy a new laptop for myself," said a woman shopper.<br><br>Sebastian
                   Chua, assistant retail store manager at epiCentre, said: "My bestseller
                   would be a new MacBook Air, of course, followed by the iPad as an 
                  educational tool as well. For Christmas, more are getting the iPod as 
                  well, Nano, Touch, Shuffle."<br><br>He said the average spending power 
                  for customers at the epiCentre shop is about S$1,500 to S$2,000.<br><br>The
                   tills are ringing - also because of the surge in tourist numbers.<br><br>Singapore
                   expects visitor arrivals to hit a record of around 12 million this 
                  year, helped by the success of the country's two integrated resorts.<br><br>"Going
                   to Singapore is a reward in itself," said a woman from the Philippines 
                  who is visiting Singapore with her family.<br><br>"Spending time, eating
                   out and shopping for the family is already a splurge for us!" said the 
                  husband.<br><br>Moving forward, retailers are bracing for slower growth 
                  next year as the economy moderates. Still, Asia Malls - which manages 
                  six malls in Singapore - expects strong sales to continue, at least in 
                  the first quarter of 2011.<br><br>"Based on past trends of shopper 
                  buying behaviour, we see this trend likely to remain strong till after 
                  Chinese New Year", said its general manager Stephanie Ho.<br><br>-
