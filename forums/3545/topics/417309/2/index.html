              <p> FEMALE lawyer has revealed how she offered herself as a "bait" to lure a Singapore man who posts self-made videos of his sexual encounters on the Internet.</p>
              <p>In a report in Lianhe Wanbao, she reportedly provided the police with leads that led to the arrest of Gary Ng, whose real name is Chen Guilin.</p>
              <p>Chen, 28, is dubbed "Singapore's Edison Chen" for his notorious exploits of uploading explicit home-made sex videos onto his blog and online forums.</p>
              <p>The woman who helped authorities in nabbing Chen is lawyer Ms Yang Bao Zhu.</p>
              <p>When approached by Lianhe Wanbao, Ms Yang revealed that numerous women, who were also victims, supported her decision to assist the police in nabbing Chen.</p>
              <p>She told the Chinese evening daily that the other women had their money cheated by Chen, who has since been slapped with 21 charges.</p>
              <p>He also faces four counts of housebreaking, five counts of forgery, six counts of possessing someone else's identity card and two counts of criminal breach of trust.</p>
              <p>Ms Yang revealed that during July, she used leads from female victims and managed to contact Chen through the Internet.</p>
              <p>She then lured him to her place two days after, where he was arrested on the spot.</p>
              <p>Ms Yang said that in order for her to gain his trust, she had to chat with him on MSN and even gave him her mobile number.</p>
              <p>"When I told him on MSN that I'm a lawyer, he became very interested and kept trying to ask me to meet him at a hotel," said Ms Yang. "It seems like his motive was only for sex. On the first day of knowing him, he said he wanted to drive me to his rented flat for a threesome session with another guy," she said.</p>
              <p>"However, while chatting, I heard his mum calling out to him for dinner.</p>
              <p>"He knew that I would know he was lying and cancelled our appointment," said Ms Yang.</p>
              <p>The next day, Chen invited her to a hotel.</p>
              <p>Knowing that he will find it too expensive, she chose a five star hotel on purpose and offered to pay.</p>
              <p>Ms Yang informed the police right away. They had planned to ambush Chen at the hotel but the plan fell through, as the police were concerned over her safety.</p>
              <p>Based on the<span id="adv_hiliteText" style="border-bottom: #0066cc 1px dashed; cursor: pointer;"> information </span>she had given to the police, they arrested Chen at his home in Yishun that night.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="advholder" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">
              </span></p><p>Ms Yang revealed to Lianhe Wanbao how Chen cheated money from his female victims.</p>
              <p>According to Ms Yang, a victim told her that Chen would always drive her around in a new Japanese car to buy alcohol before heading to a hotel.</p>
              <p>After having sex, he would then propose to start a relationship with the woman.</p>
              <p>This is when he will use certain tactics to cheat them of their money:</p>
              <p>First, he will tell them that he owes money to loan sharks and needed cash urgently. Another lie he used to cheat money was to tell the women that he lost a lot of money from the stock market.</p>
              <p>Another tactic of his was to request for his victim to purchase a new iPhone for him, in which he will then resell it at a dealer shop for money.</p>
              <p>His last method involves using a fake branded watch as a guarantee for the cash he loaned from the victim.</p>
              <p>Ms Yang revealed that Chen had managed to cheat his victims of $40,000 in total.</p>
              <p>Among Chen's charges, unlawfully possessing someone else's identity card and housebreaking carry the heaviest punishment.</p>
              <p>If convicted, he can be fined and jailed 10 years on each charge.</p>
