              <p>He was dubbed Singapore’s Edison Chen after he posted self-made 
              videos of his sexual encounters with several women on the Internet.</p>
              <p>The man called himself Gary Ng and shared up to 33 sex videos online 
              since September 2008.</p>
              <p>But as it turned out, it was a fictitious name.</p>
              <p>His real name is Chen Guilin.</p>
              <p>And now, Chen, 28, who is unemployed, is in trouble with the law.</p>
              <p>He has been slapped with 21 charges, including one charge of 
              possessing 1,100 obscene pictures and 437 video clips containing 
              pornographic material on a laptop and two portable hard drives.</p>
              <p>He was first charged in June and turned up in court to face more 
              charges.</p>
              <p>In all, Chen faces four counts of housebreaking, five counts of 
              forgery, six counts of possessing someone else’s identity card and two 
              counts of criminal breach of trust.</p>
              <p>He also faces one charge each of cheating, misappropriation and 
              possessing a fraudulently obtained or stolen laptop.</p>
              <p>Chen allegedly broke into the home of one of his victims between Aug 
              31 and Sept 5, 2008, and stole items totalling more than $36,000.</p>
              <p>One of the items he allegedly stole was the victim’s OCBC bank cheque
               book.</p>
              <p>Over six days in September that year, he is said to have forged the 
              victim’s signature on the stolen cheques and induced the bank to give 
              him a total of $81,150.</p>
              <p><strong>Forged signature</strong></p>
              <p>He is also accused of breaking into the home of another victim twice 
              and later forging the victim’s signature on a stolen HSBC cheque to 
              obtain $10,000.</p>
              <p>Chen, who is out on bail, is understood to have been arrested after 
              several victims made police reports.</p>
              <p>The New Paper reported last year that someone calling himself “Gary 
              Ng” gained online notoriety after he posted his self-filmed sex videos 
              on various amateur porn sites and sex forums.</p>
              <p>Most of the videos began with him in office wear before he undressed.</p>
              <p>He was careful to protect the identities of his partners by editing 
              away the faces of the girls and himself, but he gave the videos titles 
              based on the the women in them.</p>
              <p>There were videos titled “Gary Ng vs Beer Promo Auntie”, “Gary Ng vs 
              Friend’s Niece” and “Gary Ng vs Chua Chu Kang girl”.</p>
              <p>He claimed that he filmed his escapades, which took place at home or 
              in hotels, and put them online in order to get back at women.</p>
              <p>He said that he became disillusioned after three consecutive failed 
              relationships.</p>
              <p>Among his charges, unlawfully possessing someone else’s identity card
               and housebreaking carry the heaviest punishment.</p>
              <p>If convicted, he can be fined and jailed 10 years on each charge.</p>

              <p>There was an interview once with him.</p>
              <p>The media, at that time RazorTV, went to meet him and interview him.</p>
              <p>At that time his face was blurred, but we can see that he is an average person with average built, average fashion, and average speech and mannerism.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, compared to the male reporter / interviewer who was interviewing him, the male reporter is more handsome than him (coincidentally this is a young and handsome reporter)</p>
              <p>Even after that, in the post-interview segment, this reporter also said the same. He said his impression is that the guy is very average.</p>

              clips</h1>

              <h4 class="piccaption">Chen Guilin in a screen capture taken off an 
              interview he did with The Straits Times Razor TV in 2009. Previously 
              known by his fictitious name 'Gary Ng', he was dubbed Singapore's Edison
               Chen after he posted self-made videos of his sexual encounters with 
              several women on the Internet. -- PHOTO: ST RAZOR TV</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WHILE he was engaged in sex with different women, the intimate moments
               were filmed with a video camera hidden in a plastic bag with a slit.</p>
              <p>Some women were willing parties for the filming, but others 
              were filmed without their consent.</p>
              <p>Chen Guilin, alias Gary Ng, then posted some of the video 
              clips on the Internet with the women's faces masked.</p>
              <p>The 28-year-old on Tuesday pleaded guilty to possessing 507 
              obscene films, of which more than 480 were clips of him having sex with 
              various women.</p>
              <p>The items were seized by police from his flat at Yishun 
              Street 22 in June last year. The police also found another person's 
              identity card in his flat.</p>
              <p>The former property agent on Tuesday also admitted to seven 
              other offences, including breaking into the home of his client while she
               was away, forgery and criminal breach of trust.</p>
