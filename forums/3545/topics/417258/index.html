              <h3 class="date_story">Dec 8, 2010 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>I REFER to the interesting article on Turf City ('Last Lap for Turf 
              City'; Nov 19). While shops and restaurants are plentiful in Singapore, 
              open land available for sporting use is in very scarce supply. This is 
              forcing many sports clubs - both adult and junior - to pay substantially
               increased fees to hire facilities.</p>
              <p>The importance of Turf City for the future development of 
              sport in Singapore and for those who wish to play sport at all levels 
              cannot be overstated.</p>
              <p>Currently, Tanglin Rugby Club, Anza, Centaurs, Baseball Club
               Singapore and International Soccer Academy, all lease space at Turf 
              City. Thousands of children use the facilities each week. Schools and 
              adult football and cricket teams are also regular users of the site by 
              hiring from the above tenants.</p>
              <p>In a letter to The Straits Times in April this year, the 
              Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Singapore Sports Council (SSC) 
              said the two organisations were working closely to ensure sufficient 
              land for sports uses ('Sufficient land set aside for sports uses'; April
               3). It will surprise few in the sporting community to learn that, as 
              yet, no alternative venues have been identified, though discussions 
              continue with both the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and SSC.</p>
              <p>Open space for sport in Singapore is at a premium and should
               Turf City be lost as a venue, this will have a devastating impact on 
              sport in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The facilities at Turf City are, no doubt, in need of 
              redevelopment and it is easy to envision a much improved sporting hub 
              for the enjoyment of both current and future generations on the site.</p>
              <p>Let us not confuse this idea with the sporting hub that is 
              being developed at Kallang, which will cater to elite sportsmen and 
              sportswomen. Turf City could easily become a hub for participation 
              sport, with indoor facilities replacing the largely unused grandstand 
              and more pitches gained by filling in the centre of Turf City.</p>
              <p>For this to happen though, there needs to be a long-term 
              plan. Short-term leases do not provide sufficient certainty to attract 
              much required investment and the current structure allows middlemen to 
              profit at the expense of both the SLA and the sporting community.</p>
              <p>Redevelopment of Turf City for participation sport would be 
              welcomed by the sporting community and add to Singapore's attraction as a
               place for families to settle. I hope the authorities will allay 
              concerns over the venue's future by providing clarity on their intent.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Govt agencies studying use of former Turf Club for sports</h1>
              <p>WE REFER to Tanglin Rugby Club president Phillip Taylor's letter last 
              Wednesday ('Make Turf City a sport hub').</p>
              <p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority works closely with various
               government agencies to ensure sufficient land is set aside for various 
              economic, social and recreational uses. However, given our scarce land 
              resources, we need to strike a balance in meeting many different land 
              use needs.</p>
              <p>An example is the Singapore Sports Council's collaboration 
              with the Ministry of Education since 2003 known as the Dual Use Scheme. 
              Under it, school sports facilities are made available for public use 
              over the weekends. These include 130 school fields and 30 indoor sports 
              halls. Bookings for these facilities may be made at www.icanbook.com.sg</p>
              <p>The Singapore Sports Hub, which will be completed in April 
              2014, will be a fully integrated sports, leisure, entertainment and 
              lifestyle hub for world-class events and community activities. All 
              facilities will be accessible to the public and top athletes to train 
              and compete in.</p>
              <p>In addition to the major sports infrastructure such as the 
              55,000-seat retractable-roof stadium, 6,000-seat aquatics venue and 
              water leisure centre, there are also a whole host of community sports 
              facilities throughout the Sports Hub, including a beach volleyball 
              court, rock climbing wall, hard courts, a skate park, an area for lawn 
              bowling, and a 1km jogging track located on the perimeter of the 
              National Stadium.</p>
              <p>We also put land that is not immediately needed for 
              development to good use in the interim, for example, as parks or areas 
              for community use and sports.</p>
              <p>The former Turf Club site is one example. As the timeframe 
              to develop the site for residential use has not been firmed up at this 
              point in time, the Singapore Land Authority has leased out the site, 
              which today caters to various interim uses such as sports and 
              recreation, food and beverage, and retail.</p>
              <p>We agree with Mr Taylor that the fields in the former Turf 
              Club could be set aside for sports use in the interim and we will 
              explore this with other relevant agencies.</p>
