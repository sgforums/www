              <div class="kicker">FOREIGN WORKERS &amp; PRODUCTIVITY</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Upshot of higher levies</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the Economic Strategies Committee's recommendations in last 
              Saturday's Insight report, 'Balancing social discontent and the bottom 
              line'. The effectiveness of increasing foreign worker levies - as a 
              measure to contain reliance on foreign workers in the long run and 
              increase productivity - is questionable.</p>
              <p>Businesses will find ways to pass the cost of the levy 
              increase to foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Although there are laws against employers and employment 
              agencies receiving kickbacks from foreign workers, the difficulty of 
              overseeing the recruitment of foreign workers makes the practice 
              prevalent today.</p>
              <p>The 'fee' imposed on foreign workers for securing jobs in 
              Singapore has been increasing over the years. This fee not only goes 
              into the pockets of unscrupulous recruiters in the countries of origin 
              of the foreign workers, but is also offered to employers as incentives 
              to employ workers.</p>
              <p>As there is often no paper trail for such transactions, 
              punishing offenders remains difficult.</p>
              <p>Foreign workers who renew their contracts in Singapore are 
              also charged exorbitant fees by either employment agencies or their 
              employers. These are deducted from workers' salaries and disguised as 
              authorised deductions for food, accommodation and other advances allowed
               under the Employment Act. These deductions subsidise the business costs
               incurred in hiring foreign workers such as the foreign worker levy and 
              purchase of medical insurance.</p>
              <p>Although the Ministry of Manpower has set up recourse 
              channels for such violations, foreign workers face immense challenges in
               seeking redress against errant employers and agents.</p>
              <p>As prosecution witnesses for offences committed by employers
               and agents, foreign workers are stuck in Singapore for a protracted 
              period of time with limited access to work. During this period, such 
              workers face difficulties in meeting basic needs such as housing, food 
              and health services.</p>
              <p>Employers are also given the unilateral right to terminate a
               worker's work permit and repatriate him. This power allows employers to
               threaten workers who attempt to seek recourse to these problems.</p>
              <p>Businesses who are given access to easily exploited workers 
              find little motivation to innovate and improve working conditions, 
              causing jobs in these sectors to remain unattractive to citizen workers.</p>
              <p>While there are no easy answers to the problems highlighted,
               it is important to acknowledge the dampening effects of such 
              exploitation on the pursuit of productivity-driven growth.</p>
