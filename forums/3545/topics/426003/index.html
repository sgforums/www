              <h3 class="date_story">Mar 24, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>ON TUESDAY, I ordered a glass of iced tea without milk at the New Hawa
               coffee shop in Selegie Road. When the waitress delivered the drink, she
               shocked me with the bill: $2.</p>
              <p>As I paid up, I questioned the amount, which she agreed was 
              pricey. I checked the price with another helper and she too replied that
               I was charged the correct amount. And how much was a canned soft drink?
               "$1.50," she replied.</p>
              <p>Already displeased, I turned furious when I tasted the 
              drink, which was sugar dissolved in water. When I complained to the 
              waitress that the price was unusually high, and worse, the drink tasted 
              like anything but tea, she summoned the boss.</p>
              <p>A man who looked to be in his mid-40s turned up and I 
              related to him what had transpired. He was not bothered about the 
              pricing but said he would add more tea in my drink. When he returned 
              with the drink, I asked him why his drink prices were so high, and he 
              said all prices were going up.</p>
              <p>Why is a coffee shop charging $2 for a drink that should 
              cost at most $1.20? I hope the relevant authorities will look into this 
              matter.</p>

              <h3>Mar 24, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>ON TUESDAY, I ordered a glass of iced tea without milk at the New Hawa coffee shop in Selegie Road. When the waitress delivered the drink, she shocked me with the bill: $2.</p>
              <p>As I paid up, I questioned the amount, which she agreed was pricey. I checked the price with another helper and she too replied that I was charged the correct amount. And how much was a canned soft drink? "$1.50," she replied.</p>
              <p>Already displeased, I turned furious when I tasted the drink, which was sugar dissolved in water. When I complained to the waitress that the price was unusually high, and worse, the drink tasted like anything but tea, she summoned the boss.</p>
              <p>A man who looked to be in his mid-40s turned up and I related to him what had transpired. He was not bothered about the pricing but said he would add more tea in my drink. When he returned with the drink, I asked him why his drink prices were so high, and he said all prices were going up.</p>
              <p>Why is a coffee shop charging $2 for a drink that should cost at most $1.20? I hope the relevant authorities will look into this matter.</p>

              <p>kopitiam at tampines mart re-opened for business today.</p>
              <p>the food on offer ranges from $3.30 to 7.  i dont see the a need for a foodcourt in this neighbourhood or any hdb neighbourhood.  there is only one other coffeeshop in this area.  just next to the foodcourt.  and its operated by kopitiam too.</p>
              <p>the govt should stop building such foodcourts.  foodcourts should stay in the city or at centrals.  why in neighbourhoods?</p>
              <p>all these only result in higher daily living expenditure.  and i'm sick of such policies.</p>
