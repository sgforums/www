              <h1 class="storyheadline">Is 'intellectual snobs' label fair?</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Saturday's commentary, 'Scoring high in grades but not 
              in values'. While it rightly pointed out that values such as empathy and
               humility need to be taught to students, it singled out those from elite
               schools as needing this most.</p>
              <p>Meritocracy has provided opportunities for many deserving 
              students, regardless of their background, to come together to pursue 
              their goals in these elite schools. Is it fair to say that all these 
              students lose perspective and label them as intellectual snobs just 
              because they are highly geared to take on challenges? I am certain there
               are other admirable traits of creativity, confidence and perseverance 
              among these young, well-adjusted individuals.</p>
              <p>The issue raised involves students in general, from elite 
              schools or otherwise. Society has evolved and students today simply take
               things for granted. Their expectations are high, be it acquiring 
              branded goods, the latest gadgets, or demanding vacations at exotic 
              destinations. Many choose to be ignorant or are genuinely unaware of the
               concept of earning a living. Having parents who indulge them 
              exacerbates the problem. In addition, they are exposed to media, both 
              old and new, where they are encouraged to adopt a global outlook and to 
              be competitive, and are introduced to images of the ideal person, 
              foreign talent or otherwise.</p>
              <p>I appreciate the fact that most schools have community 
              involvement programmes which take students out of their comfort zone to 
              touch base with reality. However, a lot more can, and should, be done by
               schools.</p>
              <p>Most of these students are at an age when they are greatly 
              influenced by their peers. It is a known fact that students spend most 
              of their waking hours with their peers in school or on school-related 
              activities outside school. The teachable moments available to parents 
              have been considerably reduced.</p>
              <p>Thus schools can and should take a more proactive approach 
              in helping parents shape and mould these young minds to embrace the 
              right values. This change of mindset needs to be nurtured, and led by 
              example, to effect a positive response.</p>
              <p>Lastly, these students should not be expected to apologise 
              for wanting to excel and there is no need to drop 'proper English' just 
              to fit in. They have a long way to go, and learning is a lifelong 
              journey.</p>

              <p>Intellectual snobbery is an entirely separate dimension from creativity, competitiveness, confidence and any other apologistic rubbish that this woman flings about like so many red herrings.Â  To put it simply, just because a person is creative, competitive and confident, does it mean that he or she is not an intellectual snob?</p>
              <p>Being well aware of the irony here, I don't see any point to this woman's inane rambling.</p>
