              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNormal">Ad phrase for Singapore 
              states “Surprising 
              Singapore”  and yes Singapore will
              provide you with surprises but perhaps unpleasant surprise of racism may be
              last thing you had in mind.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I am an Indian and I am writing here to express my concerns
              regarding the racist experiences I felt from Chinese Singaporeans during my
              Singapore Trip recently. The Chinese Singaporeans are never willing to assist
              an Indian asking for directions and you are made to feel as not welcome. I am
              sure they will react differently to other travellers. I experienced a rudely
              reacting Bus driver when I mentioned I do not have the exact change and
              thankfully an Indian passenger came to rescue. 
              If the driver could have said it in a proper manner it would not had
              mattered at all.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Chinese Singaporean seems rude and always ready for a fight
              at a drop of a hat. This instance happened when I took a bus from Singapore to
              Genting highlands in Malaysia (Bus was of Sri Maju transport departing from
              Golden Mile Complex, Singapore). Bus after entering Malaysia halted for a while
              at a point for refreshments and I also got down. When I came back I saw the bus
              standing but the passenger entry door was closed and with the driver or
              attendant nowhere to be seen.  Not just
              me but other passengers who got down was not able to get in. We waited for
              about 20 min in scorching cold after which the Chinese driver came at his
              leisurely pace. I was the first one to complain since I had waited longer even
              though there were other passengers who were stranded.  The driver who saw an Indian complaining
              started abusing me in his local lingo (of course he did not know a bit of
              english) and somehow using his sign language mentioned that it is you who are
              at fault of not opening the door.  All
              the passengers tried open the door but was not successful. Then driver got to
              know that the driver had mistakenly locked the door and finally he had to
              unlock it from inside. Even after being his fault, the driver started abusing
              me for no reason and when I reacted he was ready for a fight!!!  I had to back off from that instance and
              ignored him and got into my seat.  I am
              sure what provoked him was that an Indian complained against him and not the
              complaint or the fault with himself.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The indifference does not stop here, in malls or in reception
              of hotels or at other places, I had experienced differential treatment
              especially to Indians in Singapore. When I ask for food in restaurants, they
              are not willing even answer some genuine questions.  All the racism in a country that publicizes
              itself as a multi racist- multi religious society!!  I clearly mention Chinese Singaporeans because
              the Indians or Malays I came across in Singapore were not discriminatory. The
              western tourists whom I came across were more tolerant and accommodating than
              the local Chinese.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I spoke to a couple of citizens of Indian origin in
              Singapore and they said there is racism prevailing in job sector  and in housing societies too with the Chinese
              being preferred over Indian and Malays. There seems to be no concept of equal opportunities
              for all at least not in job market.  One
              of the politicians wanted bring in Chinese immigrants over other nationalities
              and make Mandarin the predominant language.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">A note to mention here, 
              I went to Genting highlands and Kualalampur in Malaysia. Genting seems
              to be a la Singapore with majority Chinese tourists there but definitely the
              treatment was better . In Kualalampur , the people were extremely hospitable ,
              welcoming and willing to assist. I would give a Thumbs up for hospitality from people
              of Malaysia and total thumbs down for Chinese Singaporeans for their racist
              attitude.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

              <p>Are you sure these chinese are Singaporean ?</p>

              <p>I think you had problems with the CHINA chinese in Singapore.</p>
              <p>China is a MONO culture, MONO racial country.. they are not very tolerant to other racial group due to lack/limited exposure to the other races.</p>
              <p>You will face the same problem when you go to  MONO culture/racial country anywhere in the world.</p>
              <p>Where I work, we have Koreans from Korea, Taiwanese from Taiwan etc.. these workers are racist even among the Asian group. They are civil towards each other, but they clearly don't wish to be associated with one another.</p>
              <p>You India indians are racist too.. I've been to your country.. I've seen how you treated your own people... the class divide, the clans divide, tribal divide, the racial divide..the lighter skin vs the darker skin Indians..</p>
              <p>Fix your own country's racism first before you go another country to complain about their racist behavior.</p>
              <p>But yes, we understand... you don't like it because YOU get treated unfairly, but you obviously have no problem dishing out racism to other people as long as it's not YOU at the receiving end of racism.</p>
              <p>Racism is an UNFAIR and UNJUST act. The fact that you Indians treats <strong>your own</strong> race with such wide spread and high level of unfair and unjust .. yet you have the audacity to come to our country and complain about being treated unfairly .</p>
              <p>That's why when you complain... the locals tell you to Fark Off.</p>

              <p>Again.. foreigner from the MOST racist place on earth.. teaching another country how to be non-racist...what a joke.</p>
              <p>Here's an advise.. if your country practise fairness and equality... your words will carry more weight...at the current moment ...even if your Prime minister from India were to come to SG to give a free lecture about Anti-Racism.. he will be Boo-ed off the stage immediately..</p>
              <p> Sure.. it's tough being a non-chinese in SG... well... did you ask the SG indians and malays who complained about racism in Sg.. WHY they havn't all ran off to India and Malaysia and start a BETTER life there ? That's right... they are trying to scare you away , stupid.</p>
              <p>Modern glitz... glamour.. that's nothing to do with the fact that INDIA is a shit hole who treats their own people badly. And as long as this unjust life continues in India... the WORLD will look down on you Indians from India.</p>
              <p>To equate modern glitz and glamour with automatic acceptance of any low ball  standard is simply LUDACRIS on your part.</p>
              <p>Try walking into an up-scale restaurant with your flip flops , singlet and tattered shorts, you will not be welcome and possibly be asked to leave the premise....No amount of feet stomping, childish tantrums nor shouting about RACISM will get you seated inside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If you are not part of the solution you are part of the problem.</strong></p>
              <p>So, again... you want the world to respect and welcome you.. you fix the problem in your home country first. Clean up the acts.</p>
              <p>RESPECT must be <strong>EARNED.</strong>. you can't demand it.</p>
              <p>Seriously... build some toilets for the India people for goodness sake... It's disgusting to see so many people POOPING and PEEING in public on the rail way tracks every morning !!! Because your govt is tooo stupid to not put toilets in the homes !!!!</p>

              <p>There is racism everywhere and it's how you make out of it.</p>
              <p>I am friends with some Indians from India and I don't hear them bitching about racisim in Singapore. In fact they have all gotten their PR and are hoping to get their citizenship soon in racist Singapore. I wonder why they want to call Singapore their home if it's so awful here. </p>
              <p>Maybe TS you should reflect on your actions if you did anything for people to 'pick on you' and you just assume that it's your race. </p>
              <p>Also, like the others pointed out all chinese might look the same to you but in Singapore, we are now the minority. Those PRCs are also racist towards us and you might have met them. The locals are never outrightly unhelpful and rude unless there is something on your end you did to make them treat you rudely. </p>
              <p>Some self-reflection never hurt anyone. </p>
