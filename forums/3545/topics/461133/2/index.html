              <p>Ad phrase for Singapore  states “Surprising 
              Singapore”  and yes Singapore will provide you with surprises
              but perhaps unpleasant surprise of racism may be last thing you had
              in mind.</p>
              <p>I am an Indian and I am writing here to express my
              concerns regarding the racist experiences I felt from Chinese
              Singaporeans during my Singapore Trip recently. The Chinese
              Singaporeans are never willing to assist an Indian asking for
              directions and you are made to feel as not welcome. I am sure they
              will react differently to other travellers. I experienced a rudely
              reacting Bus driver when I mentioned I do not have the exact change
              and thankfully an Indian passenger came to rescue.  If the
              driver could have said it in a proper manner it would not had
              mattered at all.</p>
              <p>Chinese Singaporean seems rude and always ready for a
              fight at a drop of a hat. This instance happened when I took a bus
              from Singapore to Genting highlands in Malaysia (Bus was of Sri
              Maju transport departing from Golden Mile Complex, Singapore). Bus
              after entering Malaysia halted for a while at a point for
              refreshments and I also got down. When I came back I saw the bus
              standing but the passenger entry door was closed and with the
              driver or attendant nowhere to be seen.  Not just me but other
              passengers who got down was not able to get in. We waited for about
              20 min in scorching cold after which the Chinese driver came at his
              leisurely pace. I was the first one to complain since I had waited
              longer even though there were other passengers who were
              stranded.  The driver who saw an Indian complaining started
              abusing me in his local lingo (of course he did not know a bit of
              english) and somehow using his sign language mentioned that it is
              you who are at fault of not opening the door.  All the
              passengers tried open the door but was not successful. Then driver
              got to know that the driver had mistakenly locked the door and
              finally he had to unlock it from inside. Even after being his
              fault, the driver started abusing me for no reason and when I
              reacted he was ready for a fight!!!  I had to back off from
              that instance and ignored him and got into my seat.  I am sure
              what provoked him was that an Indian complained against him and not
              the complaint or the fault with himself.</p>
              <p>The indifference does not stop here, in malls or in
              reception of hotels or at other places, I had experienced
              differential treatment especially to Indians in Singapore. When I
              ask for food in restaurants, they are not willing even answer some
              genuine questions.  All the racism in a country that
              publicizes itself as a multi racist- multi religious society!!
               I clearly mention Chinese Singaporeans because the Indians or
              Malays I came across in Singapore were not discriminatory. The
              western tourists whom I came across were more tolerant and
              accommodating than the local Chinese.</p>
              <p>I spoke to a couple of citizens of Indian origin in
              Singapore and they said there is racism prevailing in job sector
               and in housing societies too with the Chinese being preferred
              over Indian and Malays. There seems to be no concept of equal
              opportunities for all at least not in job market.  One of the
              politicians wanted bring in Chinese immigrants over other
              nationalities and make Mandarin the predominant language.</p>
              <p>A note to mention here,  I went to Genting
              highlands and Kualalampur in Malaysia. Genting seems to be a la
              Singapore with majority Chinese tourists there but definitely the
              treatment was better . In Kualalampur , the people were extremely
              hospitable , welcoming and willing to assist. I would give a Thumbs
              up for hospitality from people of Malaysia and total thumbs down
              for Chinese Singaporeans for their racist attitude.</p>

              <p>Incase you think racism exist only in singapore , why don't you look at our dear friend malaysia. The government only caters towards it natives and exempt priveliges from the chinese.</p>
              <p>If a muddy shit face came up to me asking for direction or stupid questions that isn't about me in board daylight , i wouldn't be too pleased about it either.In fact i would be thinking what his head would look like on a pike throughtout the conversation and walk on after he shut his rubber lips up.</p>

I experienced a rudely reacting Bus driver when I mentioned I do not have the exact change and thankfully an Indian passenger came to rescue.  If the driver could have said it in a proper manner it would not had mattered at all.</p>
              <p>Chinese Singaporean seems rude and always ready for a fight at a drop of a hat. This instance happened when I took a bus from Singapore to Genting highlands in Malaysia (Bus was of Sri Maju transport departing from Golden Mile Complex, Singapore). Bus after entering Malaysia halted for a while at a point for refreshments and I also got down. When I came back I saw the bus standing but the passenger entry door was closed and with the driver or attendant nowhere to be seen.  Not just me but other passengers who got down was not able to get in. We waited for about 20 min in scorching cold after which the Chinese driver came at his leisurely pace. I was the first one to complain since I had waited longer even though there were other passengers who were stranded.  The driver who saw an Indian complaining started abusing me in his local lingo (of course he did not know a bit of english) and somehow using his sign language mentioned that it is you who are at fault of not opening the door.  All the passengers tried open the door but was not successful. Then driver got to know that the driver had mistakenly locked the door and finally he had to unlock it from inside. Even after being his fault, the driver started abusing me for no reason and when I reacted he was ready for a fight!!!  I had to back off from that instance and ignored him and got into my seat.  I am sure what provoked him was that an Indian complained against him and not the complaint or the fault with himself.</p>
              <p>The indifference does not stop here, in malls or in reception of hotels or at other places, I had experienced differential treatment especially to Indians in Singapore. When I ask for food in restaurants, they are not willing even answer some genuine questions.  All the racism in a country that publicizes itself as a multi racist- multi religious society!!  I clearly mention Chinese Singaporeans because the Indians or Malays I came across in Singapore were not discriminatory. The western tourists whom I came across were more tolerant and accommodating than the local Chinese.</p>
              <p>I spoke to a couple of citizens of Indian origin in Singapore and they said there is racism prevailing in job sector  and in housing societies too with the Chinese being preferred over Indian and Malays. There seems to be no concept of equal opportunities for all at least not in job market.  One of the politicians wanted bring in Chinese immigrants over other nationalities and make Mandarin the predominant language.</p>
              <p><strong>A note to mention here,  I went to Genting highlands and Kualalampur in Malaysia. Genting seems to be a la Singapore with majority Chinese tourists there but definitely the treatment was better . In Kualalampur , the people were extremely hospitable , welcoming and willing to assist. I would give a Thumbs up for hospitality from people of Malaysia and total thumbs down for Chinese Singaporeans for their racist attitude.</strong></p>

              <p>Erm, Genting Highlands is a resort, oh course they will treat you well.</p>
              <p>Hey, just saying, some of the Indians I met there have the "superiority complex". They expect to get serve 1st, wait for a few minutes complain, expects to get the room 1st, etc. and apparently, you have it too, huh?</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">If you are really concerned about my post, you should have first traced Bus driver of Sri Maju mentioned above who had abused me definitely due to my race, trace the flight attendants of Tiger Airways who totally ignored queries of Indian passengers but was interested in serving the Caucasian passengers. Trace the people in MRT, Restaurants and other public places who threw racists comments, abuses on other races.</span></em></p>
