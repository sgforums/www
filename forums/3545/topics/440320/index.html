              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A Singapore permanent resident who fractured his arms
               and right leg in an accident involving a van was found to be "75 per 
              cent" liable for the accident, a judge ruled on Monday.<br><br>Hence, he is only entitled to a quarter of the claims, which will be assessed by the court later. <br><br>Mr
               Thorben Langvad Linneberg, 41, a freelance consultant, had claimed for 
              general damages for his injuries, which include his "pain, suffering and
               loss of amenities" and future transport expenses. He also claimed for 
              special damages close to S$263,000, including medical expenses and loss 
              of earnings.<br><br>Mr Linneberg, a Danish citizen, alleged that the 
              collision on June 3, 2009, at Clemenceau Avenue North was caused solely 
              by the negligence of Madam Leong Mei Kuen, who was driving the van.<br><br>Mr
               Linneberg claimed that Mdm Leong had failed to keep a proper lookout 
              for his motorcycle and failed to signal right before executing the 
              U-turn or right turn.<br><br>His lawyer also suggested to Mdm Leong that she did not check her right wing and rear view mirror, as well as her blind spot.<br><br>Mdm
               Leong denied his claims: She had checked for traffic on the opposite 
              side and on her side of the road before making the turn.<br><br>Mdm 
              Leong pointed out that she had stopped her vehicle to let a student 
              alight before the accident. She added that she had checked for traffic 
              and signalled right before engaging the gear to move off. <br><br>She alleged that Mr Linneberg was riding his motorcycle at an excessive speed and failed to keep a proper lookout.<br><br>Justice
               Lai Siu Chiu ruled that Mdm Leong's evidence was consistent, while Mr 
              Linneberg made no mention of the speed he was travelling at when he was 
              interviewed by the Traffic Police. - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a> </span></p>
