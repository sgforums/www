              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Bears in 
              metal jackets - with metal catheters draining bile from their gall 
              bladders - stand in tiny cages with their muscles largely wasted.<br><br>Some
               have had their teeth smashed, or claws cut. Others could be killed, 
              with their paws cut off or gall bladders taken out on-the-spot - if that
               is what the buyer wants.<br><br>Animal welfare issues aside, these bear
               farms - found in countries such as Laos, Myanmar and China and where 
              thousands of bears are kept - are also a "real concern" from a 
              conservation standpoint, given evidence that suggests that some of these
               bears are caught in the wild, said wildlife monitoring network 
              Traffic's South-east Asia Deputy Director Chris Shepherd, who was 
              recently in town.<br><br>The two bear species in South-east Asia - the Asian black bear and sun bear -  are endangered species. <br><br>Cross-border
               trade of bear bile products is prohibited under the Convention on 
              International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora 
              (CITES), but occurs throughout the region, noted a bear bile trade 
              report published last year that Dr Shepherd co-authored.<br><br>The 
              bleak picture extends to wildlife trafficking in general: With growing 
              demand fuelled by rising affluence and the rise of online trade, and 
              enforcement agencies failing to keep up with smugglers, trafficking 
              levels are at an all-time high, according to Dr Shepherd, who is based 
              in Malaysia. <br><br>"The situation has never been as severe as it is now," he told MediaCorp.<br><br>"Last
               year, more rhinos were killed in South Africa to supply demand in 
              Vietnam than have ever been killed before - it was the absolute peak 
              last year. This year, it's looking to be worse."<br><br>Last year, 448 
              rhinos were killed in South Africa. Conservationists have pointed to 
              demand from Asia, in particular Vietnam. According to Traffic, 
              Vietnamese made up 24 of the 43 arrests of Asian nationals for rhino 
              crimes in South Africa this year, reported The Guardian last Monday.<br><br>Dr
               Shepherd said the aim is not to stop all wildlife trade - but to 
              "enforce legislation to a point where wildlife is not threatened by 
              trade and, in some cases, can be used sustainably". Such laws enacted 
              for the white-tailed deer in North America have resulted in no 
              detrimental effect on its wild population despite hunting, for instance.<br><br>Traffic
               investigates trade, provides intelligence reports and assists 
              authorities in wildlife trafficking enforcement. It has developed 
              materials such as species identification guides in various languages for
               the ASEAN Wildlife Enforcement Network, an inter-governmental 
              initiative targeting wildlife crime.<br><br>Its most recent report, on 
              trade of birds in the Solomon Islands, analysed 11 years of trade 
              figures and named Singapore as a key laundering point for tens of 
              thousands of birds caught in the wild but declared as captive bred. <br><br>Dr
               Shepherd urged the Singapore authorities to "better scrutinise permits 
              on shipments" of various species. "If they closed the door here, it 
              would have a knock-on effect globally. Singapore definitely has the 
              potential and capacity to do that," he said.<br><br>Cases of illegal 
              import, export and trans-shipment of wildlife and their parts or 
              products have decreased in the last two years, according to figures from
               the Agri-food and Veterinary Authority (AVA).<br><br>There were 33 cases in 2010 and 20 cases last year, with eight cases so far this year.<br><br>The
               possession and sale of illegal wildlife and their parts or products has
               decreased from 64 in 2010 to 14 last year. But in the first half of 
              this year, 16 cases have already been recorded.<br><br>Three cases since
               2010 have been prosecuted in court, with the rest given warnings or 
              composition fines, said an AVA spokesperson.<br><br>He added that the 
              AVA conducts regular inspections on shops that sell wildlife, and checks
               all shipments from high-risk countries at ports of entry and exit.<br><br>It
               also investigates CITES infringements based on its own intelligence and
               other information sources. The public may also contact the AVA at 6227 
              0670 to provide information on illegal wildlife sales.<br><br>"Singapore
               consumers can play their part by not eating exotic or illegal meat in 
              restaurants overseas, and not buying medicines and souvenirs with 
              wildlife parts," said Dr Shepherd.<br><br>"They should not keep wildlife
               as pets and, if they come across wildlife being illegally sold by 
              dealers, they should resist "rescuing" the animals by buying them."</span></span></p>
