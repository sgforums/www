              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Tougher 
              measures are being rolled out to curb littering in Singapore. From March
               2013, fines for first-time litter offenders will go up from S$300 to 
              S$500.<br><br>Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Vivian 
              Balakrishnan revealed this on Saturday at a community event in Bukit 
              Panjang.<br><br>At the event, the National Environment Agency (NEA) 
              jointly launched a campaign with the North West Community Development 
              Council to encourage the community to inculcate good anti-littering 
              habits.<br><br>The campaign is called "Hold on And Bin IT, Make it A 
              H.A.B.IT!", and it is being rolled out to support the Keep Singapore 
              Clean Movement.<br><br>The year-long campaign will see about 750 
              volunteers undergoing the "Litter-Free Ambassadors" programme, where 
              they will be trained to communicate with, and engage the community on 
              the importance of keeping the environment clean and binning their waste 
              properly.<br><br>Monthly themed activities will also be held in the North West District to instil a greater sense of environmental ownership.<br><br>As
               part of measures to curb littering, fines for first-time offenders will
               be increased. The penalties will go up further once amendments to the 
              Environment and Public Health Act are debated in Parliament next year.<br><br>Dr
               Balakrishnan said: "It's not so much the quantum. This is a symbol of 
              society's repudiation of a very bad habit by a very small minority. 
              Money cannot buy cleanliness.<br><br>"This is a matter of public safety 
              and public health, so we are treating this as a symbol of commitment to 
              making sure Singapore remains clean and green."<br><br>He said the 
              government is also studying the possibility of launching a 
              whistleblowing system, where feedback and complaints by members of the 
              public can be used to prosecute offenders.<br><br>Dr Balakrishnan added:
               "The other thing which we are examining - and it's still in the early 
              stages - is that, we receive a lot of feedback, through email, through 
              social media, as well as digital photos which are sent in to us, saying,
               'I know this person, and look what this person has done'.<br><br>"We 
              are examining the legal implications of whether or not and how we can 
              pursue investigations whenever we receive feedback like that. And if we 
              can identify the culprit, and if the complainant is willing to testify 
              in court, whether we can then use this as a basis to proceed for 
              prosecution."<br><br>Plans are also under way to make the Corrective 
              Work Order (CWO) even more visible. This includes having recalcitrant 
              litterbugs perform CWO in areas such as town centres instead of parks.<br><br>Derek
               Ho Yeong Thye, director-general of the Environmental Public Health 
              Division at the NEA, said: "I think if we place all these CWO exercises 
              in places which is more visible to the public, then I think they will 
              feel more eyes looking on them as they conduct the exercises, and I 
              think they will feel the public pressure on them, that this is not an 
              acceptable behaviour."<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
