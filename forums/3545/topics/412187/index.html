              <p><strong>By Raju Gopalakrishnan, Reuters</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - Along a sun-splashed cobblestone street in central 
              Singapore, coatless bankers with loosened ties quaff imported beers in a
               neighbourhood of gaily painted shophouses called Duxton Hill.</p>
              <p>The scene is almost European. And for long-time residents of this 
              Southeast Asian city-state at the crossroads of some of the world’s 
              busiest shipping lanes, a bit bemusing. Just a couple of years ago 
              late-night revellers used to tumble out of ill-lit pubs and grimy, 
              illicit brothels on Duxton Hill.</p>
              <p>The transformation is a microcosm of the reinventions Singapore has 
              undergone to keep an island with almost no resources and roughly the 
              size of New York City competitive in a neighbourhood of fast-growing 
              emerging markets.</p>
              <p>Boutique funds, advisory firms and brokerages are putting down roots 
              in a revamped Duxton Hill, where opium and gambling dens run by Chinese 
              triad gangs flourished last century.</p>
              <p>Singapore has attracted hundreds of such firms in the past decade, 
              lured by its light-touch registration requirements and relatively benign
               regulatory climate, even as Switzerland, the world’s leading wealth 
              manager, gets tougher on bank secrecy.</p>
              <p>“Our vision of this place is the Singapore version of London’s West 
              End,” said Ed Peter, 47, a Swiss-born fund manager who has been 
              buying up shophouses in Duxton Hill.</p>
              <p>The neighbourhood, in truth, bears little resemblance to London’s 
              theatre district, but it’s also a far cry from its shady past.</p>
              <p>“It’s going upmarket. It’s cool. It’s funky,” said Peter, speaking 
              effusively at his office in a three-storey building which housed an 
              Elvis impersonator bar just two years ago. “You’ve got half the 
              financial community here.”</p>
              <p>Next door, the raunchy Aristocats pub closed shop a few months ago, 
              providing space for Daun Consulting, a private equity adviser, to expand
               from its upper-level offices.</p>
              <p>Peter, Deutsche Bank’s head of asset management for Asia Pacific, 
              Middle East and Africa before setting up his own firm in Singapore, 
              manages about $650 million .</p>
              <p>The squeaky clean city of 5.1 million, nicknamed the “nanny state” 
              for its propensity for micromanagement, is fast emerging as one of the 
              world’s hottest destinations for wealth — and the wealthy, who now have 
              casinos and theme parks for play, and seaside mansions and penthouses to
               stay.</p>
              <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore at end-2009 — the most in Asia 
              and up about 40 percent from a year ago.</p>
              <p>The Boston Consulting Group estimates private banks alone in 
              Singapore manage about $500 billion in assets. The numbers are dwarfed 
              by the estimated $2 trillion in private wealth managed in Switzerland, 
              but the growth in Singapore is startling, wealth managers say.</p>
              <p>“In the last 10-12 years I’ve seen Singapore really take a leadership
               role in changing the landscape of the wealth management industry,” says
               Deepak Sharma, chairman of Citi Private Bank.</p>
              <p>“The regulatory environment in Singapore is one of the finest. It has
               one of the best standards in the world, but at the same time, it is 
              consultative. It engages the industry.”</p>
              <p>GO EAST YOUNG MAN</p>
              <p>The big players, including Swiss giants UBS AG and Credit Suisse who 
              have a global stranglehold on private wealth management, are among those
               looking East. UBS, usually chary about its plans, says it will hire 400
               new staffers in the Asia-Pacific region in the next few years.</p>
              <p>Credit Suisse said net new assets from clients in Asia climbed to 
              11.5 billion Swiss francs in 2009 from 8.4 billion in 2008. In the first
               six months of this year, net new assets came in at 7.1 billion Swiss 
              francs.</p>
              <p>Morgan Stanley plans to double its Asia headcount in wealth 
              management over the next three years, largely focussing on the top end 
              of the market.</p>
              <p>JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co plans to triple its private banking assets in
               Asia over the next five years and plans to increase its headcount in 
              the region by 40 percent over the current 400, a company spokesman in 
              New York said this week.</p>
              <p>“I believe Singapore will be the true private banking hub,” said 
              Massimo Hilber, managing partner at private Swiss bank Marcuard who, 
              like Peter, has an office on Duxton Hill. “All the big players are here,
               and the smaller players like us. You have to be here.”</p>
              <p>Why Singapore?</p>
              <p>First, assets held by Asia-Pacific’s high net worth individuals – 
              people owning more than $1 million excluding home, collectibles and 
              durables – surged 31 percent in 2009 to $9.7 trillion, overtaking 
              Europe, according to CapGemini/Merrill Lynch.</p>
              <p>Second, high net-worth individuals seeking high-return investments 
              are turning to emerging markets. Accordingly, portfolios of such 
              individuals included 22 percent in Asia-Pacific investments in 2009, up 
              from 19 percent in 2008, and will soon overtake Europe, the CapGemini 
              study says.</p>
              <p>Many of these changes are focussed on Singapore, which is at the 
              crossroads of new wealth being created in China, India and Indonesia, 
              some of the fastest growing economies in the world.</p>
              <p>Singapore, which has the world’s highest concentration of 
              millionaires, is poised to grow its own economy 13-15 percent this year,
               possibly the fastest rate in the world.</p>
              <p>Hong Kong is Asia’s other big financial centre, but tends to focus on
               investment banking and deal-making in China rather than in the 
              management of private wealth, bankers say.</p>
              <p>“Hong Kong probably makes great business sense from an investment 
              banker perspective, but I don’t think it has invested as much in itself 
              in creating a place for families to live,” says Nick Pollard, Asia chief
               executive of private banker RBS Coutts.</p>
              <p>“What Singapore has done very well is that it has almost created a 
              whole infrastructure, not just a place to work, but also a place to 
              live, a place to educate your children, a place to have great fun.”</p>
              <p>FINE CITY</p>
              <p>Stuffy. Staid. A “fine city” where every minor transgression attracts
               a fine. Where the sale of chewing gum is banned, and caning is 
              prescribed for offences such as vandalism.</p>
              <p>That was, and in some cases still is, Singapore.</p>
              <p>But about five years ago, the government launched a concerted effort 
              to change the image. Two casinos sprang up this year at a cost of about 
              $11 billion in a city where gambling had been banned. It’s the only 
              country in the world where the Formula One Grand Prix is held at night.</p>
              <p>Singapore impeccably conducted its third F1 race on September 26, 
              with Fernando Alonso winning on a balmy tropical night, driving his 
              Ferrari through 61 laps around the city’s business district.</p>
              <p>Top music acts including Mariah Carey, Sean Kingston, Chris Daughtry 
              and Adam Lambert performed at different areas around the circuit. Some 
              of the jet-setting crowd partied after the race at a newly opened 
              rooftop bar at the $5.3 billion Marina Bay Sands casino resort, built by
               Las Vegas Sands on reclaimed land around the mouth of the Singapore 
              River.</p>
              <p>Sentosa island, just offshore Singapore, is being redeveloped as a 
              home for the seriously wealthy, with golf clubs, a sailing marina and 
              sea-facing bungalows priced at $20 million and more. Genting Singapore’s
               Resorts World casino and Universal Studios theme park opened in 
              February, raking in S$503.5 million in the first three months.</p>
              <p>“Rebranding Singapore as a global city and tourism hub fits in very 
              well with its natural advantage, which is its strategic location in the 
              centre of Southeast Asia and good transportation links,” said Kit Wei 
              Zheng, a Citigroup economist.</p>
              <p>The aim is simple. Make the city more attractive for high-end foreign
               talent and wealth. Turn tourism into a money spinner. Focus on services
               as manufacturing shifts to lower-cost countries in the region. And make
               it easy for foreigners to work.</p>
              <p>It is the latest incarnation of a city that emerged from British 
              colonial rule in the 1960s as a gritty port town. Founding father Lee 
              Kuan Yew and his People’s Action Party — dressed in trademark white 
              shirts and pants — set out to scrub the city clean of corruption in all 
              its manifestations.</p>
              <p>By the 1970s, the port had become one of the world’s busiest and was 
              soon complemented by the opening of top-ranked Changi international 
              airport.</p>
              <p>By the 1980s, Singapore was a regional manufacturing hub, 
              particularly for electronics. Then it reinvented itself as a financial 
              hub, and by the 1990s was one of the world’s leading centres for foreign
               exchange trading. A decade ago, the PAP patriarchs began building an 
              education and bio-tech hub.</p>
              <p>NUMBER 10</p>
              <p>The common denominator for each Singapore incarnation has been to 
              make it easy to do business. Be the fastest shipper, the most proficient
               manufacturer, the state with the least red tape.</p>
              <p>For the Singapore financial industry, that comes from what they call 
              “Number 10″. That’s 10 Shenton Way, not Downing Street but the address 
              represents an institution similarly powerful — the headquarters of MAS, 
              the central bank.</p>
              <p>“The regulatory environment is fair as opposed to arbitrary, random 
              and difficult,” says Peter, the fund manager. “The rule of law is 
              incredibly important. This is probably the best-managed country on the 
              planet. It’s managed in a pro-active business-friendly way.”</p>
              <p>Funds with less than 30 institutional investors can set up shop 
              without a licence from MAS. While MAS is set to introduce tighter rules 
              next year, Singapore remains one of the easiest jurisdictions for funds 
              to begin operations.</p>
              <p>But as regulation is tightened in Europe and the United States 
              following the 2008 financial crisis, and Switzerland responds to 
              concerns about its bank secrecy laws, Singapore, too, has come under the
               spotlight.</p>
              <p>In November, Singapore was taken off the OECD “grey list” of nations 
              not implementing international disclosure standards, but has yet to sign
               a tax treaty with the United States.</p>
              <p>“The business model for private bankers is going to change — they can
               no longer tell customers just to put their money in Singapore and they 
              will make sure no one ever knows about it,” said Edmund Leow, principal 
              at law firm Baker &amp; McKenzie, Wong &amp; Leow.</p>
              <p>“Instead, bankers are already marketing themselves as providing the 
              best advice on how to legitimately minimize the amount of money their 
              customers have to pay in tax.</p>
              <p>“This is a global trend. I think Singapore is doing what most other 
              countries are doing and shouldn’t be disadvantaged compared with other 
              wealth management centres.”</p>
              <p>RISKS OF REINVENTIONS</p>
              <p>Singapore’s seismic reinventions were possible because the government
               nipped any political opposition in the bud and voters who have seen 
              their per capita incomes grow seven-fold over the years were not 
              inclined to grumble much.</p>
              <p>But as Singapore undergoes its latest manifestation as a “global 
              city”, with an ever-mounting proportion of foreign residents crowding 
              the roads and competing for space and jobs, the government is having to 
              soothe escalating criticism from the “heartland”, the sprawl of 
              government housing blocks in the interior of the island where much of 
              the citizenry lives.</p>
              <p>Take, for example, Pipit Road, where a public housing compound is set
               amid factories and warehouses. People there live in tiny one-room 
              apartments and are among the least well-off in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Elderly residents shuffle along through corridors to the open area at
               the ground level, many with vacant stares.</p>
              <p>“Look at my life. Do you think I have the time?”, said 
              Seet Siew Buay, a 49-year-old woman when asked if she had seen the 
              casino resorts or heard of the F1 race. “I have to look after them,” she
               said pointing to a 26-year-old son with learning and speech 
              disabilities and an unemployed common-law husband.</p>
              <p>They subsist on the S$300 given to the son each month in welfare, and
               Wong’s savings from his days as a carpenter. Singapore households earn 
              an average income of S$7,440 a month, according to government 
              statistics, but the bottom 20 percent earn only S$1,274.</p>
              <p>There is some anger in the Pipit Road housing block at what is seen 
              as the headlong rush to attract foreign investment and wealth.</p>
              <p>“The bloody government will get the money,” said a middle-aged man, 
              who called himself Jack. “We will get nothing. But somehow we still vote
               for them.”</p>
              <p>Having a super-rich pool of foreigners in the city poses the risk of 
              accentuating social tensions. Already, housing prices are rising faster 
              than in the rest of the region. Porsches, Jaguars and Ferraris flash by 
              in the streets. The number of international schools in the city catering
               mostly to foreigners has risen five-fold in the last decade or so.</p>
              <p>The number of overseas workers — mostly for menial and blue collar 
              jobs — has also risen rapidly to around 1.8 million, a figure that also 
              includes foreigners who have become permanent residents. That means one 
              in three people in Singapore is a foreigner, one of the highest such 
              proportions in the world outside the Middle East.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressed those rising concerns in his
               August 9 National Day speech saying that without an inflow of workers 
              to make up for “the shortage of workers and the “shortfall of babies in 
              our population”, the economy and society would stagnate.</p>
              <p>“I understand Singaporeans’ concerns about taking in so many foreign 
              workers and immigrants. Some of us wonder: Will it change the ethos of 
              our society? Will it mean more competition for us at work, or for our 
              children in schools? Will the new arrivals strike roots here? Can they 
              adjust to us, and we to them? These are valid concerns which we must 
              address.”</p>
              <p>One way to ensure some trickle-down effect from Singapore’s rapid 
              growth is on public spending.</p>
              <p>The government plans to spend $44 billion alone in the next decade on
               extending the commuter rail network to cope with a population projected
               to grow another 25 percent in the next few years following a 25 percent
               increase the past decade.</p>
              <p>“There is a certain degree of discontent, but it is not brewing over 
              and spilling out into unrest,” said Gerald Giam, an executive councilor 
              of the opposition Workers’ Party. “It is something we need to keep a 
              watch on.”</p>
              <p>ST. JACK</p>
              <p>Over at Duxton Hill, it’s getting to evening and executives are 
              winding their way home, some hailing a cab, one or two clambering onto 
              bicycles.</p>
              <p>It’s still a ribald place around the edges. Some of the old bars 
              still operate. In a few corners, one can almost imagine Jack Flowers, 
              the protagonist of Paul Theroux’s novel “St. Jack” about Singapore in 
              the 1960s, rifling his deck of porno cards in a seedy shophouse doorway 
              and asking a tourist: “Can I get you anything? Anything at all you 
              need?”</p>
              <p>For Peter, the fund manager, Singapore has what he needs.</p>
              <p>“This place works,” he says, strolling down the cobbled street on 
              Duxton Hill. “Take a look at the airport. In how many countries in the 
              world do you find your luggage on the carousel when you come out? In 
              Geneva, you wait 25 minutes. In the US of A, you worry, will your bags 
              show up?”</p>
              <p>Peter, who worked in private banking in Europe and Hong Kong before 
              setting up in Singapore in 2005, is also involved in a chain of wine 
              shops in Singapore, and vineyards in Australia.</p>
              <p>On Singapore’s social tensions, he becomes reflective and says: “It’s
               a new risk that’s worth watching. Is it a big risk? No.” Then reverting
               to his natural ebullience, he says: “This place has the potential to be
               Monaco and Luxembourg, and Geneva or even London.”</p>
