               note says that if anyone feeds cats here, their family will die, and 
              what's worse, the person used a vulgarity on the note. <br><br>"It 
              shouldn't be a sin to feed cats as it's a good deed to do so, if we 
              humans need to eat, cats are living things too and they should also be

              <p>Cats can find their own food. You feed, they rely on people to feed. Whats gonna happen if you move house? The cat's gonna start attacking people (cos they suddenly found themselves out of food and only rely on people for food). And what happens when they start attacking people? People gonna call SPCA to bring the cat down. <br><br>Think of it, are you helping the cat, or killing the cat indirectly?</p>

              <p>I get what u mean. But from ur quotation *open it up* is so subjective. Not all cats attack people. And SPCA wont bring down just any cat unless it is suffering from an illness. If its healthy, it will be put on adoption. :)</p>
              <p>Cats are cute little things. Feeding them doesnt harm anyone. Infact it feels great when u know ur there to fill someone's, well in this cases, the cat's stomach. I think someone is just trying to be funny or play a prank by scribbling those curses on a crumpled paper. Its just stupid mindgames. Even when someone complain to the neighbourhood police, they will just come and give some advise. Cats are harmless creatures. So dont be so uptight about feeding them.</p>

              <p>So its okay to curse someone like this, if they dirty your place? Then what happened to confronting ur neighbours in the appropriate manner? Live in a civilised world. how does one SUFFER from getting his veranda (which doesnt belong to anyone)? Just live in a private estate then.</p>
              <p>Im not picking sides. If u feed cat outside ur veranda, be responsible to clean the place up 5-10 mins later.</p>

              <p>There is the myth  that cats carry disease. There is a list of germs that cats are supposed to have that are harmful to humans. But so far no humans have been infected by cats. Bitten yes, scratched yes, disease no.</p>
              <p>SARS, H1N1, bird flu and what not, the first thing they do is to test to see if cats can transmit the disease to humans. They try to get the cats get infected and see if the virus can jump to humans. In all the past SARS, and birdflue epidemics they failed.</p>
              <p>People who hate animals, especially dogs and cats, are pathetic people. They are somehow unable to achieve contentment in life. They have to go to the circus, the movies etc  for a shot of happiness. </p>
              <p>You don't have to sayang the dogs and cats or bring them home, just leave them alone. Is that too hard to do? For those who wants to do more, slightly more, can feed them. For thos who want to do more, can shelter them.</p>
              <p>Those who don't want to do anything, just leave them alone. No need to kick them, curse them or call the government to kill them.</p>

Because stray females rarely get spayed, having too many consecutive litters takes its toll on the female's system. Strays often encounter other sick cats who transmit diseases, either those that are airborne or through fighting. While city strays are subject to physical abuse or being struck by <a class="StrongLink" href="http://www.ehow.com/cars/"><span style="color: #0086df;">cars</span></a>, those who avoid contact with humans take shelter in the woods where they hunt.

              <p>While rabies is among the most dangerous of the diseases affecting strays, others, such as respiratory viruses, occur from a lack of <a class="StrongLink" href="http://www.ehow.com/health/"><span style="color: #0086df;">health</span></a> care. Cats with Feline Immunodeficiency Virus are unable to fight infection, making them vulnerable to common bacteria and viruses. Those infected with Feline Leukemia Virus can pass the disease on to other cats through their saliva, urine, and feces. Strays might develop panleukopenia, an intestinal infection that is often fatal. Cold germs can give them eye infections, causing the eye to swell and shut. Fighting result in wounds from bites that can lead to infection.</p>

              <p>Kittens born to stray mothers are the most vulnerable to disease. Because malnutrition often weakens the mother's resistance to infection, strays are born with less chance of survival and a greater tendency toward illness. Stray mothers who have diseases like FIV often transmit them to their offspring during birth, with other illnesses transmitted by animal bites. Young strays quickly become predators in the wild. Since most are not spayed or neutered, they continue the cycle of giving birth to new generations of kittens who will never be domesticated in a real home.</p>

              <p>Those who are committed to helping stray cats need to protect themselves from certain diseases. Bacteria and viruses that can harm humans are usually transmitted through bites, scratches, and feces. People caring for strays should wash their hands after touching them, be careful around litter boxes, and keep their distance from cats who are hissing, frightened, or acting aloof. Since the rabies virus is transmitted through saliva, those who tend to strays need to be careful of cats that might have groomed themselves after fighting with a wild animal.</p>
