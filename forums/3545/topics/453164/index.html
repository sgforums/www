              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Households in Singapore can expect to gradually pay more to have their trash collected.<br><br>The
               National Environment Agency (NEA) said the move is aimed at uplifting 
              the waste collection industry, which is struggling with rising operating
               costs while it grapples with improving service standards.<br><br>Industry
               players said these challenges have been made harder by government 
              contracts that have locked in fees for the past seven to eight years, 
              with no provision for adjustments.<br><br>With several contracts up for 
              renewal over the next few years, the NEA, which manages the public waste
               collection scheme, is looking to reshape the industry.<br><br>For the 
              purpose of waste management, Singapore is currently divided into nine 
              sectors, served by four companies. This will be reduced to six sectors, 
              to help companies achieve economies of scale.<br><br>Andrew Tan, CEO of 
              the National Environment Agency, said: "This in turn will translate into
               greater affordability and at the same time, giving opportunities for 
              the waste collectors to invest in the capital, in the training of their 
              workforce and also the equipment needed to do a good job in terms of 
              waste collection." <br><br>Chairman of the Waste Management and 
              Recycling Association, Guah Eng Hock, also pointed out that waste 
              collection companies are required in their contracts to have a 
              recyclable sorting facility in each sector. He said that with the larger
               sectors, companies will be able to enjoy greater economies of scale.<br><br>A standard waste collection fee will also be introduced.<br><br>Today, households pay as little as S$4.03 per HDB flat, or as high as S$22.50 for a landed home.<br><br>Prices
               also differ between estates. For example, HDB flats in the city area 
              currently pay S$4.03, while those in Pasir-Ris and Tampines fork out 
              S$6.87. The difference in pricing is due to separate contracts being 
              called for each sector, subjected to open bidding.<br><br>Moving 
              forward, all households will pay a "uniform fee" - depending on whether 
              it is an HDB flat or landed property. The fee will be derived from the 
              weighted average of successful tender bids submitted by public waste 
              collectors.<br><br>The first to come under the new fee structure will be households in Pasir-Ris, Tampines and Bedok.<br><br>From July, HDB properties in those areas will pay S$7, while landed homes will pay S$23.19.<br><br>The
               NEA said households would have had to pay more, if the new uniformed 
              fee structure was not applied. The new uniformed fee structure will be 
              progressively rolled out to the rest of Singapore by 2015.<br><br>In 
              return for higher fees, waste collection companies will have to meet 
              higher service standards. This includes having quieter and cleaner 
              vehicles, and responding quicker to public feedback.<br><br>Companies will also have to provide better incentive schemes to encourage households to recycle.<br><br>Singapore's
               only landfill on Semakau island is currently at half its capacity, and 
              is expected to run out of space by 2040. Thus, recycling remains a key 
              strategy for managing waste in Singapore and the government hopes that 
              consumers and businesses will start at the source - by sorting their 
              recyclables from other waste.<br><br>Singapore's recycling rate currently stands at 59 per cent - a long way from its long-term target of 70 per cent.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
