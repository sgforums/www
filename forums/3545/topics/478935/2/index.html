              Imagine this: you enter the military and lead a regimented life from the tender age of 14. You wear the Army uniform, carry a rifle and learn military tactics and concepts daily, but this is not your Co-curricular Activity (CCA). This might have been a nightmare for most teens, but this bunch of boys (now men, of course) volunteered for such a life back in 1977 at the SAF Boysâ€™ School (SAFBS).

              Correct it was Yaohan....I also remembered at Plaza Singapura...2nd floor...PONDEROSA SALAD RESTAURANT....buffet style...could eat as much you want for a very reasonable price...they had steaks, sandwiches, burgers and fish n chips too in their menu.

              In late 70s and early 80s, national minimum wage was $250 per month. Overtime rate was 2.5 per hour. And for office workers if the management needed you to work during the weekend (Sunday) they paid you double salary and on holiday was triple salary. If you stayed work after 6 pm you could get your dinner allowance, after 8 or 9 pm bus fare reimbursement and after midnight taxi fare reimbursement.
              
              Office work was 40 hrs work week and in some companies even less than 40 hrs work week. More rest and quality time with families, relatives and friends.    
              
              CPF contribution was 25 per cent for employer and 25 per cent for employee until after recession in middle of 80s....20/20 for employer and employee.
              
              National Productivity achievement was good.
