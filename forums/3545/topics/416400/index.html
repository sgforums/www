              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong says government revenues have been better than 
              projected. Hence, the next budget which usually takes place in February 
              will bring good news.<br><br>Speaking at the People's Action Party's 
              conference on Sunday, Mr Lee noted that the civil service has just 
              announced this year's year-end bonus payment.<br><br>He said union and 
              the public sector employees are happy and the private sector can expect 
              good bonuses too.<br><br>The theme of Mr Lee's speech at the party's 
              conference was entitled "Singapore our home, our future together."<br><br>Prime
               Minister Lee said that Singapore should use the strong growth for 2010 
              to improve the lives of its people by building homes, upgrading housing 
              estates and strengthening the social safety nets. <br><br>Mr Lee also 
              assured Singaporeans that the government will improve the lives of 
              people by giving them opportunities, good education and a stake in the 
              country.<br><br>He assured the less skilled, the poor and especially the
               elderly, that the government will give them a helping hand to catch up 
              and keep up and make sure that they benefit from Singapore's prosperity.<br><br>-

              <p>Don't think people are going to be so draft to fall for that crap again, except for new citizens which should make up quite a sizable amount by now with the government importing supporters strategy. The amount of third world refugees will be a constant remainder to how much trouble this shxthole is in and also the amount of PMET being unceremoniously duped for cheap labour will still leave a sour taste for those PMET. The high cost of everything, including groceries, flats, transport and the eventually raising of GST will cost them some votes.</p>
              <p>The word on the streets is that the PAPist are not that confident in the coming election, I don't tink they expect to lose the majority thus they are not panicking except for the shorty toad Marlboro Tan.</p>
              <p>The next budget will be only a rough indicaton of how bad the PAPist think they will lose. No matter how much they give, they will rob from us even more.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I understand your concerns but a void vote will only help the PAPist as we are are not sure at this moment whether the opposition can even garner any seats at this moment. Most people might still vote for PAPist so if you void your vote, the PAPist will only thank you for this.  A void vote or voting for PAPIst will mean a step backwards for Sinkpore, please reconsider your decision. Many events such as the escape of Mas Salamat has clearly shown  that the PAPist are also not capable leaders, worst still, they refuse to be held accountable for their mistakes and still get promoted to Senior Minister. In this coming election, we are not merely selecting good leaders, but we are voting for the future of Sinkapore, voting for leaders that will care genuinely for the people of Sinkapore instead of destroying Sinkapore for the sake of PAPist party and their cronies own survival. Please reconsider.</p>
