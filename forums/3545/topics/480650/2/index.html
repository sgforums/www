              <p>Almost true ;) Geneva is surrounded by the biggest Casinos in Europe... Divonne-les-bains, Annemasse or even few kilometers from Geneva, one of the most famous "le Casino d'Evian"... About F1, you are right, I can't say anything except the fact that 3 hours by train from Geneva you have Monaco and its famous Grand Prix.</p>

              <p>France as most of eurpean countries are on the way to decadence... The power is in the hand of a small oligarchy... No hope of any improvement from our political class.</p>
              <p>My point of view of what is going to happen in Europe is quite pessimistic. Rise of fascism, more and more riots... poverty riots and soon even hunger riots... and Ukraine is just the beginning of something that slowly spreads all over Europe </p>

              <p>France as most of eurpean countries are on the way to
              decadence... The power is in the hand of a small oligarchy... No
              hope of any improvement from our political class.</p>
              <p>My point of view of what is going to happen in Europe is quite
              pessimistic. Rise of fascism, more and more riots... poverty riots
              and soon even hunger riots... and Ukraine is just the beginning of
              something that slowly spreads all over Europe </p>

              Was that the reason you left France and work in Geneva? Maybe due to the current situation in the EU like unemployment rate is going up etcs....more Europeans are looking at the East for better opportunities....like employment, business, better future etcs..

              <p>You're right, Switzerland is like "El Dorado" for french workers... I was pretty disapointed by many things in France and that made my decision to move. I never regreted this decision. I think more and more young europeans will leave Europe to find a better life abroad... with unemployement rates like 20% in Spain, Greece, Portugal or Italy, the youth has pretty much no choice... This economic crisis could quickly move to a politic crisis... and what happened 100 years ago could happen again</p>

              The irony thing about this is that more and more asians and middle-eastern people are looking at EU for better life and future while Europeans now are looking at Asia for the same reason. Does that affect the job market in EU now due to the foreigners from asia, middle east and africa continent presence in EU? How do you react to that personally?

              <p>It's true that we always think that the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. The main problem with the EU job market is the deregulation edicted as a law by the EU parlement... no frontiers and as a result people from east of europe can come in the west without any restriction... the result is that the wages have declined... that concurence is pretty unfair for local people.. But I think this kind of problem is pretty much the same everywhere. The strategy of EU oligarchy is pretty simple: break the frontiers, break the historical countries... which means more insecurity, more poverty... but which is in the same time a great advantage for the capitalism: low wages, less social cotisations... To make accept that to the population, the EU will become more and more dictatorial... some kind of new totalitarism dedicated to the God "World Global Market"</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was the economics strategy by the leaders of European countries about two decades ago...to build a better and bigger market so as to be more competitive with U.S.A. in the beginning. It seems workable and quite genius to unite the European countries until China opens up its market to the world.</div>
