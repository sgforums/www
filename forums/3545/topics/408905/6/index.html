              <p>Remember the last time some woman tried to start an association

              <p>Anyway they seem to stand by their director's version of the
              story. ("The candid remarks and unacceptable responses from the
              said blogger were certainly uncalled for. We were not impressed by
              his behaviour, action and mannerism.")</p>

              <p>I guess... perhaps for me, what was more 'distasteful' is that instead of  clarifying the facts, stating the sequence of events and leaving the reader to come to his own conclusion (<em>which everyone, including me, has already more or less concluded: that the blogger is a cheapo who took unscrupulous advantage to squeeze what he could out of an invitation of goodwill)</em>, they included  judgement of the blogger and a personal attack on him.</p>
              <p>That's not very .. professional of a company I guess. Afterall, they DID invite him, but what they didn't do is, at the moment he said he has 4 guests, they should clarify with him at the onset that the invitation was for 2.

              <p>S<span style="text-decoration: underline;">chedule of events</span></p>
              <p>According to the screenshot posted by Brad, the lunch invitation on Jun 2 only invites him alone.</p>
              <p>On Jun 9, Brad replied he is busy but will get back with a date.</p>
              <p>On Aug 20, Brad said he will be coming for brunch tasting on sunday (which is Aug 22 ). The reply is more than 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>On Aug 21, Melanie emailed and asked whether Brad is bringing a guest. (note the word 'a' instead of 'any')</p>
              <p>On the same day, Brad replied he is bringing 3 guests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some comments</span></p>
              <p>1.      Brad said "In the invite, i was told to bring a guest." Being told to bring a guest is not the same as being asked whether he is bringing a guest. There is nowhere stating you are told to bring a guest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.      Brad tried to dispute this:</p>
              <p>"<em>Story:</em> I had informed the restaurant that I was a food blogger, therefore assuming that the bill for all 4 of us would be waived.</p>
              <p><em>Fact:</em> In truth, I had asked for no waiver. I paid for my other two companions. The bill for 2, inclusive of sparkling wine, came to $260. Out of goodwill, they did decide to waive the wine and I eventually paid $160 for 2"</p>
              <p>But you went on to say "It was an oversight to assume to that no acknowledgement from Melanie about my 3 accompanying guests would mean that their meals would be on the house too"</p>
              <p>So you did assume the bill for all 4 would be waived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.    Brad said: "I was not expected to be billed for and then “waived” off from what was disguised as a “food tasting session"</p>
              <p>Brad also said "When I dine out, I pay for my food like any regular consumer. When I am invited for food tasting sessions, it is a mutual understanding between the inviter and myself, that I would be attending as the identity of media for a possible food review"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To Brad:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why did you not expected to be billed when you said you pay for your food when you dine out? If they waived it off, shouldn't you be happy?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you said you are attending as the identity of media, you think too highly of yourself. Is that why you throw your card at the counter?</p>

              <p>According to the screenshot posted by Brad, the lunch invitation on Jun 2 only invites him alone.</p>
              <p>On Jun 9, Brad replied he is busy but will get back with a date.</p>
              <p>On Aug 20, Brad said he will be coming for brunch tasting on sunday (which is Aug 22 ). The reply is more than 6 weeks.</p>
              <p>On Aug 21, Melanie emailed and asked whether Brad is bringing a guest. (note the word 'a' instead of 'any')</p>
              <p>On the same day, Brad replied he is bringing 3 guests.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Some comments</span></p>
              <p>1.      Brad said "In the invite, i was told to bring a guest." Being told to bring a guest is not the same as being asked whether he is bringing a guest. There is nowhere stating you are told to bring a guest.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.      Brad tried to dispute this:</p>
              <p>"<em>Story:</em> I had informed the restaurant that I was a food blogger, therefore assuming that the bill for all 4 of us would be waived.</p>
              <p><em>Fact:</em> In truth, I had asked for no waiver. I paid for my other two companions. The bill for 2, inclusive of sparkling wine, came to $260. Out of goodwill, they did decide to waive the wine and I eventually paid $160 for 2"</p>
              <p>But you went on to say "It was an oversight to assume to that no acknowledgement from Melanie about my 3 accompanying guests would mean that their meals would be on the house too"</p>
              <p>So you did assume the bill for all 4 of us would be waived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3.    Brad said: "I was not expected to be billed for and then “waived” off from what was disguised as a “food tasting session"</p>
              <p>Brad also said "When I dine out, I pay for my food like any regular consumer. When I am invited for food tasting sessions, it is a mutual understanding between the inviter and myself, that I would be attending as the identity of media for a possible food review"</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To Brad:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Why did you not expected to be billed when you said you pay for your food when you dine out? If they waived it off, shouldn't you be happy?</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If you said you are attending as the identity of media, you think too highly of yourself. Is that why you throw your card at the counter?</p>

              <p>The news got out only because the restaurant managers told other food bloggers an exaggerated version. For instance, the bill was only $200+, not $435. Unscrupulous.</p>
