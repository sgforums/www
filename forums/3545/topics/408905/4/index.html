              <p><br>yeah....someone need to be more assertive to say well only he and his partner will eat free but not all 4.</p>
              <p>I mean you have to strike a balance between taking advantage of others or show some appreciate respect of the free meal.</p>
              <p>i think it is a tough ACT for both side, but PR consultant certainly need to be fired for not communicating clearly that Food Critics can bring "1" Guest for free at the initial invitation. </p>

              <h2>Under-fire food blogger: It’s a case of miscommunication
                  <br><br>By yahoosingapore – August 24th, 2010<br></h2>
              <p><img class="attachment-single-post-main wp-post-image" title="Private Affairs 2" src="http://yfittopostblogsg.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/privateaffairs21.jpg?w=604" alt="Private Affairs 2" width="604" height="453"></p>
              <p>The local food blogger under fire 
                  for demanding a free meal at a upscale restaurant in Joo Chiat says the 
                  entire saga has been a “case of miscommunication”.</p>
              <p>On Monday, Yahoo! Singapore reported that the <a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/08/23/food-blogger-who-asks-for-free-meal-sparks-outrage-online/">local food blogging community was upset </a>that Brad Lau, who owns <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lady+ironchef+blog&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">food blog ladyironchef</a>, initially refused to pay the full cost of his meal and that of his three friends after a visit to <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=private+affairs+joo+chiat&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Private Affairs </a>for their Sunday Brunch promotion.  </p>
              <p>But in a post entitled, “The Truth”, written on Tuesday, Lau said, 
                  “An eye for an eye makes the world go blind. I would like to not point 
                  fingers at anyone – it was simply a case of miscommunication. When I 
                  dine out, I pay for my food like any regular consumer.”</p>
              <p>Lau said the miscommunication could have resulted from the fact that 
                  he was simply following up on a food tasting invitation by the 
                  restaurant back in early June.</p>
              <p>But because he had a busy schedule, he could only confirm last 
                  Friday on 20th August that he would attending their Sunday Brunch 
                  promotion, along with his partner and two other friends.</p>
              <p>He wrote, “I was invited to a food tasting session by Melanie, PR 
                  Manager for the restaurant. The first invite came June 2nd. I was unable
                   to make it then and it was not until Friday, August 20th that I 
                  scheduled the Sunday brunch. In the invite, I was told to bring a 
                  guest.”</p>
              <p>Although he did not clarify at the time if he and his partner would 
                  be expected to pay, he wrote, ”This was an invitation to a food-tasting 
                  session. There is no hard and fast rule stating a plus one for a food 
                  tasting. However, having attended previous food tastings before, I 
                  assumed that the meal would be, at the very least, on the house for 
                  myself and one dining partner.”</p>
              <p>In his post that included several screencaps of mobile and 
                  email messages, he also went to write ”it was an oversight to 
                  assume that no acknowledgement from Melanie about my 3 accompanying 
                  guests would mean that their meals would be on the house too.”</p>
              <p>While Lau denied saying, “I always get free food wherever I go”, 
                  he admitted he was hostile towards the cashier when he was settling the 
                  final bill of $160 for his group of four.</p>
              <p><em>“</em>I must admit the hostility while paying (I had tossed my 
                  credit card on the table) was uncalled for and I sincerely apologise,” 
                  he wrote.</p>
              <p>Addressing the issue of his integrity as a food blogger, he clarified
                   that when he “dine(s) out, I pay for my food like any regular 
                  consumer. When I am invited for food tasting sessions, it is a mutual 
                  understanding between the inviter and myself, that I would be attending 
                  as the identity of media for a possible food review.”</p>
              <p>Lau concluded by asking all parties to “view this situation 
                  objectively. I hope this post clarifies any misunderstanding that this 
                  might have caused.”<br><br>Source:<br><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/08/24/under-fire-food-blogger-defends-himself/">http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/08/24/under-fire-food-blogger-defends-himself/</a></p>

              <p>the problem is "Assume", all of us know when that happens, you just made an 'ass' of u and me.</p>
              <p>being objective, even if he N his friend were invited, and FOC, he would still have to pay for the 2 other people. So why the hostility? why the big shot attitude that cause he is going to write a review?</p>
              <p>why can't he be mature and professional enough to speak with the person who invited him, given he got the sms and the mobile number to call? and resolve this amicably?</p>
              <p>i think most people are just pissed that, modern days, people expect tons of homage when they are just a somebody or worse, think they are somebody. </p>
              <p>Anyway, hope both ends learnt something from this and deal with this differently the next time.</p>

              <p>food blogger trying to test waters by informing restauant he's bringing 3 friends, restaurant doesnt reply and he thinks silence means consent. When asked to pay for his 3 (or 2?) friends, he buay song, thought he has alrdy informed.</p>
              <p>Me thinks it's a serious miscommunication, albeit from a cheapo free loader foodie. And no matter how angry we are, adults don't throw cards at cashiers.That's a bloody insult.</p>
              <p>I think this fiasco shd be titled "Brat's Affair in Private" lol.</p>
