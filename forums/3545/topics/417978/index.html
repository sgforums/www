              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A CHINESE national who had 48 infringing copies of pirated movies was 
              fined $48,000 on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Guan Zhenbang, 24, a sales manager, had pleaded guilty to 
              four charges of having pirated recordings published by Universal City 
              Studios, Sony Pictures Releasing International Corporation and Paramount
               Pictures Corporation, for sale at Sim Lim Square at Rochor Canal Road 
              on April 23.</p>
              <p>Among the recordings he had were Bourne Identity, Spiderman,
               Quantum of Solace, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and Shrek.</p>
              <p>The court heard that Guan came to Singapore in 2005 to 
              pursue a course in electrical engineering at Ngee Ann Polytechnic and 
              subsequently at Nanyang Technological University under a scholarship 
              programme from the Ministry of Education.</p>
              <p>Initially, he started a small business in digital photo 
              frames and subsequently sold media players, which was highly successful.</p>
              <p>When he noticed that more customers were heading to a 
              neighbouring shop to buy hard disks with pre-loaded movies, he decided 
              to do the same by paying a customer to buy one from the shop.</p>
              <p>Later, he bought more movies from the neighbouring shop 
              surreptitiously and collected them for use in his business. He amassed 
              nine catalogues of movie titles which he could offer to his customers 
              when they bought the hard disks.</p>
              <p>A blank hard disk would be sold for $150 while a hard disk 
              uploaded with movies, $200 to $220.</p>
              <p>A police party raided the shop and kiosk at the building and
               seized the hard disks at the building that day, and the hard disks with
               pirated movies.</p>
              <p>He could have been fined up to $10,000 per article. Eight 
              other similar charges were considered during his sentencing.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>see my point is not tp waste our taxpayers money on those floor traps who commit petty crimes, non vilent one sthat do not damage people property, rape, hurt and kill others, so on. provided also the victims or directly invovled do not wnat to take legal actions. other wise more violent ones must giv them hell in jail. give them all the rotan and i think the rotan must now modify to h ae the 'made in singapore' impression on the whip lashing so that when it cracked down prmanently will have the 'made in spore' impression on them so they can show and remember that the lashes were from sgpore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if not lots of them nationalirties floor traps just think eventually come here commitcrime can still stay in ten star hotel. the longer they stay here the more tax money eats us. they must be made t clean toilets and make them clean clean if not lengthen their enetnce to cut grass gardening and do jobs to pay back the black bean rice money</p>
