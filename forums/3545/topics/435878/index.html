              <div class="art-PostContent">
              <p>In a sign that social tensions are rising in Singapore due to the PAP’s unthinking and indiscriminate mass-immigration policies, the proportion of neighbour disputes handled by the Community Mediation Centre (CMC) hit a record high last year.</p>
              <p>One of the ‘interesting’ complaints was lodged by a PRC family against their Singaporean Indian neighbors for cooking curry too frequently.</p>
              <p>Though the considerate Indian family, who were mindful of their neighbour’s aversion, had already taken to closing their doors and windows whenever they cooked the dish, but this was not enough.</p>
              <p><strong>“They said: ‘Can you please do something? Can you don’t cook curry? Can you don’t eat curry?’,”<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> </span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">said Madam Marcellina Giam, a Community Mediation Centre mediator</span>. But the Indian family stood firm.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the end, Mdm Giam got the Indian family to agree to cook curry only when the Chinese family was not home.</span></span> In return, they wanted their Chinese neighbours to at least give their dish a try.</p>
              <p>Such conflicts between native Singaporean Chinese and Indians are almost unheard of in the past as they have been living together for the past hundred years or so and are used to the cuisines of each other.</p>
              <p>However to the newcomers from the poorer inland provinces of China, the smell of curry must come as a culture-shock to them.</p>
              <p>The number of mainland Chinese living in Singapore has reached almost one million people according to UnionPay, a credit card company.</p>
              <p>The media is full of reports of PRC cleaners, hawkers, construction workers, clerks, teachers, masseurs and even prostitutes being given Singapore PR and citizenship by the PAP. One of them, a 28 year old teacher Zhang Yuanyuan obtained her Singapore PR within TWO MONTHS of application.</p>
              <p>In an interview with National Geographic magazine in December 2009, PAP supreme Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed that it is a good thing that Singapore is welcoming so many Chinese immigrants from mainland China as they are ‘harder-driving’ and ‘harder-striving’ than Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>With the PRC immigrants flooding into the HDB heartlands and forming ethnic enclaves in certain estates like Kallang and Sengkang, such conflicts with native Singaporeans are likely to rise in the near future.</p>

              <p>Extracted from Stomp : Foreigners shoo family away from Botanic Gardens landmarks because they "booked it"</p>
              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>

              <p>The PRCs are everywhere these days serious</p>
              <p>I bet you, even they're creating trouble in crowded Hong Kong over giving birth. Lots of demo and crying on the streets begging for tolong over it. But do ppl in HK really care?</p>
              <p>HK govt has decided to stop allowing them to give birth over social issues, like what we're facing now.</p>

              <p>Curry itself is a very delicous dish. The PRC should accept our culture and way of life before getting us to accept them. This is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>multiracial</strong></span> country, not like China, which is biased against some race. So I think the PRC think they have special rights. They can go back to China and plant some crops.</p>

              <p>Well, they've to learn how unique every place is and appericiate for what it is.</p>
              <p>But history might say a diff pic for they used to be bullied by the West, a sense of mistrust.</p>
