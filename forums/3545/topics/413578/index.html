              <p>AN AMERICAN businessman is facing the prospect of being caned in 
              Singapore after overstaying his visa by almost half a year, court 
              documents and his lawyer said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>If convicted for violating Singapore's immigration laws, US 
              citizen Kamari Kenyada Charlton, 37, could become the first American in 
              16 years to be caned in the strict city-state.</p>
              <p>Kamari, who was born in the Bahamas, was arrested at Changi 
              Airport on Sept 1 when he was about to leave the country, his lawyer M. 
              Ravi said.</p>
              <p>A charge sheet issued against him seen by AFP said Kamari 
              had remained in Singapore for an extra 169 days after his three-month 
              social visit pass expired on March 15, 2010.</p>
              <p>Under Singapore laws, overstaying for more than 90 days is 
              punishable by a jail term not exceeding six months and a minimum three 
              strokes of the cane.</p>
              <p>Kamari, who runs a construction business in the Bahamas, is 
              currently on remand in a local prison, Mr Ravi said.</p>
              <p>He had entered Singapore on Dec 15 last year to accompany 
              his wife, who had come to the city-state seeking medical treatment for 
              her pregnancy.</p>
              <p>Mr Ravi appealed for a commutation of the American's 
              potential sentence to a fine, citing the case of a relative of Kamari's 
              wife who was fined S$500 for exceeding his visa by 194 days.</p>
              <p>But in a written response to Mr Ravi, the Attorney General's
               Chambers rejected the appeal 'after having carefully considered your 
              representations'. -- AFP</p>

              <p>The case has caught the attention of 
              US officials.</p>
              <p>'The US Embassy is closely monitoring the case and embassy officials 
              have provided consular assistance to this individual, including six 
              visits by consular officials,' a spokesman for the mission told AFP.</p>

              vandalism. -- AFP</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">US man on cheating charge</h1>
              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>AN AMERICAN accused of overstaying in Singapore was charged on Friday 
              with conspiracy to cheat an Australian in a phone scam.</p>
              <p>Kamari Kenyada Charlton, 37, is believed to have been 
              involved in similar cases and was remanded for further investigation.</p>
              <p>He was first charged in court early last month for 
              overstaying in Singapore for 169 days after his social visit pass 
              expired in mid-March.</p>
              <p>Charlton, who is in remand, is now charged with conspiring 
              with others in Singapore and elsewhere to cheat by making calls to Mr 
              Mirko Prskalo in Australia in March.</p>
              <p>He allegedly deceived Mr Prskalo into believing that his 
              nephew and family were in urgent need of funds while in Singapore, and 
              induced him to remit A$17,145 (S$21,821) on four occasions to him in 
              Singapore via the Western Union.</p>
              <p>His lawyer, Mr M. Ravi, is no longer acting for him. His new
               lawyers Hamidul Haq and Thong Chee Kun appeared for him in chambers at a
               pre-trial conference.</p>
              <p>The next pre-trial conference is on Friday.</p>
              <p>In an e-mail response to media queries, police said that a 
              police gazette for his arrest had been issued following a number of 
              criminal complaints made against him, including two through Interpol by a
               foreign Police agency.</p>
              <p>Charlton is currently being investigated for 
              cheating-related and money laundering offences arising from these 
              complaints.</p>
              <p>The complaints being investigated include alleged cheating 
              of elderly Australians, through a phone scam operation.</p>
