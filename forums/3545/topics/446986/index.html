              <p>First and foremost, Singaporeans have had bad historical records of complaint against their DHs. And not just constructive complaints, most were humiliation motivated.</p>
              <p>So I believed based on DHs shared experiences all over the island, where such bad experiences and issues they encountered from their local bosses were exchanged via word of mouth amongst themselves, they prefer foreigners than locals.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting those locals who deliberately issuing pay cuts unnecessarily to their DHs due to some sort of misunderstanding. Or even some who missed on paying their allowances frequently. Or those using money and other emotionally striked methods to control their DHs. Sometimes DHs were treated like slaves based on modern day settings - terrible.</p>
              <p>The instances mentioned above were those I discovered during casual discussion at a formal function where one of my acquantaince happened to run DH agency in Singapore.</p>
              <p>In addition, those prudent agencies of course would prefer the clients who complaint less or create issues lesser. Thus, making their DHs happier and everybody wins.<a class="tinymce_control" href="446986#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446986#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446986#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a><a class="tinymce_control" href="446986#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png?1212956094" alt="Emoticons"></a></p>

              <p>Ha ha ha ha</p>
              <p>This is such a hilarious post!!! Someone coming up with the audacity to blatantly ask for the permission to underpay and maltreat her maid, and at the same, making it a government policy.</p>
              <p>I am certainly glad that expats had come in to offer a better pay and better 'living' conditions for their domestic helps, making the locals having a run for their money. The competition has obviously taught you and many like yourself the inconsiderate, slave-driving culture and poor living conditions you offer and demand for.</p>
              <p>How silly it is to THINK FOR YOURSELF, instead of learning from the expats and doing what they do. Well perhaps the expats had shown more of a human side to themselves. I had seen the videos on youtube and heard from many of how the locals treat their domestic helpers.</p>
              <p>And here we have someone who is oblivious to both her stupidity and pride to request for a license to offer conditions below par to her domestic helper.</p>
              <p>Here is a simple solution - if you can't afford or have no friggin idea how to make living conditions comfortable for your domestic helper........DONT GET ONE!! AND STOP BEING SO LAZY TO PICK UP AFTER YOURSELF!!</p>
              <p>Oh btw........taking care of your kids.</p>
              <p>20 years down the road we will have a generation of children brought up by domestic maids cause of parents' neglect. Ha ha ha. HILARIOUS</p>
