              <p class="header"> <strong>HDB assures residents of marketing needs; reminds 
              Sheng Siong of wet market use</strong><br> <span class="update">By Wang Eng Eng | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 07 April 2010 1852 hrs </span></p>
              <p class="header"><span>SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) has assured 
              residents that it will ensure that their marketing needs are met in the 
              wake of the recent rent hike at five wet markets operated by Sheng 
              Siong. 
              <br> <br> The HDB said it has received feedback from local advisors and residents,
               expressing concerns over the rent hike.
              <br> <br> HDB said: "Besides these wet markets, there are also other markets and 
              supermarkets nearby.”
              <br> <br> It added that the presence of alternative facilities ensures that the 
              market produce are "competitively priced".
              <br> <br> The HDB said it has made clear its position to Sheng Siong which had 
              bought over the markets and increased rent by 30 per cent.
              <br> <br> The markets are located in Choa Chu Kang, Bukit Batok and Serangoon 
              North.
              <br> <br> The HDB said in approving the sale of these properties to Sheng Siong, 
              it specified that they must continue to be operated as wet markets.
              <br> <br> It also made clear that any change of use has to be subjected to HDB's 
              approval.
              <br> <br> The HDB said these properties will remain as wet markets as there is 
              still demand from the residents for these facilities.
              <br> <br> "HDB will not allow conversion of any of these properties from wet 
              markets to other uses even if all the stalls are vacated," it said.
              <br> <br> The HDB said it recognises that Sheng Siong is a private operator and 
              has the right to adjust the rent and tenancy terms.
              <br> <br> But it said Sheng Siong would face much difficulty attracting 
              stallholders if it charges excessive rent.
              <br> <br> "The stallholders who are compelled to set high prices for their produce
               because of the high rent may not be able to sustain their business in 
              the long term," it said.
              <br> <br> The HDB advised Sheng Siong to consider the operation of the wet markets
               on a long-term sustainable basis when making any rental or tenancy 
              adjustments.  
              <br> <br> So far, 90 per cent of the stallholders have decided to continue renting
               the stalls for one year. 
              <br> <br> When contacted by MediaCorp, Sheng Siong said it has no comments.  -

              <p><br>it's e new gen of markets.</p>
              <p>Those markets weren't runned by HDB in the 1st place back in the late 1980s. They were tendered out to private companies to run and managed. Happened so the prev owner sold it to SS.</p>
              <p>Tell MBT to stop raising property taxes in times like tis. Everyone would then start jacking up rent.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Right move in keeping wet markets</h1>
              <p>THE Housing Board is right in barring the conversion of six wet 
              markets ("Wet markets must stay - even if vacated", April 8) to other 
              uses.</p>
              <p>Many of these wet market stallholders are middle-aged or 
              older. If Sheng Siong was allowed to convert the wet markets for its 
              supermarket operations, what are the disenfranchised stallholders to do 
              to make a living?</p>
              <p>Some wet markets also enjoy a long history with their 
              customers. There is a bond between them.</p>
              <p>The wet market also has a unique atmosphere and feel. It is 
              bustling with activity and is alive with a cacophony of voices. It has a
               unique collection of smells. The supermarket, though, is completely 
              different.</p>
              <p>Let us work together to preserve these jewels of Singapore.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Why Sheng Siong should let wet markets stay</h1>
              <p>I READ with interest the letter by Mr Jeffrey Tan, 'Go hyper mart, 
              Sheng Siong' (April 14). I write to support his stand of keeping the wet
               market.</p>
              <p>Wet markets have become part of our lives. Our parents used 
              to take us there to shop. Housewives go there as they can bargain over 
              prices and chat with old friends who are stallholders. Many go there as 
              they trust the stallholders will give them fresher items.</p>
              <p>Also, the stallholders are friendlier than supermarket 
              workers. This makes people happier when they visit the wet market.</p>
              <p>Finally, closing the wet markets will put many people out of
               work. This is bad as it has a negative impact on the economy.</p>
              <p>To sum up, wet markets should not be closed as they are the 
              source of livelihood for the stallholders and an important part of many 
              people's lives.</p>

              <p>the gist of it all is that if the gabrament wants to sell the damned things to Sheng Siong, they should not go and try to hamstring Sheng Siong with a lot of conditions AFTER the sale...</p>
              <p>and if the idiot who runs the goddamned ministry sells the goddamned places (i think he's really <em>Mabok</em> and on some kinda drugs.. drugs which made him both <em>mabok</em> and stupid) is being paid millions, we're way overpaying him for making really really dumb decisions...</p>

              <p><strong>Sheng Siong wet markets see 5 new tenants despite rent rise</strong><br> <span class="update">By Jessica Yeo | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 17 May 2010 2119 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Five tenants have signed on with Sheng Siong despite 
              the 30 percent increase in rent at its wet markets from April, which saw
               14 tenants leaving.
              <br> <br> Two stalls at Yew Tee wet market were quickly snapped up after three 
              tenants left.
              <br> <br> Serangoon wet market saw two new tenants after the rental increase, 
              while Fajar saw one.
              <br> <br> Hawkers MediaCorp spoke to said their business can cover the increased 
              rent, and they did not intent to adjust the price of goods just yet.
              <br> <br> Sheng Siong said their prices are comparable with other wet markets.
              <br> <br> Sheng Siong will continue to scout for new tenants to replace those who 
              have left to keep the current rental fees stable.
