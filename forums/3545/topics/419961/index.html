              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Parliament has passed sweeping changes to the Women's Charter, which was
               last amended 15 years ago.<br><br>The key to the changes is making sure
               divorced men pay up to support their children and ex-wives.<br><br>Following
               the changes, a man who defaults on maintenance payments will have to go
               for financial counselling and do community service.<br><br>His 
              maintenance debts can also be reported to credit bureaus, which would 
              affect his credit worthiness.<br><br>And to protect kids, the court can 
              transfer matrimonial assets - divided between parents - to a Children's 
              Development Account.<br><br>Still, some MPs questioned if more can be 
              done, such as confiscating a spouse's travel documents, imposing curfews
               or even confiscating handphones.<br><br>But Community Development, 
              Youth and Sports Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said such sanctions would 
              be difficult to enforce.<br><br>Instead, the government has opted for 
              measures such as requiring those who re-marry to declare their 
              maintenance debts.<br><br>There were also calls for greater parity in 
              the treatment between men and women in issues related to a failed 
              marriage, such as access-to-children rights.<br><br>In reply, Dr 
              Balakrishnan made clear that just as men are expected to pay 
              maintenance, women should also comply fully to a court's access orders 
              and not use their children as bargaining chips.<br><br>The minister also
               explained why even after 50 years, the Women's Charter will not be 
              renamed to a more gender neutral "Family Charter" to reflect the 
              changing role of men and women in bringing up kids.<br><br>He said: "The
               brutal truth is even today after we have made much progress, women and 
              children still need protection. Furthermore, we also have to ask 
              ourselves whether as a society, have we reached a point where the 
              majority of us are willing to say that a woman has the responsibility to
               support a man after a divorce?<br><br>"I'm not sure outside this House 
              that a majority of people have come round to this view. So my sense is: 
              we will hold the current position but flag this up as a constant 
              review."<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
