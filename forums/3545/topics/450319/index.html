              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Deputy 
              Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean said 
              organisations which want to be creative must be mindful of the values of
               the races and religions in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Teo said this on the sidelines of a community event at Sengkang Community Club.<br><br>He
               was responding to a question from the media on the recent unhappiness 
              in the Catholic community caused by advertisements on the Escape Chapel 
              Party, which used posters featuring women in nun outfits.<br><br>"It is good for people to have fun and it is nice to have creative ideas," Mr Teo said. <br><br>"But
               I think it is totally possible to do that without denigrating what 
              others hold most dearly and who feel most strongly about. <br><br>"This is a multi-racial society, multi-religious society. Go out and have fun but don't do it at other people's expense."<br><br>Police are investigating if the organiser had put up insensitive advertisements that could have offended the Catholic faith.<br><br>The organiser had cancelled the event, which was to take place on Saturday at Chijmes.<br><br>- CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>A place of worship should not suffer disrespect- this lovely Cathedral/chapel and former convent has great heritage value and religious  history should not have been turned into an F &amp; B and entertainment  fun place(HUB)  in the first place</p>
              <p>Teo should have had a word with URA! That place was a respectable
              convent with a chapel-why did they turn it into tourist shops,
              restuarants, cafes and pubs to start with? We must all (including URA
              AND SLA) learn to respect values, religion and heritage!</p>

              <p> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dialects are vulgar, polluting and associated with the uneducated;</span></span></strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mandarin is refined</span></span></strong> and part of the literary culture. Mr. Rabim Ishak, then Senior Minister of State (Foreign Affairs) noted the vulgarity associated with dialects in a speech where he noted that he learnt swear words in Cantonese, Hokkien, Teochew and Hainanese whereas in Mandarin, the swear words were less common and was a language for the refined people” (ST, 11 July 1980).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Dialects are divisive, fragmentary and a major cause of miscommunication and misunderstanding</span></span></strong>; Mandarin is the language of unity, cohesion and a bridge between the different members of the Chinese Community. Goh Chok Tong, then Second Defence and Health Minister, pointed out at the opening ceremony of the SMC in his constituency that “The spoken and written form in Mandarin are in unison and do not create problems, unlike dialects where one word can have several meanings depending on the dialect it is spoken in” (ST, 9 June 1981).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Dialects are a burden on the young</span></span></strong>, forcing them to learn two languages when they go to school; Mandarin facilitates academic success. Lee Kuan Yew argued that “dialect will hinder the learning of the child if he uses dialect … <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">to speak dialect with your child is to ruin his future”</span></span></strong> (ST, 17 November 1980).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>- <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dialects have no value, neither culturally nor economically</span></span></strong>; Mandarin is linked to a 5000-year old history, rich in culture and bears immense economic potential with the opening up of China’s market. Lee Kwan Yew stressed that unlike Mandarin which “has cultural value and will also have economic value twenty years later,” <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">dialects “have no economic value in Singapore. Their cultural value is also very low”</span></span></strong> (ST, 17 October 1980).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> Dialects represent the past and are primitive</span></span></strong>; Mandarin is the future. Lee Kwan Yew in a television forum argued, “Mandarin is a developing language; on the other hand,<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> dialect is a stagnant language</span></span></strong>” (ST, 10 January 1980).</p>
