              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: An 
              internal inquiry is ongoing to examine if there were lapses or 
              negligence in the case of two foreigners who absconded while on bail.<br><br>They
               were part of three who were being charged with assaulting a Singaporean
               outside Suntec City Convention Centre in April 2010.<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said the inquiry will be completed next month.<br><br>He
               also told Parliament on Thursday that warrants of arrest have been 
              issued against Robert Dahlberg and Robert James Springall who left 
              Singapore.<br><br>Police are now working closely with Interpol to locate
               the men, but whether they can be extradited would depend on whether 
              Singapore has an extradition treaty with the country they have fled to.<br><br>Mr
               Teo, who is also the Home Affairs Minister, added that regardless of 
              nationality, all accused persons are asked to surrender their passport 
              as a condition for bail.<br><br>This bail is set higher for those who 
              are likely to abscond and this is assessed based on factors such as the 
              gravity of the offence and the extent of the person's roots in 
              Singapore, the behaviour of the accused person in the course of 
              investigations and whether the person had attempted to abscond 
              previously.<br><br>But some felt more could be done to ensure accused foreigners do not escape Singapore in the first place.<br><br>MP
               for Marine Parade GRC Tin Pei Ling said: "In foreigners' instances, 
              they definitely do not have deep ties with Singapore and the likelihood 
              of them fleeing Singapore is definitely high. <br><br>"So will the 
              ministry consider putting in a standard operating procedure or a law to 
              ensure that regardless of the characteristics or the risk of this person
               is, that the passport be impounded till the court has made a decision 
              whether to acquit the accused or to charge the accused further because 
              as shown in this instance, the foreigners have fled and this have led 
              the victims left in Singapore feeling very unjust about what had 
              happened to them."<br><br>Mr Teo said: "This case illustrates the  
              challenges of ensuring that accused persons, whether they are 
              Sinagporeans or foreigners facing trial, do not abscond.<br><br>"As they
               have not yet been convicted of a crime, the presumption of innocence 
              limits how far we can restrict their movements. And ultimately the 
              discretion rests with the courts to decide whether an accused person 
              should be allowed to leave jurisdiction, taking into account submissions
               by both the prosecution and the defence.<br><br>"So the accused, as Ms 
              Tin has pointed out, has not been convicted yet. Of course if he has 
              been convicted, then that's quite clear cut. But if he has not been 
              convicted yet, then we have to balance the different requirements."<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              Ways in which  ang mohs can jump bail even when their passport are retained by the police.
                  __________________________________________________________________________
                  1) get their relatives or siblings to  come in with  their  passport to Singapore. Then with  passsport of a sibling  or  relative ...book a ticket and get thro immigration with friends and or family as a group into JB or Batam - Then take a flight from there to where-ever! Simple as that! Meantime  the foreigner declares lost passport( after the man has already jumped bail) at his own embassy and get another replacement for onward travel home!
                  
                  2) Disguise as a women Like Mas selamat !
