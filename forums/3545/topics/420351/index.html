              <p><em>Students at several tertiary institutions will have to pay higher tuition fees this year. (Yahoo! photo)</em></p>
              <p>School fees will increase starting this year, announced several tertiary institutions in Singapore on Friday.</p>
              <p>The institutions are <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+university+of+singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">National University of Singapore </a>(NUS), <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=nanyang+technological+university&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Nanyang Technological University </a>(NTU), the five <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=polytechnic&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">polytechnics</a> as well as <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=institute+of+technical+education&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Institutes of Technical Education </a>(ITEs).</p>
              <p><strong>NUS, NTU</strong></p>
              <p>According to <em>The Straits Times (ST)</em>, both NUS and NTU will increase tuition fees for its undergraduate and postgraduate courses from this year.</p>
              <p>Annual tuition fees for most undergraduate courses for Academic Year 
              (AY) 2011 at NUS will increase by 4 per cent, representing an annual 
              increase of 1.6 per cent over four years.</p>
              <p>For those enrolled in Architecture, Business, Law, Music, Nursing and
               Pharmacy courses, fees will go up by 6 per cent, which works out to an 
              annual icnerase of 2.3 per cent over four years.</p>
              <p>Those enrolled in graduate courses (coursework or research) will have
               to pay fees adjusted upwards by 6 per cent, with the exception of 
              Nursing students.</p>
              <p>In subsequent years, fees for the AY2011 intake will be increased by 3
               per cent annually for the course duration. The school’s existing 
              graduate students will also be subject to a 3 per cent increase annually
               for the remaining course duration.</p>
              <p>Over at NTU, incoming undergraduates will also see a 4 per cent 
              increase of fees, representing an annual increase of over 1.6 per cent 
              over four years. Those enrolled in Business programmes will see a 6 per 
              cent increase.</p>
              <p>Existing NTU students will not be affected by the revision. Returning
               National Servicemen will also enjoy tuition fees based on the year they
               were admitted into the University.</p>
              <p>For the incoming postgraduate students (coursework and research), 
              fees will be adjusted upwards by 6 pre cent for AY2011. In 
              subsequent years, fees for AY2011 students will be increased by 3% each 
              year for the remaining duration of their course.</p>
              <p>Both universities said the increase in tuition fees also reflect a 
              greater differentiation in fees paid by Singapore citizens, permanent 
              residents (PRs) and international students.</p>
              <p>PRs and international students admitted to NUS in AY2011 are subject 
              to fees between $480 and $2,180 higher than the existing rates for PRs 
              and between $970 and $3,720 more than the existing annual rates for 
              international students.</p>
              <p>PRs and International Students admitted to NTU in AY2011 will have to
               pay between $700 and $1,320 more than current fee rates for PR, and 
              between $1,140 and $2,180 more than existing annual rates for 
              international students.</p>
              <p><strong>Polytechnics</strong></p>
              <p>A joint statement issued by the five local polytechnics said fees 
              will increase by 2.3 per cent, or $50 to $2,220 annually, according to <em>Channel NewsAsia (CNA)</em>.</p>
              <p>Nanyang Polytechnic, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic will also be increasing tuition fees for existing <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=polytechnic-foreign+specialised+institution&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Polytechnic-Foreign Specialised Institution </a>(Poly-FSI)
               degree courses by 3 per cent in the new academic year. This means, 
              Singapore Citizen students will pay between S$4,980 and S$8,290 
              annually.</p>
              <p>Both new and existing students will be subject to the fee revision.</p>
              <p>The polytechnics explained, the fee hike is necessary to help defray 
              the cost of delivering a high quality education. They added, they will 
              continue to rely on a substantial subsidy from the government to cope 
              with the bulk of their costs.</p>
              <p>International and PR students will be harder-hit by the increase in fees, according to the polytechnics.</p>
              <p>For new PR students, fees will increase by between $480 and $810; 
              for new international students, fees will go up by between $840 and 
              $1,580. Existing PRs and international students will also pay higher 
              fees.</p>
              <p><strong>Institutes of Technical Education (ITE)</strong></p>
              <p>Fees at the ITEs will also increase, reported <em>CNA</em>.</p>
              <p>New and existing students, who are Singapore citizens pursuing 
              Nitec and Higher Nitec courses, will pay $10 more each year. Technical 
              Engineer Diploma course fees will also go up by $50 per year to $2,200.</p>
              <p>New students, who are permanent residents,will pay between $970 and 
              $1,760 more, while foreigners will pay between $1,040 and $1,820 more.</p>
              <p>Existing foreign and PR students will pay higher fees but it is based on the existing fee differentiation framework, reported <em>CNA</em>.</p>
              <p><strong>Financial assistance</strong></p>
              <p>The polytechnics and universities said there are sufficient financial
               assistance schemes in place to ensure no student will be denied the 
              opportunity of a an education.</p>
              <p>NTU will set aside S$5.65 million in financial aid in AY2011.</p>
              <p>NTU Professor Er Meng Hwa, Senior Associate Provost in charge of 
              undergraduate education said, ” For Singaporean students, the existing 
              aid schemes will cover all their tuition fees, as well as between 60 per
               cent and 100 per cent of their living expenses, subject to qualifying 
              criteria.”</p>
              <p>“For needy students who are permanent residents, the existing schemes
               will ensure that 100 per cent of their tuition fees are covered. For 
              international students, they cover about 85 per cent,” he added.</p>
              <p>NUS also has a range of financial assistance schemes including 
              Tuition Fee Loan, NUS Study Loan, NUS/MOE Bursary, Work-Study Assistance
               and the NUS Student Assistance Loan.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/14/tertiary-educational-institutions-raise-school-fees/"><br>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/14/tertiary-educational-institutions-raise-school-fees/</a></p>
