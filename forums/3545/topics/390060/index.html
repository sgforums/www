              <p><strong>SM Goh speaks on opposition's strategy</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 04 February 2010 2308 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said the opposition will
              focus on policies which they think are not working for Singapore. <br> <br> He was asked to comment on reports that opposition parties want to
              contest in Tampines GRC with the plan to turn growing concerns over the
              affordability of public housing into an election issue.
              <br> <br> National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan is an MP there.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh also noted that the opposition is trying to win one GRC or one or two single seats.
              <br> <br> He added that the ruling People's Action Party would have to convince the voters that the policies of the government are right. 
              <br> <br>Mr Goh added: "Housing prices have gone up but is this the work of
              the minister or is it a wrong policy? Or is it the demand for housing
              is so high? And the answer lies in liquidity. There is so much
              liquidity in Singapore and the interest rate is so low. So anybody who
              can borrow money from the bank, think they can just hop to property and
              make a killing. But there is a danger. When the interest rate goes up
              sometime in the future, are you able to service your loan? Most people
              don't think that way.
              <br> <br>“You can target on such policies but the voters got to ask
              themselves are you just criticising without offering an alternative
              solution. If they can criticise and offer a superior alternative which
              the voters believe in, of course the opposition will be in a strong
              position to win over votes. <br> <br> “You criticise without an alternative solution and sometimes you
              criticise without giving the full facts and the context. It is our job
              to point out that you are just giving wrong information and giving
              figures out of context. So this is the debate.
              <br> <br>"One must expect the opposition to try and find fault with our
              policies but we will be able to defend our policies quite well. That is
              the nature of this contest." <br> <br> Turning to problems being faced by the Malay community in Singapore, Mr Goh emphasised that there were national problems. 
              <br> <br> Mr Goh explained: "Their performance in Mathematics, in education,
              dysfunctional families is not peculiar to the Malay community. But for
              the Malay community, the sense of proportion of the whole community is
              higher. <br> <br> “It may be double what we see for the Chinese population or the Indian
              population. We got to attend to the problem in two ways. One on the
              national basis, the national policies must be right and also resources
              must be given to solve the national problems. <br> <br> At the community level, that is outreach and implementation. How do you
              reach out to dysfunctional families? I still believe that using Muslim
              leaders will be more effective that using a Christian leader to reach
              out to the Muslim family on their problems.”
              <br> <br>Senior Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Zainul Abidin Rasheed
              added: "It is nothing like having the Malay-Muslim leaders themselves
              being engaged in this and Dr Yaacob and the Muslim leaders in fact with
              all the Malay-Muslim organisations are on hand. <br> <br> “They are working through the community leadership forum to work out
              programmes. We are approaching them squarely and being honest about it
              and we want to tackle as much as we can. We have made much progress.” -
