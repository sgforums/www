              <p>The reason why we are not having children is the ever rising
              costs of living.Couples both have to work and no mood to procreate
              cos of work stress or heavy workload.Like that,who would dare to
              have children?There are also FTs waiting to pounce on our jobs too
              cos they are so called cheaper,faster and better.Even if we have
              kids,they also face competition from kids of FTs.From the young to

Latest estimates from the <span class="caps" style="border-image: initial; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;">UN</span> Population Division suggest that total world population, which now stands at just over 4 billion, will touch 6 billion by the end of the century.</p>

The population ‘explosion’, it was argued, was wiping out any economic development which the developing countries managed to achieve. ‘No other problem casts a darker shadow over the prospects for international development than the staggering growth of population,’ said the Pearson Commission Report on ‘Co-operation for Development’, published in 1970.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: Cambria, 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', Palatino, 'Book Antiqua', Georgia, serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: #f4f3f2; border: 0px initial initial;">But as the decade progressed this view began to give ground under repeated attacks from a Third World which was profoundly suspicious of the convenient Western argument which laid the blame for poverty at the feet of the improvident poor.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; border-image: initial; font-size: 15px; font-family: Cambria, 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', Palatino, 'Book Antiqua', Georgia, serif; vertical-align: baseline; line-height: 21px; text-align: -webkit-auto; background-color: #f4f3f2; border: 0px initial initial;">The counter-argument ran like this. Large families and rapid population growth are in themselves a result of poverty. In the absence of social security, unemployment pay, sickness benefits and old age pensions, poor people need children to look after them when they are out of work, sick or old. Secondly, the millions of poor people who live in the rural areas of the Third World need children to help with the daily ‘survival’ jobs of collecting wood and water and looking after animals, which commonly take up to twelve hours a day every day and which children can and do perform throughout the developing world.</p>
