              <p>By 
              																				Shivali Nayak, Multimedia Journalist</p>
              <p>THE Association of Women for Action and Research's (Aware) call for 
              greater women representation in parliament has made some headway in the 
              last 10 years. The number of women in parliament doubled from 12 per 
              cent in 2001 to 24.5 per cent today.</p>
              <p>Singapore also saw its first female Minister, Mrs Lim Hwee 
              Hua, sworn in in 2009. Mrs Lim is Minister in the Prime Minister's 
              Office and Second Minister for Finance and Transport.</p>
              <p>However, Aware's push for 30 per cent women representation 
              in parliament and 3 women ministers by 2005 has yet to be achieved. This
               is one of the challenges that remains for the 25-year-old advocacy 
              group. First started in 1985, it has now grown into a 600-member strong 
              organisation.</p>
              <p>Its members met last Saturday at the 'Women's choices, 
              women's lives: Shaping the next 25 years' conference, where they put 
              their heads together to discuss what needs to be done in the next 25 
              years.</p>
              <p>Aware hopes that paternity leave will be mandatory so 
              fathers can be more involved in parenting, as well as the complete 
              abolishment of marital rape acceptance. It will also find more ways to 
              render support to working mothers as well as look into the needs of 
              elderly women.</p>

              <p><strong>Gender discrimination must end for Singapore to flourish, says AWARE</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 08 March 2011 1720 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE) says for all the 
              progress made in the last 25 years, gender discrimination still exists 
              in Singapore today. <br><br>This, it said, was the unanimous view of 
              about 200 participants at the Women's Choices, Women's Lives: Shaping 
              the Next 25 Years conference last Saturday.<br><br>In a statement 
              Tuesday, AWARE said this discrimination must be eradicated and gender 
              equity achieved if Singapore is to truly flourish in the next 25 years 
              and if the challenges of the low fertility rate and the ageing 
              population are to be tackled effectively.<br><br>It is pushing for a 
              quota of 30 per cent to be set for women in Parliament as recommended by
               the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
              Against Women (CEDAW), which was ratified by Singapore in 1995.<br><br>While this has not been achieved, greater women representation in Parliament has made some headway in the last 10 years. <br><br>The number of women in parliament doubled from 12 per cent in 2001 to 24.5 per cent today. <br><br>Singapore also saw its first female Minister, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, sworn in in 2009. <br><br>Mrs Lim is Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and Transport. <br><br>AWARE is also calling for an independent body to be formed to ensure equal opportunities for both women and men.<br><br>It
               also wants all policies and legislation to be reviewed and all gender 
              discriminatory laws, policies and practices to be removed or replaced 
              with laws, policies and practices that promote an equitable and 
              sustainable work-life balance for both women and men.<br><br>AWARE also recommends that gender studies be added to the core curriculum for all students, and in the Civil Service.<br><br>The recommendations are part of a 100 point wish list submitted by participants during the conference. <br><br>AWARE says it will submit finalised recommendations to policy makers and other stakeholders.<br><br>- CNA/cc</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>AWARE is a noble organization but it must update itself with the present times and conduct deeper sociological studies to find out why certain areas lack women for example.</p>
              <p>This does not have anything to do with discrimination.</p>
              <p>Seriously I dont think that the present modern era still has gender discrimination.</p>
              <p>So AWARE need to figure out if there exists a deeper sociological reason and if there is indeed gender differentiation and specialization.</p>
              <p>For instance in a typical nursing class, there is an over-representation of women and under-representation of males. But I would never say that discrimination has anything to do with it.</p>
              <p>I would say nursing is an example of manifestation of gender differentitation and specialization.</p>
              <p>So AWARE need to decide if indeed there is such a case and how much should this be accepted or not accepted, or is it necessary to push and tweak this natural phenomenon.</p>
              <p>In trying to achieve numerical targets, AWARE also need to think about how to go about promoting it. Should it push for artificial forced measures such as affirmative action and quota reserves ? Or, should it be done from the education and campaign angle. This is something AWARE need to consider and should be careful about, and not to create more harm instead of good.</p>
              <p>I would say that today's society has evolved a lot and gender discrimination is almost totally vanished. AWARE can be said is a legacy organization. It must decide whether it can update itself to remain relevant and pertinent to today's era, or become obsolete and backward looking. Since now emancipation is already established, and it is not 1960s anymore, AWARE should not keep rehasing the battles of yesteryears. Some things such as campaign for paternity leave is more positive and constructive because it takes a holistic approach and is embracing everyone in the family and is not so focused on just the woman alone, and besides it tackles the modern contemporary issues of dual-working couples and low birth rate, etc. I believe this should be the general direction AWARE take, because fighting just for women's rights only is almost obsolete and non-relevant.</p>
