              <p>AsiaOne - 14 Feb 2010</p>
              <p>Email scams have made an appearance in our inboxes, or more recently, our spam folders, on a regular basis since the beginnings of the Internet.</p>
              <p>We look at email scams from around the world, and what are the measures cyber criminals are willing to take to make us part with our money.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Scam 5 - The Assassination Email</span></strong></p>
              <p>The email is allegedly sent by an 'assassin' who warns the recipient that he or she was made a target by a close friend or colleague.</p>
              <p>To ensure that one's life is safe, the 'assassin' demands a certain amount of money from the recipient and warns the victim against making a police report.</p>
              <p><em>Attn,</em></p>
              <p><em>I am very sorry for you, is a pity that this is how your life is going to end as soon as you don't comply. As you can see we are the members of the Deadly Networks in the world, which is responsible for the bombing of twin tower's in America on Sept. 11th and the bombing of London transport services on July 7th (AL-QUAEDA NETWORKS), I don't have any business with you, my duty as I am mailing you now is just to KILL you and I have to do it as I have already been paid for that.</em></p>
              <p><em>Someone whom you called your friend wants you dead by all means, and this person have spent a lot of money in this venture, This person came to us and told me that he wanted you dead and he provided us with your name, picture and other necessary information we needed about you.</em></p>
              <p><em>So I sent my boys to track you down this including bugging of your phones with satellite tracking devices and they have carried out the necessary investigation we needed for the operation on you, and if you doubt this information am going to give you all the necessary information about you back to you in your next reply so that you can believe me, and my boys are really on you but I told them not to kill you that I will like to contact you and see if your life is important to you and the one of your family.</em></p>
              <p><em>I called my client back and ask him of your email address which I didn't tell him what I wanted to do with it and he gave it to me and I am using it to contact you now. As I am writing you this mail my men are monitoring you and they are telling me everything about you.</em></p>
              <p><em>Now do you want to LIVE OR DIE? Since all program has be made and draw to kill you. Get back to me now if you are ready to pay some fees to spare your Life, $15,000 is all you need to spend in this process you will first of all Pay $8,000 and then I will send a tape to you which I recorded in every discussion I had with the person who wanted you dead and as soon as<br>you get the Tape, You will pay the remaining balance of $7,000. If you are not ready for my help, then I will carry on with my job straight-up.</em></p>
              <p><em>WARNING: DO NOT THINK OF CONTACTING THE POLICE OR EVEN TELLING ANYONE BECAUSE I WILL KNOW ,REMEMBER, SOMEONE WHO KNOWS YOU VERY WELL WANT YOU DEAD!</em></p>
              <p><em>I WILL EXTEND IT TO YOUR FAMILY, IN CASE I NOTICE SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT YOUR TELLING THE SECURITY ABOUT IT BECAUSE A GOOD LOOK IS OUT YOU AT THE MOMENT.</em></p>
              <p><em>DO NOT COME OUT ONCE IT IS 7PM UNTIL I MAKE OUT TIME TO SEE YOU AND GIVE YOU THE TAPE OF ALL DISCUSSION WITH THE PERSON WHO WANT YOU DEAD THEN YOU CAN USE IT TO TAKE ANY LEGAL ACTION. GOOD LUCK AS I AWAIT YOUR REPLY</em></p>
