              <p>By 
              																				Khushwant Singh</p>
              <p>THE latest offender to be jailed for involvement in an insurance scam 
              involving fake personal injury accident claims by phantom passengers, is
               ex-cabby Lim Mui Chin.</p>
              <p>The 55-year-old was on Tuesday, jailed two months for 
              falsely declaring that Peter Lim Aik Kee, 51, was the passenger injured 
              in a collision with a car at an Ang Mo Kio car park on May 11, 2008.</p>
              <p>This was to support Peter's claim of $7,344 from insurer 
              NTUC Income for injuries sustained in the accident. No money was paid 
              out as the insurance agency learnt from the other driver involved in the
               accident that the passengers in the taxi were a Malay couple and not a 
              Chinese man.</p>
              <p>Police were then called in and Lim admitted to conspiring 
              with Peter and Phang Choon Meng, 38, to cheat NTUC Income. Lim, who 
              pleaded guilty on Jan 18, will start his prison sentence on Monday as he
               wishes to celebrate Chinese New Year with his family.</p>
              <p>Peter was jailed for two months in December 2010 while Phang
               is expected to be sentenced on Tuesday. At least 13 other phantom 
              passengers have been dealt with. Four were placed on probation for 
              between 15 and 18 months while four others were jailed between two and 
              six months.</p>
              <p>The district court heard that Lim met Peter and Phang at a 
              coffee shop in Sin Ming when he brought his taxi to a workshop there for
               repairs after the accident. After learning about the mishap, Phang 
              suggested that Peter could stand in as a phantom passenger and submit a 
              false injury claim since no particulars were taken from the real 
              passengers. If the claim was successful, Phang promised to give Peter 
              $1,000. Pleading for leniency, defence counsel Adrian Wee said Lim was 
              not promised any money and had played a 'very small role' in the 
              conspiracy.</p>
