              <h1 class="storyheadline">Don't let ornamental fish trade die out</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Saturday's report, 'Ornamental fish trade in danger of 
              drying up'. It struck an emotional chord in me as I felt I was about to 
              witness the gradual but sure extermination of a 'made-in-Singapore' 
              international product.</p>
              <p>Even though the ornamental fish industry is worth a lot and 
              businesses are apparently thriving, the actions of the Government seem 
              to indicate reluctance to support this industry further. The short land 
              lease coupled with a serious shortfall in land allocation to compensate 
              them for their eviction will surely drive them to extinction.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the Government prefers to focus on knowledge-based 
              industries it deems have better prospects or are more prestigious such 
              as biomedicine. However, instead of sidelining other industries deemed 
              less favourable, it should actively nurture growing small and 
              medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to have a more balanced mix.</p>
              <p>Moreover, the ornamental fish industry in Singapore has 
              already created a niche - which is growing - in the world market, and 
              has positioned itself as part of a globally prestigious Singapore brand 
              which offers variety, quantity and quality of goods. It would be a shame
               if this branded 'made-in-Singapore' product was no longer offered in 
              the international market.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, supportive government intervention will send a 
              positive signal to a potentially huge pool of entrepreneurs eager to try
               their hand in a different industry. More would be inclined to venture 
              out, knowing the Government is fully supportive of its people and their 
              businesses.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Move ornamental fish industry to Iskandar zone</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Saturday's report on the land resource dilemma of 
              Singapore's ornamental fish industry along Jalan Kayu ('Ornamental fish 
              trade in danger of drying up').</p>
              <p>The report puzzled me as such a strategic relocation would 
              presumably have been planned way ahead by the authorities and companies 
              involved.</p>
              <p>I surmise that either the players are still having a hard 
              time finding an alternative base or there is an ongoing debate on how to
               further develop the industry in an industrialised Singapore.</p>
              <p>Either way, I have a suggestion on similar challenges to 
              land-intensive and natural resource-based industries. I believe these 
              primary resource industries are knowledge-based, high value-added and 
              intellectual property-rich. Therefore, they should be given strong 
              support and guidance, regardless of size of companies or levels of 
              fragmentation.</p>
              <p>I recently visited Johor state's Iskandar Development Region
               as part of a trade delegation hosted by the Malaysian Trade Commission 
              here. Iskandar's Nusajaya seemed to me an ideal alternative for 
              land-based industries.</p>
              <p>Have any studies have been made of a relocation of our 
              manufacturing sectors there? There are already many schools, housing, 
              medical and retail amenities in Iskandar. Most fish industry workers are
               from Malaysia. Moving there would help reduce our dependence on 
              imported labour. Moreover, we can focus on moving up the productivity 
              chain of the remaining sectors in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Beyond high level cooperation and business-to-business links
               to build hard infrastructure there, it would do our companies good if a
               framework was drawn up for specific industries to benefit from the 
              region's increasing integration.</p>
