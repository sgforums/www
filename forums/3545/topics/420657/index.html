              <p>AS A pedestrian, I have observed that many drivers in Singapore expect
               pedestrians to give way to them. For example, when they are reversing 
              or when they are driving out from a small lane into a main road, they 
              expect pedestrians to wait and let them go first before crossing the 
              road.</p>
              <p>One morning, my husband and I were crossing a small lane and
               the driver of a BMW almost drove into us. The driver was angry, wound 
              down his car window and said: "There is no traffic light here." The 
              driver did not think that he was in the wrong even though he did not 
              stop before the stop line.</p>
              <p>I would like the Traffic Police to clarify who - the driver 
              or the pedestrian - should give way in such a case. Or better still, 
              provide a general rule of thumb, for example, that drivers must always 
              look out for pedestrians and give way to them.</p>
              <p>Many pedestrians themselves perpetuate the misconception 
              that drivers have right of way at all times out of sheer fear for their 
              own safety.</p>
              <p>The Traffic Police should explain and highlight whether the 
              driver or pedestrian has right of way on roads where there are "no 
              traffic lights".</p>
              <p>And more importantly, I urge them to launch an educational campaign on giving way to pedestrians.</p>
              <p>Over time, I hope we can see real change in the way we drive in Singapore and develop genuine respect for one another's safety.</p>

              <p>She can have the right of the way if the car approaches at 100km/hr.</p>

              <p>how about pedestrians not being idiots?</p>
              <p>KNN the other day, i was driving slowly in a carpark.. some old dude walks and stops quarter-way into the lane.. so i slow down even further and have to drive to avoid him so much so that my car is about a foot into the other lane..</p>
              <p>what does that old dude do when i'm about to pass him? he suddenly lurches forward and i had to e-brake at about 10km/h..</p>
              <p>guy still stared at me as if it was all my fault!</p>

              <p>It takes both hands to clap.</p>
              <p>On my part, I've had cars barreling down on me and nearly knocking me down.</p>
              <p>Once, one farker nearly knocked me down and horned at me when I was crossing the zebra crossing late at night. I had already taken all reasonable precautions like continuously looking out for traffic while crossing and wearing bright luminous running attire (I was out running, but I was walking at the zebra crossing). His passenger was probably busy blowing him when he nearly knocked me down.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I've also seen stupid idiots who suka-suka cross the road without trying to look out for traffic and treating the street as their grandfather's road. Living at Marine Parade, I very often see this with idiotic teen beach goers who yaya cross the road at Marine Crescent without bothering to look out for traffic.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day? We all have our role to play.</p>
