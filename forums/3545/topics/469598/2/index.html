              <p>agree, your post really made us think for the future of the next generation, all they get is the electronic world but never the nature. There is a syndrome for kids that is due to lact of nature element in their life. It's also difficult to educate them to get out to play outdoor and get dirty. </p>
              <p>Guess our government has that thought in mind and thus, closing down the kiln. </p>
              <p>Nothing much we can do right?=(</p>

              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore's two remaining dragon kilns, run
               by Thow Kwang Industry and Focus Ceramic Services, have had their 
              tenancies extended by three years.</p>
              <p>And further renewals after the leases expire are on the cards.</p>
              <p>The kilns, which are used to produce earthenware, were brought to Singapore by Chinese immigrants.</p>
              <p>When the ceramic industry was in its heyday in the 1940s to 1970s, there were more than 20 dragon kilns in the country.</p>
              <p>The extension of the two remaining kilns came about as a result of support from the National Heritage Board.</p>
              <p>National
               Heritage Board's Group Director (Policy), Alvin Tan, said: "These 
              dragon kilns are of artistic value, because firstly, they are used by 
              the local artists to provide a kind of a unique glaze to their works, 
              and secondly, dragon kiln pottery is actually a unique aspect of 
              Singapore's pottery heritage."</p>
