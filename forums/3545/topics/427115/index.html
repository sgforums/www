            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>The rising cost of living is fast becoming the second  biggest 
              concern — next to jobs and earnings — among Singaporeans, who  will go 
              to the polls this year.</p>
              <p>Last week they received more bad news. Electricity  costs will rise 
              by 6.5 percent this month and a major oil firm will put up  petrol 
              prices at the pump.</p>
              <p>These are the latest of a string of price increases  that have been 
              ploughing through the city heartland, often  uncontrollably, and a few 
              of them by substantial margins.</p>
              <p>The whole thing is now like dominos going down, with one price hike leading to another.</p>
              <p>For example, more cafes and restaurants are charging  diners up to 
              S$1 for a glass of water, and one bicycle shop in Tampines  is 
              reportedly charging cyclists 50 cents for pumping air into tyres.</p>
              <p>In the heartland, it sometimes takes on laughable  proportions, with 
              some hawkers imposing an additional charge on  customers who want a bit 
              more sauce, ketchup or chilli.</p>
              <p>The most damaging are big-ticket items like healthcare and homes, public transport, cars, petrol and, of course, foodstuff.</p>
              <p>Few things — big or small — are spared for long. Sooner  or later 
              rentals will go up and vendors will charge more to make up for  that.</p>
              <p>A random look at the press showed a wide range of  products and 
              services being affected — from school bus fees to baby  food, from car 
              insurance to curry puffs.</p>
              <p>In the past, the government had managed inflation well,  keeping 
              costs very low despite the island's dependency on the outside  world for
               oil, commodities and food.</p>
              <p>But in the past five years (except for the recession), inflation has made life tough for the average wage earner.</p>
              <p>A big factor was the sharp rises in energy, commodity and food price worldwide.</p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans attribute the rising prices to the  government's 
              "grow at all costs" strategy and its mass intake of  foreigners within a
               short period, which strained resources.</p>
              <p>"I think a large part of the inflation in Singapore is  induced by 
              government policy," said Leong Wai Ho, senior regional  economist, 
              Barclays Capital.</p>
              <p>He was referring to the COE system, in which a person  has to bid for
               a Certificate of Entitlement (with a 10-year life span)  before he can 
              buy a new car in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Currently, the COE for a car ranges from S$40,000 to S$60,000 depending on capacity, after rising to incredible levels.</p>
              <p>"If you take that away, inflation will be Singapore (sic) is much more manageable," Leong added.</p>
              <p>A writer said: "The cost of living is growing, fuelled  by demand 
              from an enlarged populace for scarce resources, as well as  higher 
              government taxes and fees."</p>
              <p>During Singapore's brief post-independence history,  residents of 
              this small island, which has few natural resources, have  been 
              conditioned to deal with the occasional price spasm.</p>
              <p>When times were good, these could be shrugged away. This year, it appears harder to limit the damage than before.</p>
              <p>The current crisis appears more fundamental and lasting.</p>
              <p>In fact, it may become a structured feature in cosmopolitan Singapore.</p>
              <p>I believe that many aspects may have been due to our ambition to become a metropolis for the rich and talented.</p>
              <p>This means prices are no longer determined only by supply and demand.</p>
              <p>With the world's highest increase in the proportion of  millionaires,
               and massive foreign funds coming in, Singapore has been  transformed 
              for good.</p>
              <p>People can forget about prices falling back to pre-inflation levels, barring a calamity.</p>
              <p>The plague of 5 percent-5.5 percent inflation is eating into people's salaries and savings.</p>
              <p>"I'm worried because my bank savings, which fetch only  interest of 
              0.15%, are losing out," a housewife lamented. "When you  save, you lose;
               don't invest, even worse."</p>
              <p>Those who have mandatory retirement savings will be similarly affected.</p>
              <p>Their CPF (Central Provident Fund) ordinary account pays them only 2.5 percent a year.</p>
              <p>"With this inflation, all citizens' CPF will depreciate in value before we can even use it.</p>
              <p>"The payout (on retirement) will probably be enough only for daily coffee expenses," a surfer said.</p>
              <p>A chief investment officer commented: "We are likely to  see 
              increasing inflationary pressures in the quarters and years to  come."</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are particularly concerned about the possible decline of their CPF money which must follow any prolonged inflation.</p>
              <p>The fear is very real and strong in many families.</p>
              <p>Will the public's concern affect the election results? I believe it will, to some extent.</p>
              <p>TODAY newspaper, which recently surveyed heartland voters on this subject, reported:</p>
              <p>"From basic necessities to hawker meals, from holidays  to that new 
              car, from healthcare bills to expenses related to starting  and raising a
               family, it seems that Singaporeans are certainly feeling  the pinch of 
              higher prices."</p>
              <p>It found 40 percent of poorer Singaporeans (income from nil to  
              S$2,000 a month) replied that the rising living costs would affect how  
              they would vote.</p>
              <p>Among those earning S$2,001-S$6,000, six in 10 said the issue would influence how they cast their ballot, TODAY reported.</p>
              <p>Some older citizens, who are not benefiting from  Singapore's 
              dazzling plan to become a world-class city, are unhappy.  "Give us back 
              our older days" is their common cry.</p>
              <p>The idea is less attractive to the younger set, which  has adapted 
              well to new technologies, although still trying hard to cope  with the 
              high prices.</p>

              <p>I agree. Inflation for the whole world is up. Food shortage due to flood, drought, unforseen seasonal change and chaos have caused everything to go up. What we didn't need is for the government to add the burden to the people; such as tariff, rents, medical cost and housing price escalation.</p>
              <p>On the whole, the people's wages have not increased due to competition from "foreign talent" where they are prepared to take on the jobs at a lower wages. This may benefit the employers but overall it benefited the government when the levy was increased.</p>
              <p>What is worst is the hap-hazard ways in which policies were churned out to appease the citizens when they wantonly increased the minimum wages of the S-Pass and E-Pass holders thinking that by doing so, the jobs would go to the citizen.</p>
              <p>How wrong can they be? Did they not realised that these is going to cost the businesses more? Did they realise that our locals are calling for the wage increase too? Did they realised that such unplanned increased are going to eat into the companies profits. If the SME cannot sustained the increase, the SME is going to closed shop. Utilmately, the citizens will suffer.</p>
