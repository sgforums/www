              <p>Mar 28, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>I AGREE with Professor Tommy Koh that the policy of decolonising the 
              names of streets and places is tantamount to denying the past and wiping
               out part of our history ('Should Petain Road be renamed?'; March 20).</p>
              <p>Petain Road was named after 
              French leader Henri Philippe Petain in 1928 to honour his contribution 
              to the Allied effort during World War I. The fact that he turned traitor
               to his country in the next world war does not wipe out his earlier 
              contribution.</p>
              <p>He will always be remembered for his victory 
              in World War I and his treachery in World War II, despite the efforts of
               certain Frenchmen to airbrush his name from the history books.</p>
              <p>The name Petain carries no 
              pejorative connotation for any ethnic group in Singapore, and there is 
              no good reason for changing the name of Petain Road to de Gaulle Road.</p>
              <p>Given the timing of when the road was named, 
              no insult was intended and Singapore should not have to change its road 
              naming history.</p>
              <p>It will only confuse Singaporeans, especially long-time residents of the area.</p>
              <p>People who are knowledgeable or interested 
              enough to find out about the origins and histories of street names would
               know about Petain's role in both wars. For those who are ignorant, 
              Petain Road can serve as a unique example for learning about the twists 
              and turns of history.</p>
              <p>In any case, I am sure that with a bit of 
              digging, we could find other historical figures who have had roads named
               after them and who have done controversial things as well.</p>

              <h1>...Yes, there certainly is</h1>
              <p>Mar 28, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>THE Vichy French government headed by Prime Minister Henri Philippe 
              Petain signed an accord on Sept 22, 1940 with the Japanese government to
               allow Japan to use military bases in French Indochina and to build new 
              bases ('Should Petain Road be renamed?'; March 20).</p>
              <p>The Japanese used these military 
              installations located at Saigon (now Ho Chi Minh City) and Cam Ranh Bay 
              as staging and supply stations for its air, naval and ground forces.</p>
              <p>In his book, The Fall Of Singapore, journalist
               Frank Owen wrote that British intelligence sources reckoned Japanese 
              military strength in French Indochina before Pearl Harbor at 200,000 
              battle-hardened elite troops supported by 700 modern aircraft, including
               long-distance bombers and an unmatched navy.</p>
              <p>The first Japanese bombs fell on
               Singapore on Dec 8, 1941, from bombers based in French Indochina, and 
              the troops who invaded British Malaya and Singapore were assembled and 
              supplied from French Indochina.</p>
              <p>We are aware of the many lives lost, the 
              intense suffering and deprivation endured by Singaporeans during the 
              Japanese Occupation of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Petain indirectly aided the Japanese invasion 
              and occupation of Singapore. It is appropriate that we change the name 
              of Petain Road.</p>

              <p>Actually, following the same logic used by the second writer, we should eradicate the name 'Raffles' from all roads, buildings and institutions bearing his name.</p>
              <p>Raffles pursued a divide-and-conquer strategy, settling the immigrant races in their own ethnic enclaves instead of letting them mingle and mix.</p>
              <p>So instead of a Singaporean identity being forged early on, we had all this ethnic tension and racial riots that plagued Singapore all the way into the 1960s.</p>
              <p>It is only now that we are gradually forging a true Singaporean identity. Raffles set back the formation of this identity by a hundred years.</p>

Hence, he was able to receive news before other Singaporeans of the impending Allied return to Singapore. He claimed he had discreetly disseminated the information. As such, he was afraid the Japanese authority would punish him for doing so if he were identified. It was a heroic act.

They were the descendants of the very early Chinese immigrants (Hokkiens from the Fujian province) to the straits settlements of Malaya (Penang, Singapore and Malacca). </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">They assimilated with both the local Malays and the colonising British, whom they especially admired. </span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">The babas developed their own culture, cuisine and language - Malay liberally sprinkled with Hokkien.</span></span></p>

Lee Kuan Yew, who became prime minister of Singapore aged just 35, is the most obvious example.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> He claims a Hakka heritage, although his upbringing was that of a baba: at home, he spoke English with his parents and baba Malay to his grandparents. "Mandarin was totally alien to me and unconnected with my life," Lee said of his childhood.</span></span></p>
