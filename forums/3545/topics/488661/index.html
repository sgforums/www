              <p>KUNDASANG, June 5 — A Malaysian doctor who was on Mount Kinabalu 
              today claimed that at least one person died after the area was hit by a 
              6.0 magnitude earthquake this morning.<br><br>Dr Redzlan Abdul Rahman said that he saw three bodies and managed to check one and confirmed there was no pulse.<br><br>“I tried to checked her pulse, but I couldn’t find any.<br><br>“I believe she was Singaporean,” he said adding that he was not sure of the other victims.<br><br>Dr
               Redzlan who was here to chaperone a group of 15 students from Sekolah 
              Menengah Tengku Kudin Laut in Pahang said he first felt the tremors when
               he was at a hut in Sayat Sayat and ran out.<br><br>“You could actually 
              see the hut’s posts shaking and later on, the boulders from the mountain
               broke off and started falling down. It was so scary,” he said, while 
              shuddering.<br><br>Dr Redzlan was one of the 52 climbers who have made it down from the mountain today. Some reportedly suffered injuries.<br><br>According
               to fire and rescue services operations statistics, another 137 are 
              still stranded between km7.5 and km8 on the mountain summit where fallen
               rocks have blocked the path.<br><br>“I had to take a detour that was far off the beaten path to get down,” said Dr Redzlan.<br><br>Sabah Parks staff Alip Sampin said that about 200 mountain guides have been deployed to assist in search and rescue operations.<br><br>“However, many are on standby at lower points in the climb and awaiting further instructions from coordinators,” he said.</p>
              <p>Bad weather conditions and the possibility of aftershocks are hampering search and rescue operations.<br><br>Helicopters are also seen circling the mountain.</p>

              <p>KOTA KINABALU: A total of 11 fatalities have been recorded after an earthquake hit the vicinity of Mount Kinabalu on Friday, the Sabah Minister of Tourism, Culture and Environment Masidi Manjun announced on Twitter on Saturday afternoon (Jun 6).

"(The) Police forensic team have arrived to assist," he said. <br><br>137 HIKERS RESCUED SO FAR<br><br>Malaysian rescuers brought the last of 137 hikers down to safety Saturday after the quake stranded them atop Mount Kinabalu, an official said, but media reports claimed that at least two people were killed.<br><br>The 6.0-magnitude quake struck near the picturesque mountain, a popular tourist destination, early Friday, triggering landslides and sending huge granite boulders tumbling down the 4,095m peak's wide, jagged crown.<br><br>The quake, one of the strongest in the country in decades, jolted a wide area of the Malaysian state of Sabah on Borneo island, shattering windows, cracking walls, and causing other relatively minor damage.<br><br>"The 137 climbers have safely arrived at the Park HQ, the last batch at 2.50 am.

              <p>KUNDASANG - The Sabah earthquake that has so far taken the lives of 11 climbers was a result of the action of Western tourists who had stripped naked near Mount Kinabalu's summit last month, said the state's Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan.<br><br>Speaking to reporters on Saturday, he said the tragedy was a "confirmation" of the consequences of the actions of the 10 Europeans who he said had been disrespectful to local customs. He called on the culprits to be brought to a native court to be charged, the Malay Mail Online reported.<br><br>"Whether other people believe this or not, it's what we Sabahans believe. When the earthquake happened, it's like a confirmation of our beliefs," he said.<br><br>"It is a sacred mountain and you cannot take it lightly," he added.</p>
