               poster from the 70s National Library Archives proves it.<br> To make matters worse, the country discouraged and finally banned pop music as it was termed "yellow culture". <br> Singapore's pop music industry faded after all its glory and support from the 60s public.<br> A thriving and decent way for both amateur and professional musicians to make an honest living died an <br> unnatural death. Many enthusiasts moaned the local pop music's demise and up to this day the industry never recovered.<br> The Golden Age of Pop Music... will it ever make a comeback?<br> Image: National Heritage Board, Singapore.</div>

               Road Presbyterian Church and his body cooked in curry before being 
              disposed of. The case became popularly known as the "Curry Murder".<br> <br> An unrepentant wife-beater, Ayakannu was a father of three who worked as
               a live-in caretaker of holiday chalets in Changi. His wife Naragatha 
              worked at the Orchard Road Presbyterian Church.  <br> <br> On the day of the murder, Ayakannu was repeatedly bludgeoned to death. 
              To destroy all traces of evidence, his body was chopped up into pieces. 
              The body parts were then cooked into curry and disposed all over the 
              island.<br> <br> Investigations revealed that the victim was chopped and then cooked in a large aluminium pot.  <br> <br> Naragatha and her 3 brothers were charged in 1987 with murder. However, 
              as there was insufficient evidence against them, they were acquitted. 
              The brothers were re-arrested on the same day and detained without trial
               under the Criminal Law Act. They were released in June 1991.<br> <br> Apart from what investigations revealed, the prosecution was unable to 
              prove that it was indeed the family members who caused Ayakannu's death.
               The cooking pot in which Ayakannu's body parts were allegedly cooked 
              could not be found, leaving no traces of the cooking or Muthu in the

               believed to date back to at least the 13th century and possibly as 
              early as the 10th or 11th century, bore an undeciphered inscription, 
              which could probably shed more light on Singapore's early history before
               the coming of the British.<br> <br> In June 1819, a few months after the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 
              Singapore, a sandstone slab about 10 ft (3.0 m) high and 9 to 10 ft (2.7
               to 3.0 m) long was found by Indian labourers clearing jungle trees at 
              the mouth of the Singapore River. The men on discovering the inscription
               were very much frightened, and could not be induced to go on with the 
              clearing, which was completed by Chinese under the stimulus of high 
              wages...<br> <br> In 1843, on the orders of the acting Settlement Engineer, Captain D.H. 
              Stevenson, the slab was blown to pieces to clear and widen the 
              passageway at the Singapore River mouth to make space for Fort Fullerton
               and the quarters of its commander.<br> <br> Lt-Col  James Low managed to save small fragments bearing the most 
              legible parts of the inscription and sent them to the Royal Asiatic 
              Society's museum in Calcutta in 1848. A large block from the monument 
              lay abandoned at Fort Canning until finally being broken up and used as 
              gravel for a road.<br> <br> One of the fragments of the original sandstone slab that was saved by 
              Lt-Col Low was later returned to the Raffles Museum in Singapore. This 
              is today known as the Singapore Stone. It is currently displayed in the 
              Singapore History Gallery of the National Museum of Singapore. The Stone
               was designated by the Museum as one of 11 "national treasures" in 
              January 2006<br> <br> Because of this silly British Captain/Engineer, the secrets of the Singapore Stone will forever remain a Secret.....  <img class="inlineimg" title="Mad" src="http://www.sammyboy.com/images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> Details in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Stone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Stone</a></div>

              <p>Hidden History :  Sunny Ang<br> <br> <img src="http://www.singapedia.com.sg/entries/a/imgs/ang_sunny.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> <br> Ang, Sunny (1939– 1967) One of Singapore’s most famous criminals, 
              convicted on 18 May 1965 for the murder of bar waitress Jenny Cheok 
              Cheng Kid, whose body was never found. The prosecution alleged that on 
              27 August 1963, Sunny Ang had hired a sampan (small boat) to bring him 
              and Cheok to Sisters Islands south of Singapore, ostensibly to collect 
              corals; but the real motive was murder— she was heavily insured. Ang was
               bankrupt whereas Cheok had been insured for a total of $450,000 with 
              several insurance companies. Some of Cheok’s policies were renewed on 
              the morning of her death, although Ang’s were not. The beneficiaries 
              were Ang’s mother and Cheok’s estate.<br> <br> Ang had helped Cheok to don the diving gear and let the novice diver 
              descend alone. When she failed to surface, he did not go down to search 
              for her. Moreover, he filed the insurance claims less than 24 hours 
              after her disappearance. One of Cheok’s flippers was later found with 
              the heel strap cut in two places by a sharp instrument. The prosecution 
              relied entirely on circumstantial evidence. The jury found Ang guilty of
               murder and he was sentenced to death. He was unsuccessful in applying 
              for leave to appeal to the Privy Council and was hanged on 6 February 
              1967.  <br> <br> This case was closely followed by most Singaporeans. There were rumours 
              that he would be rescued by helicopters from Changi Jail, and steps were
               taken to prevent this possible escape.</p>

              causing seven deaths and hundreds to be evacuated.The torrential monsoon
               rains on 2 December 1978 brought disastrous floods and utter chaos 
              throughout Singapore.<br> <br> Seven people died during the floods (six were drowned and one was 
              electrocuted by a 'live' lamp post). More than 1,000 people were 
              evacuated from their homes by army and police boats from five submerged 
              areas, namely, Kampung San Teng, Potong Pasir, Lorong Buang Kok, Lorong 
              Kudang, Lorong Kinchir and Lorong Chuan.<br> <br> Howling winds, lashing rain and swirling waters hit the island at 1:00 
              pm. bringing two days of destruction to life, property, crops and 
              livestock. Flood waters, unleashed by the heaviest rainfall ever 
              recorded in a single day (512.4 mm), caused roads to be submerged in 
              more than a metre of water and impassable to traffic. Hundreds of 
              vehicles were abandoned and several cars stalled after hitting into deep
               waters or trees and lamp posts. Airline flights, train and mail 
              schedules were disrupted. Telecommunication cables and power lines were 
              damaged causing failures in communication services and electricity 
              supplies to thousands of households. Trees were uprooted by strong winds
               while the heavy rainfall caused landslides in several hilly areas.<br> <br> The worst hit areas were the farm belt zones of Woodlands, Braddell 
              Road, Potong Pasir and Changi where more than 2,000 pigs and poultry 
              perished in the swollen waters. This was the worst flood since the Hari 
              Raya floods that hit the island in December 1969.<br> <br> <br> <a href="http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_780_2004-12-30.html">http://infopedia.nl.sg/articles/SIP_780_2004-12-30.html</a></div>

              her wound without regaining consciousness.  <br> <br> X-rays showed that the bullet entered from her upper left chest and hit 
              her heart. Police suspected that the shooter was a sniper hiding in one

              Island. He also owned other businesses such as brickworks and

              <p><strong>Gemini Chit Fund - Singapore Ponzi.</strong></p>
              <p>Gemini Chit Fund Landmark fraud case. The Gemini Chit Fund Corporation Ltd was incorporated by Abdul Gaffar Mohamed Ibrahim in 1964 as a private limited company. The chit fund scheme originated in India. Usually practiced in rural societies, it is both a lending and saving scheme in which investors are also borrowers. Members make contributions to a common pool at periodic intervals. At the end of each period, the pooled funds are auctioned and the person with the lowest bid wins. Rural chit fund schemes usually involve ten people.<br><br>The Gemini Chit Fund attracted between 40,000 and 50,000 members, and promised high returns on investment. In 1973, Abdul Gaffar was charged with three counts of criminal breach of trust amounting to $3.2 million. The loss resulting from his crimes was estimated at $50 million. In sentencing Gaffar to life imprisonment, trial judge Choor Singh dubbed the case ‘the swindle of the century’.<br></p>
