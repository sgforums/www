              <h2>Tigers in Singapore</h2>
              <div id="description">
              <p>By <strong>Marsita Omar</strong> written on 2006-12-12<br> National Library Board Singapore</p>
              <p class="infotalk">Comments on article: <a href="http://infopediatalk.nl.sg/nature/SIP_1081_2007-01-17">InfopediaTalk</a></p>
              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <div>Tigers used to be found in the wild in Singapore. They were
                    sighted mostly in the areas of Bukit Timah, Choa Chu Kang and
                    Pulau Ubin. They were a menace when large areas of
                    Singapore's forests were cleared for roads and
                    plantations.  The intensive hunt for tigers which was
                    accompanied by rewards led to their diminished
                    numbers. <br> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> Early Records</span></strong></div>
              <div>The first record of tigers is found in the first newspaper in
                    Singapore, the <em>Singapore Chronicle</em>, dated 8
                    September 1831. There it was reported that a Chinaman
                    was killed by a tiger and that probably the same tiger killed
                    a native shortly after that.  Singapore then was still
                    covered by thick virgin jungle and it was home to pigs and
                    deer which were food to tigers. The island formed part of a
                    larger hunting ground for these tigers. Being good
                    swimmers, tigers had been known to swim cross the Straits of
                    Johore into Singapore. <br> <br> When the cultivation of gambier and pepper took off in the
                    1840s, plantations extended beyond town and encroached
                    on virgin jungle.  By the late 1840s, the number of
                    plantations peaked at 600.  Chinese plantation coolies
                    became easy targets for tigers.  Reports of encounters
                    with tigers increased in the 1830s and 1840s. In 1835,
                    G. D. Coleman and his convict workers were laying out a new
                    road through a swamp in the jungle near town when they
                    were attacked though no one was killed. <br> <br> Ravages by tigers grew so intense that it was said by the
                    middle of the 19th century, tigers claimed one life a day.
                    This could be doubted although not improbable. At first,
                    estate owners tried to cover up the truth but by mid-1840s
                    they gave up. In 1859, one village near Bukit Timah was
                    abandoned due to too many attacks. Bukit Timah was
                    nicknamed "A tiger Resort". It was reported that
                    390 lives were killed in 1857. It was likely that the actual
                    number was more as many tiger attacks went
                    unreported.</div>
              <div><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br> Containing the Tiger Menace</span></strong></div>
              <p>The government gave a reward of $20 for every tiger killed
                    but the increasing number of casualties led to the reward
                    being increased to $50 then to $100. Tiger hunting became a
                    rewarding sport offering money and adventure. Pits of 4 to
                    4.5 m were dug and traps set. Tigers caught were hauled
                    out alive and put into strong rattan baskets which the tigers
                    could not bite through. Indian convicts who were experts in
                    hunting tigers were also employed by the government. 
                    With so many tigers killed, their numbers dwindled and they
                    eventually perished. One French Canadian named Carrol made
                    tiger hunting a business for himself. Occasional reports of
                    tiger attacks were still heard towards the end of the 19th
                    century; a man was killed by a tiger in Thomson Road in 1890
                    and two tigers shot at Bukit Timah in 1896. The last wild
                    tiger, roaming in Choa Chu Kang area, was killed in the
                    1930s.</p>
