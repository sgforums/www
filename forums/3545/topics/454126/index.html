              For decades we have heard of the  long suffering wivies  especially in Asian society.  The men fool around  and the wivies   still stays faithful keeping home and minding the children. Even today when the husbands strays and get themselves exposed in the media, the long suffering wiives are there ,claiming that they stand by their men . 
              NOWadays we hear of wivies who stray-afternoon teas and karaoke with their toyboys, ...can be  their gym trainers or dancer instructors or some professional women even trade sex  for making sales in their jobs etc.Can their husbands take being cuckolded?

            <div class='col-md body'>But it is our societal perception isn't it? A  straying  man is ok  but a stray wife is not to be tolerated? Question of face.  If a man strays it is because he is so much a man so handsome , so rich so  popular, so macho.. what to do - all the girls  claw over him....not his fault what!  But when a woman strays- what a slut she is! always  wear low cut to seduce the men... Doesn't she know it is disgraceful? People will think her husband is not man enough to satisfy her so she sleeps around. What will the children think? what will the relatives think too!</div>

                  In a way yes , in a way no. If your wife strays you can actually sue the co-respondent  for compensation. We assume the co-reponsdent is another man of course...but these days it could be another woman! So far in Singapore I haven't as yet heard of  any case where the woman sued a man co-respondent for losing her husband  or a man who sued a  woman for losing his wife. of course if the person who strays simply strays with multiple partners- like e.g  a different girl  or man  every week-how to sue? which one to sue? as co-respondent?

            <div class='col-md body'>Reasons given , why women decide to still stand by their husbands  after  they stray.1) For religious reasons - in upholding the commitment in marriage and the family especially when there are young children involved 2) They still love the man somehow and women tend to be sentimental ( some say easily appeased and conned) 3) They are not prepared to beome a divorcee as a status  4) They enjoy the perks and prestige of being  a married woman especially  to a wealthy man -so why  give it all up  to another woman and let her step right in? 5) For the sake of preserving assets and wealth for the children 6) to take the ultimate revenge on  the man in later years.</div>

              Human beings are weak and can always be lured by temptations.  Whether   one strays or not to a large extent depends upon ' basis for marriage and the relationship one has with one's spouse. Is the marriage based upon a good relationship of understanding,honesty and communication and strongly built on the premise of total commitment to one another  in honouring, the love. trust and respect  for one another in  the marriage. If not one can always give all kinds of justification and reason for straying.
               A person's integrity and character also determines if he  can easily be tempted to stray. If a person is a principled individual who honours his words, his bonds and his commitments, to others especially those to  his wife and family, he will definitely resist straying.

              Life has been excellent as far as I am concerned. I live on the premise that if I promise, I must try to keep my promises. A man who does not do that is unreliable and  cannot be trusted! Similarly marriage is a promise of faithfulness  especially for those who take marriage vows  to cherish, honour love and care in sickness and in health....and the next thing you know  they commit adultery- disgusting. Culturally for Malays they don't take this sort of marriage vows  since they can have four wivies . What about Hindus and Guru Nanak followers- how many wivies are they allowed? Anyone knows??
