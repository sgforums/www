              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: Their accidental deaths serve as a "grim
              reminder" for parents and caregivers not to leave young children
              unattended for even a short while, said State Coroner Victor Yeo in
              court Friday.<br>
              <br>
              This came following inquests on two children who died after they
              fell out of their flats within 10 days of each other.<br>
              <br>
              On April 4, five-year-old Marson Heng Jing Quan died of head
              injuries after he fell five stories from his flat at Tampines
              Street 42.<br>
              <br>
              The kindergarten pupil was still asleep when his father left home
              for work at around 8.15am.<br>
              <br>
              Nobody else was in the flat as Marson's mother was at the market
              while his grandfather was having breakfast at a nearby
              coffeeshop.<br>
              <br>
              The court heard that after he woke up, Marson could have climbed
              onto a laundry basket and peered out of an open kitchen window to
              look for the other family members.<br>
              <br>
              While doing so, he might have lost his balance and fell to his
              death.<br>
              <br>
              Another young child met a similarly tragic end at Tanjong Rhu's
              Waterside Condominium on April 14.<br>
              <br>
              Six-year-old Anisha Reddy died of multiple injuries after she fell
              nine floors from her flat.<br>
              <br>
              Her mother, who had gone to a bathroom, had left her alone near a
              bedroom window at around 5am that day.<br>
              <br>
              She found her daughter missing when she came back minutes
              later.<br>
              <br>
              Anisha was later found lying motionless on a footpath near her
              apartment block.<br>
