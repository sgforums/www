              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>THE boyfriend of a teenage girl who fell eight storeys from a block of
               flats said on Thursday that the 17-year-old had sat on the ledge three 
              to four times before to scare him each time they quarrelled.</p>
              <p>Mr Low Chen Sheng thought that Candice Goh Hui Yi was just 
              trying to use her scare tactics on him again in the early hours of June 7
               last year.</p>
              <p>'It is not the first time she did that. I felt that it was 
              pretty normal,' the 21-year-old told a court yesterday at the continued 
              inquest into her death.</p>
              <p>Earlier on the night of June 6, the couple had a heated 
              argument over her withdrawing money from their joint bank account. A 
              group of youngsters said they had seen the couple squabbling and hurling
               things at each other at Bedok North Road, only hours before Candice 
              fell to her death.</p>
              <p>Following the fight, Candice, a sales assistant, hung out 
              with the group and chatted with them. She also bought a can of beer to 
              drink. Meanwhile, her boyfriend had sent her text messages and called 
              her repeatedly but she did not respond.</p>
              <p>He finally tracked her down at about 3.20am and made her 
              follow him to his flat by pushing her and pulling her hair. Candice then
               asked her boyfriend if he believed that she would commit suicide. She 
              took the house keys and left bare-footed.</p>
