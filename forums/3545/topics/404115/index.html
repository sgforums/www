              <h1 class="storyheadline">Dad's death: Comfort from an unexpected source</h1>
              <p>TWO days after my father passed on, I decided to write an e-mail to 
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. I remember my mother telling me that my 
              father had served with the Prime Minister in the army.</p>
              <p>Even as I composed the e-mail, I felt sillier by the minute.</p>
              <p>'Message for Prime Minister Lee', the header read. 'Dear 
              Prime Minister Lee, I don't know if you remember a ...'</p>
              <p>What in the world was I thinking? Nonetheless, I completed 
              the note and e-mailed it, not expecting a response. Two days later, I 
              received a call from the Prime Minister's secretary informing me that Mr
               Lee had read my e-mail and would like to send a letter to my family, 
              and could we furnish him with our address.</p>
              <p>We had expected a short note written on a card. So we were 
              taken aback when we received a full-page letter from the Prime Minister 
              addressed to my mother. It detailed what Mr Lee remembered of my father,
               whom he described as 'an old friend'. The letter gave my mother a 
              welcome respite from her grief and my siblings felt a renewed sense of 
              pride in dad.</p>
              <p>I felt deeply gratified that Mr Lee spared the time to pen a
               letter of comfort to an ordinary family like mine, living in a Housing 
              Board flat, and that he remembered a man who was of humble background 
              with such detail.</p>
              <p>He has shown me that he is a prime minister who governs not 
              only with his head, but also with his heart.</p>

              <p><strong>What PM Lee wrote</strong></p>
              <p>Dear Mdm Lam,</p>
              <p>I was saddened to learn from your daughter, Yvonne, that 
              your husband, Maj (Ret) Tang Seng Koong, had passed away. Please accept 
              my sincere condolences.</p>
              <p>Seng Koong was my OC in Bravo Company OCS in 1971, when I 
              was an officer cadet in Safti. I had joined the course late, together 
              with the other SAF scholars in my batch. Seng Koong took a personal 
              interest in us, helping us to settle in and get up to speed. He mentored
               us, taking some lessons himself, and accompanying us on field 
              exercises. I have an image in my mind of him walking ahead of me along a
               path, in his helmet and skeleton battle order, carrying a little pack 
              on his back. He cared for the cadets under his charge. He seldom raised 
              his voice, and never flaunted his authority over us. But he always 
              demanded high standards of us, as he did of himself.</p>
              <p>Later, Seng Koong became chief of security at MediaCorp. I 
              would meet him from time to time when I went to the MediaCorp studios at
               Caldecott Hill for events or to record TV programmes. We would chat a 
              little. It was always good to catch up with an old friend, and see him 
              well.</p>
              <p>You must feel Seng Koong's loss keenly. I hope the memory of
               your happy times together will comfort and sustain you. Our thoughts 
              and prayers are with you and your family at this difficult time.</p>
              <p>With deepest sympathies,</p>
              <p>Yours sincerely</p>
              <p>Lee Hsien Loong</p>
