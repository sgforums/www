              <p>That's right. </p>
              <p>PAP crippled all the other parties, so people were left without a choice but to go along with PAP.</p>
              <p>There was also a fear of voting for opposition. </p>
              <p>It seems to me, that PAP rule after 1959 were based on these factors and NEVER on popularity.</p>
              <p>There is no way on earth that Lee Kuan Yew can win votes base on popularity.</p>

              <p>Actually this question was what started me to question PAP and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>I was wondering how on earth can this Lee Kuan Yew who speaks a language that majority of people in Singapore don't understand can win elections?</p>
              <p>It all began with this simple question.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>I see other countries, their leaders and people speak the same language.</p>
              <p>But when it comes to Singapore, this is completely not so.</p>
              <p>Another thing that troubled me was why dialect was suppressed.</p>
              <p>These are the basic questions that led me to question PAP and Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Later I found out that Lee Kuan Yew was a political fraud.</p>

              <p>let's not forget the hundreds of thousands of people employed by the Govt like in stat boards, govt-linked companies and the uniform groups. you can count on the fact that almost all of them will vote for PAP to safeguard their ''ricebowls'' ! you can bet their families will also feel obliged to vote for PAP too.</p>

              as though safeguarding ricebowls is a bad thing. some people dont want - and know they cant- save the world. 
              
              that is middle class apathy. this class craves security in the race to reach the next class level. throw this middle class into disarray with threat of job loss/competition and then the catalyst for political upheaval will start. 
              
              for the upper mid classes who are not suffering from the policies, it is not fair to say they have no backbone. They simply dont wish to change the status quo, and sometimes rightly so.

Come on, you can't help it but admit that MM Lee had contributed tremendous efforts to get Singapore to where it is now, although many will argue this point. Would David Marshall really have brought Singapore to prosperity, I don't think so. We really need people like MM Lee who could see ahead and plan well. The other political parties are never voted in because their ideas and plans just suck. Just read Workers' Party's newspapers, they are full of contradictory articles that agree and disagree with the current government and then end up concluding nothing. This is just epic fail. As long as policies made are generally for the good of the people, I am fine with the government.</p></div>

              <p>thats why the opposition should build up war chests to context for every ward. they should pool a fund to invest and grow the money so that by the time the elections comes, they can afford to put out the deposits to contest.</p>

              <p>thats why the opposition should build up war chests to context
              for every ward. they should pool a fund to invest and grow the
              money so that by the time the elections comes, they can afford to
              put out the deposits to contest.</p>

              <p>maybe those really unhappy with the PAP should do something, like contributing funds to the party, but then the track record of the opposition parties are really dismal. They must be wondering if their funds will get misused or worse misappropriated?</p>
              <p> maybe the upcoming elections will tell us something, that the locals are really unhappy with the FT influx. I will be surprised if the opposition gets 1 or 2 seats in the parliament. I expected protest votes cast in the ballots.</p>

              <p>A lot of spoilt votes to the benefits of the ruling party next round if the oppositions still have no decency to cooperate.</p>
