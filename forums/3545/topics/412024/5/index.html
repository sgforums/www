              <p><br>Seriously speaking Singaporeans don't exactly have the best method of management. Most Singaporeans think they can use the carrot and stick to punish those who don't perform. However I see a lot of Singaporeans who are seconded overseas struggle because they don't know how to manoevre themself politically to get support from the strong people in the office, instead most Singaporean managers end up isolating themselves by using the stick to punish underperformers.</p>
              <p>Perhaps their way work well in Singapore but when they go to other country, they struggle a lot because cannot adapt to the culture. Must do it their way instead of listening to the locals.</p>

              <p>Agreed with you again.</p>
              <p>When you get your newly degree cert, can you move up the ladder?
              Provided you move out to get a new higher salary. But then, how old
              are you already?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Employers will not want his/her staff to outbeat him/her.</p>
              <p>If employers feel the threat, you are doomed on your working
              life.</p>
              <p>No more promotion, no more incentives for you.</p>

              <p>For me, I took on a lower salaried job for several years so I could qualify to obtain a BTO application. After I secured the flat, I immediately jumped ship to a much higher one, because if I started at the higher paying one, HDB will never allow me to participate in their BTO lucky draw.</p>
