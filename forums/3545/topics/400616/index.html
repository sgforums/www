              <h1 class="storyheadline">An unsettling survey</h1>
              <p>IT IS not uncommon to see insurance companies setting up booths at MRT
               stations or atriums of shopping centres. I had always managed to avoid 
              them until Monday at IMM shopping mall.</p>
              <p>A Prudential booth was set up in front of the escalators on 
              the ground floor. As I got off the escalator, I was approached by a 
              representative from the company. I was taken aback as she knew which 
              store I had visited and started asking me questions about what I had 
              bought there. She then asked me to fill up a survey form.</p>
              <p>The form was structured to look as though it was a survey 
              for the mall when it was actually for the insurance company. Questions 
              like 'How many times a week do you shop at IMM' aided in giving that 
              impression.</p>
              <p>As with all other surveys I have participated in, I did not 
              provide my contact details. The representative then asked why I was 
              being defensive and was disinterested in my survey answers. It appeared 
              that the survey's purpose was to 'ensnare' people into giving out their 
              personal details.</p>
              <p>What does Prudential do with such data collected? And does 
              it provide proper training for its staff to conduct such surveys?</p>

              <p>Problem is, most of them do not take "no" for an answer... I had to completely ignore some of them b4 they will leave me alone...</p>
              <p>It's irritating when u're in a hurry, they are for a survey, u said no and then they ask "why" -______________- <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angry.png" alt="angry.png"></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Insurance firm sorry for unpleasant experience</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the Forum Online letter by Mr Tang Shangjun ('An unsettling 
              survey'; May 27), regarding the encounter he had at a Prudential 
              roadshow in IMM shopping mall last week.</p>
              <p>We thank Mr Tang for bringing this matter to our attention 
              and regret his unpleasant experience during the encounter.</p>
              <p>We assure Mr Tang and all consumers that Prudential has a 
              set of standard operating procedures for roadshows. All financial 
              consultants are required to adhere to the procedures and standard of 
              conduct prescribed therein.</p>
              <p>It is also mandatory for all Prudential financial 
              consultants to complete the company's roadshow training programme before
               they are allowed to participate in such an event.</p>
              <p>We also want to state that we respect the trust consumers 
              place in us when voluntarily providing us with any personal data for the
               marketing of our financial services. Consumers are always free to 
              decide not to provide us with any personal data, and all our financial 
              consultants are taught never to pressure anyone into providing us with 
              any personal data.</p>
              <p>We view Mr Tang's feedback seriously and are in the midst of
               conducting an internal investigation into the matter. Upon completion 
              of the investigation, we will take the appropriate action against the 
              parties involved to ensure that the professionalism and ethics of our 
              distribution force remain at a consistently high standard.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Iras, PA sorry for volunteer's unpleasant experience</h1>
              <p>WE REFER to Monday's Forum Online letter, "Don't kill the passion to 
              volunteer" by Mr Tan Tiong Heng.</p>
              <p>We have contacted Mr Tan and apologised to him for his 
              unpleasant experience as a first time e-filing volunteer.</p>
              <p>We are also sorry for the miscommunication about the award 
              and the delay in sending the certificate of appreciation to him. Mr Tan 
              has since received his certificate of appreciation.</p>
              <p>We have also counselled our officers to be more helpful to 
              our volunteers at Fuchun Community Club.</p>
              <p>We would like to take this opportunity to share that the 
              Volunteer e-Filing Service (VES) is a joint community project by the 
              Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (Iras) and CitizenConnect centres 
              at the community clubs that started in 2005.</p>
              <p>Volunteers, including those from schools, non-profit 
              organisations, community groups and active volunteers, participate in 
              VES to help the less IT-savvy taxpayers to e-file.</p>
              <p>Iras organises hands-on e-filing training sessions for the 
              volunteers and equips them with basic income tax information before they
               commence their volunteering sessions at the CitizenConnect centres.</p>
              <p>E-filing has been made simple and easy for taxpayers as most
               of the income and tax relief claims have already been pre-filled for 
              them.</p>
              <p>Hence, volunteers usually need only help taxpayers navigate 
              the e-filing system and file their tax returns via the Internet. Tax 
              queries that are more complex are directly channelled to Iras to handle.</p>
              <p>We thank Mr Tan for his feedback, which will help us improve
               the VES and enhance the experience of our volunteers going forward.</p>
