              <h1 class="storyheadline">A logistical nightmare</h1>
              <p>WHAT began as weeks of eager anticipation turned into utter 
              disappointment and frustration last Saturday for many participants in 
              the adidas Sundown Marathon.</p>
              <p>The shuttle service ferrying the participants was a 
              disaster. For those who used the service from Pasir Ris, the waiting 
              time was too long and there were not enough buses to ferry them to the 
              race site on time. Therefore, several participants missed the start of 
              the race and began their run late.</p>
              <p>To make things worse, those who eventually caught a taxi had
               to alight far from the race site and walk at least 5km to the start/end
               point at Changi Exhibition Centre.</p>
              <p>Among them were half-marathoners and full-marathoners. 
              Imagine how tired they must have been even before they began their race.</p>
              <p>The 21km race was officially flagged off at 9pm. As a result
               of the poor shuttle logistics, the latecomers had to begin their 21km 
              race at 10pm. But the Land Transport Authority had already instructed 
              that traffic from the Changi coast side should be open at 10pm. Hence, 
              the marshals had to redirect these late runners to turn left from 
              Aviation Park Road.</p>
              <p>This caused the latecomers to miss the Changi Coast loop, 
              which is about 3km long, and they ended up running shorter than the 
              actual 21km.</p>
              <p>Despite this, their finished timings were still recorded and
               ranked under the race results for the 21km distance category. The 
              organiser should have excluded them from the rankings and simply 
              displayed their timings.</p>
              <p>What they did was very unprofessional because these runners 
              were ranked together with those who had completed the full 21km. And 
              some of those runners who ran a shorter route obtained a better rank.</p>
              <p>Despite the countless negative feedback by runners on 
              Facebook, event organiser HiVelocity has yet to respond to any of it 
              publicly.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope the organiser will take note of these 
              issues and learn from them instead of sweeping the matter under the 
              carpet.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Disturbing lessons for enthusiasts</h1>
              <p>LAST Saturday's adidas Sundown Marathon was a very disappointing 
              experience for myself and my friends. Here are a few disturbing lessons 
              we enthusiasts took away from the event:</p>
              <p>Always study the running route in detail beforehand. We had 
              wrongly assumed the fees we paid were inclusive of well-laid-out signs 
              along the route to ensure runners would not get confused. We had also 
              thought there would be representatives of the organiser along the way to
               give clear directions.</p>
              <p>Don't go by the guidebook. We had wrongly assumed the 
              guidebook's recommendation - which was to take public transport and the 
              shuttle service - was the best option. Because of the two-hour wait for 
              the shuttle bus, we missed the start time.</p>
              <p>It is never about timing. When we finally arrived at the 
              event venue, we were told there would be no official timing for us. 
              Thank you organiser, for drilling into us the true spirit of running. It
               is all about the run. Who cares about the timing?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Marathon organiser sorry, promises improvements</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Ms Joyce Neo ('A logistical nightmare') and Ms Kayleigh Ho 
              ('Disturbing lessons for enthusiasts') for their feedback on Wednesday 
              on the adidas Sundown Marathon last Saturday.</p>
              <p>As this year's race was at a new location which many 
              participants were unfamiliar with, we decided to offer shuttle bus 
              services between Changi Exhibition Centre and Pasir Ris MRT station as 
              an added service to assist runners getting to and from the race site.</p>
              <p>The closure of Changi Coast Road (between Airline Road and 
              Aviation Park Road) from 8.30pm to 10.30pm was necessary to facilitate 
              the 9pm flag-off of the half-marathon 21km category. All participants 
              were notified through the Athlete's Guide and sent an SMS reminder the 
              day before the race. Unfortunately, because of unforeseen heavy traffic 
              conditions, participants were delayed and prevented from getting to the 
              start point on time.</p>
              <p>We apologise to those who were affected by the traffic 
              conditions, which caused them to miss the flag-off. We felt their 
              disappointment and it was for that reason that we decided to have 
              another flag-off so that latecomers could still run the race.</p>
              <p>The shortening of the route was inevitable because we were 
              bound by timing constraints as the roads had to be reopened by 10.30pm. 
              We had two choices - either to go without an additional flag-off or 
              shorten the race distance. We chose the latter because we knew some of 
              our participants still wanted to run, albeit a slightly shorter route. 
              Therefore, we hope all participants will understand and support our 
              decision regarding this.</p>
              <p>The results posted on the website are provisional. The final
               results, to be released in 14 days, will be sorted based on the 
              distances completed.</p>
              <p>We take all feedback seriously and any input will certainly 
              assist us in improving the flow of the event. We will review them with 
              the aim of improving next year's event.</p>
