              <div class="byline">By 
              																				Jessica Cheam</div>
              <div class="byline"><br></div>
              <div class="byline">THE Government came out strongly on Thursday to reject criticism by 
              Real Estate Developers' Association of Singapore (Redas) president on 
              its intervention in the property market.
              <p>Mr Simon Cheong on Wednesday questioned the need for 
              Government intervention to stop private residential prices from rising.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of National Development (MND) issued a 
              statement on Thursday to say it 'disagrees totally with his view'.</p>
              <p>MND said the government's objective is to maintain a steady 
              and healthy property market where price movements are supported by 
              economic fundamentals.</p>
              <p>'This is important as a stable market matters to the 
              well-being of Singaporeans and the economy. A property market bubble, if
               allowed to form, may not only impact housing affordability but also 
              severely impact the economy when it bursts,' it said.</p>
              <p>In his speech at the launch of a new price index for private
               homes in Singapore on Wednesday, Mr Cheong highlighted the results of 
              two recent government land tenders to illustrate the 'conundrum and the 
              dilemma' developers face in bidding for such sites.</p>
              <p>Rebutting this, MND said 'it is arguable if awarding the two
               sites at the low bid prices in 2008 would have moderated property 
              prices or simply allowed the bidders to achieve a higher profit margin'.</p>
              <p>Secondly, it said that the reserve price has not deterred 
              the successful sale of sites under the Government Land Sales (GLS) 
              programme.</p>
              <p>Also, the yield of the two sites is small - estimated about 
              800 units - and is questionable whether the added supply from these 
              sites in 2008 would have affected prices today in any way.</p>
              <p>MND also said that the Government also has a duty as the 
              'custodian of state land to ensure it obtains a fair market price for a 
              site'.</p>
              <p>'The Government had awarded sale sites in the past even when
               the top bid was below the Reserve Price.</p>
              <p>'However, for the two sites cited by Mr Cheong, the 
              Government was not convinced that the bids represented fair market value
               rather than opportunistic bids, as there were very few bids for the 
              sites, and the bids were exceptionally low.'</p>

              chief said</strong></span></div>
              <p>SPEAKING at the launch of a new price 
              index for private homes in Singapore on Wednesday, Mr Simon Cheong had 
              said: 'As the supply side of the development equation is managed by the 
              public sector, market forces are often not wholly free to respond to 
              demand.'</p>
              <p>'During periods of high volatility, it is not able to respond quickly
               enough to real-time changes happening in the marketplace,' he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Cheong, who is also chairman and chief executive of developer SC 
              Global, cited two recent government land tenders to illustrate the 
              'conundrum and the dilemma' developers face in bidding for such sites.</p>
              <p>A single bid for a Tampines site was rejected in June 2008 for being 
              too low but was awarded in March at $421 per sq ft per plot ratio (psf 
              ppr), or 3.6 times higher.</p>
              <p>A Ten Mile Junction mixed-use site also had a failed bid of $162 psf 
              ppr in April 2008 but went for $437 psf ppr, or 2.7 times higher, in 
              February.</p>
              <p>'Had the two sites (along with other tenders) been awarded back then 
              at 'market prices', the current demand-supply mismatch scenario in the 
              residential market may have been more smoothened and price increases for
               such mass market projects more muted overall,' said Mr Cheong.</p>
