              <p><strong>Aug 13, 2011 - ST Forum</strong></p>
              <p>MR GAN Boey Keow's letter ('Adopt Aussie housing rules'; Aug 4) 
              highlighted an Australian measure to maintain home affordability for its
               citizens. Foreign property owners can buy only new properties, so they 
              can sell their properties only to Australians.</p>
              <p>This rule could certainly be applied to 
              Singapore to help stabilise home prices, in view of the significant 
              proportion of foreign buyers here.</p>
              <p>But Australian home prices still rose steeply until 
              this year, due to the huge growth in Australian mortgage financing. With
               up to 95 per cent total loan financing available for Australian houses,
               even overpriced homes seemed achievable to buyers of modest means, 
              especially when coupled with the 'first home buyer's grant' also offered
               in Australia.</p>
              <p>So Australia now has one of the worst 
              ratios of housing affordability among developed countries, with median 
              home prices of about 7.3 times the median annual income, according to a 
              study.</p>
              <p>The same study, by the University of Canberra and a 
              provident fund, found that 60 per cent of first-time home buyers pay 
              more than 30 per cent of their after-tax income on housing.</p>
              <p>With the post-crisis realisation that big loans carry
               big risks, Australians are trying to deleverage their personal balance 
              sheets and housing prices have stalled in many cities.</p>
              <p>How is this relevant to Singapore? According to 
              Monetary Authority of Singapore statistics, housing loans issued by 
              local banks have increased almost twenty-fold since June 1991 and over 
              50 per cent since the 2008 financial crisis alone. Housing and 
              construction loans now account for about half of local banks' loan 
              portfolios and more than half of their annual loan growth in 27 of the 
              past 32 months. It would have been more prudent to stop home buyers from
               over-extending themselves by controlling the growth of housing credit, 
              instead of allowing a bubble where rises in property prices and housing 
              loans far exceed household income growth.</p>
              <p>According to the Department of Statistics, median 
              monthly household income from work increased by just 1.1 per cent from 
              2008 to last year - far less than the 50 per cent growth in housing 
              loans.</p>
              <p>When housing prices fall to reflect the underlying 
              ability of households to service these loans, or future interest rate 
              increases, awkward situations may await recent property buyers with 
              large loans - as well as the banks who lent to them.</p>
