              <p>Alexis Ong<br>inSing.com - 2 hrs 33 mins ago</p>
              <p>The Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize is the quaintest little thing to 
              cross my Facebook newsfeed in a while, and will probably be the 
              quaintest new paperweight on New York mayor Bloomberg's desk.</p>
              <p>Not just because I (and I dare say most people) have never heard of 
              the prize – but the way in which Singapore positioned itself to dish out
               self-proclaimed prestigious accolades.</p>
              <p>Having lived in both cities, I agree that recent public 
              refurbishments in New York, including public park expansion (the High 
              Line is pretty spectacular at sunset) and rezoning efforts have been 
              wonderful examples of thoughtful urban renewal and attractive urban 
              design.</p>
              <p>But isn't it remarkable how these qualities are so hypocritically ignored in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Remember the quiet green oasis on the corner of Orchard and Scotts 
              Road, the one that allowed pedestrians a nice cool reprieve from blocks 
              and blocks glass-fronted concrete? Boom! Gone and replaced by a squat, 
              giant architectural eyesore blasting cold air-con everywhere, streaming 
              out of open mall doors. And what about Bukit Brown, let's not even start
               on that.</p>
              <p>Unlike New York, Singapore is hardly a "walking" city; it's hot and 
              fetidly humid outside, so people crowd indoors, underground, where 
              pedestrian congestion gets downright claustrophobic. When it rains, Liat
               Towers goes swimming. Problems with public transport, especially the 
              deteriorating taxi situation, are a whole other gripe.</p>
              <p>The S$300,000 prize money should be better spent actually improving 
              the flood drainage system on Orchard Road so it actually works.</p>
              <p>This leads me to Professor Kishore Mahbubani's remarks about 
              immigration and how we must learn from New York as a "World City". 
              Conveniently, the award criteria leaves out certain unsaid prerequisites
               – things like civil rights and personal freedoms – markedly absent from
               Singapore, which makes this whole award even more amusing.</p>
              <p>One criterion says the city should be experienced in facing "urban 
              problems". For me, this infers problems beyond structural and 
              environmental planning and delves well into social issues and 
              engineering.</p>
              <p>For instance, take the issue of public parks. New York expands public
               parks and gets a reward. Singapore reduces park acreage in favor of a 
              third designer store and deems itself worthy of giving out awards.</p>
              <p>The park where ION now squats was a haven for foreign workers to 
              gather on the weekends. Public sentiment suggested that many 
              Singaporeans didn't like these congregations.</p>
              <p>In New York, cultural enclaves and unique neighborhoods spring up 
              because the government there is aware that immigrants need their 
              enclaves, need places to socialize, and deserve to carve out a place in 
              society.</p>
              <p>One of the World City Prize criteria is "creating and maintaining a 
              cohesive, endearing and involved community." I'm pretty sure that we can
               all agree that Singaporeans are trained from birth to focus on their 
              own educations, careers, and immediate environments. Professor Mahbubani
               says that Singapore made a mistake in thinking that cultural openness 
              and immigration would be easy, and he's right. It's not.</p>
              <p>If we want Singapore to become an admirable Asian capital city, we 
              have to overcome a few personal prejudices first. New York is a 
              "vibrant, liveable" city because multiculturalism goes beyond a national
               policy.</p>
              <p>It's fine to say that Singapore is a cultural melting pot, but we all
               know that that's just PC-speak. Professor Mahbubani speaks of a 
              partnership between citizens and the government. I wonder when that 
              description could ever describe the dynamic between the average 
              Singaporean and our government?</p>
              <p>My main complaint isn't that Singapore shouldn't give out awards to 
              much older and established cities around the world. It is that we don't 
              deserve to have that kind of authority – no city is, because no city is 
              perfect.</p>
              <p>Here's my two cents: if however we're going to name ourselves experts in city improvement, start small, and start at home.</p>

              <p>Poetic justice.</p>
              <p>You are only talking about the good points about New York. Civil rights and personal freedom? You mean ethnic fiefdoms? New York is breeding ground for crimes. For years the Italian Mafia have been dominating the city with construction rackets, protection rackets, labor rackets, prostitution rackets and extortion rackets. Every month, the Mafia would kill some rival, cut them into pieces and bury their body somewhere. Police are corrupted and known to be mafia henchmen. You forget the Bronx and Queens - not exactly the liveable parts of New York - in fact the parts that many people would like to forget. Central Park? Nobody dares to venture into dare after dark because joggers get raped and people get robbed.</p>
