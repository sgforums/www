              <div class="kicker">FILIAL PIETY</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Does ad convey right values?</h1>
              <p>THE new TV advertisement to promote filial piety - spearheaded by the 
              National Family Council and supported by the Ministry of Community 
              Development, Youth and Sports - has left me disturbed.</p>
              <p>While some people may find it touching, the message of 
              filial piety seems distorted to the point of emphasising the wrong 
              values.</p>
              <p>The ad begins with a grandmother moving in with her son's 
              family after her husband's passing. As she may have been grieving the 
              loss of her husband, she becomes intolerable and picks on her 
              daughter-in-law. She shows no effort to be reasonable even when her son 
              makes attempts to pacify her. She throws tantrums, is ungrateful and 
              threatens to move out.</p>
              <p>When she becomes ill and is hospitalised, her grandson asks 
              his father why he is feeling sad despite his grandmother treating the 
              family badly. It is not revealed whether the father gave his son a 
              proper reply; instead, a flashback shows how his mother had taken care 
              of him when he was ill as a child.</p>
              <p>By his actions, the father seems to be teaching his son that
               it is perfectly fine to disregard his wife's feelings in favour of his 
              mother. It also seems to suggest that it is acceptable for the elderly 
              to create disharmony at home.</p>
              <p>Then came the slogan, 'How one generation loves, the next 
              generation learns'. In this instance, the boy seems to be learning a lot
               of wrong values.</p>
              <p>Shouldn't the authorities have thought of a happier way to 
              teach and instil filial piety - perhaps featuring a happy and 
              well-adjusted family visiting the grandparents, and the parents 
              explaining to their children why it is important to spend more time with
               the elderly to create precious memories for all?</p>
              <p>Or, they could have altered the ad to show the father 
              comforting his wife and acknowledging her feelings in a delicate 
              situation - thereby setting a good example for his son.</p>
              <p>Using an overly domineering grand- parent in an ad to 
              promote filial piety does not send out the intended message. After all, 
              is it not true that one has to show respect to earn respect?</p>

              <div class="kicker">MINISTRY'S TV AD</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Filial piety not a simple matter</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Ms Hannah Chee's letter ('Does ad convey right values?'; 
              yesterday), criticising the TV advertisement on filial piety.</p>
              <p>I enjoyed the ad as it highlighted tensions between young 
              and old. And these tensions do not only involve adult caregivers, but 
              the entire family as well.</p>
              <p>In this case, the teenage son is disdainful of his 
              grandmother's difficult ways and the trouble they cause his parents. He 
              leaves the dinner table in anger when his grandmother criticises his 
              mother's cooking. The father tries to placate his mother by asking her 
              if she wants something else to eat.</p>
              <p>One view of the ad, as Ms Chee suggests, may be simply that 
              one should accommodate unreasonable, and possibly matriarchal, demands.</p>
              <p>My view is that the ad captures a slice of the complexities 
              of life with the elderly.</p>
              <p>Social and practical adjustments must be made when the 
              elderly decide to live with their children. These include physical 
              changes to the home such as installing handbars in toilets and making 
              the home barrier-free.</p>
              <p>Often, changes in social relationships and the physical 
              environment may result in disagreements between family members.</p>
              <p>As women are typically the main care- givers, they bear the 
              brunt of the stress and strain of the relationship between adult 
              caregivers and elderly parents.</p>
              <p>In this respect, I agree with Ms Chee there was a need for 
              the husband to be seen to comfort his wife in the ad.</p>
              <p>However, I disagree with her view that an ad portraying a 
              well-adjusted family visiting the grandparents would have been a happier
               way to instil filial piety.</p>
              <p>Elderly parents and their children may choose to live apart.
               But visiting a healthy elderly parent once a week is different from the
               concerns and stress faced by those caring for the elderly with health 
              or other issues.</p>
              <p>It is also different when weighing the benefits and 
              disadvantages of institutional care for the elderly, which involves 
              financial and emotional concerns.</p>
              <p>These are difficult issues which deserve representation. It 
              is easy to preach the virtues of filial piety without addressing the 
              real tensions involved in elderly care and the relationship between the 
              elderly and the young.</p>
              <p>While this advertisement has its rose- tinted moments, I 
              laud its attempts at realism.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">TV ad on filial piety was effective</h1>
              <p>I REFER to yesterday's letter by Ms Hannah Chee, 'Does ad convey right 
              values?'.</p>
              <p>While I understand her concerns with using an 'overly 
              domineering grandparent' in the TV advertisement, I do not agree that 
              the message is lost with the demonstration of other 'undesirable' 
              values.</p>
              <p>What Ms Chee did not observe in the ad was the circumstance 
              in which the grandmother had to move into her son's home, that is, the 
              death of her husband.</p>
              <p>Such distressing experiences can create insecurities in the 
              elderly and affect their personality.</p>
              <p>The younger generation should demonstrate respect with 
              understanding and forbearance. After all, the elderly in our family 
              deserve our respect as they raised us.</p>
              <p>This outstanding ad not only conveyed the message of filial 
              piety to viewers, but may also remind elderly viewers to reflect on 
              their behaviour so as to sustain harmony within the family.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Favour elderly parents whom we owe so much</h1>
              <p>IN HER letter ('Does ad convey right values?'; yesterday), Ms Hannah 
              Chee criticised a government TV advertisement for distorting filial 
              piety and emphasising the wrong values.</p>
              <p>My view is that there was nothing wrong with the message 
              conveyed.</p>
              <p>Filial piety is an Asian virtue that can scarcely be 
              disputed. The ad reminds us that filial piety remains a relevant, worthy
               and necessary virtue.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee confined filial piety to visiting grandparents in 
              order to create precious memories. Her view suggests that a married 
              adult must leave the parents' home, and fulfilling one's filial duty 
              merely means visiting elderly parents, instead of supporting and caring 
              for them.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee finds the difficult grand- mother portrayed in the 
              ad ungrateful and she does not deserve respect because she has not 
              earned it.</p>
              <p>She also expects an elderly woman, who has toiled for 
              decades to raise her son, to be 'grateful' and 'respectful' when he 
              tries to repay a fraction of what his mother had sacrificed for him.</p>
              <p>Even if Ms Chee's objection is right - that the father in 
              the ad seems to teach his son it is all right to disregard his mother's 
              feelings in favour of his grandmother - we should ask whether that too 
              is objectionable.</p>
              <p>Spouses vow to support each other in sickness and in health,
               and for better or for worse. This surely must mean they are obliged to 
              care for each other's parents - or else those marriage vows ring hollow.</p>
              <p>In an extended family, it is not hard to decide who deserves
               more respect: certainly the elderly parents who have toiled for decades
               to rear their children rather than the young wife or husband whose 
              entry into the spouse's life is far more recent.</p>
              <p>It is also clear who the loved one, caught in the tug of 
              emotion between spouse and parent, should favour: the frail and 
              vulnerable parent whose days are numbered, rather than the young, 
              able-bodied spouse who has a lifetime of familial bliss ahead.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Ad does not convey correct values</h1>
              <p>I REFER to yesterday's letter by Ms Hannah Chee, 'Does ad convey right 
              values?'.</p>
              <p>People grow old and bitter for many reasons, including unmet
               needs arising from disappointments in life, depression and bottled-up 
              anger.</p>
              <p>Whatever the reason, the reality is that it is a tremendous 
              burden to live with a harsh parent or grandparent. And it is an added 
              strain on the family when younger members have other things to deal 
              with.</p>
              <p>When elderly parents are domineering, other children tend to
               stay away and see them as little as possible to avoid conflict.</p>
              <p>I agree the TV advertisement does not convey the correct 
              values as it appears to say one is entitled to be nasty and demanding 
              just because of one's position in life or good deeds done in the past.</p>
              <p>One way to moderate the ad is to have the family see a 
              counsellor and show how counselling helped in reconciliation.</p>

              <p>I REFER to Wednesday's letter by Ms Hannah Chee ('Filial piety: Does ad
               convey right values?').</p>
              <p>In the letter, Ms Chee said she was 'disturbed' by the TV 
              advertisement promoting filial piety because it seemed to emphasise the 
              wrong values.</p>
              <p>Among other things, the ad showed a grandmother unhappy with
               her daughter-in-law's cooking, throwing tantrums and threatening to 
              move out of the house.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee said the ad seemed to convey the idea that it was 
              perfectly fine for the man to disregard his wife's feelings in favour of
               his mother and that it was acceptable for the elderly to create 
              disharmony at home.</p>
              <p>While I agree that the grandmother's behaviour was wrong, I 
              disagree that the ad suggested her behaviour was acceptable. The ad is 
              intended to convey a message of filial piety, of how the younger 
              generation should love the older generation, not the other way round.</p>
              <p>Ms Chee asked: 'Shouldn't the authorities have thought of a 
              happier way to teach and instil filial piety?'</p>
              <p>They could have, but few would learn about filial piety 
              through such 'happy' ads. This ad showed a more realistic family 
              situation, something that most viewers can identify with. It conveys the
               message of showing filial piety even when the elderly are difficult.</p>
              <p>Yes, one has to show respect to earn respect, but this 
              applies to people in leadership positions. Children do not have to earn 
              or work for their parents' love, and neither should parents have to earn
               their children's love.</p>
