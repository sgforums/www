              floor of Block 268 in Tampines Street 21 yesterday morning. No one was 
              hurt by the falling debris. HDB engineers are investigating the case. --

              <p> </p>
              <p>THE Housing Board has stepped up checks on Block 268 in Tampines 
              Street 21 after half of a bedroom window ledge broke and fell from the 
              11th floor on Friday.</p>
              <p>No one was hurt in the incident, which happened at 8.45am.</p>
              <p>Residents said they heard a loud crash before they 
              discovered concrete debris scattered up to 10m from the foot of the 
              block, which faces the carpark.</p>
              <p>A man living in the affected unit, who did not wish to be 
              named, was fuming. He said he had made at least two reports to the 
              Tampines Town Council about cracks in the ledge, but no action was 
              taken.</p>
              <p>'We were being good citizens when we made the reports, but 
              nothing was done and now this has happened,' said the irate resident. 
              'If anyone had been hurt, we would have felt guilty forever even though 
              it wasn't our fault.'</p>
              <p>The Tampines Town Council could not confirm if it had received those reports.</p>
              <p>Residents who need more information on the maintenance of 
              their flats can call the HDB Branch Office Service Line on 
              1800-225-5432.</p>
