              <p>THREE workers died on Tuesday morning when a lorry carrying excess 
              passengers skidded and overturned on the slip road from PIE towards 
              Thomson Road.</p>
              <p>Two died on the spot while another died later at Tan Tock 
              Seng Hospital (TTSH), where 14 others were sent for treatment of 
              injuries. All 17 are Chinese nationals and work for CREC Construction 
              Pte Ltd.</p>
              <p>The lorry skidded and slammed into the metal railings of the
               divider separating the slip road to Thomson Road and the PIE.</p>
              <p>When ambulances arrived at 8.10am, two men were found in a 
              drain along the divider, one of whom was already dead. Most of the 
              vehicle damage was on its left side, with the passenger door smashed in,
               and windshield and left cargo side railing knocked off. Injured workers
               said those with more serious injuries had sat towards the left of the 
              vehicle.</p>
              <p>Traffic police closed off a lane on the slip road and the 
              left-most lane of PIE, causing a rush-hour traffice jam till the lorry 
              was lifted by two tow trucks at 10.45am.</p>
              <p>Eight of the injured who suffered abrasions and simple arm 
              fractures, including the driver, had been discharged from TTSH. Six 
              others were warded, some for trauma and others for minor abrasions, but 
              all are in stable condition.</p>
