              <p>MR TAN Guan Seng's letter ('Worker served with $147,000 C-class bill';
               Jan29) and the response from National University Hospital on the same 
              day ('Patient turned down advice on subsidies') caused me concern as a 
              small and medium-sized enterprise (SME).</p>
              <p>My workers are covered by the Work Injury Compensation Act 
              (Wica) and basic health insurance. In addition, they are encouraged to 
              use a small part of their bonus to pay for additional MediShield 
              coverage as it has portability benefits.</p>
              <p>But Mr Tan's example suggests that if a worker is injured in
               the course of work, he suffers again as the government subsidies - 
              designed to be generous to Singaporeans - are withdrawn and the worker 
              is left to fend for himself after the employer's Wica liability exceeds 
              the limit. Worse, it seems that where high- dependency treatment has to 
              be administered, the MediShield coverage is insufficient.</p>
              <p>SMEs are caught between a rock and a hard place if their employees are mired in medical liabilities.</p>
              <p>An employer may have to retrench staff if he is to help such a worker pay a hefty sum in medical charges.</p>
              <p>Or, he can let the worker fend for himself which will 
              inevitably mean having to contend with an exhausted worker who tries to 
              find other ways to pay off his hospital debt.</p>
              <p>Why must the Ministry of Health's policy insist on the 
              withdrawal of medical subsidies in work-related injuries? Businesses are
               taxpayers too.</p>
