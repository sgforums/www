              <p>A SIMPLE accident turned into high drama when a suspected hit-and-run driver tried to run down a human chain blocking his car.</p>
              <p>In the incident at 9.15am Monday, a grey Mazda is believed to have 
                                  hit a parked grey Toyota (above) as it was turning out of a carpark near
                                   Block 277 in Tampines Street 22.</p>
              <p>The front portion of the Toyota was badly dented and its headlights were shattered, reported Lianhe Wanbao.<br><br>When the Mazda driver tried to leave the scene of the accident, a 
                                  mechanic, Mr Sa'an, 49, tried to block his path, only to duck when the 
                                  car sped towards him.</p>
              <p>He said: "If I didn't react quickly, I'd have been knocked down."</p>
              <p><strong>Heard commotion</strong></p>
              <p>Soon after, the owner of the Toyota and his wife rushed down after hearing the commotion.</p>
              <p>A witness, who gave her name as Madam Xu, told Lianhe Wanbao that the
                                   Mazda driver then stopped near Block 275 and quickly got out of the car
                                   to remove the front and rear number plates.<br><br>She said the owner of the Toyota, who had taken out a wooden stick from his damaged car, chased after the Mazda with his wife.</p>
              <p>Madam Xu and three other women joined the Toyota owner in chasing after the hit-and-run driver.</p>
              <p>Madam Xu was carrying her 19-month-old son in her arms. She and the 
                                  rest managed to catch up with the car just after the driver got in.</p>
              <p>To stop him from driving off, they formed a human chain in front of the car.</p>
              <p>But instead of stepping out of his car, the man drove his car towards
                                   them, forcing them to move out of the way. As he sped away, the owners 
                                  and the other witnesses could only watch helplessly.</p>
              <p>Madam Xu said that in the heat of the moment, she had forgotten that she was carrying her son when she joined the human chain.</p>
              <p>She said: "I didn't expect the driver to be so callous even after seeing the child in my arms.</p>
              <p>"When we saw how angry the owner was, we told him to calm down and took the stick away from him."</p>
              <p>Lianhe Wanbao reported that the police have been told of the Mazda's 
                                  licence plate number and are working to track down the driver.</p>

              <p>Do they really need to resort to such measure? Just take down license plate and report case can liao... If the driver is fine, he would sure step out of vehicle... if he is not in the stage of taking responsiblity at that moment, he would not step out unless he had no choice...</p>
