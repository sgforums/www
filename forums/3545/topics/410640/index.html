              <p><strong>MM Lee says stress of wife's illness harder on him than stresses faced 
              in politics</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hoe Yeen Nie | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 11 September 2010 2028 hrs </span><img style="visibility: hidden;" src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phph0Ue7E.jpg" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said the stress of 
              his wife's illness is harder on him than the stresses he faced for years
               in politics.
              <br> <br> He spoke of his wife in an interview which is carried in the online 
              version of the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said he keeps his wife, who has had a series of strokes, company 
              every night.
              <br> <br> He tells her about his day's work and reads her favourite poems, adding 
              that she keeps awake for him.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said that while he tries to keep busy, from time to time in idle 
              moments, his mind goes back to when they were up and about together. And
               to calm himself, he meditates for 20 minutes at night.
              <br> <br> He said in the interview: "The problem is to keep the monkey mind from 
              running off into all kinds of thoughts. A certain tranquillity settles 
              over you. The day's pressures and worries are pushed out. Then there is 
              less problem sleeping."
              <br> <br> During the interview, Mr Lee notes that some young citizens believe that
               modern Singapore is "a natural state of affairs", that can be put on 
              "auto-pilot". But he said that is not the case.
              <br> <br> He said: "They have come to believe that this is a natural state of 
              affairs, and they can take liberties with it. They think you can put it 
              on auto-pilot. I know that is never so."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said the young people's demand for open political combat may 
              eventually open the door to race-based politics. And this will rip 
              Singapore apart. - CNA/ms </span></p>

              <p>Minister Mentor (MM) <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Lee+Kuan+Yew&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></a> says the stress of his wifeâs illness is harder on him than the stress he faced during hisÂ years in politics.</p>
              <p>MM Lee spoke of his wife, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Kwa+Geok+Choo&amp;amp;fr=fp-today&amp;amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Kwa Geok Choo</span></a>, 89, in an interview on the <em>New York Timesâ</em> <em>Saturday Profile</em>.</p>
              <p>The couple met each other when they were law students in London and have been together for 61 years.</p>
              <p>He shared that his most difficult moment is at the end of each day as he sits by the bedside of his wife who has been unable to move or speak for more than two years.</p>
              <p>âShe understands when I talk to her, which I do every night,â he said. âShe keeps awake for me; I tell her about my dayâs work, read her favourite poems.â</p>
              <p>âI told her, âI would try and keep you company for as long as I can,â before adding, âIâm not sure whoâs going first, whether she or me.âÂ </p>
              <p>MM Lee added that while he tries to keep busy, from time to time in idle moments, his mind goes back to when they were up and about together. To calm himself, he meditates for 20 minutes at night.</p>
              <p>âThe problemÂ is to keep the monkey mind from running off into all kinds of thoughts,â he said. âA certain tranquility settles over you. The dayâs pressures and worries are pushed out. Then thereâs less problem sleeping.â</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The <em>New York Times</em> report also noted how younger people worry him with their demands for more political openness and a free exchange of ideas, secure in their well-being in modern Singapore.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">âThey have come to believe that this is a natural state of affairs, and they can take liberties with it,â he said. âThey think you can put it on auto-pilot. I know that is never so.â</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The kind of open political combat they demand would inevitably open the door to race-based politics, he said, and âour society will be ripped apart.</span></strong>â</p>
              <p>Singaporeâs eldest statesmanÂ also reflected on hisÂ political career and said he wasnât perfect.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">âIâm not sayingÂ that everything I did was right but everything I did was for an honourable purpose,â he said. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">âI had to do some nasty things, locking fellows up without trial.â</span>Â </span></strong></p>

              <p>That is why he cannot retire as he do not how to live his life.</p>
