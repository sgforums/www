              <p>After several years out in the private sector working, I finally surrender to a simple notion today: Only Singaporelangs understand how Singaporelangs think.</p>
              <p><br>It is a strange thing why I bother to write, because if my reader is a Singaporelang, I can just shut my f*** up and they understand somehow, someway, what I mean. It does not need words to express what we has in common... and it's common sense.<br>Singaporelangs have common sense, or at least this is what I thought.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Money does not fall from sky.</li>
              <li>Don't marry an India Indian, she is trouble.</li>
              <li>If you are broke, borrow money from the bank, not your mother.</li>
              <li>PAP will give handouts every time it is near election, after you elect them, you suffer in silence for 4-5 years.</li>
              <li>Honey, use a condom. If I get pregnant, I will have to wake up at 3am every night to make 300ml of milk for a baby, and then 150 ml go into the sink. Spare a thought for the Libyans and Somalis, their kids have no milk to drink.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>My cousin came to me today to tell me about his whole sec 4 class failing english, and it was a conspiracy theory, because his teacher conspired with a outside vendor to set hard hard tests, so that everybody will fail, then after that the teacher will convince the school to send all the students including those who pass English to the outside vendor to attend a 1.5 hour class, and from this class each student will have to pay $10, that's like $300 for an entire level of students, so that everybody gets extra lessons, the vendor gets to earn money, and the teacher does not need to conduct remedial, and still keeps her job.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a culture of its own, and I still cannot figure out what my India Indian classmate in skool is talking to me  about... There are dozens of Indian languages, and just last week I learn that the reason why two Indian classmates don't team together, but rather add me a Singaporelang who skip lesson to their team, because one came from Pakistan, is a Muslim, while the other from East India, is a Hindi Hindu. They speak Engrish, but they don't have anything in common except for both being dark-looking girls. So.. a tutorial-skipping, ignorant, poor, and lazy classmate actually looks more interesting than working with each other.</p>
              <p>Common sense has told me that... just skip the bloody lesson, you won't earn a single cent from attending lessons. Start a business, become an insurance or property agent, either way you still need to work dang hard, to earn peanuts. At least you get paid. Studying won't get you a salary, you pay the government money.</p>
              <p>Still, my latest girlfriend, with her N level cert, reveals to me shyly that she wants to become like me with a degree. Improve her employability. But first, she has to get into was it some Poly or SIM course. She will stay away from the gay bars, and take on another part-time job.</p>
              <p>I would like to share with her, my (new) dear, yes I understand. I am here to hear.</p>
              <p>Who am I to fault?</p>
              <p>Our job market is like a fish market... the sotong and gun-neng fish smell fishy, with lots of flies hovering over the smallest tentacle or gut that pops out from the dead bodies, still.. nothing will deter the flies.</p>
              <p>Come come, eat seafood when fresh. Cheap and good! No need to go over to Malaysia, if you don't like Ang Mo Kio, we got Yakult and Subway. What you like, I cook for you.<br>When I was small, the word "consultant" was like, wow... consultant firms build houses, bridges, all the way down to ERP and SAP software... then the first day i started work, somebody said, sorry loh, our job is to con first then insult. That's all.</p>
              <p>If you not happy, Subway is hiring sandwich designers. McDonalds also need Toilet Specialists.</p>

              <p>aiyah, primary secondary lessons very boring 1. i still recall my past. they teaches you the basics and preps you for further education. learning don;t stop here. still you need to have some base on the bassics lah. after that withh some fundation you can learn better wheny ou go tiertary or after sec education. for eg english or your second lagauage. learnign and undertasning it so that yyou can underatnd and comprehend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after that people say what study until U until poly until A what very smart howlian. these are comments from theos ewho never further study obefore ones, or only hear from their friends nad acquitances.</p>
              <p>depending on what you larn poly or U really is teach you tanji knwoledge ones. although they cannever teach you everything an da better part still requires you to work and laern its still essential.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>life long learning lah. don;t study a little depnds on what? sweet talk and bull crap don;t work on me</p>
