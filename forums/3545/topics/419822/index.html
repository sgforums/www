              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Some 128 
              Bukit Batok and Bukit Batok East residents received their Singapore 
              citizenship certificates at the Bukit Batok Community Club on Saturday. <br><br>At
               the ceremony, deputy chairman of the People's Association (PA) Lim Boon
               Heng urged new Singaporeans to get more involved in the community.<br><br>Heeding
               Mr Lim's call is one couple who became Singaporeans in March 2009. The 
              couple, who came from Myanmar, organised the Bukit Batok Water Festival 
              in April last year. A month later, they also hosted a floor party for 
              about 20 families.<br><br>"If you're willing to participate....there are
               so many festivals. So, the first step is you have to come out to the 
              community, to join the event, then we can meet each other," said Chan 
              Leng Leng, who is Bukit Batok Zone 3 Residents' Committee's auditor.<br><br>To
               facilitate the involvement of new citizens in the community, the PA has
               introduced a new framework.<br><br>Explaining the Strategic Continuous 
              Engagement Framework, PA's chief executive director Yam Ah Mee said it 
              will operate on four levels of engaging new citizens, from social 
              interaction to developing a sense of belonging to the country.<br><br>Mr
               Yam said: "With this systematic approach, we hope to reach out to them 
              more (and) at a much earlier stage."<br><br>Mr Lim also highlighted the 
              role of the PA's 800 Integration and Naturalisation Champions. They are 
              grassroots leaders who reach out to new residents by visiting them and 
              inviting them to floor parties.<br><br>Among the 128 new citizens at 
              Saturday's event was Jeannette Ho. <br><br>Previously a Malaysian, the 
              mother of three said it was a natural progression to become a 
              Singaporean, having already been here for 17 years. <br><br>"I come from
               a mixed marriage. My kids and all, we were so welcome and so 
              well-accepted in Singapore," she said. <br><br>".....the meritocracy of 
              the system, and how friendly everybody is (in Singapore), it's a safe, 
              secure, wonderful place to have a family," she added.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>Quite amaze to see the article in GRASSROOT CoNNect (A monthly newsletter to grassroot leaders)  that the STATISTIC  in the increase of Grassroot leaders over a year period.  They wrote 3000- 4000 grassroot leaders being confirmed in a short time.</p>
              <p>They indicate the number of participants involved in community events have increases. Frankly I felt all this statistic numbers are balloon and have no reliable figures to support.</p>
              <p>Q1: Have our MP Advisors really signed/approved so many new grassroot leaders in his/her own constituency within 2years? There are 84 constituency and 4000 divide by 84, each constituency should have about 48 new members recruited in each constituency. I doubt so, being a GRL i DONT SEE so many new faces in my own ward.  Could the 3000-4000 means that some GRL wearing multiple hats??? Even so it shouldnt be these qty.</p>
              <p>Q2: Have our MP Advisors always see the same faces of residents participating in a community event? Brisk Walk/Block Parties/Floor Parties? I felt at times the Constituency Officer just want to make their report nice and balloon the number of participants. Make a comparison of past community events and now do you find that majority of people are heading towards commercial events (Eg SAFRA/ StandChart/ NIKE Walk etc....) Certainly the branding of the commercial one attracts better than the HEARTLAND one. Frankly PA activities are losing it's appeal to the younger one now. Most will head for the big masses.</p>
              <p>Being in the grassroot movement for sometime,  I find those sitting on top should WAKE UP THEIR IDEAS, not just make reports to look nice on paper. Certainly with the STARS grading system it make everyone write extra more in their minutes.</p>
              <p>Go and check around, is the sub group or activities or memberships.tally with the report? Out of 100% how many are the pillar of the grassroot organization? Most of the time are the PA Staff that is working not the GRL.  GRL just facilitating what PA want.</p>

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: Some 128 Bukit Batok and Bukit Batok East residents received their Singapore citizenship certificates at the Bukit Batok Community Club on Saturday.<br><br>At the ceremony, deputy chairman of the People's Association (PA) Lim Boon Heng urged new Singaporeans to get more involved in the community.<br><br>Heeding Mr Lim's call is one couple who became Singaporeans in March 2009. The couple, who came from Myanmar, organised the Bukit Batok Water Festival in April last year. A month later, they also hosted a floor party for about 20 families.<br><br>"If you're willing to participate....there are so many festivals. So, the first step is you have to come out to the community, to join the event, then we can meet each other," said Chan Leng Leng, who is Bukit Batok Zone 3 Residents' Committee's auditor.<br><br>To facilitate the involvement of new citizens in the community, the PA has introduced a new framework.<br><br>Explaining the Strategic Continuous Engagement Framework, PA's chief executive director Yam Ah Mee said it will operate on four levels of engaging new citizens, from social interaction to developing a sense of belonging to the country.<br><br>Mr Yam said: "With this systematic approach, we hope to reach out to them more (and) at a much earlier stage."<br><br>Mr Lim also highlighted the role of the PA's 800 Integration and Naturalisation Champions. They are grassroots leaders who reach out to new residents by visiting them and inviting them to floor parties.<br><br>Among the 128 new citizens at Saturday's event was Jeannette Ho.<br><br>Previously a Malaysian, the mother of three said it was a natural progression to become a Singaporean, having already been here for 17 years.<br><br>"I come from a mixed marriage. My kids and all, we were so welcome and so well-accepted in Singapore," she said.<br><br>".....the meritocracy of the system, and how friendly everybody is (in Singapore), it's a safe, secure, wonderful place to have a family," she added.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>I think we need to reexamine the spokeman for PA (Grassroot Organization) Are the activities conducted by PA really grows in number? Or just the Constituency Manager like &amp; write their reports to sound nice to their respective MP.</p>
              <p>There's a popular saying in the BIBLE (The most popular and best selling book in the world with many languages)</p>
              <p>2Timothy Chap4:2-4 </p>
              <p>In time to come, all false teaching will surfaces and these teacher will say things that tickles the ear. So that people will turn away from the truth.</p>
