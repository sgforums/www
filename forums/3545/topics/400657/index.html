              <h1 class="storyheadline">By 
              																				Selina Lum</h1>
              <p>HIS history of performing death-defying stunts to raise funds for Ren 
              Ci Hospital has earned convicted Buddhist monk Ming Yi a reduction in 
              sentence for his role over an unauthorised $50,000 loan to his former 
              aide.</p>
              <p>The High Court on Thursday cut his original 10-month jail 
              term to six months, bringing it lower than the nine-month jail term of 
              his ex-personal assistant Raymond Yeung.</p>
              <p>Ming Yi, 48, and Yeung, 35, were convicted by a district 
              court in October last year on charges that included falsifying accounts 
              and misappropriation of funds following a high-profile trial over the 
              unauthorised loan granted to the aide from the charity's coffers in May 
              2004.</p>
              <p>Ming Yi was sentenced to 10 months' jail on four charges; 
              Yeung was given nine months' jail on two charges. Both appealed against 
              their convictions and sentences.</p>
              <p>In allowing Ming Yi's appeal against sentence, Justice Tay 
              Yong Kwang said he accepted that misuse of funds in a charitable 
              organisation was a serious offence. However, the judge noted it was 
              public knowlegde that Ming Yi had risked life and limb in much 
              publicised fund-raising efforts.</p>
              <p>'In my opinion, one wrongdoing does not have to be so 
              overwhelming that the many good deeds are completely forgotten and 
              interred with the bones,' said Justice Tay.</p>
              <p>Justice Tay dismissed Yeung's appeal against sentence, 
              noting that his contribution 'paled in comparison' to Ming Yi's and that
               Yeung was the one who benefitted and had played an active role in 
              trying to cover up the offence.</p>
