              <p>MY SON, 17, has cerebral palsy and walks with the aid of a walking 
              frame. He and his friend decided to take a bus from Promenade MRT 
              station to Marina Bay Sands on the evening of March 25.</p>
              <p>When they saw a bus ramp and an external service button on 
              SBS bus service 133, they flagged for it. When the bus came to a halt, 
              my son's friend proceeded to lower the ramp as he had done on several 
              occasions on Wheelchair Accessible Buses (WAB).</p>
              <p>But the bus driver got off his seat, approached the boys and
               berated them. He was angry that my son's friend had not informed him 
              first. Further to the humiliation from the scolding, the boys were told 
              to get off the bus.</p>
              <p>My son, who was already seated by this time, had no choice 
              but to leave the bus. They walked to their destination, a more than half
               an hour's journey for my son who walks with difficulty.</p>
              <p>Subsequently, I called SBS for an explanation.</p>
              <p>It was understandable that the boys had mistaken service 133
               for a WAB bus, given the presence of a ramp at the side of the bus. But
               was it necessary for the driver to berate and order them off the bus? 
              Is the driver trained to handle non-routine matters? And why is there an
               accessible ramp on the bus that remains unused?</p>
              <p>The customer service staff, although pleasant and helpful, could not satisfactorily answer my questions.</p>
              <p>I was told that as service 133 is not a WAB, the driver 
              should have declined to pick up my son. Does that mean that the driver 
              should just drive past disabled persons, whether in wheelchairs or 
              otherwise? And if that were so, might these passengers not assume the 
              driver had missed them and continue waiting for the next bus, only to 
              have the next driver repeat the practice?</p>
              <p>Second, I was told that all new buses are equipped with 
              accessible ramps. That however, does not mean that the buses are WABs. 
              What puzzles me is that since buses are already equipped with ramps, why
               does SBS not use them? The explanation given is that they are in the 
              process of making all bus stops accessible.</p>
              <p>I feel a deeper discussion on public bus accessibility is 
              needed and I look forward to handicap- and family-accessible bus 
              services that can benefit all. We are making steps in the right 
              direction; the debate should be about how much more, and how much faster
               we should do this.</p>
