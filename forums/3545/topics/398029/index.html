              <p><strong>Singapore can look forward to good year</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh  | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 30 April 2010 1837 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has declared this year a
               "good year", with Singapore emerging from the financial storm in a 
              strong position.
              <br> <br> In his May Day message, he urged Singaporeans to take the opportunity to
               push forward with improving productivity and transforming the economy.
              <br> <br> Prime Minister Lee's optimism comes on the back of a revised growth 
              forecast of 7 to 9 per cent for Singapore economy this year.
              <br> <br> But he cautioned Singaporeans to see the remarkable performance in 
              perspective.
              <br> <br> The first-quarter growth of 13 per cent year on-year reflects the 
              volatility of a small open economy.
              <br> <br> And Mr Lee said some sectors like electronics and biomedical  sciences 
              expanded sharply but others had not done quite as well.
              <br> <br> Prime Minister Lee believes that with everyone's concerted effort, 
              Singapore can maintain its lead. 
              <br> <br> While firms push on with the productivity effort, workers need to 
              improve and achieve greater mastery at their jobs.
              <br> <br> Workers' upgrading is a marathon without a finish line, said Prime 
              Minister Lee. 
              <br> <br> He noted that during the downturn last year, workers had taken the 
              opportunity to upgrade their skills. 
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said this momentum must continue even as the economy has 
              improved.
              <br> <br> He noted that with the strong pickup, many companies are restoring the 
              wage cuts while others are awarding bonuses and increments, depending on
               their improved performances.
              <br> <br> He said these companies have remembered the sacrifices made by workers 
              during the crisis.
              <br> <br> These actions are strengthening the trust between workers and employers,
               said Prime Minister Lee. 
              <br> <br> He urged companies to work with unions to build up variable bonuses, and
               structure their wage systems to be more flexible over the longer term.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee credited tripartism as a key competitive advantage in Singapore, 
              and promised to continue to pay special attention to low-wage workers.
              <br> <br> "Singapore has successfully tackled past challenges because of our 
              strong tripartite partnership. Unions work with employers and the 
              government to enlarge the pie so that all will have more to share," he 
              said.
              <br> <br> "Investors and businesses value highly our collaborative spirit, facing 
              difficulties and solving problems together. Our track record of 
              tripartism is a key competitive advantage that wins investments and 
              brings in jobs for Singaporeans," added Mr Lee. 
              <br> <br> "Our union leaders understand what Singapore's prosperity, and our 
              workers' well-being, depend upon. They know that there is no substitute 
              for hard work, ingenuity and enterprise. They have done much to help 
              workers understand the economic trends affecting them, and encourage 
              them to go for retraining and upgrading," said Mr Lee.
