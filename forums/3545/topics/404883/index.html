              <h1 class="storyheadline">When filial piety is not enough</h1>
              <p>MY FATHER died 16 years ago from complications of emphysema, a disease
               arising from years of smoking. It was a pernicious habit that caused 
              great friction in the household. Till now, not a single day passes when I
               walk by his previous room that memories of him are not revived.</p>
              <p>He was a traditional Confucian father not given to much 
              expression of mawkish sentiment to his nine children. The present-day 
              philosophy of loving your children to death and embracing their 
              character-despoiling traits or other warts was not one he understood or 
              practised at all. When we were rambunctious and broke the golden rule 
              that children should be seen and not heard, he let his displeasure be 
              heard, silencing us with a gruff "harrumph".</p>
              <p>If we were ill-disciplined, he let his temper be felt for he
               wielded a mean rotan. When we were good, there were no rewards, for why
               should children be rewarded for behaving as they should in the grand 
              order of things?</p>
              <p>We were never mollycoddled and never the beneficiary of the 
              present-day parental habit of explicit confessions of affection from 
              him. His responsibilities, which he fulfilled to the full to his most 
              stringent standards, were in the provision of acceptable board and 
              lodging, the teaching of discipline and moral values, and most 
              importantly, the instilling of how paramount scholastic achievement was,
               making sure we applied ourselves assiduously to school studies.</p>
              <p>Yet we never felt unloved, even if all the love was implicit
               only in action. Indeed, any oral affirmation of endearment would have 
              been an embarrassment to fathers of yore.</p>
              <p>When he was in his dotage and frail with illness, we cared 
              for him as dutiful children with a bounden responsibility would.</p>
              <p>How I wish we had freed ourselves from our psychological 
              upbringing constraints and expressed our maudlin sentiments of love and 
              affection for him when he was still alive and appreciative, involving 
              ourselves more emotionally in his daily life as he aged and then died, 
              loved yet not hearing it.</p>
              <p>To the filial in all of us, parents may seem a burden and an
               imposition. Yet even when all has been done for them when they were 
              alive, the feeling of being remiss and not having done enough persists 
              when they are departed.</p>

              <div class="kicker">FILIAL PIETY</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">The invisible daughter-in-law</h1>
              <p>WHILE researching elderly Chinese living in sheltered housing in 
              Britain, I was struck by how often daughters-in-law were rendered 
              invisible.</p>
              <p>They did not feature in family photo albums nor were they 
              talked about, except negatively, which is probably why these older 
              Chinese were living on their own.</p>
              <p>Why, I wonder, would this generation of women, who had 
              suffered the wrath of their own mothers-in-law, treat their 
              daughters-in-law so unkindly?</p>
              <p>It transpired that before our marriage, my husband told his 
              parents in no uncertain terms where I, his wife-to-be, would stand in 
              the event of any future conflict.</p>
              <p>And I, from as soon as I was able to, had been preparing my 
              son for life away from mum and dad (that is, be able to cook and clean),
               just as my parents-in-law had my husband. I wrote to them soon after we
               were married, thanking them for bringing up their son so brilliantly.</p>
              <p>Clearly we are talking about different patterns of relating 
              between generations, and in many ways, between cultures. The cultural 
              shift in residential patterns had been immense in less than two 
              generations: from new brides (especially of eldest sons) living with 
              their parents-in-law, to young couples starting married life in new 
              homes (leaving ageing parents to single siblings), to widowed or sickly 
              parents moving in with daughters instead of sons.</p>
              <p>There is no longer a norm but a question of pragmatic 
              arrangements.</p>
              <p>Of course, my mother-in-law and I have differences. However,
               because she treats me with utmost respect, I reciprocate. And whenever I
               find her 'annoying', I remember that she is the woman who made my 
              husband what he is, for which I must be eternally thankful.</p>
              <p>Filial piety manifests itself in different ways. We come 
              from very different experiences of language, education, history and, 
              yes, family conflict. It is futile to expect a one-size-fits-all 
              solution.</p>
              <p>However, if we must be prescriptive, I would venture that 
              the flipside of filial piety is respect. And respect - mutual respect - 
              cannot be imposed.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Letting go is part of parenting too</h1>
              <p>THE TV advertisement portraying filial piety wants to "fix" a 
              perceived social ill, but at the risk of another - broken marriages and 
              divorces.</p>
              <p>One day I too will be weaker, perhaps senile, needing 
              physical care and taking my last breath. My children love me because 
              they were loved. Neglecting their work and their own families to care 
              for me would be an inappropriate expression of that love.</p>
              <p>Financial stress, in-laws and infidelity have been the top 
              three causes for the rising number of divorces. On my death bed, I want 
              to see all my children holding hands with their spouses and children, 
              knowing that their own family units are strong. They will not be among 
              the statistics for divorce and broken homes.</p>
              <p>The joy of parenting includes letting our children go to 
              create their lives with their own families, just as we did in our youth.</p>
