              <p><strong>Think small and put the buzz into Singapore</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">17 May 2001</span></p>
              <p>Lydia Lim / The Straits Times</p>
              <p>HE SPOKE with passion — and at length — about how to make Singapore 
              one of the great cities in the world to live in, comparable to places 
              like San Francisco and Vancouver.</p>
              <p><a href="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hdb_1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-850" title="hdb_1" src="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hdb_1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=243" alt="" width="300" height="243"></a>Mr
               Jonathon Sze, an engineer, was one of 13 people to speak at a public 
              forum held to discuss the draft of the 2001 Concept Plan, which will 
              guide Singapore’s physical development in the next decade.</p>
              <p>He was brimming with ideas on how to make this country more vibrant, 
              more attractive to foreign talent and, therefore, more competitive.</p>
              <p>Why not have jetties along the Singapore River so that people can 
              travel to and from their waterfront homes in boats, creating a new kind 
              of “high society living”, he asked.</p>
              <p>Why does Hongkong have a buzz but not Singapore? Well, because 
              Hongkongers live close to their places of work, leisure and learning, he
               said, answering his own question. So after work, they head home for a 
              shower, then head out again.</p>
              <p>They are “motivated to socialise”, he said.</p>
              <p>In contrast, Singaporeans spend up to an hour commuting and are so 
              knackered by the time they reach their doorsteps, they don’t want to 
              step out again, he added, concluding that this is where Hongkong has a 
              competitive advantage.</p>
              <p>At the end of his extended presentation, National Development 
              Minister Mah Bow Tan, who was chairing the forum, said with a smile: “I 
              can’t disagree with any of the points you’ve made.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">“I just want to add one point though. 
              Maybe it’s because Hongkongers’ flats are smaller than Singaporeans’ 
              that they spend more time outdoors,”</span> he said, to much laughter from the 300-strong crowd.</p>
              <p>Of all the points raised at last Friday’s dialogue, I found this last comment by the minister the most telling.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><a href="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hdb_pana2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-851" title="hdb_pana2" src="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/hdb_pana2.jpg?w=700" alt=""></a>It said to me that flat size is an issue that is still on the minds of Singapore’s leaders and urban planners. And rightly so.</span></p>
              <p>With so little land to be shared among so many competing uses, 
              housing density — that is the number of housing units on a given piece 
              of land — is a key issue in urban planning.</p>
              <p>In September last year, The Straits Times published a front-page 
              article that was headlined “Get set for smaller homes in future”.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">It quoted Mr Mah as saying that with 
              shrinking family sizes, it was “only logical” to build smaller homes. 
              However, it would be difficult to get people to accept the idea.</span></p>
              <p>“Human nature being such, I think we still want to have same-size 
              houses even though the sizes of households are getting smaller,” he said
               in last year’s interview.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">“So it does not follow that we will be 
              able to reduce the house sizes too much, but I think over time, this has
               got to be the trend,” he added.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The article was reprinted in the Chinese and Malay newspapers and set off a feedback frenzy.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many people called the Housing Board and the URA to register their unhappiness with any plans to reduce flat sizes.</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Smaller flats emerged as the top housing issue last year, prompting the most number of responses to the Feedback Unit.</span></p>
              <p><a href="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/singapore-hdb.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-852" title="singapore-hdb" src="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/singapore-hdb.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169" alt="" width="300" height="169"></a>The issue also sparked a heated exchange on the Straits Times Interactive (STI) website, where 200 people posted their views.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Most who called or wrote to the 
              various government departments and the STI were strongly opposed to the 
              idea. Some felt it contradicted the Government’s push to encourage 
              Singaporeans to have more babies. Others railed against the unfairness 
              of shrinking HDB flats that kept ballooning in price.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Much of the unhappiness was due to a misunderstanding of what the minister had in mind.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah was not announcing HDB’s plans to shrink flats.</p>
              <p>He was merely pointing out that if the average size of a Singapore 
              household falls from four to three, which it is expected to do with 
              rising affluence, then it only makes sense to build smaller homes <span style="color: #ff0000;">so that more land can be set aside for parks and other uses.</span></p>
              <p>I agree.</p>
              <p>I am not suggesting that in the future, all families — regardless of 
              size — be squeezed into the equivalent of a three-room flat. Neither was
               the minister.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">What I am suggesting is that both public
               and private sectors build smaller homes to cater to the growing number 
              of couples with no children, and singles. This will allo</span>w us to house a bigger population, yet preserve the greenery, old buildings and neighbourhoods precious to so many Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>To make the idea more palatable, I suggest a name change for HDB homes.</p>
              <p>Instead of labelling flats as either five- or four-room, thus 
              bringing with it the attendant associations of first and second class, 
              why not market public housing like private condominiums?</p>
              <p>Flats could be named after the precinct they are in, such as Sengkang
               Cove or Punggol Point. This would go hand-in-hand with the HDB’s pilot 
              build-to-order scheme, which invites flat-buyers to choose flats in 
              specific locations.</p>
              <p>The price, of course, would still depend on the size of the individual unit.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I think this would go a long way to 
              assuage the angst against smaller flats, which I believe is due more to 
              material aspirations than any crying need for bigger living spaces.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">After all, the average working adult spends very little time at home, as work is likely to swallow up two-thirds of his day.</span></p>
              <p>I think the minister may be right to suggest that if homes become 
              smaller, Singaporeans will change their lifestyles accordingly.</p>
              <p>In a recent article, architect and planning consultant Robert Powell 
              argued that old Chinatown enjoyed a vibrant street life because people’s
               homes were smaller, and so they tended to go out more, transforming the
               street into “a communal living room”.</p>
              <p>My memory does not stretch that far back, but I do recall visiting a 
              friend, a Japanese girl, who lived in the heart of Paris with her 
              family.</p>
              <p>Their flat was tiny, her bedroom so cramped that she had no space for
               a bed. She slept on the floor on a mattress, which she pushed against 
              the wall during the day so that she would have more room to move around.</p>
              <p>Yet, I don’t think the size of her flat compromised her quality of life in any way.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, she thrived in Paris, a city she knew as well as the back of her hand.</p>
              <p><a href="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ngbbs4dcb91f4d3dd0.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-853" title="ngbbs4dcb91f4d3dd0" src="http://singapore2025.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/ngbbs4dcb91f4d3dd0.jpg?w=300&amp;h=198" alt="" width="300" height="198"></a>She
               showed me where to get a top-class panorama of the city, not the Eiffel
               Tower, but the roof of a shopping centre called the Samaritaine; where 
              to head for the definitive display of Monet’s water lilies, and what to 
              look out for when visiting Notre Dame Cathedral, whose facade she 
              described as “perfect”.</p>
              <p>From her, I learnt that it’s not the size of one’s flat that matters but the broadness of one’s mind.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Smaller flats will take some getting 
              used to. But, instead of bemoaning the lack of space, which good design 
              and clever layout can go a long way to compensate, why not look forward 
              to less time spent cleaning up at home, and more time spent meeting and 
              mingling with others, or indulging in a whole range of sports and other 
              leisure activities?</span></p>
              <p>Let’s not close our minds to the idea that smaller flats may mean bigger buzz and broader horizons.</p>

              <p>I don't get to follow the logic where smaller household size should equal to a smaller flat. Sometimes I wonder if ministers think their brain because the logic doesn't follows.</p>
              <p>If they have a problem with housing, then there are many ways to resolve this problem, including solving their own previous "solution" of importing so many people if you do not have the good means to cater for them. When I said cater, I mean including public transportation, don't always fail and breakdown.</p>
              <p>There are many ways to resolve housing problem, but yet all they can think of is to reduce the house size, so sad... and we're paying them millions of dollars using taxpayers' money.</p>
