              <p><span id="lw_1322042910_4" class="yshortcuts">Yahoo!</span> Southeast Asia filed 
              on Tuesday a memorandum of appearance with the courts to defend itself against 
              allegations by <span id="lw_1322042910_0" class="yshortcuts">Singapore Press 
              Holdings</span> that the digital media company had infringed on its 
              copyright.<br><br>"We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this suit," 
              <span id="lw_1322042910_5" class="yshortcuts">Yahoo!</span> Southeast Asia managing 
              editor Alan Soon said on Wednesday. "Our editorial business model of acquired, 
              commissioned and original content is proven."<br><br>In its claim, SPH cited 23 
              articles which it alleged were reproduced from its stable of newspapers without 
              permission. <span id="lw_1322042910_6" class="yshortcuts">Yahoo!</span> has denied 
              the allegations in an earlier letter to SPH's lawyers.<br><br>Observers in the 
              media industry however were divided in their opinions on the 
              lawsuit.<br><br>Media consultant and former newspaper editor PN Balji said the 
              legal suit has to be seen in the larger context of falling readership at The 
              Straits Times. “The drop in readership, if not arrested quickly, will have a 
              negative impact on its advertisement revenue,” he told <em>Yahoo! 
              Singapore.</em><br><br>He also referred to a case wherein <span id="lw_1322042910_1" class="yshortcuts">MediaCorp</span> had sued RecordTV over 
              copyright infringement in 2007 after the latter, which operates a <span id="lw_1322042910_7" class="yshortcuts">recording system</span> in its website, 
              allowed Internet users to request the recording of broadcast and films produced 
              by the national broadcaster.<br><br>It was reported by Today that <span id="lw_1322042910_2" class="yshortcuts">MediaCorp</span> initially won the case in 
              December 2009 through the High Court, but the judgement was overruled by the 
              Court of Appeals, which stated that public interest was better provided by 
              allowing, instead of repressing, RecordTV’s <span id="lw_1322042910_8" class="yshortcuts">recording system</span>, especially when <span id="lw_1322042910_3" class="yshortcuts">MediaCorp</span> did not suffer any loss due 
              to this. Both sides eventually came to a confidential agreement.<br><br>On the 
              other hand, Nanyang Technological University associate professor Cherian George, 
              director of the Asia Journalism Fellowship, said the case raised important 
              questions of professional ethics. He noted that how articles are attributed have 
              been changing as a result of news aggregation.<br><br>“So there is an on-going 
              debate internationally about what's the right way to make use of other sites' 
              material,” he said.<br><br>He pointed out the case of a top American blogger Jim 
              Romenesko who resigned from Poynter, a leading institute for journalism 
              training, after running its blog for 12 years. Media reports said Romenesko’s 
              resignation came after a dispute with the school’s director over improper 
              attribution in his articles.<br><br>George said, “So, leaving aside the issues 
              of intellectual property, intellectual honesty demands that articles drawing on 
              others' work use quotation marks and links.”<br><br><strong>Readers comment on 
              lawsuit</strong><br><br>Since news of the lawsuit broke out, Yahoo! readers have 
              been furiously posting their thoughts on the comments section.<br><br>Among 
              those who posted, reader Useblain said, “Perhaps the national paper is just 
              unhappy about the amount of traffic that Yahoo! Singapore has been experiencing, 
              and the chord it has struck with Singaporeans from all walks of life? Like, grow 
              up, please.” <br><br>Another Yahoo! user Law65lee said the lawsuit could be one 
              of the biggest and interesting cases of the decade.<br><br>“Two giant media 
              companies locking horns on infringement of news issues. Must be one of the 
              biggest and interesting suit of the decade. Both companies will not be find 
              lacking of news feeds for the public which I think will be awaiting the big 
              outcome,” it said.</p>

              <div class="bd">Yahoo! Southeast Asia filed its defence and counterclaim against 
              Singapore Press Holdings with the High Court on Tuesday, denying all 
              allegations of wrongful copyright infringement by SPH.<br> <br>In its 
              defence, Yahoo! SEA highlighted the fundamental principle that copyright
               law does not protect facts and information and that the public has the 
              right to be informed of news and current events in Singapore. <br> <br>The
               internet company also filed a counterclaim which alleges that on at 
              least two known occasions over the last year, SPH had itself 
              substantially reproduced Yahoo! content on its citizen-journalism site 
              STOMP.<br> <br>On 18 Nov, SPH filed a copyright infringement suit 
              against Yahoo!, citing as examples 23 articles which it alleged the 
              internet company had reproduced from its stable of newspapers without 
              permission.<br> <br>SPH operates 18 newspapers titles in four languages.
               The publicly-held company, which also operates non-media assets such as
               property and retail, charges S$26.65 a month for access to the online 
              version of its flagship The Straits Times newspaper. Its daily print 
              version costs 90 cents. <br> <br>Yahoo! provides free local and international news coverage to anyone with access to the internet.<br> <br>The
               landmark case, which has attracted global media attention, pits a 
              traditional media owner against a new media company and is believed to 
              be the first of its kind in Singapore.</div>
