              <h3 class="date_story">Dec 2, 2010 - Straits Times</h3>
              <p>ON BEHALF of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG), I 
              apologise to Mr Richard Ho for the poor response he received when he 
              called our helpline ('Casino exclusion: Family frustrated by red tape'; 
              last Saturday).</p>
              <p>I understand his deep concern that one of his family members
               has fallen prey to problem gambling.</p>
              <p>Mr Ho has highlighted that his family member turned 
              aggressive when the family warned him that they would apply to enrol him
               in the family exclusion scheme.</p>
              <p>Indeed, it is precisely because of the family tension and 
              conflict that accompanies every single application for a family 
              exclusion order that we had designed the workflow to start with a family
               conference with trained and experienced counsellors.</p>
              <p>Over the past few months, we have been working with Tanjong 
              Pagar Family Service Centre - the centre that receives family casino 
              exclusion applications - to review the application process.</p>
              <p>We have since decided that while we must try to help 
              families manage the tensions and conflict from an application for family
               exclusion, we must also bear in mind the great urgency felt by such a 
              family to put an immediate stop to the gambling.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we will change our workflow such that all 
              applications will be heard by NCPG while Tanjong Pagar Family Service 
              Centre will concurrently try to encourage families to work through the 
              often complex and difficult family issues that problem gambling would 
              have caused.</p>
              <p>Mr Ho had stated that he was informed that there were more 
              than 300 applications still waiting to be processed. There are, in fact,
               73 cases which the council will hear this month.</p>
              <p>I thank Mr Ho for highlighting the difficulties in the 
              implementation of family exclusion applications. Remedial measures have 
              been taken.</p>

               Gambling</strong></p>
