              <p><strong>Foreign wives receive equal protection as S'porean wives: DPM Wong</strong><br> <span class="update">By Sona Remesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 19 July 2010 2150 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Foreign wives of Singaporean men receive equal 
              protection under the law as Singaporean wives, says Deputy Prime 
              Minister and Home Affairs Minister Wong Kang Seng.
              <br> <br> Mr Wong was responding to queries on the rights of the rising number of 
              foreign wives sought by low-income Singaporean men.
              <br> <br> MP Irene Ng had questioned if laws were in place to ensure these women 
              were not victims of abuse or trafficking.
              <br> <br> On abuse, Mr Wong said the Women's Charter offers protection against 
              family violence.
              <br> <br> Abused wives, whether Singaporeans or foreigners, can apply for a 
              Personal Protection order from their husbands. 
              <br> <br> Police who receive reports on suspected spousal violence are also on 
              hand to advise on available assistance.
              <br> <br> Mr Wong said Singapore has a strict regime to combat the problem of 
              human trafficking.
              <br> <br> These include tough enforcement actions and security checks at the 
              various checkpoints.
              <br> <br> Police also leverage on intelligence sources and engage foreign 
              organisations like Interpol to prevent and identify potential victims of
               trafficking.
              <br> <br> So far, the police has not received any reports from foreign brides 
              alleged to be victims of trafficking. 
              <br> <br> On the issue of whether these brides will be issued long term visit 
              passes to stay with their husbands, Mr Wong said the key consideration 
              is whether the Singaporean can support his or her foreign spouse 
              financially.
              <br> <br> So far the success rate of foreign spouses applying for long-term visit 
              pass has been 86 per cent.
