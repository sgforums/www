              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Singapore prides itself on being a clean and green city but a booming 
              economy and a high-consumption lifestyle have made it one of the world's
               biggest carbon polluters per person.<br><br>As a major United Nations 
              summit is being held in Mexico to find ways of curbing the carbon 
              emissions blamed for global warming, Singapore's environmental balancing
               act poses challenging questions for the rest of Asia and the world.<br><br>Singapore's
               green credentials are in many ways very strong and it is establishing 
              itself as a regional renewable energy hub.<br><br>Yet, if all Asians 
              emulated Singaporeans' modern and often luxurious lifestyles, greenhouse
               gas emissions would spike alarmingly.<br><br>"If everyone in the world 
              enjoyed the same level of consumption as the average Singaporean, we 
              would need three planets to meet the demands placed on our resources," 
              World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) spokesman Chris Chaplin said.<br><br>Singapore
               was last month listed by the British global risk advisory firm 
              Maplecroft as the world's seventh largest carbon dioxide (CO2) emitter 
              relative to its population size.<br><br>Ahead of it were only the United
               Arab Emirates, Australia, the United States, Canada, the Netherlands 
              and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Maplecroft's index was calculated by evaluating
               annual CO2 emissions from energy use, emissions per capita and 
              cumulative emissions of a country over more than a century -- 1900 to 
              2006.<br><br>"The lack of 'clean' energy sources coupled with the growth
               in Singapore’s economy and the increasing use of cars as well as 
              electronic appliances such as air-conditioners contribute to Singapore's
               emissions," Maplecroft said in a statement to AFP.<br><br>Despite a 
              punishing auto levy and road charges, the number of motor vehicles on 
              its roads reached 925,518 in 2009, up more than 27 percent in five 
              years, with private cars making up 60 percent of the total, official 
              figures show.<br><br>In a separate list, the WWF ranked Singapore 21st 
              in the world in terms of ecological footprint, or the demand for 
              resources per person, ahead of such countries as Germany, France and 
              Britain.<br><br>WWF's calculation covered not only emissions -- the 
              biggest component of humanity's carbon footprint -- but also demand 
              placed by people on arable land, fishing grounds, forest and grazing 
              land worldwide.<br><br>Singapore authorities insist, however, that that 
              the country has had no choice but to rely on imported fossil fuel to 
              power its rapid industrialisation.<br><br>The trade-reliant economy, 
              valued at 200 billion US dollars in 2009, is tipped to expand by a 
              massive 15 percent this year.<br><br>With a land area smaller than that 
              of New York City, Singapore has no space among its five million citizens
               for wind farms, while it is devoid of hydro and geothermal power 
              sources.<br><br>"We are dependent on fossil fuels because our small size
               severely limits our ability to switch to alternative energies," the 
              National Environment Agency (NEA) said in a statement to AFP.<br><br>It 
              said Maplecroft's index neither reflected Singapore's efforts to reduce 
              its carbon emissions nor took into account its unique circumstances.<br><br>"As
               a small city-state, the use of per capita emissions inflates our carbon
               emissions," it said, noting that overall, Singapore accounts for less 
              than 0.2 percent of global emissions.<br><br>Nevertheless, the 
              government said it was committed to the fight against climate change and
               was taking steps to reduce the growth of its emissions, including 
              switching from oil to natural gas to produce electricity.<br><br>Singapore
               is investing heavily in clean energy technologies -- it has allocated 
              770 million dollars to develop innovative energy solutions -- and is 
              building a liquefied natural gas terminal that will be ready by 2013.<br><br>This
               will allow access to gas sources beyond neighbouring Indonesia and 
              Malaysia.<br><br>It is also pushing its people to do more recycling, 
              doubling its already expansive rail network by 2020 and testing electric
               vehicles for commercial use.<br><br>In another positive move, Singapore
               has offered itself as a "living laboratory" where global energy firms 
              can develop and test new technologies before mass production.<br><br>Norway's
               Renewable Energy Corp (REC) opened one of the world's biggest solar 
              technology manufacturing facilities in Singapore in November, a project 
              costing nearly two billion dollars.<br><br>Vestas, a Danish manufacturer
               of wind turbines, already has a global research and development centre 
              in the city-state.<br><br>"Singapore has been very wise in the way they 
              are approaching this," REC's chief executive Ole Enger said. "They have 
              made Singapore a global hub for renewable energy."<br><br> - AFP /ls</span></span></p>
