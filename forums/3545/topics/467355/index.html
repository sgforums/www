              What Is Euthanasia (assisted Suicide)? What Is The Definition Of Assisted Suicide Or Euthanasia?
              
              Euthanasia, also known as assisted suicide, physician-assisted suicide (dying) , doctor-assisted dying (suicide) , and more loosely termed mercy killing, basically means to take a deliberate action with the express intention of ending a life to relieve intractable (persistent, unstoppable) suffering. Some interpret euthanasia as the practice of ending a life in a painless manner. Many disagree with this interpretation, because it needs to include a reference to intractable suffering. 
              
              In the majority of countries euthanasia or assisted suicide is against the law. According to the National Health Service (NHS), UK, it is illegal to help somebody kill themselves, regardless of circumstances. Assisted suicide, or voluntary euthanasia carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison in the UK. In the USA the law varies in some states (see further down). 
              
              There are two main classifications of euthanasia: 
              
              Passive euthanasia - this is when life-sustaining treatments are withheld. The definition of passive euthanasia is often not clear cut. For example, if a doctor prescribes increasing doses of opioid analgesia (strong painkilling medications) which may eventually be toxic for the patient, some may argue whether passive euthanasia is taking place - in most cases, the doctor's measure is seen as a passive one. Many claim that the term is wrong, because euthanasia has not taken place, because there is no intention to take life. 
              
              Active euthanasia - lethal substances or forces are used to end the patient's life. Active euthanasia includes life-ending actions conducted by the patient or somebody else. 
              Active euthanasia is a much more controversial subject than passive euthanasia. Individuals are torn by religious, moral, ethical and compassionate arguments surrounding the issue. Euthanasia has been a very controversial and emotive topic for a long time. 
              
              The term assisted suicide has several different interpretations. Perhaps the most widely used and accepted is "the intentional hastening of death by a terminally ill patient with assistance from a doctor, relative, or another person". Some people will insist that something along the lines of "in order relieve intractable (persistent, unstoppable) suffering" needs to be added to the meaning, while others insist that "terminally ill patient" already includes that meaning.

              Euthanasia is a matter for Parliament: CJ 
              
              Issues are complicated and need much debate, he says
              By K. C. Vijayan, The Straits Times, 20 Mar 2013
              
              CHIEF Justice Sundaresh Menon has made it clear it is for Parliament to decide if voluntary euthanasia, or assisted suicide, is to be allowed in Singapore.
              
              But the choice is a complicated one, requiring plenty of debate.
              
              When he delivered the Singapore Medical Association's annual lecture titled "Euthanasia: a matter of life or death?" two Saturdays ago, he highlighted the example of Singaporean lawyer Suzanne Chin to show that even science did not have all the answers.
              
              After she collapsed in Hong Kong in 2009, her family was informed she was brain dead. Her husband was advised to switch off the ventilator as there was no hope of recovery. Three days later, she revived. Eight days later she was discharged.
              
              "I make these points to make the point that there are limits to what we know and what science can tell us," said CJ Menon, who explained that issues relating to accelerated and assisted dying were profound, with so many deeply different views that no "categorical conclusion" might be reached.
              
              Euthanasia is illegal in Singapore but in certain cases under the country's Advance Medical Directive (AMD), a terminally ill person whose condition will soon lead to death can instruct doctors not to keep him alive by artificial means such as respirators. The Act, introduced in 1996, was preceded by much debate in Singapore.

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I still think they should follow the traditional physician and health professional's hippocratic oath of benevolence in helping, healing and alleviating pain and suffering. To relieve them from pain does not include taking away life to do so.. Even in the most dire of situations, to give and sustain life rather than take and terminate life. The putatie benevolence of intentional killing is illusory, not in the interest of the patient and deleterious to societal good.</span></p>
              <p>Regardless passive or active euthanasia, e.g morphine administered to ease and take away pain rather than administering it to end a life, the subtle difference is the intention and purpose of the act. It desensitises physicians and distort the idea of compassion and altruisim</p>
              <p>While I empathise with those that were punished in courts for assisted-suicide, and all the other reasons for terminating one's life e.g lack of money, suffering ...etc. That's life.. we fight till the end. We die fighting. Palliative care to the end. No sick, dying and the old should be treated like they are a burden on life. It is no different than an act of suicide we see happening everyday.</p>
              <p>Some argue that it is a issue of moral precept. The slippery slope to allow and legalise euthanisa. I personally think that once such moral precept is breached, a psychological and logical process is then set into motion which follows from what I would call the law of infinite regress and moral exceptions. But some would argue.. what then are morals ?</p>

              <p>The thing about euthanasia is that non of us has never met with a terminal illness. Of course, it's not us that is feeling the pain and the one that is dying. Euthanasia, so called "mercy killing", is just a reminder that the painkillers are not working.</p>
              <p>We need more effective pain-killers, not some drug that kills you. </p>
              <p>And also, we can never sure is euthanasia is voluntary or foced by others. It can lead to a slippery slope effect, for those unable to voice their desires, are put to death like the senile, a baby or someone in coma, which can often lead to the victimisation of the most vulnerable people of the society, like the poor and the disabled. Soon, the "right to die" might transform to the "right to kill". </p>
