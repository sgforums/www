              <p>Â </p>
              <p>WITHIN a six-month period in 2004, Mr Franco Giuseppe, 45, bought more
               than 1.35 million shares of Permasteelisa Pacific Holdings (PPH). He 
              was the firm's chief financial officer (CFO) then and on Wednesday, the 
              Italian national and Singapore permanent resident was fined $40,000 each
               on three counts of insider trading and fined an additional $80,000 each
               on two counts of market rigging. A total of 15 similar charges were 
              taken into consideration by District Judge Kessler Soh when passing 
              sentence. Mr Giuseppe had pleaded guilty in February earlier this year.</p>
              <p>Defence counsel Shashi Nathan of Inca Law pointed out that 
              his client did not make a cent from the transactions. Mr Giuseppe merely
               did as he was told by his bosses in Italy but the lawyer did admit that
               this was no excuse as the former CFO should have known better.</p>
              <p>The court had heard from the prosecutor that in early 2004, 
              PPH planned to acquire the Asian division of the Josef Gartner (JG) 
              construction business for $44 million. This purchase was to be funded by
               the issuance of 110 million new PPH shares at the issue price of 40 
              cents each.</p>
              <p>Both PPH and JG were subsidiaries of the Permasteelisa 
              S.P.A. (PSPA) group. To prevent the shares dipping below 40 cents, Mr 
              Enzo Pavan, PPH's chief executive, and Mr Giampiero Alessandrini, JG's 
              general manager, are said to have instructed Mr Giuseppe to buy the 
              shares on 40 separate occasions between March and August 2004.</p>
              <p>The court also heard that while the two alleged accomplices 
              had refused to come here to assist in the investigations, Mr Giuseppe 
              had cooperated fully with the Commercial Affairs Department. He had also
               offered to pay prosecution's costs of $31,200 and this gesture of 
              contrition had been accepted by the prosecution.</p>
