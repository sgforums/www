              <p>Went up the bus and stood at the side. This Indian chap in his 30s with a bald head and specs was seated on the green seats as I faced him. Then two sweet looking mei meis came up the bus and he beckoned one of them to sit next to him, with a lecherous smile. Well, at least it looked that way to me. Failed. He beckoned the other one who was by then standing next to me. Failed too. I looked at him and he waved a hand at me pointing to the exit. Haha wtf.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I was about to get off and at this time, came a sudden surge of urine stench. The lady sitting in front of him asked with an irritated look, "Why suddenly so smelly?" I looked at him and he looked embarassed. He probably peed in his pants.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of stressed up people in sg who kee siao. That's what I thought as I got off the bus.</p>

              <p>More getting stressed.    I have seen a couple of people talking to themselves in the buses.   One person shouted and shouted in the  MRT.  </p>
              <p>One man holding a bill cursing PAP talked to himself , citing that things are expensive.   He walked to the front and back and repeated the same words.   </p>

              <p>Another encounter today....this time in the MRT. I was standing at the railing in between the doors on both sides. On my left, this auntie at her seat kept cursing at a lady standing next to me. I think something about not giving way when entering. Then on my right, this ah beng was having a quarrel with his friend over the phone. Here's how it goes: "Kan ni nah bui chao chee bai! I tell you now I at Tanah Melah, you still say go Julong.......ä½ å�¬å¾—æ‡‚å�—ï¼Ÿï¼�ï¼Ÿ Wa lan eh, ä½ ä¸�è¦�è¿™æ ·ç¬¨ leh!"</p>
              <p>Wa lau eh.....now our society very stressed ah.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Agreed.Now people getting more and more stressed in Singapore.I had seen my colleague talking to himself while walking towards to the company as if someone was beside him.He just waved his hands up the sky and kept laughing and talking happily to himself when nobody is beside him.In fact there is nothing wrong with him when he was talking to other people.He even can present himself well during annual company meeting.However he like to be alone while walking home and talked to himself.whenever people tried to talked to him outside , he just kept quiet but not in the company.</p></div>
