              <p>By 
              																				Shawn Lee Miller</p>
              <p>20-YEAR-OLD NSF Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid wanted to join a militant 
              jihad overseas; while Pastor Rony Tan's insensitive remarks against 
              Buddhists and Taoists created a stir in the community.</p>
              <p>In the face of these religious tensions, the first ever 
              International Conference on Muslims in Multicultural Societies organised
               by MUIS will be held over two days at the Grand Hyatt hotel.</p>
              <p>Delivering the keynote address at the conference, Senior 
              Minister Goh Chok Tong cited the example of the church pastor and how 
              efforts were made to diffuse the tension and avert political conflict.</p>
              <p>"At a personal level, Singaporeans of all faiths must 
              continue to show tolerance and understanding and to adopt a 
              live-and-let-live approach to life," said SM Goh at the conference.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Integration alone not enough</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Zakir Hussain</p>
              <p>IN SEVERAL countries, especially in Europe, Muslims are seen as a 
              'problem' because their numbers have risen significantly in recent 
              years.</p>
              <p>Islamic scholars on Thursday suggested ways these Muslims, 
              who are in the minority, can overcome prejudices.</p>
              <p>Top of the list: They have to realise that integration alone
               is not enough.</p>
              <p>Muslims need to make active contributions to their 
              societies, like volunteering or joining civil society groups, said Swiss
               theologian Tariq Ramadan.</p>
              <p>Addressing them directly, he said: 'Speak out, reach out, be
               connected with your fellow citizens.. And don't only talk about Islam, 
              be much more involved in social matters.'</p>
              <p>Professor Ramadan, an Oxford don, made the point to 
              reporters at the end of two days of discussions on how Muslims can draw 
              on their faith to thrive in multicultural societies.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">SAF integrity, security intact</h1>
              <p>THE recent detention of a self-radicalised full-time national 
              serviceman under the Internal Security Act has not changed the 
              Government's view of other Malay or Muslim servicemen who continue to 
              serve dutifully and with commitment in their units, said Deputy Prime 
              Minister and Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean on Monday.</p>
              <p>He also gave the assurance that the case has not affected 
              the security and integrity of the Singapore Armed Forces.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo was replying to a question in Parliament from Pasir 
              Ris-Punggol GRC MP Michael Palmer who had asked what steps were being 
              taken to ensure that the SAF is secure from similar self-radicalised 
              activists like NSman Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid, who made online contact
               with a suspected Al-Qaeda recruiter and wanted to embark on armed jihad
               overseas.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo said Muhd Fadil, 20, 'was a solitary individual who 
              took the wrong path'. 'Mindef's view of other Malay or Muslim servicemen
               who continue to serve dutifully and with commitment in their units. 
              Mindef has briefed SAF commanders on this case, and they have briefed 
              their own servicemen so as to ensure that the whole organisation 
              understands this position clearly,' he said.</p>
              <p>The minister said the security agencies in Mindef and the 
              ministry of Home Affairs worked closely together on this case, and acted
               as soon as there was sufficient indication that Muhd Fadil was a 
              security risk.</p>
              <p>At the national level, Mr Teo said the authorities have 
              instituted security systems and processes to detect, monitor and 
              neutralise potential security threats, adding that Mindef and SAF are 
              part of this national system, and will continue to maintain a high level
               of vigilance against any potential threats that may surface.</p>
