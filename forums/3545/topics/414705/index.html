              <h2>S’porean student arrested for selling fake medicine online<br></h2>
              By Faris – November 4th, 2010<br><br>
              <p>A 16-year-old Singaporean student was nabbed by the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=health+sciences+authority&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Health Sciences Authority (HSA)</a> for selling fake medicine online.</p>
              <p>The student initially bought two packets of slimming pills online but
               suffered adverse reactions such as dry throat after using them. In 
              order to cut her losses of S$220, she sold them online for S$130.</p>
              <p>According to a <em>Today</em> report, the student is the youngest 
              person ever to be nabbed by the HSA for an online-related offence. HSA 
              deputy director (enforcement branch) Ruth Lee, 47, said, “We were 
              shocked when we caught her. We didn’t feel good…She’s too young.”</p>
              <p>As part of a major <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=interpol&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Interpol</a>-led
               operation against fake medicine sold online in 45 countries, 
              authorities in Singapore shared details of Operation Pangea III, which 
              saw three Singaporeans and three China nationals being apprehended in 
              the country.</p>
              <p><em></em>The same paper also reported that between October 5 and 12, 
              HSA senior regulatory inspector (enforcement branch) Beatrice Poh, 33, 
              and her team were trawling through popular online forums and social 
              networking sites for suspects, when they made contact with the student.</p>
              <p>Once the transaction with the undercover HSA officers were completed 
              at Bugis MRT Station, they immediately took action and subsequently 
              searched her home for more medicines. They found that she had two 
              packets of pills in her possession.</p>
              <p>A total of S$7,000 worth of fake medicines were seized from the six suspects arrested in Singapore. They have yet to be charged.</p>
              <p>According to the HSA, illegal online medicines are becoming a 
              worldwide scourge, thought to run into the billions. The World Health 
              Organisation estimates that more than half of medicines sold online are 
              fake.</p>
              <p>HSA division director (enforcement) Chan Cheng Leng, 46, said most of
               the ones sold here are lifestyle medicines claiming to treat conditions
               such as erectile dysfunction and obesity.</p>
              <p>She added that those ashamed of the stigma associated with those 
              conditions would buy the medicines online and most of them are in their 
              20s and 30s and are internet-savvy.</p>
              <p>However, Ms Chan warned that what you see is not necessarily what you
               will get. Sexual enhancement pills have turned out to be slimming 
              pills. On the other hand, slimming pills have been found to contain 
              substances to treat constipation.</p>
              <p>Although there have been no reported deaths in Singapore from 
              consumption of fake online medicines, Ms Chan highlighted, “You’re 
              putting things in your body that can cause harm. The health risks aren’t
               worth it.”</p>
              <p>The HSA said the profit margin for selling such products can range 
              between 200 and 900 per cent, with a S$5 box of hair loss product being 
              sold for S$50.</p>
              <p>In May last year, the HSA attached officers to <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singpost&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">SingPost </a>to
               train its employees how to spot suspicious packages. The number of 
              packages referred to the HSA for inspection jumped to 191 that month, up
               from 33 in April last year. It now averages 70 to 80 packages monthly.</p>
              <p>Under the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+poisons+act&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Poisons Act</a>,
               anyone convicted of selling prescription drugs or counterfeit drugs 
              online can be jailed up to two years and fined S$10,000. Last year, 34 
              people were arrested. There are already 39 cases so far this year.</p>
