              <p><strong>Aug 16, 2011 - ST Forum</strong></p>
              <p>I APPLAUD the move to cap foreign student enrolment at current levels
               and add more university places for Singaporean students ("2,000 more 
              uni places for local students"; yesterday).</p>
              <p>It was mentioned in the Prime Minister's 
              National Day Rally speech on Sunday that the proportion of foreign 
              students at universities here is 18 per cent. However, a check with the 
              three public universities' websites shows it to be 20 per cent.</p>
              <p>Despite years of debate and analysis on the issue of 
              university places for foreigners, the obvious question has never been 
              asked or answered: What is the percentage of non-Singaporeans - 
              including permanent residents - in the total student population of the 
              three public universities?</p>
              <p>I estimate the percentage of 
              non-Singaporean students to be more than 40 per cent, because 20 per 
              cent of undergraduate admissions were reserved for foreigners, plus 
              perhaps about 10 plus per cent of permanent residents; and I understand 
              that about three-quarters of the postgraduate students are 
              non-Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>What percentage of foreign students receive some form
               of financial aid, like the Education Ministry's tuition grants, 
              scholarships exclusive to foreigners, and the like?</p>
              <p>In sum, how much funding a year is given to non-Singaporeans, and how much direct funding is given to Singaporeans?</p>

              <p>What PM failed to mention was that the idea was conceptualized by a Singaporean and a Canadian Greek, the Indian national was just playing a side role which could have been easily taken up by another Singaporean. The Indian national wasn't playing a critical role in this startup. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-left: 40px;">c. e.g.<em> </em>BioMers – startup company producing a translucent orthodontic brace system</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;">i. Key people are three Singaporeans, one Indian national (all NUS alumni) and one Canadian Greek</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ii. <strong>Two Singaporeans developed the base technology</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">iii. Another <strong>Singaporean</strong> went to UK for graduate studies, where the Canadian Greek was a fellow student. <strong>Together they further developed the technology for commercialisation</strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;">iv. They came together to form BioMers, and brought in an Indian national whom the Singaporeans knew from NUS</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;">v. Product launched last year and doing well</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 80px;">vi. BioMers now has 26 staff, more than half Singaporean</p>

              <p>Just because an idiot goes through UNI doesn't mean he will be bright. Find a job perhaps yes. Though I pity with your Govt for treating their own people like Foreigners, atleast let some bright guys from other countries study there.</p>

              <p>In the few years I spent in SG I always found foreigners to be much more well informed, polite and with betetr accent than the local trash. There were rare exceptions of course.</p>

              <p>If Singaporeans are so rude, perhaps we should get rid of Singaporeans and turn this country into 80% foreigners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Since it's mostly foreigners perhaps we can change turn it into another China or India. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>They enjoy a sub-standard of living in Singapore? Perhaps they should go back to India, Indonesia, Philippines or China to enjoy a higher standard of living.

              <p>But isn't that using tax payers money to pursue a policy that is against the inalienable rights of Singaporeans? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those Universities are built using Singaporeans' money and now it's used to subsidize foreigners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on your logic. If Singapore University places should be based on merits regardless of nationality. Then I ask you.</p>
              <p>If all the smart people come to Singapore (surely there are more smart people in the world compared to just Singapore), displaces all the Singaporeans from University, after 3-4 years of study, all move back to their home countries or other advanced economies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What would happen to our dear little Singapore? No University graduates, we will be reduced to working as maids and bricklayers in Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines and China. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then if you are foreigners then it's totally good for you, cheap education which you can't get in your own decrepit 3rd world country. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i noticed one uni in china has normal gmat score as 780... that is the highest in the world... it requires good brains to get 780... if we make 'reserved' seats for nationality then it will definitely make people lazy to compete.</p>

              <p>What competition you talking about? Isn't there competition amongst the locals already? It's not 100% enrolment rate for locals, only the top tier goes to University. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Then what? Let foreigners take up 100% of University places? Surely Singapore cannot compete with the world's population in terms of geniuses. 5-6 years down the road all these University graduates would have left Singapore for greener pastures.
