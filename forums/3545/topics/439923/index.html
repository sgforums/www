              <p><cite>Mdm Zhang married a fugitive rapist.</cite></p>
              <div class="article-body">
              <p>A local woman has come forward to share her experience of having married a fugitive rapist.</p>
              <p>Mdm Zhang (43, masseuse) told reporters that she got to know her 
              Norwegian husband Michael (57, businessman) through a friend about 11 
              years ago when she was on holiday in Italy.</p>
              <p>The two had maintained contact through the internet and met again in 
              Dubai in 2004. They dated for a year before getting married in Singapore
               on 25 May 2005.</p>
              <p>Mdm Zhang said, "I felt very lonely when I was in Dubai. The social 
              rules there were very strict so it was very tough for me. At that time, 
              he became my sanctuary."</p>
              <p>Their marriage hit an unexpected hitch when her husband was suddenly 
              deported from Singapore in 2006, then extradited back to Norway from 
              Qatar after that.</p>
              <p>"I didn't know what happened to him. He told me an ex-girlfriend had 
              some financial troubles with her business, so he needed to return and 
              help with investigations," said Mdm Zhang.</p>
              <p>After that, Mdm Zhang related that she paid more than $3,000 in legal
               fees on her husband's behalf. The lawyer did not explain to her about 
              the case, but suggested that she search for Michael's name on the 
              internet.</p>
              <p>"I discovered that Michael was wanted by the Interpol. He is a convicted rapist."</p>
              <p>According to the Norwegian media, Michael was sentenced to 3 years 
              and 10 months' jail for raping his ex-girlfriend. He had also been 
              arrested for using violence on nearly ten women, including threatening 
              his ex-wife with a knife.</p>
              <p>Michael became a fugitive when he disappeared before his case was brought on appeal in Norway.</p>
              <p>Michael eventually served his sentence then returned to Singapore to look for Mdm Zhang at her flat.</p>
              <p>At the time, Mdm Zhang refused to let Michael into her house. Furious
               with the refusal, the man attempted to force entry, resulting in Mdm 
              Zhang summoning the police for help.</p>
              <p>Three weeks after the first incident, Michael returned to Mdm Zhang's
               house with some men. She was not at home to stop them and the men made 
              off with her property including furniture, appliances and her computer. 
              She lost more than $20,000 worth of property and had to call the police 
              for help again.</p>
