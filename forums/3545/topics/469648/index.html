              <h2 class="news_brief">Singapore’s Minister in the Prime Minister's 
              Office Lim Swee Say said grassroots leaders are the "voice of the silent
               majority", helping to strengthen ties between the ground and the 
              government.</h2>
              <div class="news_detail">
              <div>
              <p>SINGAPORE: Singapore’s Minister in the Prime 
              Minister's Office Lim Swee Say said grassroots leaders are the "voice of
               the silent majority", helping to strengthen ties between the ground and
               the government.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim, who is also deputy chairman of the 
              People's Association (PA), made the comments at the PA Awards Ceremony 
              on Saturday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said the ongoing “Our Singapore 
              Conversation”, which seeks to reach consensus among Singaporeans on the 
              country's future, illustrates the role of the grassroots movement in 
              reaching out to what he described as "the silent majority".</p>
              <p>He said grassroots leaders reach out to some 1.7 million residents every year.</p>
              <p>Through
               the interactions, he said they give frank feedback to the government as
               well as suggest ideas on how the government can do better.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said Phase One of the Our Singapore Conversation exercise involved some 18,000 residents.</p>
              <p>He added the feedback received is being taken very seriously by the government.</p>
              <p>He
               said: "In fact right now, as we're sitting here, the entire cabinet is 
              at the Istana, going through some of the feedback, some of the 
              suggestions, put forward by the OSC. In fact, this afternoon's session 
              is but just one of a series.</p>
              <p>“I want you to know, that as a 
              grassroots movement, what you're doing in voicing out for the silent 
              majority, is a very important role.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lim also spoke of the evolving role of the grassroots movement, from the 1960s to today.</p>
              <p>He
               said: "In the 60s, we rallied the ground to support National Service 
              and to keep Singapore clean. In the 70s, Courtesy Campaign, Speak 
              Mandarin Campaign and so on. And in more recent years, SARS. Right now, 
              again, the grassroots movement is in action, against this anti-dengue, 
              this Mozzie Wipeout and so on.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lim said there are three 
              areas that the PA could improve on in the future. The first is to try 
              new ideas, and be open to innovation as the movement widens its 
              approach. The second is to do more to bridge an emerging social gap 
              within the community. The third is to deepen the engagement among 
              residents. </p>

              Hehe...I know this Singaporean guy who just bought a property in JB, my new neighbour in JB. He is a grassroot leader of RC. He said he will retire in JB because in Singapore its expensive. I asked him, "So your are a grassroot leader RC member and strong supporter of PAP." Then he replied, "Ya, residents in my area when see me will say to themselves, "The government watchdog is coming. PAP dogs", then he laughed. Then he added, "When I have problems with my HDB flat, I see my MP and very fast the HDB will reply a positive letter to me." He said to me that he had sold and buy his HDB flats 5 times, make money and now he is staying in a five rooms flat.
                                  
              So he also admitted that Singapore is not a good place and is an expensive place to retire...that is the "voices of the silent majority".... of Singaporeans too, including himself too...right! Haha.

              <p>Some Chinese tourists 'uncivilised': top official</p>
              <p class="first">The dire manners and "uncivilised behaviour" of some Chinese tourists abroad are harming the country's image, said a top official who lamented their poor "quality and breeding", according to state-run media.</p>
              <p>Wang Yang, one of China's four vice premiers, singled out for condemnation "talking loudly in public places, jay-walking, spitting and wilfully carving characters on items in scenic zones".</p>
              <p>Such "uncivilised behaviours" were "often criticised by the media and have damaged the image of Chinese people and caused vicious impact", he said, according to the website of the People's Daily, the ruling Communist Party's mouthpiece.</p>
              <p>China proclaims itself a 5,000-year-old civilisation but at a government meeting Thursday on a new tourism law Wang said: "The quality and breeding of some tourists are not high yet."</p>
              <p>Chinese consumers have become increasingly affluent on the back of its economic boom and foreign holidays are ever more popular, with shopping often a key activity.</p>
              <p>Destination countries, including debt-laden European states, have been easing visa restrictions to attract more tourists from China, but reports have also emerged of complaints about etiquette.</p>
              <p>"Improving the civilised quality of the citizens and building a good image of Chinese tourists are the obligations of governments at all levels and relevant agencies and companies," said Wang, a former party chief of Guangdong province, which borders Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Authorities should "guide tourists to conscientiously abide by public order and social ethics, respect local religious beliefs and customs, mind their speech and behaviour... and protect the environment," he said.</p>
              <p>A mainland Chinese mother who asked her son to relieve himself in a bottle in a crowded Hong Kong restaurant sparked an outpouring of online anger in February in the former British colony, where some locals deride mainlanders as "locusts".</p>

              Time has changed now...if ask any Indonesian Chinese whether they are Chinese they will say no...their reply will be they are Indonesian. They don't like to be seen as Chinese.

              Those PRCs feel proud of their China because its big country and big economy...seeing themselves as one of the main country that will push up the world economy. I see them like those Imperial Japanese trying to make other asian countries take them as the champion against the western world...
