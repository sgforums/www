              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : A PAP 
              Community Foundation (PCF) kindergarten in Bedok has threatened to fine 
              parents who pick up their kids late from class.<br><br>The fine is S$2 for every five minutes that they are late.<br><br>While childcare centres are known to have such policies, this practice is uncommon in a kindergarten.<br><br>The
               PCF kindergarten in Block 30, Upper Changi Road said it decided to do 
              something when it faced repeated situations when parents picked up their
               kids late from school. <br><br>It said this affected lunch and dinner breaks of teachers and also affected those on evening course.<br><br>In
               a circular to parents last month, the principal of the kindergarten 
              said it will charge S$2 for every five minutes that they are late.<br><br>The
               PAP Community Foundation told MediaCorp that it knew of the situation 
              but leaves operational matters to the kindergartens themselves to 
              decide. <br><br>It added that this late charge is specific to the Bedok branch, and is not a PCF-wide policy.<br><br>Not all parents are against the penalty.<br><br>One parent said: "This works out to forty cents a minute."<br><br>Another
               added: "I have seen that some parents like to take advantage of the 
              situation, seeing that the principals and teachers stay behind...to say 
              take care of the children for a while.<br><br>"For me, it is fair 
              enough, because that is what makes it really work. If they put it at 
              S$1, I do not think it will (work), because it is not much. Every 
              five-minute extension of S$2, I think is very good."<br><br>The 
              kindergarten first imposed the penalty last May - but for a smaller 
              amount, and only when parents are late for more than 15 minutes. <br><br>It added it has about 10 cases where the parents are late by about two to three hours at times.<br><br>One
               parent said: "For those who have savings, S$2 is no problem for them. 
              If (you are) like me, with no savings, S$2 is (a) problem also."<br><br>A senior kindergarten staff said that despite the warnings, no fines have been collected so far. <br><br>However,
               one parent commented: "Putting a fine on late parents is not the 
              solution. They should get parent volunteers after school hours to say, 
              stay back for an hour? Because...money is not a problem, so a fine is 
              not a solution."<br><br>Meanwhile, another parent noted: "A fine should be a last resort for any kindergarten to come up with."<br><br>My
               First Skool, which provides infant care to kindergarten, said it also 
              imposes a penalty on parents who are late. But it said it only imposes a
               penalty after the fourth time.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

                  S$2 is (a) problem also."</span></span></em></p>
              <p>Imagine you are the teacer who also has limited budget and are
                  not better well off than the parents and you also have an evening
                  class to go to... (Lecture begins at 6pm)</p>
              <p>5pm - Dismissal time</p>
              <p>What happens if the parents are late for half an hour, one hour
                  or even two hours and you have no money to take a cab?</p>
              <p>The centre does not pay the teacher OT and if the fine is not
                  implemented, the poor teacher has to stretch her limited budget...
                  and what if she also has a family to take care of? Or she has a
                  child to fetch from school too? Teachers also has their family
                  obligations too you know.</p>
              <p>Don't you all think the fine is mandatory? <span style="color: #ff0000;">PCF Kindergarten (PAP)</span> should not only
                  take care of the needs of the people but also look into the 
                  <span style="color: #ff0000;">RIGHTS AND NEEDS of the
                  teachers.</span></p>
