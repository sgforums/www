A study on consistently good IPPT result + pre-IPPT (35yrs onwards) medical checkup result achievers in reservist vs their healthcare cost in later years dating back to 1965 SAF enlistees can be studied to measure the value of consistently good physical fitness till ORD from NS @ age 50 (/older for regular SAF servicemen/ generals) to assess the value of physical fitness amongst Singaporeans towards the national reduction of tertiary healthcare consumption and costs (and by extension, the value of 'carrots' necessary to encourage such healthy/ fitness lifestyle adoption)<br><br>Incentivising physical fitness amongst Singaporeans is urgently necessary since the Singapore workforce is quickly aging and rather than have more citizens become even more dependent on foreign nurses and maids to care for disabled young Singaporean diabetics (stroke, amputations, blindness, heart problems, dementia, kidney dialysis) , investment in physical fitness would probably go a long way to keeping the Singapore workforce able and strong.<br><br>Ref:<br>("1 in 10 stroke patients here aged under 50": ST: Nov 19, 2016)<br><br>
