              <h1 class="storyheadline">Firms should take cue from Han's</h1>
              <p>IT IS good news for those over 62 years old that some 'Singapore firms
               are keeping workers beyond age 62' (April 27) for their expertise, 
              experience, character and attitude. This is the right thing to do 
              instead of rushing to employ foreigners on low wages.</p>
              <p>At least one firm has stated that employing older people is 
              not much more expensive than employing foreigners. The latter also bring
               with them social  problems.</p>
              <p>Other employers should take their cue from Han's, the 
              bakery chain where 40 per cent of the workforce is aged between 40 and 
              82.</p>
              <p>I presume all these elderly people are Singaporeans. This is
               good. Then we will not have a situation where many unskilled or 
              low-skilled foreign workers take jobs from Singaporeans and send the 
              money home. Singaporeans will also make a living and spend here to 
              support sections of the economy.</p>
              <p>If employers must pay more for Singaporeans, at least the 
              money is spent here. If costs go up, it is a natural process and does 
              not bleed the country as when low-skilled foreigners send money home.</p>
              <p>A Singaporean does not have to be broken in. He does not 
              have to be integrated, saving the country millions.</p>
              <p>There is need to ensure that foreigners are employed only in
               jobs which need their skills. I believe in Australia, one cannot get a 
              visa unless one's skill is required.</p>
              <p>Also high-skilled foreigners will create fewer problems and
               improve the local scene, socially, culturally and in other ways.</p>
              <p>The recent cascade of unskilled foreigners working as 
              cleaners, shop assistants, coffee shop assistants, hawker stall 
              assistants and so on has produced much disquiet. Besides their 
              productivity is poor.</p>
              <p>One thing worries me though, about older Singaporeans 
              working in low-skilled jobs like those I have described. I wonder if 
              they have annual leave, medical leave and medical insurance cover. They 
              should also have some security of tenure, that is, they should not be 
              sacked if they report sick occasionally.</p>

              <p>MIW don't clean tables, and those contractors bid like crazy. The cleaners are the one getting the cuts. It's all about more profits nowadays.</p>
