              <p>BRITISH writer Alan Shadrake, 76, was sentenced to six weeks in jail 
              and fined S$20,000 on Tuesday for contempt of court.</p>
              <p>Shadrake was also ordered to pay S$55,000 in costs to the 
              prosecution by High Court Judge Quentin Loh.</p>
              <p>The judge dismissed a last-minute apology by Shadrake as 
              'nothing more than a tactical ploy in court to obtain a reduced 
              sentence', and ruled that the freelance journalist will have to serve 
              two more weeks in prison if he fails to pay the fine.</p>
              <p>'A fine should be imposed to prevent Mr Shadrake from 
              profiting from his contempt (of court),' the judge said. The High Court 
              delivered the verdict against Shadrake in connection with his book Once a
               Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock, which was deemed to have 
              insulted the Singaporean judiciary.</p>
              <p>The attorney-general's office, which took Shadrake to court,
               claims that statements in the book impugn the impartiality, integrity 
              and independence of the judiciary.</p>
              <p>The writer accused Singapore's courts of succumbing to 
              political influences and favoring the rich over the poor in his book 
              'Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore's Justice in the Dock.' The book 
              contained 'half-truths and selective facts; sometimes even outright 
              falsehoods,' Judge Loh said in his Nov 3 verdict.</p>
              <p>The prosecution had sought a jail term of at least 12 weeks 
              because of Shadrake's 'continued defiance' and allegations of 'the worst
               possible kind' against the judiciary. Shadrake had no intention of 
              undermining the city's judiciary and ought to be censured instead of 
              jailed or fined, his lawyer M. Ravi said at a Nov 9 hearing.</p>

              <p>CONTEMPT OF COURT CASE</p>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Shadrake to appeal jail term</h1>
              <p>A BRITISH author jailed for six weeks after his book on Singapore's 
              death penalty was found to be in contempt of court is filing an appeal 
              to overturn his conviction, his lawyer said on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Alan Shadrake, 76, 'wishes to appeal against his conviction 
              and sentence,' a letter sent by his lawyer M. Ravi to the Supreme Court 
              said.</p>
              <p>Mr Ravi told AFP by telephone that Shadrake, a freelance 
              writer based in Malaysia and Britain, should not have been convicted for
               insulting the judiciary in his book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore 
              Justice in the Dock.</p>
              <p>'Even if he's found guilty, the sentence is excessive,' 
              added Mr Ravi, who declined to state his grounds for challenging the 
              conviction.</p>
              <p>Shadrake was handed a six-week jail term on Tuesday and 
              fined S$20,000 after being found guilty of scandalising Singapore's 
              courts.</p>
              <p>It was the stiffest sentence ever imposed in Singapore for 
              the offence. The previous longest jail term for contempt of court was 15
               days.</p>
              <p>Judge Quentin Loh said he imposed a deterrent sentence on 
              Shadrake as the freelance journalist's allegations of 'judicial 
              impropriety' were without precedent.</p>

              <div id="hn-headline">British minister 'dismayed' by author's Singapore jail 
              term</div>
              <p class="hn-byline">(AFP) â <span class="hn-date">4 hours ago</span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE â A minister has said he is "dismayed" by the prison sentence 
              handed to a British author convicted by a Singapore court of insulting the 
              city-state's judiciary.</p>
              <p>Foreign office minister Jeremy Browne said in comments posted on the website 
              of the British High Commission in Singapore that author Alan Shadrake's views on 
              the judicial system should be covered by the right to freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>The High Court of the island republic on Tuesday imposed a six-week jail term 
              on 76-year-old Shadrake for insulting the judiciary by publishing a book 
              critical of executions there.</p>
              <p>The freelance journalist was also fined 20,000 Singapore dollars (15,000 US) 
              following his conviction for contempt of court. He remains free pending an 
              appeal.</p>
              <p>"The government attaches importance to freedom of expression around the 
              world," Browne said in remarks seen on the website Friday.</p>
              <p>"I am therefore dismayed that Mr Shadrake has been charged, convicted and 
              sentenced to six weeks in jail in Singapore for expressing his personal views on 
              the legal system."</p>
              <p>Browne added that the commission "would continue to call on all countries, 
              including Singapore, to recognise the right to freedom of expression as set out 
              in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights".</p>
              <p>On Thursday, Shadrake said through his lawyer that he was filing an appeal to 
              overturn the conviction, which stemmed from allegations made in his book "Once a 
              Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock".</p>
              <p>Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) issued a sharp rebuttal to 
              Browne's comments, saying it was "surprised" he had raised the issue and the 
              case had nothing to do with freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>"The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is surprised that a British minister has 
              commented on the matter, which is not about freedom of expression or 
              Singapore-UK relations, but about the integrity of Singapore's judicial system," 
              a ministry spokesman said.</p>
              <p>"The British government should understand that Singapore has the right to 
              enforce its own laws to protect the reputation of our judiciary and judicial 
              system, as well as other key public institutions."</p>
