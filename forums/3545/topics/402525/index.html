              <p>WASHINGTON (AFP) - – The United States has put allies Singapore and 
              Thailand as well as Vietnam on a human trafficking watch list, accusing 
              them of failing to prevent women from being forced into prostitution.</p>
              <p>The move Monday opens the way for the United States to cut off some 
              civilian assistance, although it usually functions as a way to pressure 
              countries to take action.</p>
              <p>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has made women's and 
              children's rights a signature issue, called human trafficking a 
              "terrible crime" as she presented the State Department's annual report.</p>
              <p>"All of us have a responsibility to bring this practice to an end," 
              she said.</p>
              <p>The report estimated that 12.3 million people were the victims of 
              trafficking in 2009-2010, although it said there has been progress over 
              the past decade.</p>
              <p>The State Department added a number of Asian nations to its watch 
              list -- Afghanistan, Brunei, Laos, Maldives, Singapore, Thailand and 
              Vietnam.</p>
              <p>Bangladesh, China, India, Micronesia, the Philippines and Sri Lanka 
              stayed on the list, unchanged from a year earlier.</p>
              <p>North Korea, Myanmar and Papua New Guinea remained at the bottom 
              level of countries that do not even meet the minimum standards on human 
              trafficking.</p>
              <p>Explaining the downgrade for Singapore, the report said that some 
              women from China, the Philippines and Thailand are tricked into coming 
              to the city-state with promises of legitimate employment and coerced 
              into the sex trade.</p>
              <p>The report said that while Singapore launched "some significant new 
              steps" against trafficking, there were no "quantifiable indicators" that
               the government was identifying more victims or prosecuting more 
              culprits.</p>
              <p>The State Department said that Thailand was a source, destination 
              and transit point for trafficking, with ethnic minorities and citizens 
              of neighboring countries at particular risk of sexual abuse or forced 
              labor.</p>
              <p>Senator Jim Webb, who heads the Foreign Relations subcommittee on 
              East Asia, had made an unusually open appeal not to place Thailand on 
              the watch list.</p>
              <p>Webb visited Bangkok this month and said US embassy staff disagreed 
              with the intended downgrade as it could curb assistance for democracy 
              and human rights programs in the wake of the kingdom's political 
              violence.</p>
              <p>The downgrade occurs "at a time when this type of aide is 
              desperately needed to bolster political reforms in Thailand and to 
              promote political stability," Webb said last week in a letter to 
              Clinton.</p>
              <p>The State Department recognized improvements in Pakistan, which was 
              taken off the watch list, and Malaysia, which was on the watch list but 
              lifted from the lowest category.</p>
              <p>Pakistan "has dramatically increased the number of convictions and 
              prosecutions for human trafficking, undertaking creative efforts to 
              prevent bonded labor," Luis CdeBaca, the US envoy on human trafficking, 
              told reporters.</p>
              <p>Malaysian authorities "have acknowledged and begun to tackle their 
              serious human trafficking problem, including intensified engagement with
               foreign governments," CdeBaca said.</p>
              <p>From other regions, Cuba, Iran and Saudi Arabia remained in the 
              rock-bottom category and the Dominican Republic was newly added.</p>
              <p>Representative Christopher Smith, a Republican who authored the law 
              that requires the human trafficking report, said that more countries 
              should have been assigned the lowest rank.</p>
              <p>"If we are willing to hold the Dominican Republic to account, as we 
              should, it's outrageous that China, Vietnam and India get a free pass," 
              Smith said.</p>
              <p>Taiwan was upgraded and listed as fully compliant in efforts against
               human trafficking after starting new services for victims, CdeBaca 
              said.</p>
              <p>Australia, New Zealand and South Korea were also listed as fully 
              compliant.</p>
              <p>For the first time, the United States included itself in the report.
               It ranked itself in compliance.</p>
              <p>Japan was listed as not fully compliant but making efforts. The 
              United States put its close ally on the watch list in 2004 and 2005, 
              embarrassing Tokyo into stepping up efforts to protect trafficked women.</p>
