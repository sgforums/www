              <p><strong><span class="title">Geylang cleanup leads to vice in heartland - The Straits Times</span></strong></p>
              <p>By Sujin Thomas</p>
              <p><span class="txt-body">
              </span></p><p>WHETHER in Marine Parade or Bedok, Kovan or 
              online, prostitutes are making their presence felt.</p>
              <p>No longer 
              are they plying their trade in traditional red-light districts such as 
              Geylang, going by police vice raids over the past few months.</p>
              <p>Their forays into the HDB heartland are upsetting MPs, who think
               that, among other things, the 'cleanup' of Geylang has simply led to 
              the pimps and prostitutes moving elsewhere.</p>
              <p>MP for Tanjong Pagar 
              GRC Baey Yam Keng said: 'They are
              spilling out because of the raids. People accept what they do in 
              Geylang, but may not be used to it elsewhere.'</p>
              <p>A bigger concern 
              they have is whether more will enter Singapore with the establishment of
               the two integrated resorts and the influx of
              gamblers and high-rollers the IRs are expected to bring in.</p>
              <p>Mr 
              Baey said: 'Singapore has always been welcoming to tourists who may seek
               different sorts of pleasure activities. When demand goes up, so will 
              supply.'</p>
              <p>Already, the numbers are
              not good: A total of 7,614 foreign women were arrested for vice-related 
              activities last year, up from 5,047 in 2008.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, police 
              said 60 Chinese women had been arrested for offences such as vice 
              activities at 32 unlicensed massage parlours
              in Bedok, Tampines and Marine Parade. They were nabbed over a 15-day 
              operation in March.</p>
              <p>Anti-vice raids had been carried out in 
              Geylang, Kovan and two budget hotels at Balestier Road, in which 12 
              foreigners were arrested.</p>
              <p>Some of those
              arrested had also hawked their sexual services online: Customers made an
               online booking and turned up at an appointed time at a pre-arranged 
              hotel room, mostly in budget hotels in Bugis, Lavender and Little India.</p>
              <p>On April 21, budget hotel owner
              Siah Chen Long, 52, was convicted of allowing prostitutes to carry out 
              vice activities in his hotel, Shing Hotel, at Kitchener Road.</p>
              <p>A 
              day after, police raided a budget hotel at Lavender Street and caught 38
               women for vice activities.</p>
              <p>Criminal Investigation Department director Ng Boon Gay had said then:
               'Vice operators who think they can operate freely under the anonymity 
              of the Internet are sadly mistaken. We will continue to clamp down on 
              syndicates and hotel operators who
              knowingly facilitate such illicit activities.'</p>
              <p>The authorities 
              had long held the view that vice could not be eradicated completely, and
               the strategy was to contain these activities within traditional 
              red-light areas.</p>
              <p>But pimps and
              prostitutes, both licensed and illegal, who do their business in Geylang
               say the police are coming down hard on them. A pimp who runs a brothel 
              with Thai women said: 'Anti-vice officers raid a few times a day. It has
               affected our business as everyone
              scatters. We don't see as many streetwalkers these days as we used to.'</p>
              <p>He said many streetwalkers had moved out of Geylang over the past 
              two years into areas such as Balestier to get out of the eye of the 
              authorities.</p>
              <p>Asked about their
              vigorous enforcement in Geylang, a police spokesman said they have 
              always taken a tough stand against vice activities 'regardless of where 
              they occur'.</p>
              <p>Lawyers said the crackdown in Geylang can be 
              attributed to the influx of foreign prostitutes
              who come here on social visit passes.</p>
              <p>But why hit Geylang so 
              hard only to send the prostitutes moving to the heartland to ply their 
              trade?</p>
              <p>Lawyer Chia Boon Teck said: 'Residents and prostitutes in 
              Geylang have always adopted a
              live-and-let-live attitude. But when the number of prostitutes rises and
               they become so blatant about it, the police have to do something.'</p>
              <p>Lawyer
               Shashi Nathan suggested another possibility: The amendment to the Penal
               Code in 2008, which makes
              it illegal for anyone to obtain sexual services from someone under 18. 
              He said: 'What the police are doing could well be about keeping controls
               in place, that is, to clamp down on unlicensed pimps who bring in young
               girls and then live off their
              earnings.'</p>
              <p>MPs, such as Ms Lee Bee Wah of Ang Mo Kio GRC, said 
              police are taking action because of residents' complaints about vice 
              activities in their neighbourhoods.</p>
              <p>She said: 'Their numbers may
               have gone up, and so complaints have too.
              Obviously, they (pimps and prostitutes) will go wherever they think 
              there is business. If we don't do anything about it, it will get worse.'</p>
              <p>Mr Christopher De Souza, an MP for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, said the
               raids send the 'right signal' that
              vice in the heartland will not be tolerated.</p>
              <p>Both he and Ms 
              Cynthia Phua, an MP for Aljunied GRC, want some curbs on the 
              establishment of budget or 'transit' hotels.</p>
              <p>Mr De Souza 
              suggested banning hotels from operating on an hourly rate in
              all residential areas. He said: 'Transit rates are a euphemism for 
              hourly rates. Why would any traveller transiting here for an hour or so 
              need to put up in a hotel about an hour away from the airport?'</p>
              <p>Ms
               Phua is perturbed that two budget hotels
              have been allowed to operate between Upper Serangoon Road and Sireh 
              Place.</p>
              <p>She told The Straits Times: 'Residents have to come 
              face-to-face with these activities, even if it may just appear to be a 
              couple walking in and out (of the hotel).'</p>
