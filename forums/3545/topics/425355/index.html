               latest  cuisine being offered in some restaurant downtown? Sadly, the 
              answer is no.  </p>

              <hr>
              <p class="style25">With alarming statistics,
               vivid pictures and videos being  flashed on the screen, I was fortunate
               to be able to attend this very educational  environmental protection 
              talk conducted by Tzu Chi volunteer, Brother Cai Rong  Fu, which was 
              also being attended by more than 60 medical staff, in this very  
              meaningful afternoon session on 29th Feb 2008 at Gleneagles Hospital.</p>
              <p class="style25">In  his presentation, 
              Brother Cai shared with us what “plastic soup” is, and how it  was 
              formed and why we should continue to practice environmental protection 
              for  the benefits of our children and future generations.</p>
              <p class="style25">The  Pacific “plastic 
              soup”, or the great Pacific garbage  patch,  is  the world’s largest 
              rubbish dump which is formed by two massive, linked areas  of 
              circulating rubbish. Discovered in 1997 by American  sailor Charles 
              Moore, it is a vast area of plastic debris  and other flotsam drifting 
              in the northern Pacific Ocean,  held there by swirling ocean currents <em>(see  footnotes 1 &amp; 2). </em></p>
              <p class="style25">As the “plastic soup” is 
              now twice the size of  continental United States, scientists are very 
              alarmed by its ever-growing size  since it was first discovered and the 
              possible impacts on human health.</p>
              <p class="style25">How is “plastic soup” 
              formed? Historically, flotsam in  the gyres has biodegraded. But modern 
              plastics do not break down like other  oceanic debris, meaning objects 
              half a century old have been found in the North  Pacific Gyre. Instead 
              the plastic slowly photodegrades (i.e. the process of  breaking down 
              into smaller pieces due to being exposed to sunlight), becoming  brittle
               and disintegrating into smaller and smaller pieces which enter the food
                chain and end up in the stomachs of birds and other animals.</p>
              <p class="style25">Hearing Brother Cai’s 
              sharing on the topic of “plastic  soup” and how important it is for us 
              to start on environmental protection for  the betterment of our 
              children’s future, it sent shivers down my spine. </p>
              <p class="style25">Have I ever unknowingly, 
              ate or drank some “plastic soup”  before? Was this one of the reasons 
              why the number of cancer patients had  increased tremendously in recent 
              years? From now onwards, what can I do to  prevent this “plastic soup” 
              from growing larger in size? Will I ever be able to  leave this world in
               peace knowing that I am one of the “culprits” who had  contributed 
              towards the pollution of our one and only one, precious mother Earth?</p>
              <p class="style25">After attending this 
              talk, the very thought of “plastic  soup” kept appearing in my mind. I 
              began to feel that I am a very blessed  person, to be able to live in 
              modern day comforts and enjoying high standard of  living. However, what
               price am I paying for my present lifestyle? Now then I can  fully 
              appreciate why our Master Cheng Yen has been appealing to everyone, for 
               almost twenty years, to do recycling and take part in environmental 
              protection  activities.</p>
              <p class="style25">I promised myself, for 
              the sake of my children and our  future generations, I will be more 
              proactive in the area of environmental  protection, will continue to 
              contribute my tiny efforts in leading a greener  lifestyle, and will 
              strive to become a happy environmental  protection volunteer!</p>
