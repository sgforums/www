              <h1 class="storyheadline">Changing pay-cut mindset: Govt-linked firms must take lead</h1>
              <p>WHILE the joint reply by the Singapore National Employers Federation, 
              the Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress on 
              Thursday is heartening ('Less than 3% of private firms cut older 
              workers' wages'), how many government and government-linked companies 
              implement the wage cut for older workers?</p>
              <p>From our experience with Singapore Airlines (SIA), it was 
              simply the extraction of the maximum cut permissible under the law, 
              without any due regard given to the reasonable mitigation factors 
              provided under the legislation.</p>
              <p>It was really a case of no cut, no job. This was despite the
               fact that there was no change other than the pilot turning 60 years 
              old.</p>
              <p>What is worse is that of late, SIA Cargo has come up with a 
              scheme that will employ a national pilot beyond age 62 only on a 
              daily-rated basis. There is no assurance of any minimum level of monthly
               income. Effectively, that would be a wage cut beyond 10 per cent.</p>
              <p>As pilots, we can work up to age 65, legally. Here is a 
              company that has been struggling to stay above water, and yet it is 
              willing to hire the more expensive expatriate pilot on a longer contract
               term, with the attendant costs such as housing and child allowances.</p>
              <p>Why are they denying the national pilot, who helped build up
               the national icon, the same opportunity of a job until the end of his 
              useful working life?</p>
              <p>We are not asking for freebies, merely fairness and equity.</p>
              <p>How can one, and a national at that, be denied a job, or 
              even be offered unfavourable terms, just because of his age?</p>
              <p>I know that efforts are being made at all levels to change 
              the mindset and to discourage discrimination based on age, but for this 
              lifelong employment initiative to really take off, all government and 
              government-linked companies must be directed to take the lead and do the
               right thing.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Pay cut for older workers: What's SIA's policy?</h1>
              <p>THE joint reply by the Singapore National Employers Federation, the 
              Ministry of Manpower and the National Trades Union Congress last 
              Thursday ('Less than 3% of private firms cut older workers' wages') does
               not appear to take public listed companies into consideration.</p>
              <p>Singapore Airlines (SIA), SIAEC (SIA Engineering) and all 
              other SIA-affiliated companies practise 10 per cent across-the-board pay
               cut for all employees the moment they turn 60 years old.</p>
              <p>Such employees can expect their salary the month after their
               60th birthday to be 10 per cent less - with exactly the same workload 
              as in the month before.</p>
              <p>When queries are made to the human resource department about
               such cuts, especially in relation to the new government push to extend 
              the working life of experienced older workers, the reply given is that 
              it is 'company policy'.</p>
              <p>This, at a time when SIA has great difficulty attracting and
               retaining younger workers to replenish the labour pool as people leave 
              for various reasons.</p>
              <p>It is time for these companies to rethink their human 
              resource policies instead of waiting for a mandate from the authorities 
              before more older workers choose to retire than stay and be exploited.</p>

              <div class="kicker">OLDER WORKERS' WAGES</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Adjustments help seniors stay employed</h1>
              <p>WE THANK Madam Ee Kit Heng ('CPF cuts based on age, which is not a 
                  reasonable factor', last Saturday) and Captain Rakesh Dir ('CPF cut a 
                  contradiction', Wednesday) for their views on the Central Provident Fund
                   contribution rates for older employees.</p>
              <p>While Singapore has seen the employment rate of older 
                  residents aged 55 to 64 rise from 43 per cent in 1999 to 57 per cent 
                  last year, it is still significantly lower than the overall employment 
                  rate of 76 per cent for all age groups. We have introduced various 
                  measures to improve the ability of older workers to stay employed.</p>
              <p>In our labour market, wages still contain significant 
                  elements of seniority-based pay, where wages increase automatically with
                   age regardless of workers' productivity and performance. This may 
                  result in older workers becoming less competitive. Some wage adjustment 
                  is, therefore, necessary in order to maintain the employability of 
                  workers as they age.</p>
              <p>Singapore's approach is twofold. First, an adjustment 
                  through the CPF contribution rates for older workers, which applies to 
                  all firms across the board. Second, allowing employers to adjust the 
                  salaries of their workers as they reach age 60. However, employers 
                  should not do so automatically, but should take into account the ability
                   and performance of their workers as well as other relevant factors.</p>
              <p>In addition, since 2007, the Workfare Income Supplement has 
                  also helped to boost the annual income of older, low-income employees 
                  and make up for the lower CPF contribution rates.</p>
              <p>The Ministry of Manpower will continue to work with the 
                  tripartite partners to enhance the employability of older employees, 
                  through training, skills upgrading and job redesign. This will reduce 
                  the element of seniority-based pay in wage structures, and hence reduce 
                  the extent of wage adjustments that older workers will face.</p>
