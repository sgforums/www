              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : National
               Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said there are signs that measures to 
              cool the property market have taken effect.<br><br>There has been at 
              least a 20 per cent drop in HDB resale transactions this quarter while 
              Cash-over-Valuation (COV) is down some 10 per cent from the third 
              quarter.<br><br>Mr Mah was speaking at the ground breaking ceremony of 
              the SkyVille@Dawson and SkyTerrace@Dawson on Saturday morning.<br><br>Public
               housing prices have started to ease since property cooling measures 
              were introduced in August 30 this year.<br><br>Mr Mah said HDB resale 
              transactions have gone down by at least 20 per cent so far this quarter.
               <br><br>Average transactions for the last three quarters were about 
              8,000 to 9,000 per quarter.<br><br>He said COV figures have also dropped
               by more than 10 per cent from around S$30,000 in the third quarter to 
              about S$25,000 last month. <br><br>Mr Mah said: "With COVs coming down, I
               think it's good for first-time buyers who want to buy a resale flat in a
               particular area. And of course with transactions coming down, it does 
              mean there will be more opportunities for first-time buyers to come into
               the market."<br><br>"So all in all, I would say the cooling measures 
              have started to take effect. But the overall impact is still too early 
              to tell. I think we'll wait a few months more." <br><br>Mr Mah said 
              private property prices have also moderated, with price increases at 
              about 3 per cent, compared to 5 per cent in previous quarters. <br><br>Private
               property transaction volumes also went down sharply in September after 
              measures were introduced.<br><br>But with increasing liquidity and 
              measures also being taken in other property markets overseas, Mr Mah 
              noted there may be more funds entering Singapore. <br><br>This could 
              create pressure for prices to go up.<br><br>"Based on the outcomes, 
              based on how the market is reacting at the moment, we think it is a bit 
              too early for us to do anything. So we will wait for a while. But we are
               watching it constantly," said Minister Mah.  <br><br>Mr Mah also 
              unveiled the Dawson Landscape Masterplan to residents of Dawson estate, a
               step towards realising the "housing in a park" concept announced in 
              2008.<br><br>They will enjoy enhanced pedestrian and cycling connections
               and environmentally-0friendly features like rain gardens to collect 
              rain water. <br><br>While some residents appreciated the changes, others
               felt more could be done.<br><br>"The canal is quite good because I can 
              cycle around here, so it's another form of exercise. And it links all 
              the way to Great World (City) and further down, so it's quite good for 
              jogging," said 25-year-old Tee Eng Hua, a Dawson Estate resident. <br><br>"What
               is lacking here is we have only a very small Dawson shopping place. 
              They could have built a bigger one, now that SKyTerrace and SkyVille are
               coming on board," said Dawson Estate resident Loh Kok Yew. <br><br>Mr 
              Mah also announced that HDB will launch the tender for the first mixed 
              commercial-residential site at Punggol Town Centre next week. <br><br>The
               new development will be next to the Punggol Waterway and Punggol MRT.<br><br>-

              consider more transparent 'Progressive Property Taxes' for SG.<br> <br> Based on <a href="http://iras.gov.sg/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_6E606833F548A48BE9072D1BF8860CC59BED0000/filename/E-Tax%20Guide%20on%20HDB%20Assessment.pdf">Annual Value (AV)</a>[<a href="http://tinyurl.com/49tersh">alt HDB link</a>]
               of your owner occupied home, the current tiers are as follows (Source: 
              'New Property Tax Computation for Home Owners from January 2011' [<a href="http://bensonkoh.com/2010/new-property-tax-computation-for-home-owners-from-january-2011/">bensonkoh, 22Feb2010</a>]):-<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>0% on your first $6,000 of AV</li>
              <li>4% on the next $59,000 of AV</li>
              <li>6% on anything above $65,000 of AV</li>
              </ol>I think that to curb speculation, the following tiered tax rate for all residential properties (which mirrors the <a href="http://iras.gov.sg/irasHome/page04.aspx?id=1190">income tax regime</a>) should apply:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>0% on your first $10,000 of AV</li>
              <li>4% on next $20K of AV, above $10K (plus nothing)</li>
              <li>6% on next $20k of AV above $30K  plus $800.</li>
              <li>8% on next $20K of AV above $50K  plus $2000.</li>
              <li>10% on next $20K of AV above $70K  plus $3600.</li>
              <li>12% on next $20K of AV above $90K  plus $5600.</li>
              <li>14% on any further AV above $110K plus $8000.</li>
              <li>All the a/m BEFORE a resident/PR owner occupied tax rebate of up to $800.</li>
              <li>The 'AV' shall be the "estimated annual rent that your property can fetch" [<a href="http://tinyurl.com/49tersh">HDB pdf link</a>] OR 3.5% of the property valuation, whichever the higher.</li>
              </ol>Why this new regime (subject to tweaking) is a good idea:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
              <li>SG has almost the highest Gini coefficient in the whole world [ref <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/107980/countries-with-the-biggest-gaps-between-rich-and-poor">Business-week</a>]. As such, there is an urgent need to reduce taxes on the lower and middle classes and to increase taxes on the upper classes.<br> All owner occupied properties below $30K AV pay zero property taxes, ditto all HDB  properties.<br> The definition of 'owner' shall be defined as the person owning 50% or more in shares of the said property.</li>
              <li>Some
               Singaporeans choose to live in pte property and enjoy the current 
              benefits of 'owner occupied' tax discounts whilst turning their HDB flat
               (govt/ public subsidised housing) into a vehicle of profit. This new 
              scheme would go some way towards eradicating this abnormality by 
              limiting the owner occupier to a tax rebate of $800 (or the actual 
              property tax, whichever lower)- a good substitution for the current 
              'limitless' owner occupied property tax discount. For the avoidance of 
              doubt, where a person owns BOTH HDB and pte properties, the HDB one, 
              such a person SHALL NOT enjoy the (up to) $800 ppty tax rebate on the 
              pte property, it shall by default apply to the HDB one.</li>
              <li>Eradicate
               the need for the odd and queer double ('duplicate') 'owner occupied' 
              property tax rebate currently applicable to HDB flats: the first under 
              the usual 'owner occupied scheme' (discounted 4% property tax scheme), 
              the second under the 'HDB owner occupied scheme' (up to $120 discount)[<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_aMxISxmw94Y/TTN2_Ypm9qI/AAAAAAAAARc/vmKEdB-pD00/s1600/Property+Tax+on+HDB+flats+for+2010+%2528IRAS%252C+PDF%2529.JPG">IRAS pamphlet link</a>].</li>
              <li>Making
               permanent such progressive ppty taxes would also improve control over 
              the entire residential property market rather then such laissez-faire 
              attitudes  dependent on stop gap measures and knee jerk responses- a 
              more sincere concern for social inequalities is necessary rather than 
              profit at all costs objectives.</li>
              <li>Allow more progressive taxes 
              benefiting the ave SGporean most with  Singaporeans enjoying rebates, 
              this is because statistics show that  poorer SGporeans are being 
              exploited by their richer brethren.<br> Allowing the rich to contribute more towards the building of SG is an 
              egalitarian principle. Residents of public housing and cheaper private 
              residents should not have to pay property tax at all/ pay reduced 
              amounts.<br> Acc to 'SG Budget speech2010'&gt;<a href="http://www.mof.gov.sg/budget_2010/speech_toc/pe.html#s2">Shift to a Progressive Property Tax Regime</a>, E.20.:<em> "Owners of high-end properties with AVs of more than $77,000 .. 
              comprise the top 3% of private  owner-occupied residential properties, 
              or the top 0.4% of all  owner-occupied homes in Singapore"</em>. By my 
              calc (see bottom), only owner occupied residential properties &gt;$64K 
              AV will pay increased property taxes, everyone else pays less then 
              current (ditto for non-owner occupied res. ppties &gt;$38K). Most pte 
              landed properties are freehold properties, unlike HDB which by virtue of
               its 99yr lease, remains a depreciating asset- this is why HDB and 
              cheaper pte ppty dwellers ought to enjoy ppty tax discounts/ rebates.</li>
              <li>Foreigners
               owning SG properties shall only be entitled to an 'owner occupied tax 
              discount' half of the SGporean/ PR rate- provided that they spend 
              &gt;180days in SG per annum.</li>
              <li>The waiver of majority of 
              SG'poreans/PR from paying property taxes would do much to reduce SG's 
              Gini coefficient as well as go far to promote home ownership amongst 
              Singaporeans as the rich in SG are disallowed unlimited owner occupant 
              tax benefits at the expense of poorer SGporeans.</li>
              <li>Allow the 
              increased property taxes collected from rich home owners to offset any 
              need to further increase GST for all Singaporeans and allow the 
              'progressiveness' of ppty tax rates to mirror income tax rates; make 
              MND's job of regulating property demand easier, and make all 
              Singaporeans feel more welcomed to a home governed on egalitarian 
              principles.</li>
              <li>'PS': For further consideration would be a freehold 
              property tax surcharge whereby freehold properties are further taxed a 
              surcharge of 20%. This is to subsidize our currently exorbitant defense 
              spending, the peace and stability SG govt by which the value of 
              expensive pte ppties in SG are upheld- this however, should be a point 
              for consideration only as these additional taxes (like any other taxes) 
              require a step wise approach to implementation.</li>
