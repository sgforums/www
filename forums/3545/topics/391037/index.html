              <p><strong>Malay community to look at playing a more active part in integrating new citizens</strong><br> <span class="update">By Saifulbahri Ismail, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 16 February 2010 1830 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: With many new citizens coming from China and India,
              the local Chinese and Indian communities have been busy trying to
              integrate these new citizens.
              <br> <br>Malay dance and silat are items put up at community events by
              members of the People's Association Malay Activity Executive Committee
              Co-ordinating Council or MESRA.
              <br> <br> They are part of efforts to promote social cohesion in Singapore's multi-racial society.
              <br> <br> However, with the arrival of more new citizens, MESRA wants to be more pro-active in reaching out to them.
              <br> <br>Mustaffa Abu Bakar, chairman, MESRA, said: "I think in a way, we
              have taken things for granted. We have been quiet and maybe we have to
              partake in the integration exercise by sending our tarian, our silat.
              But I think more needs to be done."
              <br> <br>To help organisations create more opportunities for interaction
              between Singaporeans and new citizens, the government launched a
              Community Integration Fund last year.
              <br> <br> One of the beneficiaries is Hum Theatre which received S$16,000 to organise a play called Rafta Rafta.
              <br> <br>Daisy Irani, co-founder, Hum Theatre, said: "What we want to do is
              do plays in English. The reason to do that is so that the audience can
              comprise the locals, new citizens even a wider base - people who want
              to just enjoy and understand the sensibilities and sensitivities of the
              Indians."
              <br> <br> The Malay community is also looking into how it can better understand the new citizens and what they can offer to the community.
              <br> <br>Yang Razali Kassim, chairman, AMP Convention Steering Committee,
              said: "We see the Muslim foreign expatriates as having skills, talents
              and expertise that our Malay community can benefit from. I see them
              like a new engine for the growth of the Malay community."
              <br> <br> Malay organisations said efforts must also be made to reach out to the larger groups of new citizens.
              <br> <br> If not, the repercussions could be damaging.
              <br> <br>Zulkifli Mohammed, president, Majlis Pusat, said: "Well I guess we
              don't want to be perceived as a community that is at the fringe. So if
              we don't come in and participate in this kind of national project, then
              people will have a distorted view of the Malay community, that they
              keep to themselves and they are isolationists."
              <br> <br>Mr Zulkifli added that the Malays being the largest minority group
              also has an important role to play in helping the new citizens sink
              their roots in Singapore. - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><br>Some are here working and are aware of the bawu already, that is why many don't want to become citizens.</p>
              <p>I chatted with a bangladesh doing cleaning about becoming citizen, he said he not interested he will work and contract ends he goes back.</p>
