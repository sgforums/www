              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Angela Lim – July 19th, 2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p>Britain’s Foreign Office is seeking more information on the arrest of
               one of its citizens, a veteran author, in Singapore.</p>
              <p><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=alan+shadrake&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Alan
               Shadrake</a>, 75, was arrested on Sunday on charges of criminal 
              defamation and contempt of court, barely a day after he launched a book 
              on the death penalty in the city-state. He remains in police custody 
              pending an investigation.</p>
              <p>A statement obtained by Yahoo! Singapore also confirmed that the 
              British High Commission in Singapore is in touch with the author.</p>
              <p>“We can confirm that we have been informed about the detention of Mr 
              Alan Shadrake on 18 July 2010 and are providing consular assistance,” 
              said a spokesperson in an emailed statement.</p>
              <p>Shadrake’s arrest comes after the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Media+Development+Authority&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Media
               Development Authority</a> lodged a report the eve of his book launch, 
              the Singapore police said in a statement. Mr Shadrake has also been 
              served with an application by the attorney-general for “an order of 
              committal for contempt of court”, it said.</p>
              <p>News of the author’s arrest has made headlines in newspapers across 
              the world, including in England, India, Canada and Australia.</p>
              <p>In an email to <em>Reuters</em> on July 3, Shadrake called himself a 
              “British freelance journalist and author” who planned to launch his 
              latest book <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Once+A+Jolly+Hangman:+Singapore+Justice+in+the+Dock&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">“Once
               A Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock”</a> in the city-state 
              on Saturday.</p>
              <p>His book, which was released for sale at Kinokuniya’s Ngee Ann City 
              store last month but which has since been taken off the shelves, alleges
               double standards in Singapore’s use of the death penalty.</p>
              <p>According to <em>The Straits Times, </em>the 219-page book was filled
               with accounts of high-profile cases in Singapore involving the use 
              of the death penalty. It also included interviews with Darshan Singh, 
              the long-time chief executioner at Singapore’s Changi Prison, who has 
              since retired.</p>
              <p>Shadrake, who has written articles for London’s <em>Daily Telegraph</em> and other newspapers, told AFP after the book’s Singapore launch on 
              Saturday that he had expected trouble, but felt that the authorities 
              were not going to take action.</p>
              <p>“If they do anything, it’ll just draw more attention to it all, and 
              they have no defence,” he had said.</p>

              I think death penalty should only be given to those who murdered others. The reason for me thinking this is that if the person can kill another person, he/she will have no problems killing another time or the third time or more. So they deserves to be removed from society.
              
              However, for anything else, like peddling drugs, I think death penalty is too much. Besides, you can't always blame the seller, if someone purchase drugs then they deserves to be punished. I mean if someone wants to purchase a knife to do bad things, then maybe you want to punish the person who sells the knife to that person too?

              <p>What i don't understand is that since when an opinon of a law become an issue of "contempt of court" ?</p>
              <p>I mean if the old guy post on Youtude or across all social media. Around the World will sees it ......My point is you can't stop debate on this topics in the age of internet.</p>
              <p>Arresting the man make him a 1 man "Crusade" against an "authoritarin regime" is that what Singapore want to show case to the world......That we can't even debate and defend openly on this topics? considering the "Elite" and "Talent folks" we hired in the government....!!</p>
              <p>All we did was "Ka Chen"  lock him up....!!!! and say it is "contempt of court" who are they trying to convince? "Singaporean" or the "World outside"</p>

              <p><strong>British author Alan Shadrake out on police bail</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 20 July 2010 1014 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Police said they released British national 
              Alan Shadrake on police bail on Tuesday morning.
              <br> <br> He is required to remain in Singapore to assist the police in its 
              investigations.
              <br> <br> The police said Mr Shadrake must seek its permission if he wants to 
              leave the country.
              <br> <br> A Home Affairs Ministry spokesman said the Briton is now under 
              investigation for criminal defamation.
              <br> <br> He is also the subject of contempt of court proceedings initiated by the
               Attorney-General's Chambers.
              <br> <br> The spokesman said "his anti-death penalty views are not the issue in 
              these investigations; it is his violation of the laws of Singapore which
               are."
              <br> <br> The spokesman added that anyone - Singaporean or otherwise - who breaks 
              the law regardless of the cause he touts, will be taken to task.
              <br> <br> He said Mr Shadrake is no exception - he cannot expect to commit 
              offences and then assume that he will be exempted from being held 
              accountable under the law.
              <br> <br> Mr Shadrake was arrested at his hotel a day after the launch of his book
               "Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore Justice in the Dock", in which he 
              alleged double standards in Singapore's use of the death penalty.      -
