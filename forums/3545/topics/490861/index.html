              NTUC Income gets youths to meet their â€œfuture selves
              
              NTUC Income is working with BBH Asia Pacific to launch a brand campaign challenging Singaporeans to be â€˜future readyâ€™ before they meet their future â€˜older selvesâ€™ and realise that they have not prepared themselves for old age.
              
              The integrated campaign -â€˜Future Youâ€™ â€“ features creative work telling the story of young people who meet their future selves in both good and bad scenarios, and receive a reaction depending on how well they have planned for their future.

            <div class='col-md body'>To those Singaporean youth who are unable to continue their studies, please do not be despair. If you need to work because of unforeseen circumstances occurred in your life, just work and do not worry about your future. This could be a blessing in disguise and maybe you need to release something to gain something better. Do not self-pity yourselves or see yourselves as a failure because that will not help you.

              Thank you. Yes, I agree with you.  One must know what you are capable of in life and what you are good at in search of a career path. Paper qualification is important but if you don't have it....make the best of yourselves in life.
