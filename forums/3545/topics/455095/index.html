              <h2>Why Singaporeans are one of the most hardworking people in the world</h2>
              <p class="date">Posted by temasektimes on July 4, 2012</p>
              <p class="date">I believe Singaporeans are really one of THE most hardworking people 
              in the world. (arguably) but then due to the policies which the 
              government has opted for, they have turned people into working cows 
              constantly draining any milk inside them with all the crazy taxes 
              imposed and miscellaneous fees, electricity and water which are not 
              subsidized as in other countries, crazy housing prices, non welfare 
              state and overly lenient immigration policies.</p>
              <p>IT IS PARTICULARLY BECAUSE OF THE NON WELFARE STATE CHARACTERISTIC, 
              that makes Singapore so attractive to foreign talent and foreign wealth.
               The government is always seeking to broaden its tax base and increase 
              tax revenue… I understand that surpluses are important to build reserves
               but not to the extent that it squeezes the middle income people so much
               so that they become over worked, jaded, do not have a positive outlook 
              in life and can’t look forward to the retirement years. How much 
              reserves do you want? For the low income group, the plight is even worse
               now, it’s as if they will not be able to come out of this social class 
              unless they are somehow born a genius. Which is one every century like 
              Albert Einstein.</p>
              <p>Transport cost (going to work) already takes up so much money. 
              (public transport ain’t that cheap you know) and FOOD prices are 
              soaring. The cost of living is so high that people don’t even want to 
              have babies. And then this is what you justify your immigration policies
               by. By blaming Singaporeans for not giving birth enough. And you plead 
              your case by saying that you give birth benefits. $10000? Seriously, 
              after seeing a pediatrician a few times, it is enough to completely use 
              it up. And the doctors can’t be to blame completely as well, their 
              tuition fees like the rest of the courses are so high that they need to 
              charge this amount to pay their bills.</p>
              <p>WHY DO UNIVERSITIES CHARGE SO MUCH? And what do they do with the 
              money, they give it away in scholarships which the locals are not able 
              to get. MONEY IS FLOWING OUT. SINGAPOREANS HARD EARNED CASH. You’re 
              lucky Singaporeans are still willing to work at 60. Just look at Greece,
               the people aren’t willing to work anymore, and thus they are in deep 
              shit. So you’re lucky Singaporeans are cooperating with you.</p>
              <p>Instead of spending so much in defense which is like almost useless 
              if any major superpower wants to take control. They do not fear us 
              because of our army. Instead, it’s because the only way they can stead 
              to gain from us, is if we are still around and coopertate with them, 
              since Singapore only has human resource to offer, no oil no gold, etc 
              etc. hence, there is no point for them to attack us.</p>
              <p>When will the money be used to help the poor? I’m not talking about 
              all the poor, only those that are willing to work hard. And when I mean 
              help, it doesn’t mean a lump sum of 2000 dollars in the FAS we have in 
              school, but rather to sponsor them to study as long as they are 
              hardworking enough. CUT DOWN ON THE NUMBER OF FOREIGN PLACES GIVEN AND 
              GIVE MORE TO LOCALS IF YOUR EXCUSE IS THAT THERE IS NOT ENOUGH PLACES. 
              There are so many things you can do yet you choose to ignore this part 
              and focus on the rights of foreigners and not the rights of your own 
              people.</p>
              <p>Instead of focusing on how to attract even more foreign talent with 
              IRs and GARDENS BY THE BAY, RWS etc, as well as focusing on the rights 
              off maids etc, why not focus on the rights of your own people first, the
               freedom of expression for instance. I’m not saying you aren’t focusing 
              at all on your people, but rather focus MORE! So much MORE can be done. 
              This is not demanding, this is basic necessities.</p>
              <p>Foreigners love that Singapore has no welfare system so that they 
              know their tax is spent on themselves and not the lower classes of 
              society. HOW FLAWED IS THIS CONCEPT? If you really want the poor to be 
              motivated to work hard and study hard, they need to see the light at the
               end of the tunnel. Now the light is so small that they don’t even 
              bother. SO MANY LOW INCOME STUDENTS CHASING AFTER SO FEW SPOTS AND 
              SCHOLARSHIPS. how can that be motivating. They know that even if they 
              work super hard, the fact is many of them will still not be able to get 
              the scholarships. PROVIDE MORE FOR LOCALS. also, why aren’t ASEAN 
              scholarships for locals to study at local universities? A bit funny 
              don’t you think considering your own people are from ASEAN as well? 
              Think about it</p>
              <p>To add on, Singaporeans and PRs have to serve army and use 2 years of
               their life which they could be using to build a career and save up for 
              their golden years. Foreigners come take the scholarships, study and 
              leave WITHOUT NS. and although, I know what I mentioned above is a lot 
              of things that need to be handled, but you are one of the highest paid 
              ministers of the WORLD, if you can take that kind of salary home, you 
              better be able to handle this kind of shit and be able to bear the 
              responsibility of solving ALL the problems associated with it.</p>
              <p>IN SHORT, YOU SIGNED UP FOR THIS DEAL, YOU BETTER BE ABLE TO TAKE 
              EVERYTHING IN THE DEAL, NOT JUST THE PERKS BUT ALL THE NECESSARY 
              HARDWORK AND HOURS OF WORK AS WELL. Even if that means working through 
              the night. That’s what a million dollars is worth. Am I right?</p>

              <p>2. What do they do with the money? You obviously haven't been to NUS. They just built a new campus with 3 residential colleges, with 2 more under construction. They pay professors and lecturers and university. They have to pay for the maintanence for the entire bloody campus. The amount of money the university spends on foreign scholarships is PEANUTS compared to this.</p>

              <p>The education system and social conditioning have made Singaporeans a obedient son, worker and citizens.</p>
              <p>They subscribe to the old ethics of working hard and getting a regular paycheck.</p>
              <p>It was highlighted in Transitioning.sg that Singapore PMETs dun have the heart for setting up a business by themselves as failures and setbacks are part of the package.</p>
              <p>With the job market going for cheap labour, the job experience that you have gained so far will not guarantee you a job or higher pay.</p>
              <p>That is why so many PMETs are struggling with this issues when they are out of job.</p>
