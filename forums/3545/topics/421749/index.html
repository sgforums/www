              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The wet weather the past two days has affected businesses, travellers and shoppers.<br><br>Businesses along Orchard Road were expecting huge crowds of shoppers over the last weekend before Lunar New Year. <br><br>But they were sorely disappointed.<br><br>One
               business owner at Lucky Plaza said: "I think this is unusual. Normally 
              we see more crowds, but now I can see that even (during this) Chinese 
              New Year period, there are no people on Orchard Road."<br><br>Another 
              business owner at Lucky Plaza said: "This year, it is really quiet. 
              Hopefully we will get a better crowd, but the rain is killing us, 
              frankly speaking. I think the people in Chinatown are complaining. Last 
              year it was a lot better."<br><br>Some florists and nurseries Channel 
              NewsAsia spoke to said business dipped by about 20 per cent. But most 
              are confident it will pick up soon. <br><br>James Koh, co-partner of 
              Hawaii Landscape, said: "There is a slight slowdown, of course. (The 
              rain has) been continuous for about two nights. Other than that, people 
              are still coming. They still keep on coming with their umbrellas."<br><br>But there was a bright side for some shoppers. <br><br>One
               shopper at Far East Flora, Calvin Tan, said: "(The rain has helped me.)
               Since fewer people are coming, I managed to get a parking lot. Normally
               it is worse than this."<br><br>Tourists too felt the dampener in the festive mood. <br><br>One
               couple from the UK said: "We wanted to do some sightseeing, we went on a
               tour yesterday. It rained. We could not see anything from the coach. We
               got out, we were dripping wet. We go home today. We were here for three
               days. It is a shame."<br><br>Train services to and from Malaysia and Singapore have also been disrupted for a second day.<br><br>Keretapi
               Tanah Melayu (KTM) said eight services to and from Singapore to various
               parts of Malaysia have been disrupted because tracks are unsafe because
               of floods in Johor. <br><br>Of these, two trains to and from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have been cancelled. <br><br>Train
               services travelling to and from Singapore and Butterworth in Penang are
               now operating only to and from Kuala Lumpur to Butterworth.<br><br>But 
              despite the floods which have cut off some roads to towns such as Muar, 
              Segamat and Labis, coach services seem to be operating. <br><br>Travel 
              agencies told Channel NewsAsia that there has been a 30-40 per cent 
              increase in queries and last-minute bookings to Malaysia.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
