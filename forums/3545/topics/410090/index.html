              <p>As Singapore’s infrastructure groans under the weight of a five million plus population – more than a third of them foreigners – there’s rising resentment against the island state’s immigrant policy.</p>
              <p>BURSTING at our seams. This is a frequent phrase used to describe Singapore these days, after its population crossed the five million mark.</p>
              <p>Hardly a day passes without a citizen or two complaining about overcrowdedness or shortage of amenities or rising costs associated with the mass arrival of foreigners.</p>
              <p>With immigration continuing to rise, the controversy could become the hottest issue in the general election that is expected to take place within the next 12 months.</p>
              <p>What is annoying Singaporeans is, not their presence, but the large number of people who have arrived to work and live in their overstretched city.</p>
              <p>The sentiment is, however, not one way.</p>
              <p>Support is coming from a section of society which is greatly benefiting from cheap manpower and the larger customer base that the foreigners bring.</p>
              <p>For them, the newly-released statistics are encouraging. A new census report released last week shows the population reaching 5.08 million, with foreigners making up 36.4%, or more than a third.</p>
              <p>The number of foreign workers has risen some 75% from 750,000 in 2000 to 1.31 million currently.</p>
              <p>Adding to the overcrowdedness is the 1.1 million tourists who set foot on this 711 sq km island every month.</p>
              <p>The immigration policy has expanded the population by 25% in 10 years, one of the highest rates in the world, surpassing even the traditional migrant societies.</p>
              <p>Canada’s population, for instance, is 19.8% foreign-born, New Zealand’s 23% and the US 16%.</p>
              <p>In Japan, one legislator recently suggested raising the foreign content of its declining population to 10% within the next 10 years.</p>
              <p>Singapore’s record, as far as its citizens are concerned, is less than welcomed. The new arrivals have strained its infrastructure, creating a shortage in public housing that was once Singapore’s showcase to the world.</p>
              <p>As a result, thousands of graduates who plan to settle down are compelled to wait for years – or jostle with foreign PRs to pay a lot more for a resale flat. Roads and shopping plazas are jammed during weekends, and hospitals as well as buses and trains are packed.</p>
              <p>“People have to queue for a restaurant table and queue again to pay the bill,” one shopper moaned.</p>
              <p>Timmy lamented: “I remember Singapore was not like this a few years ago.</p>
              <p>“Now our standard of living is dropping every day.”</p>
              <p>Many are complaining of spiralling prices in the wake of growing demand. Another Singaporean, Daniel, said: “I find it unsettling just to note how fast our society is being taken over by foreigners.”</p>
              <p>Last week, a foreign correspondent based here wrote that Singapore is showing symptoms of urban stress as more immigrants and guest workers jostle for space with the locals.</p>
              <p>He named some of them – “flash floods along posh Orchard Road; packed subway trains; traffic gridlock in the morning and evening rush hours and intensifying competition for public flats.”</p>
              <p>They have affected Singapore’s image as a squeaky-clean, smooth-flowing city that has earned it the reputation as one of the world’s most livable, he added.</p>
              <p>Businesses and motorists recently complained about road closures or diversions for major public events.</p>
              <p>Motorists were asked to give way to buses transporting athletes taking part in the Youth Olympics; shops in the city centre were affected.</p>
              <p>To cope with increasing demand and shrinking supply, property developers have happily been reducing the average size of flats, making buyers pay more to get less.</p>
              <p>A 1,600 sq ft flat which was the average in the 80s is today regarded as a luxury. In fact, some under-300 sq ft apartment dwellings have made an appearance for S$500,000 (RM1.16mil) each – and sold like hot cakes.</p>
              <p>Singapore architect Khoo Peng Beng, in a speech last week in Venice, said that urban planners who were bracing for a influx of people should look to Singapore as a “model compact city”.</p>
              <p>The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) is evidently concerned about the rising public resentment.</p>
              <p>“It is fighting its biggest political battle in modern history,” said a company consultant. On the outcome will decide the long-term future of the party, he said.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last week announced a number of important measures to improve sentiments, including:</p>
              <p>Making it easier for first-time buyers by building a total 38,000 more government flats in 2010-11, as well as cutting down on owners having more than one such flat.</p>
              <p>Spending S$60bil (RM139bil) over the next 10 years to double Singapore’s mass rail network to relieve over-crowding.</p>
              <p>A top up of S$9,000 (RM20,848) to S$10,500 (RM24,323) over 12 years in their study grant and retirement fund for those Singaporeans who complete their 12-year national service cycle.</p>
              <p>It is apparently aimed at convincing Singaporeans that they come first before foreigners.</p>
              <p>The move to increase the chances of first-time buyers to get a subsidised flat is well received by some young Singaporeans, but few believe Lee has changed the overall political landscape.</p>
              <p>For the estimated 1.8 million foreign residents here, the uppermost question is whether it will lead to any deterioration of public sentiments towards them.</p>
              <p>In recent years, there had been increasing conflicts between locals and foreigners but rarely any violence. Political leaders have repeatedly appealed to citizens to help the new arrivals integrate.</p>
              <p>Prominent blogger Lucky Tan said that until the arrivals turned excessive, Singaporeans were the most open people in the world.</p>
              <p>“Nowhere else in the world can you find such a high level of acceptance of foreigners,” he noted.</p>
              <p>It was only when they crossed the 25% mark and structural unemployment emerged that Singaporeans began to react, he added.</p>
