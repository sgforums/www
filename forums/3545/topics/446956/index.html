              <p><span class="update">Posted: 09 February 2012 0632 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>WASHINGTON: 
              Singapore on Wednesday urged the United States to be careful in comments
               on China, warning that suggestions of a strategy to contain the rising 
              power could cause strife in Asia.<br><br>On a visit to Washington, 
              Foreign Minister K. Shanmugam voiced confidence that the State 
              Department accepted the need for cooperation with China but said that US
               commentary too often cast Asian politics in "win/lose sporting terms."<br><br>"Domestic
               pressures in the US and the demands of elections have resulted in some 
              anti-China rhetoric in domestic debates," Shanmugam told a conference on
               Singapore at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.<br><br>"We
               in Singapore understand that some of this is inevitable in an election 
              year. But Americans should not underestimate the extent to which such 
              rhetoric can spark reaction which can create a new and unintended 
              reality for the region," he said.<br><br>Singapore is a close partner of
               Washington and home to a key US military logistical base. But the 
              city-state is highly dependent on trade and has sought smooth commercial
               relations with Asia's major economic powers such as China, Japan and 
              India.<br><br>"It's quite untenable -- quite absurd -- to speak in terms
               of containment of China. That's a country with 1.3 billion people," 
              Shanmugam said.<br><br>"It is determined to progress in all fields and 
              take its rightful place in the community of nations. It will succeed in 
              that venture," he said.<br><br>The United States, while looking to trim 
              spending on its giant military to tame a soaring debt, has set a 
              priority on Asia as rapid economic growth and the rise of China look set
               to reshape the region.<br><br>The US military has sought closer 
              cooperation with the Philippines and Vietnam, which have accused China 
              of increasingly bellicose actions to assert control over disputed 
              territories in the South China Sea.<br><br>Shanmugan said that the 
              United States should also look at other ways of engagement in Asia such 
              as pressing ahead with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an emerging trade 
              pact that involves at least nine countries.<br><br>It is "a mistake to 
              focus only on the US military presence in the region, to the exclusion 
              of other dimensions of US policy," he said.<br><br>President Barack 
              Obama's administration has repeatedly said that it welcomes the rise of 
              China and will try to find areas for cooperation. Vice President Joe 
              Biden, ahead of a US visit by his counterpart Xi Jinping, called in a 
              statement Wednesday for the two powers to work together on "practical 
              issues."<br><br>Shanmugan did not cite examples of "anti-China" comments
               in the United States, but a number of US lawmakers have raised fears 
              about Beijing's rise.<br><br>At a congressional hearing Tuesday, 
              Representative Dana Rohrabacher called for the United States to ramp up 
              support for the Philippines to help the democratic US ally assert its 
              claims in maritime disputes with China.<br><br>"We need to stand as 
              aggressively and as solidly with the Filipino government in their 
              confronting an aggressive, arrogant China -- expansionist China -- as we
               have stood with them against radical Islam," said Rohrabacher, a 
              Republican from California.<br><br>Economic disputes with China have also come to the forefront.<br><br>In
               a recent television commercial that outraged Asian American groups, 
              Representative Pete Hoekstra -- a Republican seeking a Senate seat in 
              Michigan -- attacked his opponent with an advertisement criticizing US 
              debt to China.<br><br>In the advertisement, a young Asian woman -- in a 
              setting that looked more like Vietnam than China -- said in broken 
              English, "Your economy get very weak; ours get very good."<br><br>- AFP</span></span></p>

              <p>wrong - history has shown that the cheenas are war hungry people. just need to change a ruler like hitler and you see the whole china may shift to anotehr face. US and otehr major continents are our hope of keep this elephant in check. if she gets too powerful who know what will happen. japan, korea, taiwan, tibet - these are countries even in peace time they wanna take full control of. so beware. if they go war it won;t be too diffcilut for their military now toÂ  cross laso, vietnam, thailand, malasya and down to singapore.</p>
