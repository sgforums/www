              <h1 class="storyheadline">Do more to prevent property bubble</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Friday's article, 'Most flats sold with low cash 
              upfront: HDB'. I believe this trend is not healthy as it indicates that 
              valuation figures for HDB flats have finally caught up with the recent 
              years' soaring HDB resale flat prices.</p>
              <p>From these soaring prices, no one would have believed that 
              we went through and are still recovering from an economic downturn. A 
              three-room HDB flat in Tanjong Pagar Plaza was going for $280,000 in 
              2008, but in just two years, it is now going for more than $400,000.</p>
              <p>The younger generation of Singaporeans and even their 
              parents are feeling that an HDB resale flat is no longer within their 
              means.</p>
              <p>Generally, new job entrants who are thinking of starting a 
              family would rather buy a resale flat in mature estates than a new flat 
              in the outskirts. This is to cut down on the time taken for their daily 
              commute to work, particularly if they have young children that they need
               to take to grandparents' homes or childcare centres each day.</p>
              <p>I notice that the Ministry of National Development and the 
              Monetary Authority of Singapore have been taking sporadic measures to 
              curb the sharp increases in property prices, but the impact is not 
              really visible. I understand that the Government has to balance the 
              needs of different groups - investors who wish for property prices to 
              rise, and home buyers who are averse to soaring prices.</p>
              <p>The Government should take more comprehensive preventive 
              measures to curb a property bubble, rather than resort to remedial 
              actions when a bubble forms or bursts.</p>
              <p>Recent strong measures taken by the Chinese government to 
              curb undue property speculation have sent a strong signal to potential 
              speculators that the Chinese government means business. These measures 
              have also done much to reassure the public. I wonder if our Government 
              has taken sufficient measures to do the same.</p>

              <p>If you refer to the HDB resale price index, which new HDB valuations are based on, the prices of housing in Singapore has been increasing a few percentage points each quarter.  The soaring price index doesn't look like it's gonna come down anytime soon.  In fact, it's almost guaranteed not to come down, since MM Lee had predicted so.  And we know that somehow, the old MM Lee is right more often than not.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, MND came out with figures to justify the current prices as affordable, so no government intervention is necessary.  Anyway, they have also produced figures to show that the Singaporean household income has increased FASTER THAN the the increase in HDB prices over the past 10 years, so HDB prices could in fact rightfully be even higher.</p>
              <p>Plus, at least according to our PM, the government cannot do anything even if the prices keep rising, since price movements are due to market forces (supply and demand).  That is to say, the government cannot fix HDB prices just because there are not enough HDB flats (supply) and too many people looking for flats (demand), both of which are implied to be beyond control.</p>
              <p>What the government is saying is that  they won't do much, if anything at all, to prevent a bubble.  In fact, they are saying there is no bubble.  Prices will continue to rise, and justifiably so, as the market moves towards its price equilibrium.  And anyway, Singaporeans are still well able to afford HDB flats, with their income increase outpacing HDB price increase!</p>
