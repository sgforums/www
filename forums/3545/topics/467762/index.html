              <p>If you’re a high-earning expatriate banker in low-tax Singapore, now is not a good time to flaunt your good fortune.</p>
              <p>Singaporean citizens, incensed by a recent influx of international 
              talent into their crowded city-state, are clamouring for companies to 
              hire fewer foreigners. The Singapore government has responded by promising to ensure that employers give “fair consideration” to Singaporeans when they recruit.</p>
              <p>It doesn’t help the reputation of expat bankers when one of their 
              ranks allegedly breaks the law. Swiss national Juerg Buergin, a former 
              UBS executive, is currently on trial in Singapore for sex with an underage prostitute. Last year stockbroker Robert Dahlberg,
               a New Zealander, was involved in a boozy brawl with a taxi driver. Both
               could be seen as extreme examples of an unloved stereotype – the 
              arrogant expat.</p>
              <p>Here is some advice about how to fit into a Singaporean workplace rather than stand out.</p>
              <p>1) Don’t be an escapee</p>
              <p>An increasing number of overseas candidates wanted to move to Asia 
              purely because it was a safe haven for finance jobs compared with the 
              West, said Matthew Ng, senior consultant, banking and financial services
               at recruiters Ambition
               in Singapore. But boasting about using Singapore as a temporary safety 
              net won’t win you the trust of local staff and may mean you don’t get a 
              job there in the first place. “If candidates are relocating to Singapore
               as a shelter from less economically favourable countries, interviewers 
              would be able to differentiate them from those with genuine motivations 
              to be here,” added Ng.</p>
              <p>2) Make a meal of it</p>
              <p>Singapore citizens are mainly of Chinese, Malay and Indian descent, 
              and Singaporean cuisine is equally diverse. Nothing will win the hearts 
              of your co-workers quicker than enjoying a meal with them at a hawker centre,
               an open-air food court with stalls selling cheap and tasty local 
              delights. “Surprise your colleagues by showing a deep knowledge of their
               culture,” said Tony Latimer, an executive coach at the Asia-Pacific Corporate Coach Institute in
               Singapore. “Take them out for a great seafood dinner, but not in the 
              central tourist traps. For example, the best place to eat crab is in the
               middle of a suburb called  Ang Mo Kio,” he added.</p>
              <p>3) Drink kopi, not beer</p>
              <p>After work the bars of Boat Quay
               and other drinking haunts in central Singapore are full of foreign 
              bankers (mainly white, male ones). But to avoid such obvious expat 
              enclaves, try going for a sugary cup of  kopi,
               a local coffee made with condensed milk. “Socialising in Singapore 
              doesn’t always revolve around alcohol, so invite people out to a cafe 
              instead,” said Emma Boyd, director of consultancy Pinstripe Business Solutions in Singapore and a manager at the Financial Women’s Association Singapore.</p>
              <p>4) Understand your own office</p>
              <p>It’s not only Singaporean culture in general that you need to know 
              about; talk to your new colleagues before your arrive in Singapore and 
              understand what makes the team tick. “Finding your place in the team is 
              crucial for new expats,” said Gerard Milligan, strategic account 
              director at recruitment firm Randstad
               in Singapore. “A local private equity fund will have a different work 
              culture to a European bank, which again will be different to a local 
              bank,” he said.</p>
              <p>5) Meetings matter</p>
              <p>Employees in Singapore don’t generally take kindly to receiving 
              criticism in front of their colleagues. So save most of your negative 
              feedback for one-on-one meetings, said Boyd. “And remember that people 
              won’t always put their hands up to make suggestions in groups, so you 
              can also make use of these meetings to ask for their ideas,” she said.</p>
              <p>6) Have humility</p>
              <p>Certain personality traits made integrating into local culture easier, said Professor Sattar Bawany, managing director of the Centre for Executive Education
               in Singapore. These included humility, empathy, tolerance of ambiguity,
               flexibility, initiative, open-mindedness, and sociability, he added.</p>
              <p>7) Don’t rush in</p>
              <p>Expat assignments in Asia often involve making changes to the way a 
              team or company operates. Under pressure from head office to delivery 
              quick results, new arrivals may rush through reform without proper 
              consultation with local staff. “First gain an understanding of the local
               business before making changes,” said Natalia Shuman, chief operating 
              officer, North Asia,  Kelly Services.
               “Only changes that you can explain well will make sense to your team,” 
              she said. Latimer from the Corporate Coach Institute added: “When you 
              arrive, shut up and listen. Regardless of what you think you know, you 
              will be accepted faster by listening and asking. Allow the locals to 
              educate you.”</p>
