              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The services sector can expect an S$84 million boost to its service excellence efforts over the next five years. <br><br>Committed
               by the GEMS (Go-the-Extra-Mile-for-Service) Up committee, the funds 
              will be in the form of grants to help companies embark on 
              Customer-Centric Initiative (CCI) projects and to train their service 
              staff.<br><br>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, Lim Swee Say, 
              made the announcement at a CCI symposium marking the fifth anniversary 
              of Singapore's service excellence movement.<br><br>Introduced in 2005 to
               raise companies' service levels, the CCI movement today reaches out to 
              six service sectors - retail, food and beverage, healthcare, land 
              transport, hospitality and travel.<br><br>To date, 250 companies have embarked on CCI, benefitting their 7,800 outlets and 183,000 workers.<br><br>Speaking at the same symposium, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Lee Yi Shyan said these efforts are bearing fruit.<br><br>The
               latest Customer Satisfaction Index of Singapore revealed that the 
              perceived service quality, one of the key drivers of customer 
              satisfaction, has improved from 70.4 points in 2007 to 71.3 points in 
              2010.<br><br>Other indicators of service quality, such as Singapore 
              Tourism Board's (STB) own survey to assess companies for its Singapore 
              Service Star Award, also showed improvements in many areas of customer 
              service.<br><br>However, Singapore is still behind cities such as Tokyo, Hong Kong and Taipei in terms of customer orientation.<br><br>Other
               surveys on productivity also suggest that Singapore's service sector 
              productivity is only about half to two-thirds of some advanced 
              economies.<br><br>Mr Lee said there is still much room for innovation and improvement.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p>TO HELP firms succeed in getting customers to go gaga over their 
              business, like what Lady Gaga has done with her music, the Government is
               spending $84 million over the next five years on more advanced 
              programmes for service staff.</p>
              <p>The investment was announced on Monday by Mr Lim Swee Say, 
              Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, in a speech at a 
              Customer-Centric Initiative (CCI) symposium attended by representatives 
              from about 500 companies.</p>
              <p>'Every sector ought to find a way so that more of you will 
              become like the Lady Gaga of your respective sectors,' he said in 
              encouraging companies to strive to deliver a level of experience that 
              will draw strong support and emotional attachment from customers.</p>
              <p>The $84 million is put up by Spring Singapore and the 
              Workforce Development Agency. Under CCI, firms can tap the fund to send 
              workers for more sophisticated courses, engage a consultancy to assess 
              current work processes and adopt technologies or practices to boost 
              productivity.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim noted that since CCI's launch in 2005, customer service had improved and it is time to go beyond the basics.</p>
              <p>Mr Png Cheong Boon, chief executive of Spring Singapore, 
              said a major share of the $84 million will be used on firms which want 
              to go the extra mile in service. 'Now, we are looking at not just 
              training sales coordinators but fashion coordinators... Training on

              <p>hey, no wonder our ministers feel such a sense of kinship with
              her. they have lots in common. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Lady gaga music is nothing more than 80's backing click tracks, Nile 
              Rodgers could have laughed himself silly if he ever heard of Lady Gaga 
              stuff.</p>
              <p>Western music is generally in decline, there's very little new musical styles coming up nowsdays.</p>
              <p>Sinkapore generally follows as well, it is in decline.</p>
              <p>Frankly speaking, the money could be better spent trying to help locals find and upgrade on proper paying jobs.</p>
              <p>Service industry just like about any other industry in Sinkapore is Floor Trap infested anyway, why bother?</p>
              <p>They can start hiring from places as far flung as Sudan, Chad and Namibia.</p>
              <p>People from places like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan are working in StinkTech as programmers already anway.</p>
              <p>Cheap
               can already, even if they want to raise the standards, they will want 
              to charge a premium on their services on poor consumers like me, sorry, 
              no money. Just give me what I want, I pay and fxxk off, no frills, ok?</p>
              <p>Singapore No money, no talk.</p>
              <p>There's still a lack of general idea on how to advance Sinkapore.</p>
              <p>Anyway, let the clowns try and fail, can just entertain me anyway.</p>
              <p>Stupid idiots.</p>
