              <p><strong>Tighter foreign worker policies will put pressure on companies</strong><br> <span class="update">By Wong Siew Ying | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 01 March 2013 2208 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The 
              government has recently tightened foreign worker policies further with 
              more focus on the construction, marine and services sectors. <br><br>Economists
               warn that the foreign labour curbs could hurt the Singapore economy if 
              these companies cannot raise productivity in the short-term.<br><br>With
               the manufacturing sector weighed down by weaker electronics demandï¼Œ 
              industries such as construction, marine and services have been and will 
              continue to be important growth drivers of Singapore's economy.<br><br>The services sectorï¼Œ for instance, contributes 70 percent of Singapore's GDP.<br><br>Some
               economists are concerned that the tighter foreign labour policies in 
              2014 and 2015 could put a drag on these sectors even as regional growth 
              momentum picks up. <br><br>Irvin Seah, Senior Economist, DBS Bank, says:
               "These sectors should perform better. But that said, growth performance
               would have been even better if there is no such tightening measures in 
              place, unless of course those sectors are able to raise their 
              productivity in the near-term to offset the drag from the tightening 
              measures. For example, Singapore could easily have achieved GDP growth 
              of at least 3 percent and above last year if not for those tightening 
              measures." <br><br>Singapore's GDP grew by 1.3 percent in 2012.<br><br>This year, economists project growth to come in at the higher-end of the government's estimates of between 1 and 3 percent.<br><br>CIMB expects the construction, marine and services sectors to see at least a modest growth this year.<br><br>But as stricter foreign labour curbs kick in, companies will increasingly need to raise productivity to drive their bottomline.<br><br>Song
               Seng Wun, Regional Economist, CIMB, says: "Singapore is looking at 
              restructuring not just domestically. We are also well aware that the 
              push for productivity is strong because regionally wages are going up. 
              If we don't force it upon local businesses first, we might find 
              businesses may struggle as competition for labour intensify in the 
              coming years."<br><br>Some economists say the risk of a global downturn 
              this year is low and this is a good time for businesses to restructure 
              their operations in an environment of growth. <br><br>However, should 
              external demand softens due to any unforeseen event, then companies may 
              face more pressure and business failures could increase.<br><br>Apart 
              from raising productivity, economists say companies can also explore 
              opportunities in regional markets with lower cost structure.<br><br>- CNA/ch</span></span></p>
