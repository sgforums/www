              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Former 
              Member of Parliament Dr Tan Cheng Bock has indicated that he may be a 
              candidate in the coming Presidential Election. <br><br>This comes after the 71-year-old quit the ruling People's Action Party earlier this month. <br><br>Speaking to 938LIVE, Dr Tan explained his decision.<br><br>"Many
               Singaporeans have been urging me to stand for the Presidential 
              Election, and I'm really honored by them urging me to stand. I would say
               it's a recent decision. You know you always think about what you can do
               for the country. What sort of role I can really play with my past 
              experiences as a Member of Parliament, in the corporate world also. So 
              that I probably would have some feel as to how I would like to 
              contribute my role as a President in looking after the reserves and the 
              also in the appointment of all the top people in the government 
              service."<br><br>Dr Tan also said the recent GE results did not affect his decision.<br><br>He said there were no contests in last two presidential elections and he wanted to offer himself as a candidate if he qualifies.<br><br>He
               encouraged more people to come forward to be candidates, saying "only 
              through a contest that you feel you are legitimately there because you 
              have the support of the people".<br><br>The Presidential Election must be held before August 31 this year.<br><br>- 938LIVE/cc</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS -</strong>Debate on the Address (First Allotted Day) 11.04 a.m.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am
               greatly honoured to be given this rare opportunity to move this Motion 
              of Thanks to the President.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,</p>
              <p>That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the President be agreed to:-</p>
              <p>‘We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, 
              express our thanks to the President for the Speech which he delivered on
               behalf of the Government at the Opening of the First Session of this 
              Parliament.".</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in his opening remarks, the President said:</p>
              <p>‘The political leadership of Singapore has passed on to a new team of younger leaders.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our younger leaders are now plotting the new 
              stage of development for Singapore. They have set out certain goals to 
              be achieved within the next five years. However, whatever they plan, 
              whatever they do, they must not forget that it was the common man, the 
              man in the street, who voted the PAP into power.</p>
              <p>Since 1963, the people have given this Government a 
              blank cheque. They went with us all the way, accepting our policies 
              readily because they believed in us. They had faith in us and, above 
              all, they trusted us. Our Prime Minister and his able men led them 
              through the first stage of our development – the construction phase of 
              our development. The changes they produced were remarkable. They were 
              very visible – from squatter huts, zinc and plank shops to tall 
              skyscrapers of Housing and Development Board flats and offices, from 
              stand-pipes to individual taps at home and from mud tracks to metalled 
              roads. These changes were not only visible but impressive and it was 
              dramatic. The people saw this with admiration and placed more faith in 
              our Government.</p>
              <p>But today, after 25 years of nation-building, there 
              is an erosion in this faith and trust in the Government and this was 
              translated into a 12.5% swing in the last general election. The reasons 
              for the erosion have been aired many times after the elections. The most
               frequently whispered comment is that the PAP no longer cares for the 
              common man as many Singaporeans perceived the numerous policies as 
              elitist, in particular, the priority scheme for graduate mothers and the
               streaming of our children in the schools, the emphasis on special and 
              gifted schools, the publicity given to scholars and their achievements 
              and, of course, the unpublicized but much-talked about special social 
              development programmes for unmarried graduates. All these and many more,
               including the controversial CPF issue, made the people suspect the 
              intentions of the Government. While these policies have always been 
              defended as not significantly depriving the majority of their rights, 
              the fact remains that they benefited so few alienates the majority.</p>
              <p>Is this then the ordinary people’s government, or is 
              it a government for a special breed of men? The ordinary men in the 
              street are prepared to let the able ones to lead but in turn they expect
               these able men to have empathy. But, alas, our hard-headed and 
              statistical approach to problems have given the impression that we are 
              beginning to care less for the people and more for those who can 
              achieve. In the eyes of many, we are beginning to shed our image as an 
              ordinary man’s party.</p>
              <p>But have we really stopped caring for the ordinary 
              people? The answer is no. We are still the ordinary man’s party. We 
              still build flats for them, we still build roads, hospitals, improve 
              utilities and we provide social and recreational facilities for all. Why
               are the people then less aware and conscious of these achievements than
               in. the past? Have they forgotten that these achievements are only 
              possible because this Government has remained honest, efficient and 
              non-corrupt?</p>
              <p>One possible reason why people do not appreciate 
              these achievements is that the rapid change of policies within the last 
              two to three years have confused our people so much that they have 
              missed the forest for the trees. The ordinary people were not able to 
              follow the rapid changes in our education policy, the controversial 
              proposals on the CPF, the special tax concessions to highly qualified 
              women, the high increases in cost of houses and car taxes, PUB increases
               and the restructuring of our economy.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the angry mood of the people did not
               go unnoticed. It was picked up by PAP Members of Parliament in this 
              House and they brought up all these issues in this House. The Member for
               Moulmein, for example, has brought up many issues concerning education 
              and streaming. Then we have the Member for Rochore who has also brought 
              up very controversial Issues in this House. And of course our Backbench 
              economist, the Member for Whampoa, has cautioned and advised the 
              Government on economic policies. We also have the Members for Leng Kee, 
              Punggol, Toa Payoh and our newly elected Deputy Speaker who sRoke very 
              strongly in this House on many issues concerning our policies. In spite 
              of what they have said in this House, somehow our Ministers did not pay 
              much attention to these issues. Maybe they did pay much attention but 
              they did not perceive the feedback correctly, or they took for granted 
              that the people will understand and are with them because of the good 
              past track record.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to relate an incident 
              involving my son. I took him to the Botanic Gardens one day, when he was
               very young. I was eager to see the Orchids section, and so I walked 
              very very fast. He shouted to me to wait for him. I turned around, only 
              to urge him on. I had presumed he was able to follow me but suddenly he 
              stopped calling. I turned back and found him seated on a stone at the 
              far end of the road. I walked to him. I saw that he was angry and in 
              tears and, with arms folded, he burst out, "Why didn’t you wait for me?"
               He refused to move in spite of my apologies. He was hurt. He 
              interpreted my fast pace as not caring, and this is how the people view 
              the PAP.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans felt left behind because they could
               not follow the pace of change, and they resented this. We have to be 
              honest with the people that we misread them, but they should not misread
               our intentions which are always in the interests of Singapore.</p>
              <p>At this point, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that
               it is not good enough for the Government to have good intentions when 
              introducing new policies. The Government must also ensure that the 
              people understand these good intentions and thereby enjoy their support.
               A policy supported by the people would be less traumatic when 
              implemented. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no more blank cheque.</p>
              <p>Running a country is not like running a company. We 
              cannot "sack" our people if they are less effective. Our 
              responsibilities go beyond that. We must help them. It is therefore good
               to find that one of the Government’s new goals will be to pay 
              particular attention to the 15-20% lower income group and the aged. This
               works out to approximately half a million Singaporeans. The fact that 
              Government has singled out these two target groups for special mention 
              shows the concern of the new leaders. It is no easy task.</p>
              <p>For a start, we must identify the impediments that 
              have prevented the lower income group from moving up. One of their basic
               needs is better housing, and it is gratifying to note that the Cabinet 
              has plans to help this group achieve home ownership. Another need is 
              better education for their children so that they will be able to get 
              better jobs and break out of this poverty cycle. In this context I hope 
              to see the Ministry of Education draw up positive programmes to help 
              these children overcome the linguistic and learning disadvantages that 
              their home background imposes on them.</p>
              <p>However, we must not give them handouts. Do not 
              entice them with our $10,000 in order to stop them from producing more 
              babies. They have pride. We should not insult them. Educate them.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the new leaders have a very 
              difficult task of improving upon what the old leadership has built. Many
               have commented that it is easier to take off with the infrastructure 
              built for them, but this is not necessarily true. It is easier to please
               the past generation. Their needs are simple. But times have changed and
               problems are different today. Expectations are high. Thus the people 
              may not realize that the new leadership will have to put in a great deal
               more effort to produce very marginal visible change. Let me illustrate.
               Moving from a rental flat to a purchase flat, upgrading from a 3-room 
              flat to a 4-room flat, improving a one-lane traffic to a dual carriage 
              way, do not create such dramatic impact as moving from an attap house 
              with well water facilities to a HDB flat with all its associated 
              amenities.</p>
              <p>It is, therefore, right, Mr Speaker, that we should 
              get the people to be more involved in the important decisions of this 
              country. What then is the type of Singapore they want in the coming 
              years? This was the question put to the audience by our First Deputy 
              Prime Minister in the last Dialogue Session. I am surprised that there 
              has not been much response from the press or from the public. If 
              criticism of the Vision for the 1990s had been forthcoming during the 
              last elections, I am disappointed that nothing has been generated in the
               press to fire the imagination of the Singaporeans on what they want for
               our future country. Perhaps the vision of the new leaders put up by 
              them is what the people really want Singapore to be. And it is not fair 
              to be silent now, and later, with the benefit of hindsight, to criticize
               the vision of our young leaders.</p>
              <p>This involvement of the people in big decision making
               marked a new style of government. The intention to set up a unit in the
               Ministry of Community Development to sample public opinion on new 
              ideas, to accept and consider new ideas from the public, to sample 
              public opinion on policy matters before implementation, to review policy
               particularly where it affects the public, and lastly as a complaints 
              bureau is a big step towards participatory democracy. This unit, 
              however, must not be seen as another arm of the Government to explain or
               to defend the actions of the civil service or the statutory boards. Nor
               should civil servants misunderstand the role of the unit to that of 
              witch-hunting or fault finding.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, behind all these domestic issues, we must not forget that we are living in turbulent times. We are small.</p>
              <p>Singapore watchers saw how our people voted in the 
              last general elections. They have made conclusions. It would be in our 
              national interest to ensure that people elsewhere do not draw the wrong 
              conclusions about our unity and commitment to this country. Singaporeans
               must bear in mind that our actions cannot go unnoticed.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, much has been said of the new 
              leadership and the new Members of Parliament. Most are inducted into 
              politics. Many are labelled as "reluctant politicians" and some 
              Singaporeans are sceptical of their political leadership. I would like 
              to compare ourselves as kidney transplants. Mr Speaker, Sir, in a kidney
               transplant, two things can happen – either the body accepts or the body
               rejects. To prevent rejection, the doctor pumps into the body certain 
              substances called immuno-suppressants. In spite of this, some are still 
              rejected. Like the transplanted kidneys, the new MPs must have these 
              immuno-suppressants in the form of faith and support from the people. 
              And, like the transplanted – kidneys, those that are accepted will no 
              doubt be able to perform as effectively as the older leaders. 
              Singaporeans must give our new leadership a fair chance to prove 
              themselves. Our new enthusiastic Cabinet leaders have set admirable 
              goals for themselves and for the people. If they are able to win the 
              hearts and minds of our disciplined people, these goals will no doubt be
               achievable and our country will prosper and progress.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the House has asked 
              the new MPs "to speak their minds and let conscience be their guide." We
               should take his advice. Although we will get walloped by the Ministers 
              for some of our remarks, we should not let these parliamentary wounds 
              deter us from speaking. We must develop what people call"thick-skin"and,
               like a rubber ball, you must be prepared to bounce back.</p>
              <p>Finally, I am not sure whether the new MPs are lucky,
               or unlucky, not to have amongst us the former First Deputy Prime 
              Minister and the former Minister of Education with us. I remember he 
              delivered my first parliamentary wound when I accused his education 
              system of creating class divisions. And I can assure new Members of this
               House that it was not a pleasant experience. It was ulcer-producing 
              but, at the end of it all, it was worth it because I registered my 
              reservations and my belief and I also reflected the views of many people
               who strongly believe that there is this weakness in our education 
              policy.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause]</p>

              <p><strong>PRESIDENT’S ADDRESS -</strong>Debate on the Address
              (First Allotted Day) 11.04 a.m.</p>
              <p>Dr Tan Cheng Bock (Ayer Rajah): Mr Speaker, Sir, I am greatly
              honoured to be given this rare opportunity to move this Motion of
              Thanks to the President.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move,</p>
              <p>That the following Address in reply to the Speech of the
              President be agreed to:-</p>
              <p>‘We, the Parliament of the Republic of Singapore, express our
              thanks to the President for the Speech which he delivered on behalf
              of the Government at the Opening of the First Session of this
              Parliament.".</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, in his opening remarks, the President said:</p>
              <p>‘The political leadership of Singapore has passed on to a new
              team of younger leaders.’</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our younger leaders are now plotting the new stage of
              development for Singapore. They have set out certain goals to be
              achieved within the next five years. However, whatever they plan,
              whatever they do, they must not forget that it was the common man,
              the man in the street, who voted the PAP into power.</p>
              <p>Since 1963, the people have given this Government a blank
              cheque. They went with us all the way, accepting our policies
              readily because they believed in us. They had faith in us and,
              above all, they trusted us. Our Prime Minister and his able men led
              them through the first stage of our development – the construction
              phase of our development. The changes they produced were
              remarkable. They were very visible – from squatter huts, zinc and
              plank shops to tall skyscrapers of Housing and Development Board
              flats and offices, from stand-pipes to individual taps at home and
              from mud tracks to metalled roads. These changes were not only
              visible but impressive and it was dramatic. The people saw this
              with admiration and placed more faith in our Government.</p>
              <p>But today, after 25 years of nation-building, there is an
              erosion in this faith and trust in the Government and this was
              translated into a 12.5% swing in the last general election. The
              reasons for the erosion have been aired many times after the
              elections. The most frequently whispered comment is that the PAP no
              longer cares for the common man as many Singaporeans perceived the
              numerous policies as elitist, in particular, the priority scheme
              for graduate mothers and the streaming of our children in the
              schools, the emphasis on special and gifted schools, the publicity
              given to scholars and their achievements and, of course, the
              unpublicized but much-talked about special social development
              programmes for unmarried graduates. All these and many more,
              including the controversial CPF issue, made the people suspect the
              intentions of the Government. While these policies have always been
              defended as not significantly depriving the majority of their
              rights, the fact remains that they benefited so few alienates the
              majority.</p>
              <p>Is this then the ordinary people’s government, or is it a
              government for a special breed of men? The ordinary men in the
              street are prepared to let the able ones to lead but in turn they
              expect these able men to have empathy. But, alas, our hard-headed
              and statistical approach to problems have given the impression that
              we are beginning to care less for the people and more for those who
              can achieve. In the eyes of many, we are beginning to shed our
              image as an ordinary man’s party.</p>
              <p>But have we really stopped caring for the ordinary people? The
              answer is no. We are still the ordinary man’s party. We still build
              flats for them, we still build roads, hospitals, improve utilities
              and we provide social and recreational facilities for all. Why are
              the people then less aware and conscious of these achievements than
              in. the past? Have they forgotten that these achievements are only
              possible because this Government has remained honest, efficient and
              non-corrupt?</p>
              <p>One possible reason why people do not appreciate these
              achievements is that the rapid change of policies within the last
              two to three years have confused our people so much that they have
              missed the forest for the trees. The ordinary people were not able
              to follow the rapid changes in our education policy, the
              controversial proposals on the CPF, the special tax concessions to
              highly qualified women, the high increases in cost of houses and
              car taxes, PUB increases and the restructuring of our economy.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the angry mood of the people did not go
              unnoticed. It was picked up by PAP Members of Parliament in this
              House and they brought up all these issues in this House. The
              Member for Moulmein, for example, has brought up many issues
              concerning education and streaming. Then we have the Member for
              Rochore who has also brought up very controversial Issues in this
              House. And of course our Backbench economist, the Member for
              Whampoa, has cautioned and advised the Government on economic
              policies. We also have the Members for Leng Kee, Punggol, Toa Payoh
              and our newly elected Deputy Speaker who sRoke very strongly in
              this House on many issues concerning our policies. In spite of what
              they have said in this House, somehow our Ministers did not pay
              much attention to these issues. Maybe they did pay much attention
              but they did not perceive the feedback correctly, or they took for
              granted that the people will understand and are with them because
              of the good past track record.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I would like to relate an incident involving my
              son. I took him to the Botanic Gardens one day, when he was very
              young. I was eager to see the Orchids section, and so I walked very
              very fast. He shouted to me to wait for him. I turned around, only
              to urge him on. I had presumed he was able to follow me but
              suddenly he stopped calling. I turned back and found him seated on
              a stone at the far end of the road. I walked to him. I saw that he
              was angry and in tears and, with arms folded, he burst out, "Why
              didn’t you wait for me?" He refused to move in spite of my
              apologies. He was hurt. He interpreted my fast pace as not caring,
              and this is how the people view the PAP.</p>
              <p>Many Singaporeans felt left behind because they could not follow
              the pace of change, and they resented this. We have to be honest
              with the people that we misread them, but they should not misread
              our intentions which are always in the interests of Singapore.</p>
              <p>At this point, Mr Speaker, Sir, let me reiterate that it is not
              good enough for the Government to have good intentions when
              introducing new policies. The Government must also ensure that the
              people understand these good intentions and thereby enjoy their
              support. A policy supported by the people would be less traumatic
              when implemented. Mr Speaker, Sir, there is no more blank
              cheque.</p>
              <p>Running a country is not like running a company. We cannot
              "sack" our people if they are less effective. Our responsibilities
              go beyond that. We must help them. It is therefore good to find
              that one of the Government’s new goals will be to pay particular
              attention to the 15-20% lower income group and the aged. This works
              out to approximately half a million Singaporeans. The fact that
              Government has singled out these two target groups for special
              mention shows the concern of the new leaders. It is no easy
              task.</p>
              <p>For a start, we must identify the impediments that have
              prevented the lower income group from moving up. One of their basic
              needs is better housing, and it is gratifying to note that the
              Cabinet has plans to help this group achieve home ownership.
              Another need is better education for their children so that they
              will be able to get better jobs and break out of this poverty
              cycle. In this context I hope to see the Ministry of Education draw
              up positive programmes to help these children overcome the
              linguistic and learning disadvantages that their home background
              imposes on them.</p>
              <p>However, we must not give them handouts. Do not entice them with
              our $10,000 in order to stop them from producing more babies. They
              have pride. We should not insult them. Educate them.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the new leaders have a very difficult task of
              improving upon what the old leadership has built. Many have
              commented that it is easier to take off with the infrastructure
              built for them, but this is not necessarily true. It is easier to
              please the past generation. Their needs are simple. But times have
              changed and problems are different today. Expectations are high.
              Thus the people may not realize that the new leadership will have
              to put in a great deal more effort to produce very marginal visible
              change. Let me illustrate. Moving from a rental flat to a purchase
              flat, upgrading from a 3-room flat to a 4-room flat, improving a
              one-lane traffic to a dual carriage way, do not create such
              dramatic impact as moving from an attap house with well water
              facilities to a HDB flat with all its associated amenities.</p>
              <p>It is, therefore, right, Mr Speaker, that we should get the
              people to be more involved in the important decisions of this
              country. What then is the type of Singapore they want in the coming
              years? This was the question put to the audience by our First
              Deputy Prime Minister in the last Dialogue Session. I am surprised
              that there has not been much response from the press or from the
              public. If criticism of the Vision for the 1990s had been
              forthcoming during the last elections, I am disappointed that
              nothing has been generated in the press to fire the imagination of
              the Singaporeans on what they want for our future country. Perhaps
              the vision of the new leaders put up by them is what the people
              really want Singapore to be. And it is not fair to be silent now,
              and later, with the benefit of hindsight, to criticize the vision
              of our young leaders.</p>
              <p>This involvement of the people in big decision making marked a
              new style of government. The intention to set up a unit in the
              Ministry of Community Development to sample public opinion on new
              ideas, to accept and consider new ideas from the public, to sample
              public opinion on policy matters before implementation, to review
              policy particularly where it affects the public, and lastly as a
              complaints bureau is a big step towards participatory democracy.
              This unit, however, must not be seen as another arm of the
              Government to explain or to defend the actions of the civil service
              or the statutory boards. Nor should civil servants misunderstand
              the role of the unit to that of witch-hunting or fault finding.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, behind all these domestic issues, we must not
              forget that we are living in turbulent times. We are small.</p>
              <p>Singapore watchers saw how our people voted in the last general
              elections. They have made conclusions. It would be in our national
              interest to ensure that people elsewhere do not draw the wrong
              conclusions about our unity and commitment to this country.
              Singaporeans must bear in mind that our actions cannot go
              unnoticed.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, much has been said of the new leadership and
              the new Members of Parliament. Most are inducted into politics.
              Many are labelled as "reluctant politicians" and some Singaporeans
              are sceptical of their political leadership. I would like to
              compare ourselves as kidney transplants. Mr Speaker, Sir, in a
              kidney transplant, two things can happen – either the body accepts
              or the body rejects. To prevent rejection, the doctor pumps into
              the body certain substances called immuno-suppressants. In spite of
              this, some are still rejected. Like the transplanted kidneys, the
              new MPs must have these immuno-suppressants in the form of faith
              and support from the people. And, like the transplanted – kidneys,
              those that are accepted will no doubt be able to perform as
              effectively as the older leaders. Singaporeans must give our new
              leadership a fair chance to prove themselves. Our new enthusiastic
              Cabinet leaders have set admirable goals for themselves and for the
              people. If they are able to win the hearts and minds of our
              disciplined people, these goals will no doubt be achievable and our
              country will prosper and progress.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, the Leader of the House has asked the new MPs
              "to speak their minds and let conscience be their guide." We should
              take his advice. Although we will get walloped by the Ministers for
              some of our remarks, we should not let these parliamentary wounds
              deter us from speaking. We must develop what people
              call"thick-skin"and, like a rubber ball, you must be prepared to
              bounce back.</p>
              <p>Finally, I am not sure whether the new MPs are lucky, or
              unlucky, not to have amongst us the former First Deputy Prime
              Minister and the former Minister of Education with us. I remember
              he delivered my first parliamentary wound when I accused his
              education system of creating class divisions. And I can assure new
              Members of this House that it was not a pleasant experience. It was
              ulcer-producing but, at the end of it all, it was worth it because
              I registered my reservations and my belief and I also reflected the
              views of many people who strongly believe that there is this
              weakness in our education policy.</p>
              <p>Mr Speaker, Sir, I beg to move. [Applause]</p>
