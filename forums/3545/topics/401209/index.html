              <p>SINGAPORE Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers are giving themselves a bad name, with a recent spate of misdemeanours.</p>
              <p>One posted a photograph of himself in full army attire, holding a cigarette and leaving his SAR21 rifle unattended.</p>
              <p>In another incident, a group of soldiers was caught visiting a brothel during a military exercise in Taiwan.</p>
              <p>According to a May 22 report by The Liberty Times, a Taiwanese newspaper, a certain Sergeant Wang and three other SAF soldiers were caught visiting a massage parlour that also operated as a brothel in the southern city of Pintung.</p>
              <p>It was reported that Sgt Wang broke away from the trio of Singaporean soldiers, as well as four accompanying Taiwanese soldiers, to visit the parlour.</p>
              <p>After getting their dinner, the rest went to the parlour to wait for him and were ambushed by Taiwanese police, who were raiding the brothel that evening.</p>
              <p>The news article was published on citizen-journalism website Stomp yesterday.</p>
              <p>Also fresh on Stomp were an article and photograph of a full-time national serviceman squatting and posing with a cigarette, a "rocker" hand gesture and an unattended SAR21 rifle.</p>
              <p>The soldier, who is believed to be on duty at a sentry post, uploaded the photograph onto a social- networking site.</p>
              <p>The post drew a slew of reactions from Stomp users.</p>
              <p>One user named Decadent wrote that the soldier was going to get into huge trouble, but that he deserved it because uploading the photos was stupid.</p>
              <p>On the contrary, ToShac68 was unfazed, and said that duties in the army were only a simulation, and that the man simply wanted to "pose like American or British soldiers, holding guns and smoking in uniform".</p>
              <p>Full-time national servicemen, however, took the postings in a more serious light. One of them, Private Timothy Tan, said: "It tarnishes the image of the SAF as most soldiers are usually very disciplined.</p>
              <p>"They are poor representatives of the current soldiers and poor examples to future generations of soldiers."</p>
              <p>Another NSF, Lance-Corporal Li Wen Hao, said: "It is irresponsible of them, as they represent our country. Now that it has gone public, it will affect the good reputation of other NSFs."</p>
              <p>When NSFs were found to be forming groups on social-networking website Facebook last year, the Ministry of Defence said that all SAF personnel are not to disclose or post classified or sensitive information and photos online.</p>
