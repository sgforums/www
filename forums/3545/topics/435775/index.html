              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore
               has revised down its full-year economic growth forecast for this year 
              amid renewed turbulence in the global financial markets.<br><br>It is 
              now expecting growth to come in at between 5 and 6 percent instead of 
              the original projection of 5-7 percent. This was revealed by Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his National Day message on Monday.<br><br>And
               with the economic outlook looking more uncertain going forward, 
              economists are not ruling out a technical recession for Singapore.<br><br>Asia, led by China and India, is expected to continue growing. But the global outlook remains uncertain.<br><br>"Europe's
               debt problems are far from solved, despite the recent bailout of Greece
               by the EU. The US economy remains sluggish. The US President and 
              Congress have agreed to raise the debt ceiling, but have put off 
              difficult decisions to raise taxes and cut spending. Japan has the added
               burden of earthquake and tsunami recovery," said Mr Lee.<br><br>"These 
              three key economies are struggling to find the decisive leadership 
              required to resolve their domestic challenges. This will weigh them down
               and dampen global prospects," he said.<br><br>That's one main reason the official forecast for Singapore's gross domestic product growth this year has been trimmed.<br><br>The
               revision was not a surprise, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore 
              (MAS) alluding to it in its annual report released last month.<br><br>In fact, some private sector economists have already cut their own forecasts or are currently planning to revise their numbers. <br><br>CIMB
               were among the latest to downgrade its full-year forecast for Singapore
               economy to 4.7 percent, from its earlier projection of 6 percent. <br><br>DBS and UOB said they are currently revising their numbers downwards.<br><br>Weaker business sentiment is expected to be a drag on manufacturing activity, especially in electronics.<br><br>Mr
               Song Seng Wun, CIMB Research's regional economist, said: "For the 
              full-year GDP, the slower production, the slower exports may translate 
              to the headline GDP being bumped down slightly.....Another source of 
              lower growth is obviously high inflation. We've got slower growth but 
              inflation has been higher this year."<br><br>Mr Wu Kun Lung, Credit 
              Suisse's economist, said: "We cut our 2011 and 2012 real GDP growth 
              forecast for Singapore to 5.5% (from 6.5%) and 4.8% (from 5%), 
              respectively, with downside risks if the European debt situation 
              deteriorates further. We expect the 3-month Singapore SIBOR to stay 
              unchanged at 0.44% till end-2012 (from 1% previously)."<br><br>Prime 
              Minister Lee said the Singapore economy grew 4.9 percent in the first 
              half. This suggests that the second-quarter GDP grew 0.5 percent 
              year-on-year, in line with flash estimates. <br><br>Advance estimates released last month also showed the second-quarter GDP contracted 7.8 percent from the previous three months.<br><br>With
               growth expected to slow for the rest of the year there are now higher 
              expectations of a technical recession, which is defined as two 
              consecutive periods of quarter-on-quarter contraction.<br><br>But some said this could be good for Singapore. <br><br>UBS'
               chief investment strategist (Singapore) Kelvin Tay said: "We don't see a
               prolonged period of stagnant growth. In fact I think a slowdown in the 
              third quarter might actually do the economy some good in the sense that 
              we're a little bit too strong....in the first quarter of this year. <br><br>"If
               the economy slows down a little bit....it could be positive, because, 
              don't forget, we are actually at full employment, with unemployment at 
              an all-time low right now. So that will take some heat off the economy."<br><br>Singapore's unemployment rate in the first half remained at 2.1 percent. <br><br>Going
               forward, there are some bright spots for the Singapore economy. 
              Commodity prices have been dropping recently and this could help 
              exporters as well as rein in inflationary pressures. <br><br>Detailed second-quarter GDP data will be released on Wednesday.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              Maybe is not 100 percent. Like lao lee wrote in his book PAP will lose power one day does not mean it will happen.

              <p>Negative growth in an economy means recession.  Economic growth is measured periodically and compared with the preceding period. Technical recession is when growth is negative for 2 consecutive periods.  Recession is part of economic cycle of positive growth, no growth and negative 'growth'.  That's reality!  This is Economics 101.</p>
              <p>The question is how long will recession last?  If it continues for several years, that is Depression.  Next question is what is the government doing to get the economy out of recession?</p>
              <p>And the most important question is: since recession WILL occur, what must we as individual and the government do to prepare and ride a recession when it occurs?</p>
