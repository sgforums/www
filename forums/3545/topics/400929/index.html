              <p><span>SINGAPORE : A man was found dead in an open field along Kallang 
              Road.
              <br> <br> A passer-by spotted the body and alerted a security guard at condominium
               Riverine by the Park next to the field.
              <br> <br> And it was the guard who called the police at around 7.30am.
              <br> <br> According to the guard, the dead man's head was covered in blood.
              <br> <br> He was dressed in a brown T-shirt and black pants.
              <br> <br> More than 10 officers were deployed to the scene where a forensic team 
              spent the whole morning conducting investigations.
              <br> <br> Police spokesperson Yvonne Edwin said: "The body of a man, believed to 
              be Indian, was found at the said location. He was pronounced dead by the
               paramedics at about 8am. Police have classified the case as murder and 
              investigations are currently ongoing. Anybody with information should 
              call the police hotline at 1800-255-0000." - CNA /ls</span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">1 dead, 3 seriously hurt</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Mavis Goh
              						
              																														 and 
              																						Mavis Toh</p>
              <p>A FULL-time national serviceman, one of four victims of a series of 
              knife attacks in Kallang on Sunday, lay bleeding by the Pan-Island 
              Expressway for seven hours before he was spotted.</p>
              <p>Half his left hand, along with four fingers had been hacked 
              off, and he had deep cuts to his neck, face and abdomen; a part of his 
              scalp had been sliced open.</p>
              <p>But at least Ang Jun Heng, 19, was alive. Of the remaining 
              three victims of the still-unknown slasher or slashers, one is dead, and
               the other two, like Mr Ang, are in intensive care in Tan Tock Seng 
              Hospital.</p>
              <p>The police said on Monday that they were yet to make an 
              arrest. They declined comment when asked whether the attacks were the 
              work of one person or several, nor would they confirm that the attacks 
              were related. All the police spokesman would say was that investigations
               were on and no possibilities have been ruled out.</p>
              <p>The four victims appear not to know each other. Aside from 
              Mr Ang, the other three, including the dead man, are Indian nationals 
              aged between 24 and 44. Here on work permits, they live and work in 
              different places.</p>
              <p>The common thread: They were all believed to have been 
              knifed from behind in the Kallang area. No weapons have been recovered.</p>

              <p><strong>Gang of 7 believed to be behind spate of attacks in Kallang; 3 arrested</strong><br> <span class="update">By Leong Wee Keat | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 01 June 2010 1151 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A gang of seven was believed to have been responsible 
              for the recent spate of attacks in the Kallang area on Sunday, which 
              left one man dead and three others seriously injured.
              <br> <br> The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) said on Tuesday that three 
              Malaysians have been arrested in connection with the attacks.
              <br> <br> They are aged between 21 and 26 years old and were nabbed near Syed Alwi
               Road between 6pm and 10pm on Monday evening.
              <br> <br> All three came from Sarawak and were general workers living in a 
              dormitory in the area.
              <br> <br> Four other suspects are still at large but CID has vowed to "go all out"
               to hunt them down.
              <br> <br> Investigations are still ongoing to establish the identities of the 
              remaining four suspects and also to determine if the suspects were 
              involved in any previous cases of robbery.
              <br> <br> Calling the crimes "vicious and violent", the CID said the men were 
              caught after a 24-hour large scale island-wide operation that saw 100 
              police officers deployed to crack the crimes.
              <br> <br> The three arrested will be charged in court tomorrow with murder and 
              armed robbery with hurt.
              <br> <br> An Indian construction worker was slashed to death and his body was 
              found in an open field near the Kallang MRT station.
              <br> <br> Three others were also viciously slashed and are now in the intensive 
              care unit at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. 
              <br> <br> They were robbed a total of S$400 and three handphones.  - CNA/vm </span></p>
