              <h1 class="storyheadline2">Slash-and-rob gang behind 
              attacks</h1>
              <h4 class="piccaption">The gang selected its quarry at random, stalking 
              each one before pouncing on them with knives. All four were slashed and 
              hacked before the gang made off with their belongings.</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FIVE men who carried out what police described as a 'cruel' and 
              'inhumane' spate of attacks in the Kallang area on Sunday have been 
              arrested after an operation involving more than 100 policemen.</p>
              <p>The five, all Sarawakians who worked here as cleaners and 
              odd-job labourers, went on a planned orgy of violent theft which has 
              rarely been seen here.</p>
              <p>The men, some of whom stayed at a Syed Alwi Road lodging 
              house, are believed to have hatched their crimes with two others. The 
              gang went on a knife-wielding rampage that left one person dead, two 
              others in intensive care and another with half his palm hacked off - all
               for $400 cash and three cellphones.</p>
              <p>Police have mounted a huge manhunt in several areas for the 
              remaining two suspects who are believed to be part of the same gang.</p>
              <p>The gang may also be responsible for one or two other 
              similar slash-and-rob incidents in the area recently.</p>
              <p>Said Criminal Investigation Department (CID) chief Ng Boon 
              Gay: 'What the group had done was very violent. They not only robbed 
              people of some small items... some mobile phones and cash... they caused
               harm and killed one of them. These are all innocent victims. They had 
              nothing to do with the culprits.'</p>

              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A MAN from Sarawak was charged with the murder of a construction worker
               while two others were accused of gang robbery.</p>
              <p>No plea was taken from general worker Micheal Garing, 22, 
              who allegedly committed murder by causing the death of Indian national 
              Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, 41, with three others at an open field along 
              Kallang Road on Sunday.</p>
              <p>In the same court, Sylvester Barogok, 26, and Shahman Milak,
               21, both also from Sarawak, were charged with committing gang robbery 
              of a mobile phone, cash of $32, a work permit card and an ez-link card 
              from Mr Raja Kana Kazi under an overhead bridge at Sims Drive last 
              Friday evening.</p>
              <p>The duo were allegedly with Micheal, Hairee Landak, 19, Tony
               Imba, 31, and Donny Meluda, 19, one or more of whom were armed with a 
              parang.</p>
              <p>All three were remanded at Central police division lock-up 
              for further investigation. They will appear in court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>If convicted of murder, Micheal faces the death penalty. The
               maximum punishment for gang robbery is a jail term of five to 20 years 
              and not less than 12 strokes of the cane</p>

              <p>The duo were allegedly with Micheal, Hairee Landak, 19, Tony Imba, 31, and Donny Meluda, 19, one or more of whom were armed with a parang.</p>
              <p>All three were remanded at Central police division lock-up for further investigation. They will appear in court on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>If convicted of murder, Micheal faces the death penalty. The maximum punishment for gang robbery is a jail term of five to 20 years and not less than 12 strokes of the cane</p>

              <p><strong>One more suspect linked to Kallang violence arrested</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 02 June 2010 2320 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Police have arrested one more suspect linked to a 
              spate of violence in Kallang, which left one dead and three seriously 
              injured in the early hours of Sunday.
              <br> <br> The 31-year-old suspect was arrested at about 8.15pm on Wednesday at the
               Golden Mile Food Court in Beach Road, following extensive follow-up 
              investigations by the police.
              <br> <br> He will be charged in court with murder on Friday.
              <br> <br> Police investigations are still on-going to trace the last suspect in 
              the case. So far, six out of the seven suspects have been arrested.
              <br> <br> Three of them were charged in court on Wednesday. 
              <br> <br> One of them, 22-year-old Micheal Anak Garing was charged with the murder
               of an Indian construction worker at an open field near Riverine by The 
              Park condominium.
              <br> <br> The Malaysian is alleged to have committed the crime with three other 
              men.
              <br> <br> Two of the alleged members of the group were charged with armed robbery.
              <br> <br> They were accused of committing the robbery with five others under an 
              overhead bridge in Sims Drive on May 28.
              <br> <br> One or more of the accused were allegedly armed with a parang.
              <br> <br> The court has allowed detectives to take the trio out of remand to the 
              crime scene for investigations.
