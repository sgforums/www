              <p><br>those white people usually are hated most by our higher class. people who draw higher income. the white or masalehs are more skilled and usually challenge our manegerial and directing position. since its the rich against rich i don;t care anyway.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>histories aside living in the now our middle and lower income groups are threaten on livilihood by the categories of 'foreign talents' taht are real cheap. sadly the criminals who did the slashing falls into this category.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have no regret for the remarks i wrote. they caome here challenge our workers to marking pay real low and down, and now they kill people and create trouble for singapore, big or small scale and expect us to fed them in prison with our taxpayer's money, on no guarantee that they will reform, for our coountry?</p>
              <p>hanging is far less painless and less brutal than the firring squd i tell you, if if the prison division should decide to outsource they execution people and hire me to do the job it will be even worse a dying experience for teh savages i tell you.</p>

              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Another member of the gang who went on a crime rampage
               last Sunday has been charged Thursday morning in connection with the 
              murder of an Indian construction worker. 
              <br> <br> Hairee Anak Landak, 20, was said to have committed the act with three 
              others for the death of Mr Shanmuganathan Dillidurai, whose body was 
              found in an open field in Kallang Road. 
              <br> <br> No plea was taken from the Sarawakian and he would be detained for 
              further investigations. 
              <br> <br> Hairee was detained as he entered Singapore via the Woodlands Checkpoint
               on Tuesday.
              <br> <br> Another suspect, Peter Usit Anak Musa, was charged Thursday morning with
               gang robbery.
              <br> <br> Peter, 22, was said to have rob Mr Raja Kana Kazi last Friday with six 
              others under an overhead bridge of Block 41 Sims Drive. 
              <br> <br> Six of the seven members have been arrested since Sunday's rampage which
               left one dead and three others seriously injured. 
              <br> <br> One other member, Donny Anak Meluda, is still at large. - CNA/jy</span></p>

              <p><strong>Singaporeans donate to help foreign workers attacked in Kallang</strong><br> <span class="update">By Evelyn Choo and Leong Wee Keat | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 08 June 2010 2053 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Singaporeans have again shown a readiness to help 
              strangers in need.
              <br> <br> This time, they opened their hearts - and wallets - to three foreign 
              workers who were attacked in Kallang about two weeks ago.
              <br> <br> One of them died from his injuries. 
              <br> <br> Two of the victims - Egar Karuppaiah and Sandeep Singh - are recovering 
              in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. They will be discharged in a few days but 
              have nowhere to go.
              <br> <br> "I'm just a construction worker. I'm not rich. I have no money. My life 
              is simple," said Sandeep, victim of the Kallang attack. 
              <br> <br> One donor donated $500 to each of them and wants to send money to the 
              family of the worker who was killed.
              <br> <br> Members of two voluntary welfare organisations - the Humanitarian 
              Organisation for Migration Economics and Transient Workers Count Too - 
              have the workers' contact details in India to remit all donations to 
              them.
              <br> <br> "These workers will have problems with their livelihood in the future. 
              They have families to support. That's why we feel it's important for us 
              to assist them financially," said Jolovan Wham, a social working from 
              Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics. 
              <br> <br> The VWOs have been approached by about 10 people, asking how they can 
              contribute and how the funds will be used.
              <br> <br> "Interested members of the public can donate to us directly, and we will
               disburse the funds to the workers or their families. Moving forward, 
              there is a possibility for us on wanting to set up a fund for workers 
              like these who fall through the cracks of the system," said Wham. 
              <br> <br> So far, more than $5,000 has been donated. 
              <br> <br> Those who want to know more can send an email to 
              migrants.home@gmail.com.
