              <h1 class="storyheadline">Stringent rules in place to ensure animal welfare</h1>
              <p>I THANK Ms Deirdre Moss of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
               Animals ('Impose stricter measures to protect dogs at farms'; April 29)
               and Ms Tabatha Randall ('If the Government can curb the number of cars 
              on the road, it can restrict the number of dogs imported and monitor 
              farms'; April 29) for their feedback.</p>
              <p>The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority (AVA) does not 
              restrict the number of pets imported, bred and sold commercially as long
               as the businesses are legal and comply with our regulations. The AVA 
              has put in place stringent regulations for the pet industry to ensure 
              that animal welfare is not compromised.</p>
              <p>Pet shop operators are assessed by AVA on their knowledge 
              and experience with animals before the approval of their licence 
              application. These licensed operators are subsequently required to 
              comply with housing and management conditions that safeguard the welfare
               of the animals. Dog farms are also licensed by AVA, and required to 
              comply with licensing conditions, one of which is that they must have an
               adequate health-care and disease prevention programme approved by AVA.</p>
              <p>AVA conducts regular as well as surprise inspection visits 
              to dog farms and pet shops to ensure that animal welfare standards are 
              adhered to. Enforcement action is taken where there is evidence of 
              breach of conditions.</p>
              <p>We are also continuously reviewing and improving our 
              regulations. For example, AVA has worked with the industry to implement 
              compulsory structured formal training for dog farms and pet shops from 
              Jan 1 this year to further enhance their standards and competencies.</p>
              <p>As for the farm mentioned by Ms Moss, AVA is currently 
              investigating allegations of animal cruelty against the previous owners.
               Errant operators can be fined $10,000 or jailed up to 12 months, or 
              both.</p>
              <p>The public can help raise the standards by patronising only 
              responsible dog farms and pet shops, and reporting to AVA if they come 
              across any errant pet shop or dog farm.</p>

               Chief Executive Officer <br>Agri-Food &amp; Veterinary Authority</strong></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Profit is bottom line for animal farms</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the report, '5-digit sum spent to save 80 dogs' (April 21), 
              and the letter by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, 
              'Impose stricter measures to protect dogs at farms' (April 29). I urge 
              the authorities to take a closer look at these puppy mills, many of 
              which are run in an inhumane manner.</p>
              <p>My conversations with animal welfare volunteers and people 
              who have visited these farms revealed that most animals are kept in 
              appalling and unhygienic conditions. This is because the owners care 
              little about the animals in their quest to make a profit.</p>
              <p>These volunteers have rescued many 'slave' animals (since 
              they are kept in cages all the time and fed the minimum to keep them 
              alive, the sole reason for their existence to be mated to produce 
              puppies for sale).</p>
              <p>Singapore has reached a high level of sophistication in its 
              'hardware' and we should aim for a similar level in our 'software' which
               involves being gracious not only to one another but also to animals. We
               are First World in economic terms but unfortunately, when it comes to 
              our attitude towards animals, we are far from First World.</p>
              <p>I urge the authorities to give serious and urgent attention 
              to this puppy-mill issue. These farms should be strictly regulated and 
              be made to pass stringent tests on hygiene, living conditions, animal 
              welfare, vet care and so on before they are granted a licence.</p>
              <p>At the same time, I urge members of the public to refrain 
              from buying from these unethical farms. Better still, instead of buying,
               adopt and give a second chance to the thousands of homeless animals 
              around us. Your kindness will be returned many times by the love and 
              loyalty of the grateful animals.</p>
