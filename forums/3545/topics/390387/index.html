              <p><strong>Singapore Zoo lets visitors get closer to white tigers</strong><br> <span class="update">By Evelyn Choo, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 09 February 2010 0023 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Remember the white tigers that made the headlines when
              a man went into their enclosure and got mauled to death at the zoo?
              <br> <br> One year on, the Singapore Zoo is asking visitors to get to know these very same tigers and how they are trained.
              <br> <br> Meet Omar - a 10-year-old Bengal tiger who resides at the Singapore Zoo. 
              <br> <br>And today is that time of the week when Omar goes for his
              conditioning session with his keeper. He is taught to respond correctly
              to stimulants and gets rewarded with a meaty treat.
              <br> <br>Francis Lim, Curator at Singapore Zoo, said: "In the past, we had
              to sedate the animal. That means we have to knock the animal down, let
              them sleep so we can do a close examination. But with this operant
              conditioning, we don't have to do that. It's safe for the animal, it
              doesn't compromise the animal's health."
              <br> <br> For the zookeepers, it is part of a bond that has been built over seven years.
              <br> <br>Mohamed Nasir, Zookeeper at Singapore Zoo, said: "There was one
              time when Omar was really ill. He was really, really down because of
              his kidney. He was really sick, and you can really feel the pain. He is
              like our family member. Omar is a bit bossy since he is the only male
              here. And like a typical male he has this ego in him. And he always has
              to be the first one."
              <br> <br> For $28, visitors can witness this intimate session, but they have to stay behind the line and keep their voices down.
              <br> <br>For the less adventurous, visitors can take a peek at what the rest
              of the animal kingdom are up to this Lunar New Year season. - CNA/de</span></p>

              <p><br>Oh is it. Maybe they taling precautions to prevent another mauding?</p>
              <p>Anyway the zoo keepr killed by white tigers also not the tigers' problem. he had suicideal thought already. secondly tigers are territorial. they don't usually kill once they are full but a sign of aggression by crossing in to their territory sure gaurantees some paw and claw actions from them.</p>

              <p>You are right Kco.</p>
              <p>Those are big giant cats. No matter how zoo keepers tame the big cats, once feel threaten or cross over their line, they will attack you. They dont care whether you feed him everyday. Their instinct is to kill if threaten.</p>
