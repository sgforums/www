              <h1 class="storyheadline">Singapore still far behind in true gender equality: Aware</h1>
              <p>WE WHOLEHEARTEDLY agree with Professor Hans Rosling's view last 
              Wednesday ('Want more babies? Fathers, please step up') that Singapore 
              has not seen a reversal in the decline of fertility rates because 
              Singaporean fathers are not rising to the task of child rearing, and 
              state support for equal parenting roles is not adequate.</p>
              <p>In our 2004 report (Beyond Babies: National Duty Or Personal
               Choice), we stated that there is a direct correlation between total 
              fertility rates and gender equity.</p>
              <p>Many people think that Singaporean women have achieved 
              gender equality. However, compared with countries such as Australia, 
              Sweden, Britain and the United States where the total fertility rate is 
              now increasing, we have a long way to go.</p>
              <p>In the last 30 years, women have entered the workplace in 
              droves. More girls graduate from our universities than boys. However, 
              these changes are asymmetrical. Men have not moved into the domestic 
              sphere at the same rate.</p>
              <p>This asymmetry makes child rearing much less attractive for 
              women. The woman who derives satisfaction from her work will not be keen
               to have any, or many, children if she has to bear the bulk of the 
              childcare burden. In the meantime, her husband does not lose sleep about
               balancing work and family life.</p>
              <p>Whose problem is this and what can be done? The State, the 
              market and the individual all play important roles in the determination 
              of fertility decisions.</p>
              <p>Here are some considerations:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li> What is the message and effect when the State 
              mandates four months' paid maternity leave, but not a day of paternity 
              leave? Are we sending the message that fertility is solely a woman's 
              responsibility? </li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> Adequate support structures for families and 
              availability of flexiwork arrangements are key factors in countries 
              which have seen positive fertility trends. In Singapore, however, part- 
              time work amounts to a minuscule 10 per cent of employment. Why is this? </li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> Are family-friendly arrangements in workplaces
               equally available to male employees, or do employers treat a male 
              employee's request to take time off to care for his sick child less 
              favourably? </li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> How can we support more active fathering? The 
              'Dads for Life' national campaign is a commendable initiative of the 
              National Family Council and a step in the right direction.
              <p>Traditional gender roles not only deprive men of the 
              opportunity to play an active role in their children's lives but also 
              create an unbalanced environment where women are discouraged from having
               more children.</p>

              <p>Hopefully in future, scientists will discover a way to impragnate men and then men can do the breast feeding, child delivery and housework while the women go out and work, flirt with toy boys and socialise until the wee hours of the morning.</p>

              <h2>AWARE responds: ‘Not blaming men for low fertility rates’</h2>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Yahoo! Southeast Asia Editors –
               May 21st, 2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p><strong>Guest Post<br> By Corinna Lim, Executive Director, AWARE</strong></p>
              <p>It is great that our letter to the ST Forum (ST, 20 May 2010) (“ST 
              Letter”) has generated so much discussion <a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/05/20/greater-gender-equality-the-key-to-singapores-big-baby-problem/">on
               this site</a>.</p>
              <p>First, I must clarify that AWARE is not anti-men or blaming the issue
               of low fertility rates on men.</p>
              <p>What we said in the ST Letter (which from the comments on this site, 
              many people did not read) is that Singapore could do better in the area 
              of gender equality at home compared to other developed countries like US
               and Sweden, and that there is a correlation between fertility rates and
               gender equality as shown in the fertility trends of these countries.</p>
              <p>Very importantly, we do not think that the lack of gender equality is
               the fault of men alone – “the State, the market and the individual all 
              play important roles in the determination of fertility decisions”. I 
              think the AWARE name makes guys BEWARE and they automatically read our 
              letters in a certain way.</p>
              <p>In the ST Letter, we pointed out certain practices and policies that 
              discourage gender equality at home, such as the lack of mandatory 
              paternity leave and employer’s attitudes to fathers taking time off.</p>
              <p>In relation to fertility, we do not think that gender equality is the
               only factor causing low fertility. We think it plays a significant part
               and that it is something that is worth focusing on as it is less 
              obvious and has been shown to work in Sweden and other countries.</p>
              <p>The main factors discouraging childbearing in Singapore are well 
              known. As has been pointed out by many readers, these include the high 
              cost of living, our incredibly long work hours, the lack of support by 
              companies for work life balance, lack of options for women to go back to
               work after taking time off and lack of child care facilities.</p>
              <p>Some things we can change, some we can’t.</p>
              <p>Do we ever see Singapore becoming less expensive and less pressuring?
               No. So this is not something that we can change and, in my view, no 
              point talking about this.</p>
              <p>But can we try to encourage and incentivize fathers to play a bigger 
              role at home (why should mums have all the fun of bringing up 
              children?)? Can companies be more supportive of their employees’ family 
              life and offer work-life harmony, part time work, and back to work 
              schemes? These seem well within reach. So, let’s try to do something 
              about things that can be improved. And let’s keep the dialogue open.</p>
              <p>I am glad to have the chance to discuss this issue more fully and 
              look forward to receiving more feedback.</p>
