              <p>PUBLIC unease about the influx of immigrants and foreign workers has 
              led to policies checking their numbers here. However, without foreign 
              workers, who is going to construct our houses, clear our rubbish and 
              trim the grass in our housing estates, while we preoccupy ourselves with
               wealth building?</p>
              <p>There are plenty of jobs available to Singaporeans at fair wages, if they wish to take them up.</p>
              <p>I am from the service sector. For every job advertisement 
              that we put up, only one or two out of 10 respondents will be a 
              Singaporean. We will be lucky if any actually turn up for the interview.
               I remember a local respondent calling up to say that she was desperate 
              for a job. Yet when I told her that we were located in the Bukit Timah 
              area, she replied that it was too far and hung up. There are also those 
              who do not wish to do shifts or work on weekends. Someone has to take 
              over the jobs that we do not wish to do.</p>
              <p>Immigrants inject fresh ideas and offer new skill sets. They
               also possess the drive and motivation to succeed. With increased 
              globalisation, we need to embrace cultural diversity.</p>
              <p>Unless we choose to accept slower growth and a lower 
              standard of living, let's welcome the foreigners. Future generations 
              will benefit from this policy.</p>

              <p>mr kwok. don't forget that these people will never put their heart and soul in the work. they only come here count days. month end take salary only. eventually they can still go back to their country. a dollar for many more dollars. while sgreans have to pay and pay for the ever increasing prive. we have no money changer to go change to a newer bigger singapore dollar. mr kwok - we are not saying no foreigners. but there has to be many people working on the ground to ensure bosses don;t over hire any tom with harry dick and flood our island creating many social, security problems. not to to say spoliing our market by marking down salaries to teh point where they can survive we cannot. really tehy can becaus ethey can go money changer and change money - we go ther echange what money? theeir money?</p>

              <p>Just saw on TV that China average worker earns only $100 RMB per month , that is only $20 Singapore Dollars.   Imagine they can earn $800 here.  They just need to spend $500 and the rest send home...$300 x 5 = $1, 500 RMB.  Die die also want to stay and work here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know when Singapore opens the floodgate for so many foreigners, the other countries are thankful to our Government for letting their poor citizens earn good money here, but Singaporeans suffer.</p>
              <p>Poor Singaporeans can't go to Phillippines, Thailand, India, Bangadash, China to earn good money and send home to pay for bills. Their money not even enough to buy a good meal here.</p>
