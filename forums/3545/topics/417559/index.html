              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Former 
              Ministry of Education (MOE) scholar Jonathan Wong had already been 
              arrested for possession of child pornography when he returned to teach 
              in a secondary school here in Singapore.<br><br>23-year-old Wong, who is
               a history major at the University of York, was arrested in March and 
              did his month-long teaching attachment in July at the school in the 
              western part of Singapore.<br><br>Besides teaching history and 
              literature, he interacted closely with pupils when working on a project 
              with them, although "nothing was amiss and Wong acted normally like any 
              other teacher", said a source who also taught at the school.<br><br>But,
               the MOE only knew of Wong's involvement in child pornography last 
              month.<br><br>In reply to queries, a ministry spokesman said: "His 
              offence only came to light after he was charged in court in November."<br><br>The
               spokesman added that "neither Jonathan Wong nor his university informed
               MOE that he had been arrested in March and was under police 
              investigation when he returned for his school attachment".<br><br>University
               of York spokesman David Garner told Channel NewsAsia that it "was not 
              informed by the police of Jonathan Wong's arrest nor the subsequent 
              charges".<br><br>Mr Garner said: "The first that the university knew of 
              the charges was when Jonathan Wong appeared before York Crown Court on 
              Nov 15."<br><br>Parents whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to were concerned 
              when they heard the news.<br><br>A teacher, who declined to be named, 
              added: "When he was first arrested ... we should give him the benefit of
               the doubt. But he should not be allowed to teach till his case is 
              concluded. There should be tightening of communication between the 
              ministry and their scholars overseas."<br><br>This will now be done.<br><br>The
               MOE spokesman said: "We are reviewing our processes to improve the 
              selection of scholars and the reporting of such offences."<br><br>Wong, 
              who is on bail, will be sentenced during the week of Jan 17 after the 
              initial court date of Dec 13 was postponed.<br><br>He could face up to 
              10 years in jail, though a non-custodial sentence is also possible, 
              according to the Crown Prosecution Service.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

               Jonathan has been "permanently excluded" on the grounds of gross 
              misconduct.<br><br>The university added that it is strongly committed to
               child safety and deplores all types of child pornography and abuse.<br><br>Jonathan
               had also been sentenced to six months' imprisonment by the UK court on 
              Monday. <br><br>However, his sentence has been suspended for two years. 
              This means it will not be a custodial sentence. Sources at the court had
               earlier indicated he would not receive a custodial sentence because he 
              had pleaded guilty to the charges and had no previous convictions.<br><br>But
               he will be subject to an eight-month supervision order from the 
              probation service and will be placed under the sex offender's register 
              for seven years. <br><br>He has also been disqualified from working with
               children. <br><br>With the expulsion, Jonathan's eight-month 
              supervision order has to be re-looked at as he will no longer be staying
               legally in the UK.<br><br>The MOE has also revoked his teaching 
              scholarship.<br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p>the sad thing is child pornorgraphy  is NOT the same as regular porn. it's a disease that has no cure, the sadder thing is that the criminal is also a victim as in he cannot help himself, what kind of child porn was it, hetro or homosexual ?</p>
              <p>maybe if it was little girls he was watching let him teach in a boys' school and vice versa....... maybe that could help , nevertheless I doubt that he would do anything now that all eyes are on him already , just keep it that way.......</p>
              <p>this is a really sad sad situation where there is really no way out for him if found guilty . the public will "kill" him, both socially and financially (when he cannot get any employment)</p>
