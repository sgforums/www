              <h1 class="storyheadline">Singapore Sling at icon of service sours memory</h1>
              <p>I AM 82 years old and a frequent visitor to Singapore.</p>
              <p>When I was much younger, my late husband and I shared our 
              first 'Singapore Sling' at Raffles Hotel. During my most recent visit to
               Singapore, I decided that for nostalgia's sake I would return to 
              Raffles Hotel to sample once again Singapore's most famous cocktail.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the experience soured my memory.</p>
              <p>The staff of Raffles Hotel treated me in an offhand manner, 
              often ignoring my request for attention. Further, I was shocked to see 
              them refer to recipes behind the bar counter when mixing cocktails.</p>
              <p>My Singapore Sling tasted like a cheap fruit cocktail, 
              lacking any spice of gin, and my friend, who had ordered a 'Lychee 
              Martini', found it was made of vodka with no hint of Martini at all.</p>
              <p>When we asked the bartender if there was a mistake in the 
              mix, we were met with a sheepish smile but no apology or even an effort 
              to correct the mistake.</p>
              <p>I learnt from the manager at the Raffles Grill, where we 
              subsequently had dinner, that the Singapore Sling tasted below par 
              because the hotel made large quantities of the cocktail for demanding 
              customers and, as with anything produced in great volume, standards 
              suffered.</p>
              <p>I found the explanation unacceptable at best, but the 
              manager did offer to personally concoct a Singapore Sling for me. After 
              the bad experience, I declined but ordered 'a good wine' instead. We 
              were shown a bottle but not quoted the price. To our surprise, the bill 
              for three glasses came to an astonishing $186+++.</p>
              <p>If that was not enough to spoil my visit, the last straw 
              came when, on leaving the restaurant, my arm was tugged back by a butler
               who shoved an article of clothing at me without a word. I discovered it
               was my shawl which I had accidentally left behind.</p>
              <p>I confess that my hearing is not what it used to be. Perhaps
               someone did hail my attention and I did not realise it. But my knees 
              are also weak and I have trouble walking. If I had been tugged back any 
              harder, I would have fallen and could have been severely injured.</p>
              <p>This poor standard of service must stop. Raffles Hotel is an
               international icon that has for generations attracted visitors from 
              every corner of the globe. This is what motivated me to visit it more 
              than 60 years ago and what made me come back again during my most recent
               visit. How can the hotel be so casual with its history and its brand? 
              How can it hire such poor staff as its ambassadors?</p>
              <p>How many more memories will Raffles Hotel shatter?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Service unbecoming of an icon</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Friday's letter by Ms Joanna Hoare, 'Singapore Sling at
               icon of service sours memory', in which she describes the poor service 
              attitudes she encountered on a recent visit to Raffles Hotel.</p>
              <p>I empathise with her and would like to add my own 
              experiences.</p>
              <p>On Feb 20, my friend and I had a dinner appointment at 
              Raffles Grill. On approaching the hotel door, we noted that only one 
              half-door was open and there were two 'bouncers' standing there. One 
              asked my friend, 'May I help you?', with a tone of voice that implied, 
              'So where do you think you're going?'</p>
              <p>My friend took particular exception to this as it seemed the
               hotel was only interested in serving Caucasians. On arriving at the 
              Grill, we noticed it was almost empty.</p>
              <p>However, the final horror was still to come. At the end of 
              the meal, we were each offered a large pink candy floss more in keeping 
              with the fun fair at Coney Island in New York than a supposed five-star 
              hotel. We saw this as a cheap marketing gimmick if ever there was one.</p>
              <p>When the bill came, we noted, as did Ms Hoare, that the cost
               was extremely high. In our case, more than $500.</p>
              <p>In sum, although there were some redeeming points, the 
              overall dining experience and attitude was way below that of earlier 
              days and certainly not befitting of a hotel like Raffles.</p>
              <p>I wrote a complaint to the hotel's general manager on Feb 26
               as my friend and I were upset by the seemingly racist 'welcome' we 
              received on arrival. A reply - making no reference to this - was sent 
              only two weeks later on March 9. Such in itself suggests lack of 
              interest and importance accorded to guests by a senior employee of the 
              hotel.</p>
              <p>I rather wonder whether these attitudes are a reflection of 
              poor service standards in their own right or whether it has anything to 
              do with the fact that Raffles is no longer a Singapore icon, owned - as 
              it is - by foreign interests whose major concern is presumably to see a 
              handsome financial return from the property rather than provide a 
              quality experience for guests.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">It tasted like over-sweetened cough medicine</h1>
              <p>THANK you for publishing last Friday's letter by Ms Joanna Hoare, 
              'Singapore Sling at icon of service sours memory'.</p>
              <p>I could not agree more with her. I went to Raffles Hotel 
              with my husband on my first trip to Singapore in 2008. We were given no 
              menu, only a cheeky smile from the waiter: 'Two Singapore Slings to 
              start with?'</p>
              <p>It tasted like over-sweetened cough medicine, and cost $58.</p>
              <p>It is a real shame as this hotel is part of Singapore's 
              image and it just gives a bad name to this beautiful hotel and country.</p>
