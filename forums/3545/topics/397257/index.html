              <p class="clear" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;  padding: 0px;"><span class="media" style="display: block; float: left; width: 240px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px;"><img style="float: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; display: block; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://a323.yahoofs.com/ymg/inspirations__2/inspirations-858383055-1271386745.jpg?ym6ZW_CDQORTZUA." border="0" alt=""></span>Singapore = Food. The city-state dominates the 'net with food blogs where hungry netizens compare, dissect, argue and swap foodie fodder, scouring the island for new tastes. And nearly every conceivable victual from every earthly corner has a home here. Fancy authentic Egyptian Baba Ghanoush? Arab Street's got you covered. Crave something Nigerian besides a scam e-mail? Find it on Verdun Road in Little India. If it's edible and fits on a plate, bowl, banana leaf or sheet of paper, we'll wolf it with zeal. But if you truly want to sample Singapore's food culture, head to any of the hawker centers in the heartlands -- there's a huge variety of stalls there at dirt-cheap prices.</p>

              <p>Singapore's a Garden City, literally. Amid the concrete jungle we call home, there's the Botanical Gardens, HortPark, MacRitchie Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve -- each claiming myriad varieties of flora and fauna. But the most common impression left visitors to Singapore concerns the rows of trees that line roads everywhere, from expressways to suburban streets. It's not just a green facade -- Singapore's a champion of environmental initiatives, from the world's largest CNG refueling station to its first Solar Greenlots for electric vehicles.</p>

              <p class="clear" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;  padding: 0px;"><span class="media" style="display: block; float: left; width: 240px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px;"><img style="float: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; display: block; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://a323.yahoofs.com/ymg/inspirations__2/inspirations-691385071-1271386771.jpg?ymTaW_CDyUx8qxDT" border="0" alt=""></span>No one in Singapore, regardless of political stripe, has anything but a healthy respect -- perhaps even awe -- for Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew. He led Singapore to independence in 1965 and served as its first Prime Minister for 31 years, setting the record as the world's longest-serving Prime Minister. He's the architect of Singapore's present prosperity, laying a foundation of nation-building which has taken Singapore from a sleepy little island to one of Asia's most developed states, despite its small population, limited space and lack of natural resources.</p>

              <p>Singapore has one of the best health care infrastructures in the world, with various dignitaries and royals from the region patronizing local hospitals -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe even slipped in quietly for a 'secret cancer check-up' in 2008. The health care provision system is also one of the world's best, so good that some say it beats the proposed ObamaCare model.</p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal; font-family: georgia, times, serif; padding: 0px;">5. First and only Night Race in the world</h2>

The inaugural race in 2008 also earned the city-state an unfortunate distinction for being the one in which Team Renault boss Flavio Briatore ordered Nelson Piquet to crash, giving teammate Fernando Alonso the win. It's now known as the Singapore 'Crashgate' scandal -- which might lend some cred to Singapore's squeaky-clean image.</p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal; font-family: georgia, times, serif; padding: 0px;">6. Water technology so good, we drink our own pee</h2>
              <p>Time magazine called Singapore the global paragon of water conservation. Through sheer effort, and more than a little desperation (Singapore imports less than half the population's water from neighboring Malaysia with agreements set to expire in 2011 and 2061), the island turned to desalination technologies to provide for thirsty citizens. The result is NeWater, which is non-potable wastewater filtered into high-purity H2O that can be used for industrial development and even drinking.</p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal; font-family: georgia, times, serif; padding: 0px;">7. Most awesome crustacean dish of all time</h2>
              <p class="clear" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;  padding: 0px;"><span class="media" style="display: block; float: left; width: 240px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px;"><img style="float: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; display: block; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://a323.yahoofs.com/ymg/inspirations__2/inspirations-483541979-1271386806.jpg?ym3aW_CDQvhnZrnR" border="0" alt=""></span>The Singapore chili crab is famous. Despite what the Malaysian Tourism Ministry claims, the dish is distinctly Singaporean, as evidenced by the Singapore Chilli Crab Festivals staged all across Europe. Madam Cher Yam Tian created the succulent recipe in 1950 and it's now the unofficial national dish of a food-loving nation, with restaurants and coffee shops serving it by the ton nightly.</p>
              <h2 style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.7em; margin-left: 0px; font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal; font-family: georgia, times, serif; padding: 0px;">8. English that no one else understands</h2>
              <p>It's the unofficial 'first language' of most Singaporeans and one that would bewilder the remaining English-speaking world. Singlish is the creole of choice for citizens, cobbled together from various influences including Queen's English, Bahasa Melayu, Tamil, dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Bengali, Punjabi and even a smattering of various other European, Indic and Sinitic languages. Word of warning -- if you don't know it, don't try it. It'll make you sound sillier than we already do. Eh, dun pray pray ah ...</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #226699;" href="http://www.cnngo.com/singapore/none/perfect-singlish-singaporean-white-boy-515356">Curious about white boy Singlish and how to speak it.

              <p>Thanks to its minuscule size, Singapore has the infrastructure to support island-wide 3.5G mobile and wireless internet access. According to Singapore's Infocomm Development Authority (IDA), there are 6.5 million mobile subscribers (as of July 2009), making for a staggering 140-plus-percent mobile phone penetration rate, and over four million in wireless broadband subscriptions. This is why you'll see Singaporeans with their attentions dedicated to their phones, rather than their environment.</p>

              <p class="clear" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px;  padding: 0px;"><span class="media" style="display: block; float: left; width: 240px; margin-top: 2px; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-left: 0px;"><img style="float: none; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 4px; margin-left: 0px; display: block; border: 0px initial initial;" src="http://a323.yahoofs.com/ymg/inspirations__2/inspirations-731213720-1271386829.jpg?ymNbW_CDLP0NOUEF" border="0" alt=""></span>There's a Singapore-wide campaign for everything -- Be Courteous, Speak English, Speak Mandarin, Stop Dengue, Save Water, Stop Littering, Be Kind, Don't Spit, and Stop At Two are just a warm-up. We'd go on, but that would violate the current Stop Prattling campaign.   -<span style="color: #666666; font-size: 11px;">Fri Apr 16 13:08pm</span></p>

              = Food. The city-state dominates the 'net with food blogs where
              hungry netizens compare, dissect, argue and swap foodie fodder,
              scouring the island for new tastes. And nearly every conceivable
              victual from every earthly corner has a home here. Fancy authentic
              Egyptian Baba Ghanoush? Arab Street's got you covered. Crave
              something Nigerian besides a scam e-mail? Find it on Verdun Road in
              Little India. If it's edible and fits on a plate, bowl, banana leaf
              or sheet of paper, we'll wolf it with zeal. But if you truly want
              to sample Singapore's food culture, head to any of the hawker
              centers in the heartlands -- there's a huge variety of stalls there
              at dirt-cheap prices.</p>

              <p>Singapore's a Garden City, literally. Amid the concrete jungle
              we call home, there's the Botanical Gardens, HortPark, MacRitchie
              Reservoir, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve -- each claiming myriad
              varieties of flora and fauna. But the most common impression left
              visitors to Singapore concerns the rows of trees that line roads
              everywhere, from expressways to suburban streets. It's not just a
              green facade -- Singapore's a champion of environmental
              initiatives, from the world's largest CNG refueling station to its
              first Solar Greenlots for electric vehicles.</p>

              one in Singapore, regardless of political stripe, has anything but
              a healthy respect -- perhaps even awe -- for Minister Mentor Lee
              Kuan Yew. He led Singapore to independence in 1965 and served as
              its first Prime Minister for 31 years, setting the record as the
              world's longest-serving Prime Minister. He's the architect of
              Singapore's present prosperity, laying a foundation of
              nation-building which has taken Singapore from a sleepy little
              island to one of Asia's most developed states, despite its small
              population, limited space and lack of natural resources.</p>

              <p>Singapore has one of the best health care infrastructures in the
              world, with various dignitaries and royals from the region
              patronizing local hospitals -- Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe
              even slipped in quietly for a 'secret cancer check-up' in 2008. The
              health care provision system is also one of the world's best, so
              good that some say it beats the proposed ObamaCare model.</p>

              is the first F1 venue to <a style="text-decoration: none; color: #226699;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.cnngo.com/singapore/play/singapore-grand-prix-2009-400446">host
              a night race</a> on its streets, and will do so for several
              years to come. The inaugural race in 2008 also earned the
              city-state an unfortunate distinction for being the one in which
              Team Renault boss Flavio Briatore ordered Nelson Piquet to crash,
              giving teammate Fernando Alonso the win. It's now known as the
              Singapore 'Crashgate' scandal -- which might lend some cred to
              Singapore's squeaky-clean image.</p>

              <p>Time magazine called Singapore the global paragon of water
              conservation. Through sheer effort, and more than a little
              desperation (Singapore imports less than half the population's
              water from neighboring Malaysia with agreements set to expire in
              2011 and 2061), the island turned to desalination technologies to
              provide for thirsty citizens. The result is NeWater, which is
              non-potable wastewater filtered into high-purity H2O that can be
              used for industrial development and even drinking.</p>

              Singapore chili crab is famous. Despite what the Malaysian Tourism
              Ministry claims, the dish is distinctly Singaporean, as evidenced
              by the Singapore Chilli Crab Festivals staged all across Europe.
              Madam Cher Yam Tian created the succulent recipe in 1950 and it's
              now the unofficial national dish of a food-loving nation, with
              restaurants and coffee shops serving it by the ton nightly.</p>
              <h2 style="margin: 1em 0px 0.7em; font-size: 21px; font-weight: normal; font-family: georgia,times,serif; padding: 0px;">8. English that no one else understands</h2>
              <p>It's the unofficial 'first language' of most Singaporeans and
              one that would bewilder the remaining English-speaking world.
              Singlish is the creole of choice for citizens, cobbled together
              from various influences including Queen's English, Bahasa Melayu,
              Tamil, dialects such as Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, Bengali,
              Punjabi and even a smattering of various other European, Indic and
              Sinitic languages. Word of warning -- if you don't know it, don't
              try it. It'll make you sound sillier than we already do. Eh, dun
              pray pray ah ...</p>

              <p>Thanks to its minuscule size, Singapore has the infrastructure
              to support island-wide 3.5G mobile and wireless internet access.
              According to Singapore's Infocomm Development Authority (IDA),
              there are 6.5 million mobile subscribers (as of July 2009), making
              for a staggering 140-plus-percent mobile phone penetration rate,
              and over four million in wireless broadband subscriptions. This is
              why you'll see Singaporeans with their attentions dedicated to
              their phones, rather than their environment.</p>

              a Singapore-wide campaign for everything -- Be Courteous, Speak
              English, Speak Mandarin, Stop Dengue, Save Water, Stop Littering,
              Be Kind, Don't Spit, and Stop At Two are just a warm-up. We'd go
              on, but that would violate the current Stop Prattling campaign.

              <p>Owing to our geographic location, Singapore is sheltered from most of 
              the natural disasters that afflict neighboring countries and the rest of
               the world. Still, people get a kick each time a strong wind blows down 
              from the north or our houses rumble from the aftershocks of Indonesian 
              earthquakes.</p>
              <h3>12. Most crooked-backed kids</h3>
              <p>Small children toting oversized backpacks crammed with books are common 
              to our neighborhood streets. That would be due to our educational 
              system, with streaming programs that start as early as primary four. 
              This goes all the way up past secondary school, until you are able to

              dizzying enough, clamber up to the top floor helipad for a 360-degree 
              view of the bright lights of Singapore. On a clear night you can see as 
              far as Indonesia. Just don't look down. Or fall over.

              and places Rambo wouldn't tread without a Sherman. Not so here. Public 
              housing is actually pretty good, with most of the population living in 
              government-managed apartments -- it's just not cheap. In fact, far from 
              poverty, Singapore has the <a href="http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/My%2BMoney/Story/A1Story20090916-168053.html">highest density of millionaires at 8.5 percent of the

              Digging into the history books, <a href="http://library.thinkquest.org/10414/sang.html">Sang
               Nila Utama</a>, the founder of modern Singapore, named the island of 
              Temasek as such when he saw what he thought was a lion, took it as a 
              good omen, and renamed the place 'Singapura,' meaning "Lion city." The 
              English 'Singapore' evolved from the Malay name, hence the moniker 'Lion
               City' and one half of the iconic Merlion. Zoologists maintain that 
              lions probably never lived there, not even Asiatic breeds, and that the 
              beast seen was more likely a tiger, probably the Malayan Tiger. Funny 
              how the island's eponymous animal never really existed. But, then 
              'Harimaupura' (Tiger-city) doesn't have quite the same kick.

              proven track record of scientific accomplishments." But educated or not,
               like cabbies everywhere, our taxi drivers are full of opinions and 
              political commentary -- just ask what they think of the government and 
              watch their mouths outrace their motors in RPM. Plus, all taxis are 
              meticulously maintained, with twice-daily washes and a rigid fare 
              structure. The rides might cost more than other Southeast Asian 
              countries, but you'll never get cheated or over-charged.

              Our very own pleasure island of <a href="http://www.sentosa.com.sg/">Sentosa</a> was once known as <a href="http://www.sentosa.com.sg/about_us/sentosa_island/index.html">Pulau Blakang Mati</a>, which in Malay means "Island 
              (pulau) of Death (mati) from Behind (blakang)."  All of this was swept under the dead grass carpet when the Singapore 
              Tourist Promotion Board launched a campaign to rename the island 
              'Sentosa,' a Malay word meaning "peace and tranquility." It obviously 
              worked, considering it's visited by some five million peace seekers a 
              year.

              <h3>38. The coolest pairing of comic book superheroes (or most 
              unfortunate name ever)</h3>
              Nineteen-year-old <a href="http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5">Batman Bin Suparman</a>, born in Singapore to Javanese 
              parents, has a lot to live up to if his namesake is any guide. He's even
               got his own <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Batman-Bin-Suparman-Fan-Club/32959402904">Facebook Fan Club</a>. The wedgies this kid receives 
              must be superhuman.<br>

              Beijing has its Bird's Nest Stadium. Taipei has its Bamboo Skyscraper. 
              And Singapore has the Durian Theaters. The waterside <a href="http://www.esplanade.com/index.jsp">Esplanade 
              Theatres</a> on the Bay were designed to express harmony with nature, 
              reflecting the balance of yin and yang. But they've, instead, been 
              compared to the eyes of flies, copulating aardvarks and Chinese 
              dumplings. Locals just call them the "Durians."<br><br> <em>The Esplanade Theatres, 1 Esplanade Drive, Singapore, tel +65 68288

              The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milo_%28drink%29">Milo Dinosaur </a>has made its way across the Malaysia 
              border and has spawned new offspring in Singapore. The ultra-chocolatey 
              drink, which is basically a cup of Milo topped with an extra spoonful of
               undissolved Milo powder, has the Milo Godzilla (added ice cream and 
              whipped cream) trailing after, together with siblings "Horlicks 
              Dinosaur" (a variant with the malt drink power) and "Neslo" (combined 
              with Nescafe powdered coffee).

              <div id="TixyyLink" style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">Everyday, in kopitiams (local coffee shops) all over Singapore, coffee 
              stall attendants with bellows for lungs yell out drink orders in the 
              most perplexing code this side of the Causeway. "Kopi-o peng gao jit 
              puay" means one iced thick coffee without milk and less sugar, while 
              "teh-si siew dai sua neng puay" means two cups of tea with condensed 
              milk and less sugar. Don't bother, most Singaporeans just place their 
              drink orders in plain ol' indecipherable Singlish.</div>

              <h3>44. Hang out with purple-haired artists doodling on walls while 
              blowing smoke rings out of an Egyptian shisha</h3>
              <a href="http://hajilane.sg/">Haji Lane</a> is 
              Singapore's must-visit street, where streams of curious tourists, design
               students and wannabe fashionistas gather to hunt for great local finds,
               designer clothes and accessories. Expect rows of small boutiques packed
               with vintage dresses, classic bags, shoes and even cameras. Take time 
              to check out the graffiti on the walls -- it's one of the best 
              collections of street art around.<br>
              <h3>45. Toilets are taken (too) seriously</h3>
              The <a href="http://www.toilet.org.sg/">Restroom 
              Association of Singapore (RAS)</a> wants its public toilets so clean you
               can eat off the lids. To do that, they comb the island in search of the
               causes of dirty crappers and spread the Good Word on good toilet 
              etiquette.

              that plays regional films, Old School's is a magnet for those with an 
              alternative bent. Hang around in the evening and get to know the local

              bruises, no "Eye of the Tiger" soundtrack in the background. What there

              <div id="TixyyLink" style="overflow: hidden; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;">It's strangely comforting when everyone (and we mean everyone) is 
              accorded a familial term, including the Ice Cream Uncle on Orchard Road,
               or that Toilet Auntie at Far East Plaza. If your taxi driver's younger 
              than you, then it's 'brudder' or 'sistah', or just 'boss,' if you want 
              to score some brownie points.</div>

              venerable nicknames, but the perennial favorite has to be the Little Red
               Dot. We're so small and unnoticeable on the world map, some dusty 
              cartographer with Harry Potter specs had to use a red dot to denote our 
              location. But notice us the world did, with accolades such as the 
              'easiest place for business,' the 'most livable city in Asia' and the 
              'best city in the world to live in for Asia expatriates.' We are 
              Singapore, hear us roar.
