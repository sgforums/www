              <p><strong>A World Heritage Site in S'pore?</strong><br> <span class="update">By Leong Wee Keat, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/"><span style="color: #cc0000;">TODAY</span></a> | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 15 April 2010 0821 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Cambodia has Angkor Wat, Malaysia boasts the town of 
              Malacca as one and the Great Wall of China is one of the best well known
               - so why can't Singapore have a world heritage site too?
              <br> <br> According to a tender that closes on Thursday, the Government is on the 
              search for possible United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
              Organisation (Unesco) World Heritage Sites. It is looking to engage a 
              contractor to undertake "a comprehensive study to assess the feasibility
               of selected heritage sites ... as possible World Heritage Sites and to 
              recommend a suitable tentative list".
              <br> <br> There are 890 sites around the world, but Singapore has none. 
              Neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia have 
              three, five and seven sites, respectively.
              <br> <br> Ministry of Communication, Information and the Arts (Mica) deputy 
              secretary Sim Gim Guan said the study is aimed at exploring whether 
              Singapore has potential sites and if there were benefits of nominating 
              one for listing. If feasible, this would help develop a process for 
              nomination, evaluation and selection of suitable cultural landmarks and 
              districts of historical significance for a listing.
              <br> <br> "The entire nomination process is rigorous, and we envisage the entire 
              process, should we proceed, will take three to five years, based on the 
              experience of some countries that have succeeded in World Heritage Site 
              listing," said Mr Sim.
              <br> <br> The move has been lauded by observers and conservation advocates who in 
              turn, have suggested the Singapore Botanic Gardens - founded in 1859 - 
              as the sole candidate that would meet Unesco's criteria.
              <br> <br> The Botanic Gardens has strong connections with the history of global 
              colonial economy in the past, given its links to Britain's Kew Gardens, 
              said Associate Professor Johannes Widodo, a jury member of the Unesco 
              Asia-Pacific Heritage Awards for Culture Heritage Conservation. "In 
              addition, the Gardens have very important ecological value at present 
              and in the future, not just for Singapore but also globally."
              <br> <br> Singapore Heritage Society president Kevin Tan said that if the Gardens 
              succeeded in being listed, perceptions of Singapore "being a very young 
              city with no history and large green spaces, a bit of a concrete 
              jungle," will change. Listing it "will showcase a very significant jewel
               in our midst".
              <br> <br> But observers warned that the benefits of having a site need to be 
              balanced against potential pitfalls, such as a surge in mass tourism, 
              over-commercialisation, and erosion of dignity. Mr Tan Wee Cheng, who 
              has visited 247 sites worldwide, launched a Facebook group to canvass 
              support and raise awareness. Such pitfalls can be avoided with careful 
              planning, and it is important "not to be overly ambitious," he said.
              <br> <br> For the study, Mica requires that the contractor identify potential 
              threats and evaluate the implications of future re-development plans 
              within and in proximity to the heritage sites.
