              <h2>New guidelines on use of malls for religion</h2>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Angela Lim – July 21st, 2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>

              <p>New government guidelines reveal 
              that while religious organisations can make use of commercial premises 
              for their activities, these must be done within limits.</p>
              <p>Over the years, it has been common for Christian groups to use venues
               like hotel function rooms and convention centres for their activities 
              on weekends.</p>
              <p>However, with new guidelines set, no more than 20,000 sq m of a 
              commercial complex’s gross floor area (GFA), or 20 per cent of GFA, 
              whichever is lower may be used for religious purposes. In addition, such
               activities may not be held for more than two days a week.</p>
              <p>Religious organisations are also limited to using 10,000 sq m, 
              equivalent to about one and a half football fields. This serves to 
              ensure that no particular commercial complex is dominated by a religious
               organisation.</p>
              <p>The<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=urban+redevelopment+authority&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> Urban Redevelopment Authority</a> (URA) and the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ministry+of+community+development+youth+and+sports&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry
               of Community Development, Youth and Sports </a>(MCYS) explained in a 
              joint statement that they were willing to be more flexible with 
              commercial premises like hotels, auditoriums, function halls, convention
               halls and cinemas. This is as long as the locations are used in a 
              “limited, non-exclusive way” by religious groups that hold large 
              gatherings and on condition that the events do not cause noise, traffic 
              or parking problems.</p>
              <p>Other guidelines state that there should be no use of religious 
              symbols or signage, and the interiors should not be furnished to 
              resemble a worship hall when not used by the religious group. These 
              rules are meant to ensure the secular nature of the venues.</p>
              <p>These guidelines will take effect immediately and apply to all 
              religions. All religious organisations using commercial space will need 
              to register with the URA.</p>
              <p>Most churches received the new land use rules with relief as most are
               not at risk of violation. The URA discussed the guidelines on Monday 
              with representatives of the larger megachurches including 33,000-strong <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=city+harvest+church&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">City
               Harvest Church</a>, 20,000-strong <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=new+creation+church&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">New
               Creation Church </a>and 10,000-strong <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=faith+community+baptist+church&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Faith
               Community Baptist Church</a>. Their landlords, Singapore Expo and 
              Suntec Singapore were also included in the discussion.</p>
              <p>On City Harvest Church’s controversial S$310 million investment to 
              become a co-owner of <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=suntec+singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Suntec
               Singapore </a>and hold services in the 12,000-seat auditorium there, 
              the URA states that it does not regulate property ownership.</p>
              <p>“However, the actual use of the premises must adhere to the planning 
              and land use zoning intentions regardless of the ownership. The 
              contractual agreement between City Harvest and Suntec City is a private 
              matter between two parties,” a URA spokesman told <em>The Straits Times. </em></p>
              <p>While Senior Pastor Lawrence Khong of Faith Community Baptist Church 
              felt such explicit guidelines could be restrictive and preferred to 
              leave it to the market to “self-regulate”, others like Nicholas Mak, a 
              real estate lecturer at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, agreed with the new 
              guidelines.</p>
              <p>“Rather than let religious organisations slowly take over commercial 
              spaces and make other users feel uncomfortable, the guidelines ensure 
              that members of the public of all religions can use the premises,” he 
              said.</p>
