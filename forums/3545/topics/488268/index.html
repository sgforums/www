                                      important issues that affect all of us here in Singapore. I don’t blame them
                                      for it for it sometimes require some reading and looking deeper into the facts.
                                      The most common errors concern the minimum wage, our CPF and Singapore
                                      taxation. I will debunk the myths and tell you the truth. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Often people complain that Singapore does not have a minimum
                                      wage. Their thinking is that if the government sets a minimum wage, employers will
                                      be forced to pay our lowest paid workers a higher wage. This is nonsense. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">You cannot raise people’s wages by force. Each of us is paid
                                      what we deserve based on our skills. Employers have the power to hire or fire.

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">These are the poor. They are poor because they have low
                                      wages. But that is better than no jobs. No job means zero income. No job also
                                      means a loss of opportunity to gain skills. On the other hand, if a young
                                      person with little skills start with a low wage job, he can gain higher wages
                                      later with working experience. The only way for people to raise their wages is
                                      to improve their skills. The only way to improve your skills is through
                                      education and working experience. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Do you want to know how the minimum wage got started? The
                                      early pioneers of the minimum wage were Australia and New Zealand. The
                                      motivation was racism. In the late 19th century, Australia was flooded with
                                      Chinese immigrants. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">When they came, they knew little English and so had to accept
                                      a lower wage if they wanted a job. They were (and still are) physically smaller
                                      and weaker than Caucasians in an era when manual labor was required for most
                                      jobs. The white Australians felt their jobs threatened by these immigrants and
                                      so demanded the minimum wage. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">The minimum wage was imposed at a level that it is not worth
                                      it for an employer to hire the Chinese worker. So they ended up hiring white
                                      Australians. If you don’t believe me that it was racists that demanded the

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">In America, the idea caught on in the 1920s. But this time,
                                      the intention was to discriminate against Blacks and not Chinese. Southern
                                      Blacks moved to the North seeking jobs. Contractors hiring cheaper Black
                                      workers clinched building contracts. The white unions were angry and of course
                                      asked for a minimum wage. The first Minimum Wage law in the US was the Davis
                                      Bacon Act passed sometime in the 1920s with the support of white racists. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Blacks, then as they still are today, were less educated than
                                      whites. So if they wanted work they had to accept lower pay. Once the law
                                      decreed they must be paid higher than what their labor is worth, they became
                                      jobless and the whites got the jobs. </span></p>

                                      because of  racism? I suggest you </span><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2014/04/29/on-the-historically-racist-motivations-behind-minimum-wage/"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%; color: #1155cc;">click

Now I
                                      want you to think what would happen if the minimum wage is imposed in
                                      Singapore.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Well, unemployment will go up as those with low skills will
                                      be fired from their jobs. Employers will try to automate or replace them with
                                      more efficient workers. Which ethnic group do you think will be the most badly
                                      affected? The group that will be most badly affected will be the ethnic group
                                      with the least education among our ethnic groups - the Malays. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">While they have made significant progress over the decades,
                                      they still lag behind in qualifications and skill levels. So they will
                                      disproportionately lose their jobs if Singapore imposes a minimum wage.  It is not a good idea to implement a policy
                                      that will increase the suffering of poor low skilled Malays if we want racial
                                      harmony. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Jobless blacks in America, caused by the minimum wage laws,
                                      are very unhappy. These Blacks became angry at their poverty and at the
                                      slightest excuse go on a riot. That’s what happened in Ferguson, Staten Island
                                      and Baltimore recently. Using alleged police brutality as an excuse, they
                                      looted the stores to get the things they did not have money to buy. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Finally, the whole idea of minimum wage is wrong. A job is a
                                      contract between two willing parties. If someone is willing to offer a job at a
                                      certain wage and another is willing to accept it, why should the government
                                      interfere? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">If the minimum wage is so bad as what Nobel Prize winner
                                      Milton Friedman said, why are there so many countries having it? One possible
                                      answer is the sheer ignorance of the politicians. Another answer is that the
                                      policy makers are aware that it is a bad idea but don’t care because it is
                                      popular. I think the second reason is the more likely reason. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Politicians need to be popular to get elected. They crave
                                      power for its own sake and also because with power they will get rich one way
                                      or another. They know that the minimum wage is popular because most people do
                                      not know much about economics. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">We are lucky to have a good government who understands
                                      economics and do the right thing even though it is unpopular. Our opposition is
                                      promising the minimum wage because it is popular and they want votes. Either
                                      they are ignorant of the harmful effects or they do not care. Either way, they
                                      are not fit to govern. </span></p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">The CPF generated a mother lode of misconceptions among
                                      netizens. Many Singaporeans are angry that they are now no longer allowed to
                                      withdraw their CPF money at age 55. This has sparked off wild theories. One is
                                      that the government has lost a lot of money in their investments. Therefore,
                                      they are unable to return us the money when we reach 55. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Others believe in the reverse. Instead of losing their money,
                                      they think that the government is making money out of our CPF money. They think
                                      that government is getting a better return with their CPF money than what CPF
                                      pays us because Temasek reported a 16% rate of return since it started.
                                      Therefore, the theory goes, the longer they hold on to our money, the more
                                      money our government makes. Some are wondering who is managing their CPF
                                      investments, accusing them of lack of transparency. Is it Temasek or GIC? Or
                                      who else?</span></p>

                                      sources. Let me start with the most stupid misconception floating on the

                                      their debt. That’s because it simply prints or borrows money whenever they are
                                      short of money. Besides printing and borrowing money, all government can also
                                      raise taxes to pay their debts. So even if this wild rumor is true, CPF members
                                      will get paid. Of course, printing money is a drastic step as it will cause

                                      would not be fair or prudent. Temasek invests in risky assets. They can and do
                                      sometimes lose money. There is no guarantee that they can make 16% return in
                                      the future. The rate of return must be related to the riskiness of your asset.
                                      Since CPF is risk free, you must compare the interest rate with other risk free
                                      assets or at least very low risk assets. If you don’t believe me, go ask any

              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">In 2014, Singapore government's tax revenue amounted to only
                                      15% of GDP. In layman’s terms, it means that our government only took away 15%
                                      of what we earned on the average. “What we earned” includes all the salaries,
                                      profits, rent, interest earned by people living in Singapore. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Now let’s see what other governments did. The comparable
                                      number for the UK, Australia and New Zealand are 40%, 33% and 41% respectively.
                                      This means that they have taken a bigger chunk of the people’s hard earned
                                      money. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">What have the people gotten in return for the money they paid
                                      the government? A government is supposed to provide services to the people.
                                      This includes security from external and internal bad guys. This means
                                      protecting us from foreign enemies and local criminals. The government must
                                      also provide education, healthcare, infrastructure and so on for the taxes we
                                      pay them. Besides all this, it must create jobs by attracting investors. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">So with the little money it taxes away from us our government
                                      must of necessity spend less money on education, health care, police, infrastructure,
                                      etc. Are we more unhealthy, uneducated, crime ridden with crumbling
                                      infrastructure as a result? </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">The answer is ‘no.’ We are healthier, have better schools,
                                      have lower crime, have fewer jobless people than most western countries. If you
                                      don’t believe me, here are the facts. Our health care system is ranked the most

                                      Health Organization ranked Singapore’s healthcare</span></a><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;"> as the 6th
                                      best in the world. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">As a result, </span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%; color: #1155cc;">Singaporeans’

                                      who say that our government does not spend enough on health care just because
                                      western countries spend more have missed the point. Our tax $ is well spent and
                                      it is the results that counts. The Ang Mo governments spend taxpayers’ money
                                      wastefully and that’s why they spend more. That’s why </span><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-efficient-health-care-2014-countries"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%; color: #1155cc;">we

              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%;">Our education system ranks<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #1155cc;"> <a href="http://www.edudemic.com/learning-curve-report-education/">3rd
                                      best</a></span></span> in the world. Our top University, the NUS, is </span><a href="http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/2014-15/world-ranking"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;  line-height: 115%; color: #1155cc;">ranked

                                      university. But NUS loses out to Cambridge, Oxford and Imperial College. The

                                      and NZ are 1.0, 1.1 and 0.9 respectively. </span></p>

                                      and 7.5% in the United Kingdom. I chose Australia, UK and NZ to compare with
                                      because, like Singapore, they are all wealthy countries that have the British
                                      Parliamentary system and use English as the working language.</span></p>

                                      and in exchange gave us better schools, healthcare, more jobs and security than
                                      the others. I think 99% of Singaporeans focus on the ministers’  pay. I prefer to look at the taxes we pay and
                                      what we have got in return. It seems that we got more for less than most First

              <p>Ah finally! Someone has started a real conversation. Thank you my friend. I was getting bored. Did you go through the links I provided? They explained that the minimum wage causes unemployment.</p>
              <p>The original purpose of minimum wage was to prevent certain groups - like Chinese and Blacks from getting jobs. Now it is preventing the lowest skilled from getting jobs. Employers are not affected. </p>
              <p>Go through those links I gave you and see if you understand. If there is anything you don't understand, ask and I will explain. </p>

              <p>right now SC/PRs only takes home 80% of their total pay (annual bonus+incentives+others on top of their basic pay). new PRs have a progressive change from 100% to 80% accordingly.</p>
              <p>foreigners come to SG for better pay or better conditions. they came on work permits, S-pass, E-pass or other passes. the S-pass holder have a minimum wage. </p>
