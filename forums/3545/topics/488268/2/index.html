              <p>what if the employer underpays you?</p>
              <p>right now SC/PRs only takes home 80% of their total pay (annual
              bonus+incentives+others on top of their basic pay). new PRs have a

              <p>foreigners come to SG for better pay or better conditions. they
              came on work permits, S-pass, E-pass or other passes. the S-pass

              <p>If an employer underpays you, you can always look for another job that pays higher - provided you have the skills to justify the pay. At the end of the day, it is your skill level that determines your pay. </p>
              <p>If you cannot find another job that pays higher, you better go for retraining. </p>
              <p>What is the minimum wage for S pass holders? The minimum wage for S pass holders is to stop employers from hiring too many of them following complaints of too many foreigners. </p>
              <p>The purpose of minimum wage is always, since the time it first started in Australia and NZ, to prevent employment. Let me give you a simple illustration to convince you, since you do not appear convinced.</p>
              <p>Since minimum wage started in Australia/NZ, I will give you an Aussie illustration. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>It is sometime in the 1890s. Mr White is an experienced sheep shearer. Mr Wong is just fresh of the boat from China and inexperienced in Aussie jobs like sheep shearing. Also the job needs strength and White is bigger and stronger than Wong. Mr Rich is a wealth owner of a sheep station (Aussie slang for ranch or farm). He has 400 sheep that needs shearing. </p>
              <p>Mr White can shear 12 sheep in one hour. Mr Wong can only shear 4 sheep in one hour. Mr Rich is prepared to pay Mr White $3 per hour and Mr Wong $1 per hour. Mr Wong does not mind because he knows that Mr White can do the job three times faster than he can. </p>
              <p>In 25 hours, White sheared 25 x 12 = 300 sheep. He was paid $25 x 3 = $75.</p>
              <p>In 25 hours, Wong sheared 25 x 4  = 100 sheep. He was paid $25 x  1 = $25.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Rich paid a total of $100. </p>
              <p>Now watch what happens when they imposed a minimum wage of say $2 per hour. </p>
              <p>In 25 hours, White still sheared 300 sheep and he was paid $75.</p>
              <p>In 25 hours, Wong still sheared 100 sheep but now he would have been paid $50.</p>
              <p>This would have cost Rich a total of $125. </p>
              <p>But Rich did not become rich because he was stupid. So he decided to fire Wong and let White do all the sheep by himself.</p>
              <p>Since White can shear 12 sheep in one hour, he finished the job in 400/12 = 33.33 hours. He was paid 33.33 x $3 = $100. </p>
              <p>Result? Rich spent the same as before minimum wage. White gets more pay while Wong is jobless. Wong also lost the opportunity to gain experience and in time would have qualified him a higher salary. </p>
              <p>This is a simple illustration of how minimum wage causes unemployment among the low skilled. It does not help the poor. It makes things worse for them. </p>

              <p>This is not true. <a href="http://www.global-rates.com/interest-rates/central-banks/central-bank-america/fed-interest-rate.aspx">US interest rates have been steady</a> and not rising. <a href="http://www.moneysmart.sg/home-loan/sibor-trend">Our SIBOR</a> did rise from 0.5% at the begining of the year to about 1% today. Our CPF ordinary account interest rate recently went up from 2.5% to 3.5%. </p>
              <p>In general, it is better for the economy to have low interest rates. High interest rates may be good for depositors but bad for lenders. Most of us have housing loans to pay. So we don't want high interest rates. </p>

              <p>Oh but it does. You cannot assume all employers break the law. By making foreigners less affordable more Singaporeans will be employed at a higher salary. Of course, our government must not overdo it. Or companies will relocate to Vietnam or elsewhere.</p>

              <p>If an employer underpays you, you can always look for another
              job that pays higher - provided you have the skills to justify the
              pay. At the end of the day, it is your skill level that determines
              your pay. </p>
              <p>If you cannot find another job that pays higher, you better go

              <p>What is the minimum wage for S pass holders? The minimum wage
              for S pass holders is to stop employers from hiring too many of
              them following complaints of too many foreigners. </p>
              <p>The purpose of minimum wage is always, since the time it first
              started in Australia and NZ, to prevent employment. Let me give you
              a simple illustration to convince you, since you do not appear
              convinced.</p>
              <p>Since minimum wage started in Australia/NZ, I will give you an
              Aussie illustration. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>
              <p>It is sometime in the 1890s. Mr White is an experienced sheep
              shearer. Mr Wong is just fresh of the boat from China and
              inexperienced in Aussie jobs like sheep shearing. Also the job
              needs strength and White is bigger and stronger than Wong. Mr Rich
              is a wealthy owner of a sheep station (Aussie slang for ranch or
              farm). He has 400 sheep that needs shearing. </p>
              <p>Mr White can shear 12 sheep in one hour. Mr Wong can only shear
              4 sheep in one hour. Mr Rich is prepared to pay Mr White $3 per
              hour and Mr Wong $1 per hour. Mr Wong does not mind because he
              knows that Mr White can do the job three times faster than he
              can. </p>
              <p>In 25 hours, White sheared 25 x 12 = 300 sheep. He was paid $25
              x 3 = $75.</p>
              <p>In 25 hours, Wong sheared 25 x 4  = 100 sheep. He was paid
              $25 x  1 = $25.</p>
              <p>Therefore, Rich paid a total of $100. </p>
              <p>Now watch what happens when they imposed a minimum wage of say
              $2 per hour. </p>
              <p>In 25 hours, White still sheared 300 sheep and he was paid
              $75.</p>
              <p>In 25 hours, Wong still sheared 100 sheep but now he would have
              been paid $50.</p>
              <p>This would have cost Rich a total of $125. </p>
              <p>But Rich did not become rich because he was stupid. So he
              decided to fire Wong and let White do all the sheep by himself.</p>
              <p>Since White can shear 12 sheep in one hour, he finished the job
              in 400/12 = 33.33 hours. He was paid 33.33 x $3 = $100. </p>
              <p>Result? Rich spent the same as before minimum wage. White gets
              more pay while Wong is jobless. Wong also lost the opportunity to
              gain experience and in time would have qualified him a higher
              salary. </p>
              <p>This is a simple illustration of how minimum wage causes
              unemployment among the low skilled. It does not help the poor. It
              makes things worse for them. </p>
