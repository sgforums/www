              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Some 
              2,000 stall holders in markets and food centres are now worried about 
              what to do next, now that their contracts are about to end under the 
              Stall Ownership Scheme.<br><br>Ms Lee Bee Wah, who chairs the Government
               Parliamentary Committee for National Development and Environment, has 
              urged authorities to solve the problem as soon as possible.<br><br>The government launched the Stall Ownership Scheme in 1994 to enable stall holders to own their stalls.<br><br>Under the scheme, they could buy the stalls on a 20-year lease at a discount.<br><br>Those
               who declined to buy their stalls could surrender them and opt for cash 
              grants or continue to rent their stalls at a revised rate instead, 
              according to National Environment Agency (NEA).<br><br>The scheme was discontinued in 1998.<br><br>For the 200 stall holders at Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, 20 years is almost up and their lease will end by May 2014.<br><br>Stall holders told Channel NewsAsia they still prefer to rent and they hope the rates can be lower than that at food courts.<br><br>They also said if they have to pay a higher rent, this may drive up food prices.<br><br>Ms
               Lee said she has received several calls for help from affected stall 
              holders. "They are worried about where to continue their business once 
              their lease ends. Some are also concerned they'll lose their regular 
              customers if they move to a new place. I have relayed these concerns to 
              NEA and I hope they can solve these problems before their lease ends."<br><br>Other
               than Ghim Moh Market and Food Centre, there are about 1,700 stall 
              holders in 14 other markets and food centres who will have to face this 
              issue over the next four years.<br><br>In the past, some stall holders 
              have petitioned the government not to tear down their markets and food 
              centres, when the property goes back to the government.<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
