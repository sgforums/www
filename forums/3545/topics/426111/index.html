              <h1>Arthur Lee Wee Guan Murder: Found Fead By Roadside In Malaysia</h1>
              <p><strong>Arthur Lee Wee Guan</strong> was a 59-year-old businessman of 
              Singapore. This is a very sad news that Arthur Lee Wee Guan was found 
              dead by a roadside in the northern Malaysian state of Kedah on Monday. 
              Mr Lee is believed to have been dead for at least six hours before his 
              body was found. PM Lee had earlier issued a statement saying, “I was 
              shocked and saddened to learn the tragic news. I had known Arthur and 
              his wife in National Junior College, and he had been helping me at the 
              Teck Ghee grassroots for many years.”</p>
              <p>Kedah police criminal investigation chief Mohd Zakaria Ahmad told ST 
              yesterday that Lee is believed to have been killed elsewhere before his 
              body was dumped. Mr.Lee had three stab wounds in his neck and was found 
              dressed only in his briefs. <strong>Arthur Lee Wee Guan</strong> was a 
              grassroots volunteer at Teck Ghee and was active in Prime Minister Lee 
              Hsien Loong’s ward in Ang Mo Kio GRC, according to the Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Miss Clara, who is the wife of 59-years old <strong>Arthur Lee Wee Guan</strong> identified and claimed the body from the Sultanah Bahiyah Hospital in 
              Alor Star yesterday after Kedah police checked his fingerprints against 
              the Singapore database. No identification documents were found on him.</p>
              <p>More investigation of the murder are continue…</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Kedah murder: 2 charged with killing Singaporean</h1>
              <p>A MAN and a woman were charged in a Malaysian court yesterday with the murder of Singaporean businessman Arthur Lee Wee Guan.</p>
              <p>Rajasekaran, 52, and Chen Jia Mei, 38, allegedly murdered Mr Lee, 59, sometime between 9am on March 20 and 2.30pm the next day.</p>
