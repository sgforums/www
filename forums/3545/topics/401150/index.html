              <p>Straits Times - 1 June 2010</p>
              <p>IN THE wake of a spate of slashings at Kallang over the weekend, another man was fatally stabbed yesterday evening at PoMo, along Selegie Road.</p>
              <p>Mr Sitoh Woon Chee, 59, was leaving for home after work at about 6.45pm when he was knifed to death. He was a part-time employee of Singapore Pools, whose job was to announce lottery results.</p>
              <p>Mr Sitoh's wife, visibly distraught and helped by a group of people, arrived at the scene at about 9pm. She was later taken into the Pools office, accompanied by a group of relatives.</p>
              <p>A company spokesman said the police were notified shortly after the incident.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times understands that the attacker had tried to escape but was eventually caught by the police. Police are still investigating the case.</p>
              <p>It is also not clear if the incident is related to the slashings at Kallang, which left one dead and three injured.</p>

              <p>Depends on how you look at it. Does more people equate to more crime being committed? But out of the percentage of crime, how many are actually committed by locals or foreigners?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No. You remembered wrongly. Crime rate is largely hovering around the same amount each year for the last 5 years. You can check the statistics online.</p>

              Ordinarily i would have agreed with you. I will quote stats, I will cite more frequent media reporting, I would state examples of crimes commited by locals. 
              <br>
              
              but today, i am struck by the sheer violence of these spate of crimes - the newspapers got that down pat - it's a mindless orgy of crimes, done by people who seem to have given up on their own lives. I dont recall ever having such intended violence before. Crimes of passion are understandable - follies in the heat of the moment. These are different - almost Clockwork Orange-sque to it. It's scary. 
              <br> 
              Yes crime rate may be the same, but the violence of it has definitely increased. Let's say, hypothetically, I wont mind being robbed of my belonging, but come on, I don't want to be stabbed while being robbed of my belonging or left for dead in a field. 
              <br>
              Why are people captivated all these cases? cos they involve a measure of violence almost unimaginable. A simple snatch thief as vs a gang of 7 attacking 4 random people? Erm, doesnt take a genius to figure out which gripes our attention more. And as for more media coverage, I say, keep them coming, so at least I'll keep my eyes peeled when walking near worker dormitories. 
              <br> 
              Do foreigners make Singapore less safe? Sure, the crime rate is constant; but the violence has gone up. I just put two and two together and it tells me what i need to know.

              <p>Lots of stabbing nowadays.</p>
              <p>Just last week, there was the first case of stabbing in my neighbourhood.    Scary sia, the noise was as if end of the world.    Ended up in bloodshed.    Foreigners involved.  </p>
              <p>Never had we so many cases of crimes and stabbing in the past when the number of foreigners is not that great as compare to present.</p>

              <p>I happen to be at Selegie Road after the stabbing incident happen around 6.50pm. Lot's of onlooker  and security guard from shopping mall was kind enough to control the crowd. Saw a man lying flat on ground with lot's of blood behind his white office shirt.</p>
              <p><strong>I spoke to a onlooker, the man mention that he has been standing around for 20min and no ambulance has arrive so far.What's happening to the ambulance ?????????????????????????????. </strong></p>
              <p>5min later the first police car arrive follow by second police car. Still waiting for ambulance. I felt very angry and hope that an emergency reponse systems is avialiable to located the nearest GP clinic doctor to attend to the injury.</p>
              <p>But i am glad to know that 2 courageous man is chasing after the murderer.</p>

              <p><br> Ordinarily i would have agreed with you. I will quote stats, I will
              cite more frequent media reporting, I would state examples of
              crimes commited by locals.<br> but today, i am struck by the sheer violence of these spate of
              crimes - the newspapers got that down pat - it's a mindless orgy of
              crimes, done by people who seem to have given up on their own
              lives. I dont recall ever having such intended violence before.
              Crimes of passion are understandable - follies in the heat of the
              moment. These are different - almost Clockwork Orange-sque to it.
              It's scary.<br> Yes crime rate may be the same, but the violence of it has
              definitely increased. Let's say, hypothetically, I wont mind being
              robbed of my belonging, but come on, I don't want to be stabbed
              while being robbed of my belonging or left for dead in a
              field.<br> Why are people captivated all these cases? cos they involve a
              measure of violence almost unimaginable. A simple snatch thief as
              vs a gang of 7 attacking 4 random people? Erm, doesnt take a genius
              to figure out which gripes our attention more. And as for more
              media coverage, I say, keep them coming, so at least I'll keep my
              eyes peeled when walking near worker dormitories.<br> Do foreigners make Singapore less safe? Sure, the crime rate is
              constant; but the violence has gone up. I just put two and two
              together and it tells me what i need to know.</p>

              <p>You have to take into consideration the psychological mindset of the accused. Drug, substance abuse, mental state and of course level of desperation plays its part.</p>
              <p>As for violence, it has always been around. Just whether someone with a camera happens to be on scene or not and whether there are bigger news events around to give priority to report. You can also put into consideration the level of violence that the media portray through its outlets today. Whether those are based on real life events or just pure fantasy thoughts on script. I'll leave it to you to make that deduction.</p>
