              You know why I say the easiest way to catch rogue employers, rogue agents, illegal foreign workers and illegal aliens at the lobby of MOM-WPSC at Tanjong Pagar Complex? Because.... 
                  
              1.   Many non-Malaysian foreign workers exceeded their 14 days stay in Singapore once they entered Singapore and the employer or agent didn't go to ICA to extend their stay in Singapore. And as long as the work permit has yet to be process though the foreign workers are awaiting to be call to process their work permit while sitting down at MOM-WPSC lobby, they are still considered overstayers and working illegally for their employers.
                  
              2.   Many non-Malaysian foreign workers and Malaysian themselves are working illegally without knowing that their employers applied for the work permit with MOM a few days before their social visit pass expired. That cause them to be technically overstayers and illegal workers.
                  
              3.   Though when the employers have received the letter from MOM that they can send their foreign workers to process the work permits with the stapulated period before it expired, many employers failed to do so with the excuse that the foreign workers were busy and they have no time to go down to MOM to process the work permit.
                  
              4.   This is the worst thing that can happen within MOM. Regardless of all the abovementioned, the counter officers didn't bother and just passed them to process the work permit reason being they have quotas to meet. And lastly because immigration matters doesn't concern them so they don't bother, they simply passed the process of work permit regardless of the abovementioned situation of the illegal foreign workers and overstayers.

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the serious matter about loopholes within MOM work permit application system is the work permit documents during the verification and registration of their work permit before they proceed to have their finger prints, is the authorised signature from the company. The counter officers wouldn't know whether the company authorised signature is genuine or forgery.  The authorise signatures name and signature samples from the company  are not programme within the computer system. To check those authorise signatures the counter officers need to refer to the files manually and those files are not updated. usually, the counter officers will just passed the documents during verification and registration process of the work permits.</div>
