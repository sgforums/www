              <p><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">ewenboey</span> | <span class="provider org">SingaporeScene</span> – <abbr title="2011-07-15T05:48:32Z">Fri, Jul 15, 2011</abbr></cite></p>
              <p>"I will kill you when I hunt you down" and "I will rape you ladies 
              wen I get hold of you" are some of the threats that have been made on 
              the woman behind the Geylang Checker website.</p>
              <p>The woman, who only wants to be known as Angie, has been running the 
              "whistle-blowing" website since last July to monitor "cheating men in 
              Geylang".</p>
              <p>However, the nasty e-mail messages have not deterred Angie.</p>
              <p>In an e-mail interview with <em>my paper</em>, she revealed that she 
              has assembled a team of more than 50 volunteers, or "checkers" as she 
              calls them, to conduct "hourly patrols of Geylang streets" every day.</p>
              <p>These volunteers are mostly female.</p>
              <p>They snap photographs of boyfriends, husbands, male relatives and colleagues who solicit the services of prostitutes.</p>
              <p>The checkers receive assignments or tip-offs from women who want to find out if their men have been to the red-light district.</p>
              <p>Angie, who is in her early 30s and works for "one of the big five 
              auditing firms" here, confessed to being fearful of her life and the 
              lives of her volunteers.</p>
              <p>"Safety is a concern, but helping Singaporean women takes a higher 
              priority," said the woman whose family is unaware of her activities.</p>
              <p><strong>Her motivation to set up the site</strong></p>
              <p>She started the website to help other women avoid the experiences she had been through.</p>
              <p>In May last year, she caught her boyfriend stepping out of a brothel in Geylang and saw him kiss a woman on his way out.</p>
              <p>"I didn't believe it when my friend told me, so I took a cab down and
               waited outside," recalled Angie, who cut ties with him immediately.</p>
              <p>"We had been together for six years. I deleted his contact numbers and warned him not to look for me any more," she said.</p>
              <p>To date, there have been 43 postings on the website, featuring 
              photographs of men and women and recruitment ads for more volunteers.</p>
              <p>She said that their team has so far received 30 requests and has exposed 15 cases of cheating.</p>
              <p>The operations were initially conducted by Angie alone, but she 
              managed to rope in two friends whose boyfriends had also cheated on them
               to take photos surreptitiously in Geylang.</p>
              <p>She admitted to not having a long-term plan initially as well.</p>
              <p><strong>How they check up on the men</strong></p>
              <p>The initial trio of volunteers were able to take photos without any 
              suspicion as they were "dressed formally" and were thought to be 
              tourists.</p>
              <p>Armed with cameras that "are not well-furnished, the volunteers are 
              also not trained professionally or skilled in martial arts, but they 
              have "guts and strategy".</p>
              <p>The team also grew bigger when people found out about it through word of mouth and through their call to arms on the site.</p>
              <p>The volunteers include lawyers, doctors, junior-college and university students, office workers and housewives.</p>
              <p>Men have also stepped forward. Citing them as "our secret weapon", 
              Angie revealed that one of them works in the army and helps train the 
              volunteers with "expertise in guerilla warfare".</p>
              <p>Taught by the army expert, the volunteers work with two teams -- one as a decoy while the other snaps photos.</p>
              <p>Angie told the paper, "We have also planned our escape route. We know which hotels we can hide in if we're being chased."</p>
              <p><strong>Volunteers in some close shaves</strong></p>
              <p>However, she admitted that there have been some close shaves. There 
              was an incident, she recalled, when a female volunteer was caught taking
               pictures and chased by two men.</p>
              <p>They cornered her and smashed her camera on the ground. Luckily for 
              her, the police arrived and the men fled before they could "make 
              advances on her".</p>
              <p>Security experts the same paper spoke to commended the intentions of 
              the volunteers, but warned that the best results may not be achieved.</p>
              <p>James Loh, 39, owner of SG Investigators, said that cheating spouses may not stop his errant ways even after being confronted.</p>
              <p>He added that the photos taken by the volunteers may even "jeopardise
               the collection of evidence that can be used by the court". Such 
              evidence is required for settling divorce claims.</p>
              <p>The investigator of more than eight years said that only the evidence
               collected by professional and licenced sources can be used.</p>
              <p>Angie, however, is not deterred.</p>
              <p>She wants the website to become a "whistle-blower", and her goal is 
              to create a site that is "a complete deterrent to cheating among 
              Singaporean men".</p>
              <p>The single, who has not dated anyone since her break-up last year, is still keen to pursue a relationship.</p>
              <p>"Yes, trust (in men) has been lost, but I want to see how my future 
              partner can help me regain this trust so that Geylang Checker may be 
              passed on to the next hurting woman."</p>
