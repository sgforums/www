              plans to curb milking of flat sellers</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Mavis Toh</p>
              <p>PROPERTY firms with moneylending arms that do a roaring business are 
              now putting the brakes on their ventures.</p>
              <p>Their activities came under the spotlight last Tuesday when 
              Minister of National Development Mah Bow Tan said in Parliament that his
               ministry is drafting measures to stop moneylenders from exploiting 
              cash-strapped flat sellers.</p>
              <p>Property agency owners and moneylenders told The Straits 
              Times there are about 10 realty firms that hold moneylending licences 
              and operate credit arms along with their property businesses.</p>
              <p>Moneylenders' Association of Singapore president David Poh 
              estimates that there are at least another 30 individual property agents 
              who are also licensed moneylenders.</p>
              <p>There are currently 260 licensed moneylenders in Singapore, 
              up from 173 in 2008 and 169 in 2007.</p>
              <p>The draw? Licensed moneylenders are currently free to set 
              interest rates for loans above $3,000.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Estate agents shouldn't work with moneylenders</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Monday's report, 'Realty firms halt lending activities'.</p>
              <p>As reported, there are currently some real estate agencies 
              and agents who are licensed moneylenders. Although the moneylending 
              business is typically constituted as a separate legal entity, the 
              individuals behind it are essentially the same as those of the real 
              estate group.</p>
              <p>At present, there is no prohibition against a real estate 
              agent holding a moneylender's licence and vice versa. However, when 
              either scenario occurs, the likelihood of collusion between the credit 
              companies and estate agents becomes real.</p>
              <p>Already, the report mentioned 'black sheep' moneylenders cum
               estate agents who have abused the trust of cash-strapped HDB sellers 
              and exploited them. The sellers who had hoped for a breather were 
              smacked with exorbitant interest rates and possibly robbed of the lion's
               share of their sales proceeds in other 'hidden costs'.</p>
              <p>Singapore Accredited Estate Agencies (SAEA) urges estate 
              agencies and agents who are licensed moneylenders to exercise caution 
              and ethical conduct in their professional relationships with their 
              clients who are HDB sellers. Although legal, it is not advisable for the
               two businesses to mix.</p>
              <p>We do not support the practice of estate agents working with
               moneylenders and referring their clients to them for introducer's fees 
              or to take advantage of their clients' financial plight.</p>
              <p>Estate agents should not introduce HDB sellers to 
              moneylenders for a fee as this is not within the ambit of their job and 
              the real estate brokerage service rendered. In fact, estate agents who 
              do so stand in potential breach of fundamental ethical obligations to 
              their clients and may be perceived as lining their own pockets rather 
              than acting in the interests of their clients.</p>
              <p>SAEA will not hesitate to act against such agents should 
              they be accredited.</p>
              <p>Instead, according to the HDB resale checklist for sellers, 
              estate agents should, among other duties, help HDB sellers work out 
              their estimated sales proceeds before selling, and upon resale, sellers 
              must discharge their outstanding mortgage loan and refund the Central 
              Provident Fund (CPF) monies used to buy the flat with interest to their 
              CPF accounts. Estate agents should also advise sellers to plan for their
               next home before they sell their flat, and should the sellers wish to 
              buy another HDB flat, they will need to know if they are eligible for an
               HDB or bank loan.</p>
              <p>If HDB sellers are in dire financial need, there are other 
              avenues of help to which estate agents can refer their clients so they 
              do not lose the roof over their heads.</p>

              <div class="kicker">ERRANT PROPERTY DEALS</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Check lawyers first</h1>
              <p>I REFER to yesterday's report, 'Govt steps in to curb errant property 
              agents', and the response by Dr Tan Tee Khoon of Singapore Accredited 
              Estate Agencies ('Estate agents shouldn't work with moneylenders'; 
              Thursday) to Monday's report, 'Realty firms halt lending activities'.</p>
              <p>While estate agents appear to be the culprits singled out, 
              should the authorities be more concerned that if lawyers continue to 
              draft such agreements and have these caveats frivolously lodged, the 
              problems will persist?</p>
              <p>In the first place, the situation should be such that 
              lawyers decline to work with moneylenders and estate agents when 
              requested to draft such agreements and lodge such caveats.</p>
              <p>Are not these lawyers duty-bound to check the validity of 
              their clients' claims instead?</p>
              <p>Should not such lawyers have advised their clients 
              accordingly of the principle in Rule 40 of the Legal Profession 
              (Professional Conduct) Rules?</p>
              <p>Rule 40 states as follows: 'An advocate and solicitor shall 
              in appropriate cases evaluate with a client whether the consequence of a
               matter justifies the expense or the risk involved.'</p>
              <p>Will we eventually see many negative sales in the property 
              market because of the unnecessary litigation involved in such caveats as
               many lawyers draft such agreements, generate litigation and lodge 
              caveats?</p>
