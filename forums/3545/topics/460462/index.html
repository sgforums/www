              <p>IT WAS disappointing that there was no 
              mention of tray-return design in the new hawker centres ("3 towns to get
               new hawker centres"; Sunday).</p>
              <p>We could be missing a great opportunity to start afresh with a 
              fundamental change in hawker centre design that will be a model for 
              others to follow.</p>
              <p>Will there be centralised tray-return areas that provide abundant 
              tray-return racks that are made inaccessible to cats and birds?</p>
              <p>Will there be centralised washing areas so that hawkers<span id="adv_hiliteText" class="adv_class" style="background-color: transparent;"> need </span>not wash cutlery and utensils next to uncooked food in the confined space that they have?</p>

              <p><strong>Push for tray return to start at 9 food centres</strong><br> <span class="update">By Tan Qiuyi | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 03 November 2012 1251 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A renewed
               push to get patrons to clear their own trays will kick off with a first
               batch of nine hawker centres from this month.<br><br>The hawker centre at Block 726 Clementi West Street 2 will be the first to start the tray return initiative on 11 November.<br><br>The
               other food centres -- North Bridge Road Food Centre, Zion Riverside 
              Food Centre, Tiong Bahru Market, Kallang Estate Food Centre, Block 137 
              Tampines Street 24, Block 628 Ang Mo Kio Avenue 4, Block 16 Bedok South,
               and Block 254 Jurong East Street 24 -- will follow over the next three 
              months.<br><br>Authorities said the move is an effort towards building a more gracious society in Singapore.<br><br>Dirty dishes left on the tables are a common sight at food centres all over the country. <br><br>But
               there is a possibility of change to come -- at least at nine hawker 
              centres. These include popular ones in the city, as well as several 
              others in the heartlands in the western, northern and eastern parts of 
              the island.<br><br>Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Dr 
              Vivian Balakrishnan, made the announcement at the launch of the Clean 
              and Green 2013 campaign on Saturday.<br><br>He said: "The objective is 
              to make tray return a default, to make it something which we all do out 
              of habit, and to ensure that peer pressure always exists to keep us all 
              doing the right thing."<br><br>One way to make it work, said Dr Balakrishnan, is to have tray-return facilities at all food centres.<br><br>The
               National Environment Agency said food centres will be retrofitted with 
              facilities designed to make it convenient for customers to deposit their
               trays -- for example, racks and trolleys that can take different tray 
              sizes and stacked crockery.<br><br>There have been several tray-return campaigns in the past, but these have not really taken off. <br><br>Dr
               Balakrishnan said it is not just about having the right infrastructure 
              to make tray return convenient and easy -- what is needed here is a 
              mindset change. <br><br>"It's not just about being clean in a sterile 
              sense of the word, but clean because it reflects us, our values, our 
              consideration for each other, our responsibility and stewardship of the 
              environment, of our homes and the environment outside our homes," he 
              added.<br><br>"It will be ingrained as part and parcel of our habits, 
              it's something we do in schools, it's something we do in national 
              service, it's something we do in our hawker centres, it's something we 
              do at home. This becomes part and parcel of our way of life -- that's 
              really what we're trying to achieve."<br><br>Deputy Prime Minister 
              Tharman Shanmugaratnam said: "I echo minister Vivian Balakrishnan's call
               that Singapore needs to turn from a "cleaned city" into a "clean city".
               <br><br>He added that every individual here -- citizens, transient 
              workers, even the tourists -- should play his or her part to exercise 
              graciousness and consideration.<br><br>The tray-return campaign is expected to roll out to all 107 food centres in Singapore over the next two years. <br><br>- CNA/al</span></span></p>

              <p>Just because the frog from the well living in the ivory tower made noise about keeping, clearing trays, the PLP people getting in the action to please him. Â  Â Next month onwards they will implement clearing of trays in some hawker centres. Â  Â </p>
              <p>Might as well let us also clean the utensils, plates....... wipe table then they can save money to hire cleaners. Â Â </p>
              <p>In time to come cleaners will not be needed. Â  Â </p>
              <p>How much does the arrogant frog who kicks a fuss on clearing trays know about the daily living of people??? Â  Really see himit no up lah. Â  Â Bo lor yong, only know how to get in more money and please himitself.</p>

              <p>I agreed with SJS6638 that it is an idea thought out by some idiots that expects peasants to return the tray themselves as part of their cost cutting measures.</p>
              <p>It is like the free newspapers on the bus idea a few years ago. (We know how long that stupid ideas last.)</p>
              <p>Even before they try out the ideas, they already wasted money in setting up the stand for tray return.</p>

              <p>My Extreme Xenophobic view of the issue:</p>
              <p>- People clear tray and disk after meal.</p>
              <p>- Less cleaners needed and employed.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>- Cheng Hu get cheaper quotation from cleaning company.</p>
              <p>- Monthly maintenance fee collected from hawkers still the same. (Citing inflation as the reason or long time never increase which is the ultimate stupid reason)</p>
              <p>- Employ inspectors to catch people for not returning tray and disk and impose a fine for them.</p>
              <p>- W$n W$n situation and income opportunity for the cheng hu in charge.</p>

              <p><strong>Kopitiam partners grassroots organisations to expand "tray return" programme</strong><br> <span class="update">By Sharon See | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 11 November 2012 2033 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The "tray
               return" programme is set to expand with the Jurong and Yuhua 
              constituencies now partnering Kopitiam food court to encourage 
              Singaporeans to return their trays.<br><br>The food court at JCube in 
              Jurong East now has four tray collection points and it is the first such
               tie-up between a grassroots organisation and a food court operator.<br><br>Kopitiam
               said it has introduced tray return stations at several other food 
              courts over the last six months but response has been "lukewarm".<br><br>It hopes this tie up with Jurong GRC and Yuhua SMC grassroots organisations will allow them to reach out to more people.<br><br>Kopitiam's
               corporate communications manager, Goh Wee Ling, said: "Tapping on the 
              Jurong GRC's resources, we find that we are able to leverage on that to 
              create more awareness of the tray return program. Publicity wise, 
              grassroots are able to reach out to residents easier than us. They have 
              an grassroots office in every location and could help us persist in that
               sense."<br><br>It hopes the visibility of the tray return stations and ease of use can encourage more customers to use them.<br><br>Goh
               said: "It's not so much about saving manpower, but more of working 
              effectively, more effective resources. Given the size of this outlet and
               customer turnover being so high, it's nearly impossible to say 'okay, 
              today we are going to do away with one cleaner', but it's more about 
              tapping on what we have right now and to maximise the effectiveness and 
              clean faster."<br><br>MP for Jurong GRC, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, said: 
              "Let's try to do it by way of encouraging and by way of example. I think
               once a few people start, more will follow. Kopitiam is taking the 
              initiative here and it intends to do so at its other outlets as well. I 
              hope that can be sustained, so you don't need incentives for everything.
               So let's try our best. We're basically decent folks, Singaporeans, so 
              I'm sure we can do much better."<br><br>- CNA/ck</span></span></p>
