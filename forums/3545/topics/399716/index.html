              <p>A DINING experience at JPot has left me wondering whether the 
              restaurant is first rate or otherwise.</p>
              <p>I had lunch there and was interested in ordering some 
              Pacific Clams. However, a friend who had previously ordered the same 
              item advised me that the clams may not be very fresh. We then requested 
              for our clams to be left unopened. The service staff informed us that 
              the restaurant had opened up all the fresh clams which they received in 
              the morning and that there were no unopened ones.</p>
              <p>We were told that the clams for this season were very sandy,
               hence as a service to all patrons, the restaurant had opened the clams 
              to wash them before serving. This would have been fine if the clams were
               opened and washed just before serving. However, if this was done in the
               morning when the clams first arrived at the restaurant, they would have
               been dead for hours before serving.</p>
              <p>I wonder if washing the clams that way would affect their 
              freshness or if it is even necessary to do so as soaking them in salt 
              water would get rid of the sand.</p>

              <p>I've been to jpot so many times, I never knew they served pacific clams!?!?</p>
              <p>Anyway, personally, I don't recommend eating clams at steamboat restaurants, its a 50/50 thing. I would say I have a strong stomach, but clams always bring me to my knees literally. 9/10 times I had clams, I had serious food poisoning, that even my mum doesn't take chances anymore, because a few times I was down coz she didn't cook it properly.</p>
              <p>For one thing, you dunno how clean the clams are, you dunno how clean the shells are, you are boiling it in soup, literally you are washing it in there. If you really want to eat it, overcook it.</p>
