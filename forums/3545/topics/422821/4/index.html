              <p>Low pay, high living cost is already eating into everyone's bank account. My friend who married 1 or 2 years ago is currently digging into his savings to sustain his family needs. He has also recently bought a flat, his wife is not working, if he's out of a job, he would be in trouble.</p>
              <p>But some people do save but can it beat inflation and CPF interest is also on the low side.</p>

              <p>Terminal illness means going to die, keep so much money in CPF for?</p>
              <p>This is like a no brainer.</p>
              <p>I stand corrected, maybe you can do a nether world banking transfer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CPF locked up is as good as no CPF. Perhaps you are those few people who can feel good looking at your CPF statement (but you can't use) and knowing that your HDB cost a 1/4 of a million (but you can't sell). I think you can derive pleasure from staring into Jade restaurant (Fullerton) and imagine yourself actually eating the Chinese delicacies. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>CPF squandered is still money you own and squandered before your last days on earth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The amount of money made for the lower wager earners in our population is insufficient to make ends meet and expect people to save money? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Those who can afford to save are those high wage earners. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>just take it that the money is locked up in the bank.  still got interest.   If you must spend every cent in your bank, you take out your cpf also the same. all gone in a year.</p>
