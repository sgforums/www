              <h3 class="date_story">Oct 26, 2010</h3>
              <p>SYDNEY - A PLANNED multi-billion dollar merger of the Sydney and 
              Singapore stock exchanges faced a fierce political backlash on Tuesday, 
              as a senior Treasury official warned the deal also posed 'regulatory 
              issues'.</p>
              <p>Greens leader Bob Brown, a key ally of Australia's fragile 
              ruling coalition, expressed strong opposition over Singapore's 
              'appalling' rights record, while a maverick cross-bencher said he didn't
               want to live in a country of 'serfs'.</p>
              <p>The vocal objections raised further questions over the 
              US$8.2 (S$10.7 billion) US dollar merger, which needs approval by both 
              Singapore and Australia, where it must overcome a number of hurdles. The
               move, scheduled to complete in mid-2011, aims to create the world's 
              fifth biggest exchange with a market capitalisation of about US$12.3 
              billion as a regional trading hub to rival Hong Kong, Shanghai and 
              Tokyo.</p>
              <p>The deal will be studied by Australia's securities, foreign 
              investment and competition watchdogs, as well as the central bank, and 
              must be approved by Treasurer Wayne Swan.</p>
              <p>Parliament - where Prime Minister Julia Gillard holds just a
               one-vote majority in the lower house - will then have to vote on 
              amending the Corporations Act to allow ownership of more than 15 percent
               in the ASX bourse.</p>
              <p>Analysts say one significant hurdle could be the Singapore 
              government's large stake in the SGX bourse, which could raise sovereign 
              ownership concerns. Jim Murphy, markets executive for the Treasury, said
               officials were yet to receive submissions and it was too early to 
              comment on whether it could be approved. 'There are a number of 
              regulatory issues that need to be worked through,' he said.</p>

              <h1>MPs line up to oppose ASX merger</h1>
              <p class="author">By online business reporter Michael Janda</p>
              <p class="first">The proposed merger between the ASX and Singapore's 
              stock exchange is already under threat after a wide range of non-Labor 
              MPs expressed opposition to the deal.</p>
              <p>The planned tie-up must not only be reviewed by several regulatory 
              agencies, but will also need to be approved by the Federal Government 
              and the finely balanced Australian Parliament.</p>
              <p>Independent MP Bob Katter was quick in declaring his opposition to 
              the merger.</p>
              <p>"I intend - I'm determined - to tenaciously oppose it, and I expect 
              that all of the crossbenchers, every single one of us on the 
              crossbenches, will be doing the same thing," he said.</p>
              <p>Greens leader Bob Brown also came out against the planned deal, 
              citing the Singaporean government's significant stake in the stock 
              exchange, and the nation's poor human rights record as reasons to reject
               the merger.</p>
              <p>"The Singapore government put the phone down and hung Nguyen Van with
               no further compassion or consideration of Australia's opposition to the
               death penalty," he told reporters.</p>
              <p>"Now the phone's ringing in the opposite direction to have the 
              Singapore stock exchange - with a 15 per cent government interest, I 
              might add - take over the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney. We should
               tell them, 'nothing doing'."</p>
              <p>The two exchanges have done substantial work to get the deal to this 
              stage, but comments from senior Coalition politicians show they may be 
              facing their toughest hurdle: securing the votes they will need to have 
              the merger approved by the Federal Parliament.</p>
              <p>The Nationals' Senator Barnaby Joyce says he is concerned about the 
              potential impact on Sydney's status as a regional financial hub, given 
              that the merged company will be run from Singapore.</p>
              <p>"Obviously, in the discussion, people in the town of Sydney will have
               some clear questions to ask about if there's a removal of the commerce 
              that's involved with the Stock Exchange to another country, with the 
              removal of the merchant banks with it, where does that leave Sydney?"</p>
              <p>The Coalition's shadow treasurer, Joe Hockey, says it is up to Wayne 
              Swan to explain how it is in Australia's national interest for the ASX 
              to be controlled by a Singaporean company.</p>
              <p>"We welcome investment, but we also have to make decisions about a 
              monopoly," he said.</p>
              <p>"I mean, the ASX is effectively a monopoly and, therefore, as a 
              monopoly, is it in our national interest to have, not only a foreign 
              exchange own it, but a foreign exchange with a substantial shareholding 
              from its own government."</p>
              <p>However, the Treasurer says it is a matter for the regulators at this
               stage, not the Government - and there are plenty of regulators who will
               be scrutinising the deal.</p>
              <p>The Foreign Investment Review Board, the Australian Securities and 
              Investments Commission, the Reserve Bank and the Australian Competition 
              and Consumer Commission will all be having a look.</p>
              <p>If they recommend approval, it will then fall to Treasurer Wayne Swan
               and the Government to decide whether to sign-off.</p>
              <p>Even if Mr Swan gives the green light, the Parliament will have to 
              approve a change in regulations in the Corporations Act to allow the 
              deal to proceed, because there is currently a 15 per cent limit on the 
              stake any one party can hold in the ASX.</p>
              <p>That is no fait accompli given the fragile numbers in both the House 
              and the Senate and the hostility expressed towards the planned merger by
               many MPs.</p>
              <p>Mr Swan has told Parliament the Government will make sure the deal is
               in the national interest.</p>
              <p>"Australia rigorously applies a national interest test, in foreign 
              government investment and significant private sector investment, and of 
              course this particularly applies to a proposal of this scale and this 
              importance," he said.</p>
              <h2>Regulatory risk</h2>
              <p>The head of the Stockbrokers' Association, David Horsfield, says that
               is why ASX shares are trading so far below the offer price of around 
              $48 a share.</p>
              <p>"It's the regulatory risk that people are building into the share 
              price at the moment," he said.</p>
              <p>But he says the deal does seem to offer significant benefits to both 
              exchanges.</p>
              <p>"There's no doubt that the cost efficiencies by the two exchanges 
              coming together seem to be quite significant."</p>
              <p>Share analyst Andrew Hills from Wilson HTM says the deal is 
              attractive to ASX shareholders.</p>
              <p>"It's a fantastic deal for ASX shareholders. I mean, the premium of 
              this transaction values ASX at a 37 per cent premium to its previous 
              close," he explained.</p>
              <p>However, he says the real benefit to shareholders is much lower, 
              because the company would be taxed in Singapore and unable to give 
              franked dividends.</p>
              <p>"Current ASX shareholders will not receive franking credits in the 
              merged company, so that reduces the premium by about 20 per cent or so, 
              depending on how you value franking credits," he added.</p>
              <p>Investors seem to have cottoned onto that, with ASX shares trading at
               $39.48 by 1:27pm (AEDT), after hitting highs of almost $44 yesterday.</p>
              <p>ASX shares had dipped even lower this morning, to $38.18 by 12:17pm, 
              after the comments by Senator Brown and other MPs.</p>
              <p>Investors also seem to think Singapore's exchange is overpaying, with
               its shares falling around 6 per cent yesterday, and another 2 per cent 
              today.</p>

              <p>i don't know much about Aust domestics economy....but personally i would like the merger to go thru for several reasons.....</p>
              <p>Australia should asked this question....Would they like to see SGX be bought over by rising China HSX. Australia would see that they are once again facing the geopolitics of a single power dominating S.E.A........</p>
              <p>The merger would help move Singapore further south and financially least influence by rising China. -- An Example..... Given recent dispute between Japan and China...China is holding Japan hostage by limiting Rare Earth Export.</p>
              <p>The reality of our region remain unchanged since WWII be it military or economics expansion.</p>
              <p>2nd reason why i hope the merger is successful it would help to channel the surge inflow of foreign funds into both Exchange and park their funds in investment in financial instruments rather than Property and loans.</p>

              <p>the merger bid will face a lot of political infighting among Aussies if it went through forcefully...there are seemingly too many obstacles and differences to overcome and not just pure investment ambitions...this would hilt badly against the new Aussie PM position, and another wave of Aussie political leadership would affect the new deal...looking further....not only losing money in the end, we may have to leave with disgrace and strained bilateral relationships between the two countries....</p>
              <p>of course, and unless you have great majority Aussie's support to think otherwise other than bruised ego to the takeover....</p>
