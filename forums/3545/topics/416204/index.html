              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Labour 
              Chief Lim Swee Say said he would not be pushing for every company to 
              match the two-and-a-half months year-end bonus for civil servants, 
              announced on Wednesday<br><br>He explained performances across different
               industries would be different.<br><br>But he added that feedback from 
              union members indicate that overall wage increases this year are likely 
              to be higher than those of last year, with companies paying on the 
              average half a month more in terms of year-end bonus.<br><br>Speaking to
               the media after an NTUC learning journey to Sakae Sushi, he said total 
              wages for workers in companies which are doing better this year, should 
              be higher than those in 2009.<br><br>But how much of these wages go into
               wage increases and variable bonuses would vary across companies and 
              organisations.<br><br>He said what's important to note was that the 
              flexible wage system has worked very well for Singapore up to now and 
              the labour movement hopes it will continue to function well in the 
              future.<br><br>For this, the NTUC Chief emphasised that it's important 
              to maintain trust.<br><br>This meant that it's important for employers 
              to share the gains and improvements in performance with their workers if
               their companies are doing well.<br><br>In this way, all parties will 
              strengthen the wage system in good and bad times.<br><br>He said: "So 
              far, on the whole, most companies are doing much better than last year. <br><br>"(As
               such), some of them decided to (increase wages) because of the keener 
              competition and tighter labour market. <br><br>"In some cases they are 
              restoring the monthly variable component (MVC) because some (employers) 
              did cut MVCs during the downturn. <br><br>"In (other) cases they are 
              going to pay higher bonuses".<br><br>As for the labour market situation,
               Mr Lim said he believe it would remain tight.<br><br>The government 
              also announced on Wednesday that it had again decided to defer the 
              salary adjustments for Administrative Officers, Political, Judicial and 
              Statutory Appointment holders.<br><br>Mr Lim said: "What we worry about 
              is not whether our salary will be restored... (but) how we are going to 
              sustain the growth for the next three, five to 10 years, and how we keep
               ensuring that the employment growth will be healthy and strong so that 
              there will be more good paying jobs for Singaporeans."<br><br>He added 
              it was important for every Singaporean, regardless of age group, 
              education and skills levels, to be able to pursue a productive career 
              and lead a better life.<br><br>"That is really the pre-occupation of the
               political leaders as well as the senior civil servants," he said. <br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
