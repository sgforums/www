              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: From next
               month, new hawker stallholders will no longer be allowed to sublet or 
              assign their stalls to another person.<br><br>Senior Minister of State 
              for Environment and Water Resources, Grace Fu, said hawker stalls were 
              set up to provide Singaporeans with an opportunity to run their own 
              small business. As such, stalls should be personally run and not be used
               for profiteering.<br><br>Speaking in Mandarin during the debate on her 
              ministry's budget in Parliament, Ms Fu said existing stallholders will 
              have a three-year grace period to adjust to these new conditions.<br><br>She
               added that controlling subletting and assignment of stalls will help to
               stabilise rentals, reduce costs for stallholders and achieve food price
               stability.<br><br>The issue of hawkers transferring their stall 
              tenancies for a high price has been an ongoing concern among customers, 
              who worry about the impact on food prices. The practice is believed to 
              have started around 10 years ago.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia reported in 
              November 2011 that at least four stalls at a hawker centre in Kovan have
               changed hands for fees ranging between S$250,000 and S$300,000.<br><br>However,
               Ms Fu acknowledged that it is not easy for a stallholder to operate a 
              stall for a full day. Thus, the National Environment Agency (NEA) will 
              permit joint tenancies, and do away with the requirement that each stall
               can only have a single tenant.<br><br>NEA will also not set a reserve 
              rent when tendering out vacant stalls. This means that even if the 
              bidding price is below market price, NEA will allocate the vacant stall 
              to the highest bidder as long as there are competitive bids.<br><br>Ms 
              Fu also announced the locations where new hawker centres will be built 
              within the next five years. They are Bukit Panjang, Yishun, Pasir Ris, 
              Jurong West, Admiralty, Tampines and Punggol.<br><br>She said: "In the 
              year ahead, we will be consulting closely with members and grassroots on
               the new centres that will be built. Their design and development should
               be informed by the views of the people they will serve as hawker 
              centres are more than just places for affordable food.<br><br>"They are 
              also important common spaces that cultivate the sense of community upon 
              which environmental stewardship depends. Like schools, parks, 
              playgrounds and community centres, they are places where Singaporeans 
              from different walks of life encounter one another, share the same space
               and experience things together."<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
