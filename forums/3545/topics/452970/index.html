              <p>His love literally set her on fire.<br><br>Hsiung Wei Ling, 43, died on 
              Friday night after allegedly being set on fire by her ex-lover and 
              suffering first degree burns to 86 per cent of her body, reported <em>Shin Min Daily News</em>. <br><br>According to<em> <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_803401.html">The Straits Times</a> (ST)</em>,
               Hsiung was staying with her aunt’s family in Sengkang after recently 
              ending a three-year relationship. Before that, she had been living 
              together with her boyfriend, said to be in his 40s, in Hougang.<br><br>Things took a tragic turn when her ex-boyfriend, known as “Ah Biao”, tracked her down on Friday morning. <br><br><em>Shin Min</em> reported that witnesses saw him splashing kerosene against the door of 
              the four-room flat on the 14th floor of Compassvale Link Blk 206B. He 
              allegedly barged in after Hsiung’s cousin Phua Duan Kai, 32, opened the 
              door upon hearing a commotion.<br><br>It’s not clear what happened next 
              but neighbours said they heard loud screams and saw smoke coming out of 
              the unit. Phua suffered second-degree burns to his arms and legs when he
               tried to save Hsiung from a fire. He is now hospitalized at the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+General+Hospital&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore General Hospital</a> (SGH) and is in critical condition. <br><br>The suspect also suffered burns on his right lower arm and leg in the process. <br><br>SCDF firefighters, who arrived within minutes of the call received at 8:30am, told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> the fire had already been put out when they reached the scene. Only the main door of the flat was burnt.<br><br>A spokesman added that all three casualties were sent to the SGH in a conscious state.<br><br>Phua’s father, who did not wish to be named, told <em>ST</em> his niece had returned to Singapore from Malaysia a few days ago as she wanted to vote in the Hougang by-election on Saturday.<br><br>The
               63-year-old had spotted Hsiung’s ex-boyfriend at a stairwell near his 
              flat as he was leaving for work on Friday morning but did not think much
               of it.<br><br>“I should have asked her to take care, or called back earlier when I saw Ah Biao,” he was quoted as saying.<br><br>Police say they have arrested a 44-year-old man for murder in connection with the case.</p>
