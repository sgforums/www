              <p>Shin Min Daily News - 7 hrs 3 mins ago</p>
              <p>Marina Bay Sands (MBS) casino is refusing to pay a woman her jackpot winnings of more than $410,000.</p>
              <p>Mdm Zhu Yun Ping (50, hawker) had visited the casino with some foreign friends and her store helpers at about 5am on this Tuesday, 18 October.</p>
              <p>She described what happened to reporters, "I was playing on this jackpot machine until 6am and my stored value card had already accumulated about $800 in winnings. Suddenly, I struck the Bonus Cash jackpot of $416,742.11."</p>
              <p>At the time, Mdm Zhu was confused with what happened until a bystander explained to her that she had struck a jackpot prize. Many other casino patrons also came up to her to congratulate her on the win.</p>
              <p>She continued, "Soon after, the manager of the casino came up to me and told me that the jackpot machine had malfunctioned. The manager explained to me that the machine's top prize is a car, and that its highest cash payout is only $50,000, so I could not have struck that Bonus Cash prize. The manager also explained that I could get $258,962 if I decide to sell the car back to the dealer."</p>
              <p>Mdm Zhu refused to settle with the manager's explanation and insisted that she was entitled to her win, which the jackpot machine clearly displayed.</p>
              <p>At that time, a casino patron had also stepped forward to help her by taking a photo of the displayed cash prize as evidence. The man was however, stopped by casino staff who warned him that photo-taking is not allowed in the casino. The staff then asked the man to hand over his phone and indicated that they will be deleting the photo. The man was then escorted out of the casino.</p>
              <p>Mdm Zhu has lodged a complaint with the Casino Regulatory Authority of Singapore, which is currently investigating the case. The police have also explained to her the forms of legal action she can take.</p>

              <p><br>The machine is supposed to malfunction so that people can win the jackpot.</p>
              <p>Unless the manager is saying the machine is supposed to allow players to win jackpot on every spin when it is functioning?</p>
              <p>Every player is supposed to feed the machine with coins to spin the machine until it buay tahan and let the lucky player win the jackpot so that it can vomit all the coins in the tummy.</p>
              <p>Sue the casino.</p>
