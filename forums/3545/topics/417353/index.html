              <p>WE WOULD like to apologise to Ms Chng Hwee Miang and her mother for 
              their experience ('Has SGH become too confusing for outpatients?'; last 
              Saturday).</p>
              <p>Our staff had suggested to Ms Chng to do her mother's CT 
              scan that afternoon to save them from making another trip to the 
              Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for the procedure, before their next 
              appointment. Nonetheless, our front-line staff could have been more 
              helpful by making the necessary inquiries internally to seek 
              clarification.</p>
              <p>Our current systems and processes are designed to allow us 
              to cope with the heavy load of 3,000 outpatients every day. This may 
              translate into stressful, long waiting times and administrative 
              procedures. Mindful of the need to improve patient experience, Camden 
              Imaging Centre was set up to offload some cases from the hospital's 
              Diagnostic Radiology Department. This allows patients who are ambulant 
              the option of having their scans done at the centre on the same day.</p>
              <p>We will continue to work on simplifying our procedures and 
              processes, and coaching our staff to better anticipate and respond to 
              the needs of our patients, especially the elderly ones.</p>
              <p><strong>Associate Professor Agnes Tan <br>Chairman, Division of 
              Ambulatory <br>and Clinical Support Services <br>Singapore General 
              Hospital </strong></p>
