              <p><span class="update">By Tan Weizhen, <a href="http://www.todayonline.com"><span style="color: #cc0000;">TODAY</span></a> | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 26 April 2012 0611 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: A prominent professor here has warned that the 
              Republic's financing scheme for the intermediate- and long-term care 
              (ILTC) sector will not be enough for Singaporeans to meet basic costs 
              for such services, as the clock ticks down on the silver tsunami which 
              will hit the Republic by 2030. <br><br>Lee Kuan Yew School of Public 
              Policy Professor Phua Kai Hong, an authoritative figure in the region on
               healthcare policy and management, first voiced his concern about 
              ElderShield, which is the sole national insurance scheme for 
              intermediate and long-term care, at a closed-door discussion earlier 
              this month. <br><br>Speaking to TODAY, he reiterated that the scheme is 
              "completely inadequate". Said Prof Phua: "People are calling our 
              hospitals a First World sector, but that our long-term care is Third 
              World standard. Besides the over-reliance on voluntary welfare 
              organisations, patients' families and cheap labour, the financial 
              structure in this sector needs to be thoroughly re-looked."<br><br>He added that Singapore's existing 3M framework - Medisave, MediShield and Medifund - are "rigged towards hospital care". <br><br>Among
               other appointments, Prof Phua had undertaken healthcare consulting 
              assignments for international organisations such as the World Bank and 
              the World Health Organisation, as well as the health ministries of 
              various countries including Singapore. <br><br>Prof Phua's concerns were
               unanimously shared by industry players and Members of Parliament TODAY 
              spoke to, with one of them describing the situation as a potential time 
              bomb even as the Government is ramping up the infrastructure in the 
              sector and raising subsidies especially for low- and middle-income 
              households.<br><br>Adding that the issue is "right at (the) doorstep", 
              NTUC Eldercare general manager Lim Sia Hoe cautioned: "The Government 
              must show urgency. We don't have the luxury of time. The longer we wait,
               the more difficult it is."<br><br>The Ministry of Health (MOH) had announced previously that it is reviewing the Eldershield scheme next year. <br><br>In
               response to TODAY's queries, an MOH spokesperson said it recognises 
              that "the cost of caring for the elderly over a period of time can be 
              significant".<br><br>On the increased subsidies, the spokesperson noted 
              that around two-thirds of the population "will benefit from some form of
               financial assistance" when the changes take effect in the third 
              quarter. <br><br>Among other measures, the MOH will also absorb goods 
              and services tax for healthcare services for all subsidised ILTC 
              patients, while cash payouts and qualifying income for the Interim 
              Disability Assistance Program for the Elderly will also be increased for
               low-income disabled elderly who were unable to join ElderShield at its 
              inception.<br><br>Nevertheless, the spokesperson acknowledged that 
              insurance coverage "also plays an important role in ensuring the 
              sustainability of our healthcare financing system". <br><br>She said: 
              "MediShield and ElderShield provide a basic level of protection against 
              severe illnesses and disability. Those who wish to obtain higher 
              coverage may purchase ElderShield Supplements provided by private 
              insurance providers ... We will continue to refine our aged care 
              financing framework to make care more affordable for our elderly."<br><br>The
               ElderShield scheme was launched in 2002 as an affordable severe 
              disability insurance scheme that provides basic financial protection to 
              those who need long-term care.<br><br>In 2007, the Government increased the monthly payout from S$300 to S$400, and the maximum payout period from 60 to 72 months. <br><br>Singapore
               citizens and permanent residents with Medisave accounts are 
              automatically covered under ElderShield at the age of 40, unless they 
              opt out.<br><br>According to industry players, the ElderShield payout is insufficient: Patients' bills are at least twice that amount. <br><br>Calling
               for the cap on the payout period to be abolished, they said that the 
              scheme should also cover not only those who are severely disabled and 
              unable to perform three activities of daily living. <br><br>Said former 
              Nominated MP and private orthopaedic surgeon Kanwaljit Soin: "The payout
               should be as long as the person is alive. It will even out in the end 
              as some people will die earlier and others, later." <br><br>There should
               also be more flexibility in the scheme - for example, the amount of 
              payout should be pegged to the level of care needed.<br><br>Sengkang 
              West MP Lam Pin Min, who chairs the Government Parliamentary Committee 
              for healthcare, said that the payout should be reviewed regularly, 
              taking into account inflation.<br><br>Higher payouts will entail higher 
              premiums and Dr Soin suggested that co-payment from Singaporeans be 
              capped at 20 to 30 per cent - a level that Prof Phua concurred was 
              optimal according to past studies.<br><br>Most observers TODAY spoke to 
              felt the Government should take the lead in this area, even though 
              private insurers should ultimately come into the picture.<br><br>Said 
              Prof Phua: "It is a relatively new issue so a lot of private insurers 
              are waiting for the Government to come in and set directions." He noted 
              that the Government has to make projections and set a basic package on 
              how much is needed for long term care.<br><br>Former NTUC Income CEO Tan
               Kin Lian pointed out that that consumers' interest is best protected by
               the Government being involved in setting the framework to determine the
               eligibility for a claim. Said Mr Tan: "The insurance company can be 
              quite strict in interpreting the eligibility to the detriment of the 
              consumer." - </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com">TODAY</a> </span></p>

              <p>There are ample proof that old geezers when they receive a lump
              sum of their entire CPF savings, blow their all money in a couple
              of years and then are pennyless and old. The beneficiaries are
              usually not their spouses here, but nubile Indonesian girls in
              Batam, Thai girls in Southern Thailand, and the PRC girls here.</p>
              <p>Of course, all the schemes are inadequate, including the annuity
              scheme. All are designed to prevent a winfall to the thousands who
              reached the withdrawl age at  any given year.</p>
              <p>They should release the money to the geezers at the same rate as
              their CPF contributions.</p>

              <p>Have some respect for the elderly. Not all behave like that. Afterall that are their money and the govt need to return them as promised not by changing all the time.</p>
