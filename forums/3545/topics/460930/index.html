              <p>Do we really have bad service standards or are we just plain demanding?</p>
              <p>According to service experts, Singaporeans can be harder to please compared to their counterparts in the region.</p>
              <p>Ben Llewellyn, regional director of a global market research company 
              IPSOS, said that different countries accept different levels of service,
               but there are those who are less tolerant of bad service.</p>
              <p>"If I compare it across the region, Singaporeans are typically a little bit harder to please in general," said Llewellyn.</p>
              <p>"I think this largely comes from there being such a strong service 
              culture in Singapore, and typically, you find that more affluent people 
              have higher standard levels and are often the hardest customers to 
              please," Llewellyn added.</p>
              <p>He adds that because Singapore is a country where "everything works",
               when something doesn't work, it stands out more and causes more of a 
              problem.</p>
              <p>This is echoed by others working in the service industry.</p>
              <p>Gordon Foo, coordinating director of operations at St James Power 
              Station, described Singaporeans as always expecting tip-top service.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes they expect five-star treatment, [such as] fine dining 
              restaurant service in a club environment, which is mostly impossible. We
               try our best to provide that for our customers, but if we're facing a 
              full house, that will not be possible," Foo said.</p>
              <p>"Living in a first world country, most Singaporeans grow up expecting
               a certain level of service standard as compared to the rest living in 
              Southeast Asia, where they're just out for a night of fun. They don't 
              expect such quality service so anything over and above is a bonus for 
              them," Foo added.</p>
              <p><em class="strong">Ugly customer behaviour </em></p>
              <p>Once, a female customer threw a chair at another female customer at 
              St James Power Station after witnessing her boyfriend flirting with the 
              other woman, Foo recalled.</p>
              <p>In some cases, customers direct their aggression toward the staff and
               start abusing them -- sometimes physically but mostly verbally.</p>
              <p>"It usually happens once or twice a week, quite common. Some 
              customers are quite aggressive in nature after a few drinks and they 
              react to almost anything," Foo said.</p>
              <p>Llewellyn explains that the worst customer behaviour usually comes 
              from customers who have done something wrong, or those who don't 
              understand something so they end up trying to almost bully the company 
              into taking the blame.</p>
              <p>"[Customers] have to remember that they are dealing with humans who 
              often don't have any say in corporate or company policy," Llewellyn 
              added.</p>
              <p>Yelling "I want to speak to your manager" does not work for everyone 
              too. Typically when customers ask to speak another person in a higher 
              position, managers will often take the same line as the junior staff.</p>
              <p>Companies might look at the value that you as a customer provide to 
              the company and decide how they will respond to you. For instance, if 
              it's an airline, they might look at your membership or credit card and 
              work out how valuable you are to the company.</p>
              <p><em class="strong">Using the 'customer is always right' card</em></p>
              <p>As much as the mantra "the customer is always right" goes, some 
              companies have actually stepped in to protect their employees instead of
               siding customers.</p>
              <p>"For us, I think the customer is always right until it gets personal.
               If you start abusing a staff, his or her parents or family, I think 
              that is when we should step in to protect the staff," Foo said.</p>
              <p>In protecting service staff and pleasing customers, Thomas Choong, 
              executive director of Chinese fine dining restaurant Xi Yan, said that 
              the best protection is to prepare their staff for foreseeable and 
              unforeseeable circumstances.</p>
              <p>"The reality is that the customer is not always right," Choong said.</p>
              <p>"A principle we try to adhere to is when others may be wrong, it 
              doesn't mean we have to be as well. We also believe that even when a 
              customer is mistaken, misunderstood, disrespectful or badly behaved, it 
              doesn't mean we should reciprocate in a similar way," Choong added.</p>

Hence, they know  what to look out for, and much more wary, as sensitive to how something is pushed to them.

              <p><cite>By <span>Fann Sim</span> | <span>Yahoo! Finance Singapore</span> – <abbr title="2012-11-01T10:34:58Z">23 hours ago</abbr></cite></p>
              <p>Do we really have bad service standards or are we just plain
                  demanding?</p>
              <p>According to service experts, Singaporeans can be harder to
                  please compared to their counterparts in the region.</p>
              <p>Ben Llewellyn, regional director of a global market research
                  company IPSOS, said that different countries accept different
                  levels of service, but there are those who are less tolerant of bad
                  service.</p>
              <p>"If I compare it across the region, Singaporeans are typically a
                  little bit harder to please in general," said Llewellyn.</p>
              <p>"I think this largely comes from there being such a strong
                  service culture in Singapore, and typically, you find that more
                  affluent people have higher standard levels and are often the
                  hardest customers to please," Llewellyn added.</p>
              <p>He adds that because Singapore is a country where "everything
                  works", when something doesn't work, it stands out more and causes
                  more of a problem.</p>
              <p>This is echoed by others working in the service industry.</p>
              <p>Gordon Foo, coordinating director of operations at St James
                  Power Station, described Singaporeans as always expecting tip-top
                  service.</p>
              <p>"Sometimes they expect five-star treatment, [such as] fine
                  dining restaurant service in a club environment, which is mostly
                  impossible. We try our best to provide that for our customers, but
                  if we're facing a full house, that will not be possible," Foo
                  said.</p>
              <p>"Living in a first world country, most Singaporeans grow up
                  expecting a certain level of service standard as compared to the
                  rest living in Southeast Asia, where they're just out for a night
                  of fun. They don't expect such quality service so anything over and
                  above is a bonus for them," Foo added.</p>
              <p><em>Ugly customer behaviour</em></p>
              <p>Once, a female customer threw a chair at another female customer
                  at St James Power Station after witnessing her boyfriend flirting
                  with the other woman, Foo recalled.</p>
              <p>In some cases, customers direct their aggression toward the
                  staff and start abusing them -- sometimes physically but mostly
                  verbally.</p>
              <p>"It usually happens once or twice a week, quite common. Some
                  customers are quite aggressive in nature after a few drinks and
                  they react to almost anything," Foo said.</p>
              <p>Llewellyn explains that the worst customer behaviour usually
                  comes from customers who have done something wrong, or those who
                  don't understand something so they end up trying to almost bully
                  the company into taking the blame.</p>
              <p>"[Customers] have to remember that they are dealing with humans
                  who often don't have any say in corporate or company policy,"
                  Llewellyn added.</p>
              <p>Yelling "I want to speak to your manager" does not work for
                  everyone too. Typically when customers ask to speak another person
                  in a higher position, managers will often take the same line as the
                  junior staff.</p>
              <p>Companies might look at the value that you as a customer provide
                  to the company and decide how they will respond to you. For
                  instance, if it's an airline, they might look at your membership or
                  credit card and work out how valuable you are to the company.</p>
              <p><em>Using the 'customer is always right' card</em></p>
              <p>As much as the mantra "the customer is always right" goes, some
                  companies have actually stepped in to protect their employees
                  instead of siding customers.</p>
              <p>"For us, I think the customer is always right until it gets
                  personal. If you start abusing a staff, his or her parents or
                  family, I think that is when we should step in to protect the
                  staff," Foo said.</p>
              <p>In protecting service staff and pleasing customers, Thomas
                  Choong, executive director of Chinese fine dining restaurant Xi
                  Yan, said that the best protection is to prepare their staff for
                  foreseeable and unforeseeable circumstances.</p>
              <p>"The reality is that the customer is not always right," Choong
                  said.</p>
              <p>"A principle we try to adhere to is when others may be wrong, it
                  doesn't mean we have to be as well. We also believe that even when
                  a customer is mistaken, misunderstood, disrespectful or badly
                  behaved, it doesn't mean we should reciprocate in a similar way,"
                  Choong added.</p>

              <p>Exactly WHAT is the purpose of this article ?</p>
              <p>The author is "just sayin" ? Just complaining ??</p>
              <p> He wants us to accept lower standard of service ?</p>
              <p>He wants us to be less demanding ? Can, then don't charge so MUCH lor...</p>
              <p>if everything is free.. I will accept ZERO service... I'd just SELF SERVICE lah.. can ?</p>
              <p>And also.. what "region" is he comparing Singaporeans to ? Another third world country ? Japan ? Korea ? Australia ? What ? Can he be more specific ?</p>
              <p>Only FOOLISH customers treat their service staff badly.</p>
              <p>I personally witnessed a waitress spit into the food before she served the dish to her nasty customer.</p>
              <p>When I treat service staff well, I get better services from them... some went above and beyond their job scope to please me. So it's a <strong>win-win</strong> situation.</p>
              <p>When you are nice to others, you are actually being nice to yourself.</p>

              <p>majority ok lah.happy or not just keep quiet and not come back lor if poor service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the harder to please ones usually are the cheapskate ones who don't want to pay for service. or pay $1 want $10. I've encountered customers who demanded 90% discount for $900 items lol </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and then like to argue over things they don't understand(technical knowledge) to show you they're not pushovers. I'm in a service/retail/sales line. I find that ocassionally you'll get a few like that lah. some with a screw loose think they can win by raising voices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe the issue is also singaporeans generally can't socialise well.</p>
