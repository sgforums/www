They wake up, they brush their teeth, then they'll farm, and then they'll sleep. But do you want it that way?". What concerns me is the assumption that all farmers in less-developed countries do not understand what life is.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

They are able to read and write in English and think more critically than many Singaporeans I have met. They are able to use the Internet and even have Facebook. They humble me with their know-how and adaptability in farming - a skill that has been long-lost in my generation. </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></span></p>

These are the unsung and financially unrewarded people who have contributed to the success of Singapore today. They are also the people whom millions will rely on to be highly adaptive and resilient in light of changing environmental conditions brought about by climate change. </span></span></p>

              goh chok tong might be right.
                  
                  in oz,all the vietnamese came in here a few years ago on work visa.they were all farmers n butchers not one passed out from secondary school.
                  
                  they go around slicing cows in oz....and they go home after werk in oz.they do the same thing in and out.
                  
                  when they lost their job,they ended up being a nail polisher in a few massage place.thats about all they know in life.and these are guys n girls.
                  
                  what do u think of these farmers then?in chinese culture,progress is not about merely making $$$$$$$ but also by advanced products...the higher tech the more valued that person is in this ever advancing werld.

              not all folks in PAP are bad and not all of them are good.as a nation with intelligent citizens u must know how to cope with folks like these.
              
              do not condemn them but study them and their acts if they make sense.use info....accurate data and come with real data and not instant condemnation of everyone!even a fool can criticise n condemn!are u a fool in the first place?
              
              if not....gather the data and think...he could be partially right n partially wrong.
              
              in vietnam...everything is never progressing.,the peopkle are satisfied being a rice farmer.in fact none of them are technologically incline probably due to their DNA.they have a hard time figuring out how to fix back many items.its only folks like me...the singaporeans..the south koreans..the americans would go up to their spoilt machine thats been spoilt for half a year and repair it in less than 20 minutes.
