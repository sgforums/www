              <p><strong>CDCs see 54% jump in number of job seekers asking for help in 2009</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 11 February 2010 1820 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : More job seekers approached Singapore's Community Development Councils (CDCs) for help in 2009.
                  <br> <br> According to the latest figures released by the People's Association,
                  38,000 job seekers applied for employment assistance at the CDCs from
                  January to December 2009. This was a 54 per cent jump compared to 2008.
                  <br> <br>The People's Association added that about half of the job seekers
                  were mature workers aged 40 and above, and the bulk of the increase
                  came in the first quarter of 2009, peaking at 5,000 job-seekers in
                  March.
                  <br> <br>The CDCs added that they were able to successfully place 20,000 job
                  seekers in employment. This was a 56 per cent increase over 2008.
                  <br> <br>Among professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET)
                  job seekers, 2,800 were placed, more than double from 1,200 in 2008.
                  <br> <br>For this group, the CDCs also provided targeted assistance,
                  including workshops on job search and resume writing skills, and
                  one-to-one counselling services.
                  <br> <br>Teo Ser Luck, Mayor, North East District, explained: "Last year,
                  while helping residents to look for jobs, North East CDC had
                  encountered a 'twist' because the number of job seekers had peaked in
                  the first half of the year, but at the third quarter, the situation
                  improved. We saw more jobs available in the market. <br> <br> "North East CDC had also worked closely with the three North East Local
                  Job Placement Centres to provide job seekers with job opportunities.
                  The CDC had stepped in to beef up these centres by setting aside S$1
                  million and with the additional resources, the centres were able to
                  supplement the CDC's efforts in reaching out to the unemployed in the
                  district."
                  <br> <br>The number of recruitment events organised by the CDCs in
                  collaboration with various grassroots bodies and the Workforce
                  Development Agency also went up in 2009.
                  <br> <br> Four hundred and ninety recruitment events were held in 2009, up from about 320 in 2008.
                  <br> <br>Commenting on the trends in 2010, South West CDC Mayor, Dr Amy
                  Khor, said, "In January 2010, for instance, even though the number of
                  job seekers seen by the CDC has declined from the previous month, and
                  is also 44 per cent below the number logged for January 2009, 55 per
                  cent of the job seekers are aged 40 years and above and 58 per cent
                  have secondary education and below. <br> <br> "With this renewed focus on worker productivity spelt out by the ESC
                  (Economic Strategies Committee), the older and less educated workers
                  will become even more vulnerable, unless they go for skills training or
                  retraining. We need therefore to build deeper resilience into this
                  segment of the workforce. <br> <br> "Hence one of the key foci of the South West CDC going forward is to
                  help such workers remain employable. We will do so by making job
                  preparatory and mindset change courses, and skills training and
                  retraining, more easily accessible to them. At the CDC, our career
                  consultants will play an even more active role in identifying workers'
                  barrier to employment and make appropriate recommendations on training
                  during their interview. <br> <br> "On the recruitment aspect, besides stepping up on the number of mini
                  recruitment events, we will continue with our efforts to organise more
                  targeted thematic job fairs, which we have found to be more effective."

              <p>CDC is only for show.   When my friend signed up with them seeking for assistance in job hunting, not long after that the consultant ask if my friend wants her case to be closed.    It was hardly a few months and the consultant is eager to cease helping.   </p>
              <p>Recently, she received a notice from CDC, her consultant sent her this and asked if she is still interested to continue to seek help in looking for job or do not wish to continue as the case is expiring soon.   MY friend indicated she would like to continue to be assisted in job hunting and sent reply by post and email.    Few weeks later when my friend called her consultant, she was surprised to hear that the consultant has actually close her case.  </p>
              <p>Wow, this is how the govt is so "committed" to help locals find job.   CDC is really a tool for drama drama only.     How has the govt resort to this extreme to "render help"?   Let us not forget to take this into consideration when we make our decision on who to vote.</p>
