              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Think logically, on such a small island with so limited land, the demand cannot meet the supply. So of course the price is over the roof. Whereas countries like Malaysia, Australia, all have relatively cheap houses. Somemore can buy landed property around the price of a HDB flat.</span></p>
              <p>But sadly most people only see this as the main picture. In places like KL, basic salary is RM 1,600 for fresh degree holder. And if you have a house, every month at least half to three quarter of your salary goes to paying loans for mortgage. Then how much of hundreds left for food? For savings? Close to zero I say.</p>
              <p>What about Australia? Cars are very cheap there compared to Singapore. Pay also very high. Part time at Starbucks can get AUD 20 per hour. Average pay of a degree holder is about AUD 4,000. But then again, their cost of eating out daily is so pricy. A very humble meal by eating out (excluding fast food) could cost at least AUD 20. In a month, that would make AUD500 just by eating ONE MEAL outside per day. What about those who eat out 3 meals a day? AUD1500. I repeat. HUMBLE meals. Rental? AUD 300 on average per week for a decent studio room. In a month, that would make AUD 1200. Plus staying in Auss, you will definitely need a car to get around the place if you plan to stay long term.</p>
              <p>My friends from Australia, whenever stopping by Singapore would always say that they're so jealous because Singapore is so safe, food is cheap and good, and there's no traffic jam that goes on for hours, nor is there any long drives to get from one place to another.</p>
              <p>I think that everywhere is the same. There's good and there's a bad side to everything. Just appreciate what you have, if you're still unhappy, then migrate.</p>

                  then again, their cost of eating out daily is so pricy. A very
                  humble meal by eating out (excluding fast food) could cost at least
                  AUD 20. In a month, that would make AUD500 just by eating ONE MEAL
                  outside per day. What about those who eat out 3 meals a day?
                  AUD1500. I repeat. HUMBLE meals. Rental? AUD 300 on average per
                  week for a decent studio room. In a month, that would make AUD
                  1200. Plus staying in Auss, you will definitely need a car to get
                  around the place if you plan to stay long term.</p>
              <p>My friends from Australia, whenever stopping by Singapore would
                  always say that they're so jealous because Singapore is so safe,
                  food is cheap and good, and there's no traffic jam that goes on for
                  hours, nor is there any long drives to get from one place to
                  another.</p>
              <p>I think that everywhere is the same. There's good and there's a
                  bad side to everything. Just appreciate what you have, if you're
                  still unhappy, then migrate.</p>

              <p>Nobody can deny that Sg is the most expensive city to live in, but it also gives us choice to live a more humble and modest life here without spending heaps on leisure. Ofcourse, who doesn't want to live a luxurious life with a big bunglow and a big car but since we live in "the most expensive city", we need to control our expenses. There are few ways in which life can be wallet friendly here:</p>
              <p>1. Take public transport.</p>
              <p>2. Use free shuttle buses.</p>
              <p>3. Eat at local hawker centers.</p>
              <p>4. Visit free or low cost clinics for medical treatments.</p>
              <p>5. Use free play zones for kids.</p>
              <p>6. Go to parks like ECP/Bishan etc for exercising.</p>
              <p>7. Use public exercise facilities.</p>
              <p>8. Go for free movie nights.</p>
              <p>9. Walk around Singapore.</p>
              <p>10. Avail library facilities.</p>
