              <p>So i know it's been a HUGE topic of discussion in here and anywhere else Singapore-related: The very High cost of living in Singapore. Heck, This little island has even been called one of the top five most expensive countries to live in!</p>

              <p>But we forget we've also been called the world's richest nation... NO, i am NOT a PAP supporter, but facts are facts.</p>
              <p>Here's what i think,after visiting the devastated europe and more Importantly, staying in SWITZERLAND for a month:</p>
              <p>Before you guys denounce Singapore as being 'unlivable', think this: an average meal for four at a SMALL takeout place in the tiny town Zermatt, Switzerland costs easily 80 Francs or 104 SGD.</p>
              <p>An average cup of coffee costs an upwards of 6 francs or 7.80 SGD.</p>
              <p>In Paris, the cost to rent a place costs an upwards of a few thousand euros/ square meter.</p>
              <p>A MACDONALDS quarter pounder meal with fries, no drink costs 11 francs or close to 15 SGD, so a meal for four costs easily 60 SGD in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>A small bottle of shampoo at Coops(switzerland's Fairprice, supposed to be the low end, affordable market) costs easily 10.50 SGD.</p>
              <p>A meal for one at an italian 'foodcourt' costs minimum 7 euros or 11 SGD if u order only a plate of, say, pasta and nothing else, a full set is easily 12 euros and up.</p>
              <p>Compare to what we have here and perhaps before we open our mouths to say Singapore is too expensive, perhaps you'd like to see how bad to europeans have it as well.</p>

              <p>Hello, resident of ivory tower.     Usually PAP supporters don't want admit they are.    </p>
              <p>Whatever, PAP supporters or not,  generally we acknowledge costs of living in Singapore is high, there is no doubt about it.      Even the rich are agreeing the cost of living are getting higher and higher.</p>
              <p>If you don't agree with the people in general, does not surprise me.   People living in the ivory tower will not know what high costs of living is.</p>

              <p>Please wake up la, even foreigners angmos and asians agree Singapore is expensive to live in.    In some angmo countries with Singapore dollar 200k can buy land and build house, here in Singapore you wait long long hor.   In Philippines, a few thousand singapore dollars you can buy a house.    Ridiculous, someone just told me that her relative sold the house in philippines for sing $150.</p>

              <p>So i know it's been a HUGE topic of discussion in here and
              anywhere else Singapore-related: The very High cost of living in
              Singapore. Heck, This little island has even been called one of the
              top five most expensive countries to live in!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But we forget we've also been called the world's richest
              nation... NO, i am NOT a PAP supporter, but facts are facts.</p>
              <p>Here's what i think,after visiting the devastated europe and
              more Importantly, staying in SWITZERLAND for a month:</p>
              <p>Before you guys denounce Singapore as being 'unlivable', think
              this: an average meal for four at a SMALL takeout place in the
              tiny town Zermatt, Switzerland costs easily 80 Francs or 104
              SGD.</p>
              <p>An average cup of coffee costs an upwards of 6 francs or 7.80
              SGD.</p>
              <p>In Paris, the cost to rent a place costs an upwards of a few
              thousand euros/ square meter.</p>
              <p>A MACDONALDS quarter pounder meal with fries, no drink costs 11
              francs or close to 15 SGD, so a meal for four costs easily 60 SGD
              in Switzerland.</p>
              <p>A small bottle of shampoo at Coops(switzerland's Fairprice,
              supposed to be the low end, affordable market) costs easily
              10.50 SGD.</p>
              <p>A meal for one at an italian 'foodcourt' costs minimum 7 euros
              or 11 SGD if u order only a plate of, say, pasta and
              nothing else, a full set is easily 12 euros and up.</p>
              <p>Compare to what we have here and perhaps before we open our
              mouths to say Singapore is too expensive, perhaps you'd like to see
              how bad to europeans have it as well.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>You make a fair statement. However you're only looking at the expense side of things. When the common "Singaporean" says Singapore is expensive. Said person means the average joe's earning power as compared to the costs of living.</p>
              <p>Long story short.... compare apple for apple that is what you were missing.</p>
              <p>The same commodity in different countries have different prices which is balanced with different wages.</p>

              <p>TS has definitely forgotten to compare the salary of the ppl here and there... like in aus, a simple meal there can cost &gt;10 aussie... way more expensive than singapore, but their wages lets say for someone who works at a starbucks equivalent of sg, earns about 11aus/hr.</p>
              <p>In other countries, high expenses are balanced by high wages. The comparison that you've just made, imo, is purely stupid.</p>
