              <p><strong>Robust demand for S'pore convention, exhibition sector</strong><br> <span class="update">Posted: 23 June 2010 1151 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The buzz is back in Singapore's convention and 
              exhibition industry as Asia-Pacific economies rebound and new casinos 
              attract more visitors to one of the region's favourite meeting 
              destinations.
              <br> <br> From telecom and hotel trade shows to Christian prayer meetings and 
              home-decor fairs, conference centres are enjoying robust demand from 
              event organisers along with rising attendance numbers.
              <br> <br> Convention centres have already sealed contracts for events in 2011 and 
              2012, with Singapore Expo, located close to Changi Airport, hosting a 
              tenth of all business-related events.
              <br> <br> "The big conventions and exhibitions sector is starting to bounce back,"
               said its deputy general manager Chandran Nair. "A significant number of
               associations and organisations have stopped playing a wait-and-see 
              game."
              <br> <br> Singapore hosts some 6,000 business events annually, accounting for a 
              quarter of such meetings held in Asia in 2008, according to official 
              figures, but the global recession hit the industry in 2009.
              <br> <br> In 2008, Singapore welcomed three million business travellers including 
              convention participants, said Melissa Ow, assistant chief executive at 
              the Singapore Tourism Board in charge of business travel and 
              conventions.
              <br> <br> The segment contributed S$6 billion (US$4.4 billion) or about 40 per 
              cent of total tourism revenues in 2008, Ow said.
              <br> <br> Total visitor arrivals including tourists and business travellers 
              slipped 4.3 per cent to 9.7 million in 2009, but the STB forecasts 
              visitor arrivals for 2010 could range from 11.5 to 12.5 million.
              <br> <br> The target is 17 million arrivals by 2015 -- more than three times the 
              current population of Singapore.
              <br> <br> The turnaround of the local economy despite lingering US weaknesses and 
              the recent financial shocks in Europe is also boosting demand for 
              meetings and display space at convention centres.
              <br> <br> Economists expect Singapore's output to expand 9.0 percent in 2010 after
               contracting 1.3 per cent last year, and the government has been pushing
               service industries to reduce dependence on manufacturing in the long 
              term.
              <br> <br> Chua Chor Hoon, the head of research for Southeast Asia at realty 
              consultancy DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, told AFP that growing the convention
               industry is key to achieving the target.
              <br> <br> "With the global economies recovering from last year's recession, the 
              outlook for (the business meetings industry) in 2010 is good as 
              companies are more willing to spend again," Chua said.
              <br> <br> For conventioneers, Singapore offers a central location and extensive 
              airline connections as well as a safe, business-friendly and 
              English-speaking environment.
              <br> <br> All convention centres are connected to the mass transit system, and 
              many offer integrated hotel, entertainment and dining facilities, with 
              accommodation generally cheaper than in Hong Kong, its arch rival.
              <br> <br> "What is unique to Singapore is our user-centricity, which means that 
              experiences are built around the visitor, with the visitor's needs and 
              preferences in mind," said the tourism board's Ow.
              <br> <br> The addition of two massive casino complexes earlier this year -- one on
               Sentosa island, the other right next to the banking district -- is 
              another incentive to hold regional and world conferences in Singapore
              <br> <br> Both properties began operations earlier this year and have already 
              signed close to 200 events contracts each, according to company 
              officials. - AFP/jy</span></p>
