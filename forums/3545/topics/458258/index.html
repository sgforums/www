              <p class="first">The New Zealander who jumped bail after being charged with assault at Suntec City in 2010 has turned himself in. <br><br>Robert
               Dahlberg, 35,  was arrested upon his return to Singapore on Thursday 
              and was presented in court on Friday, the Singapore Police Force (SPF) 
              said in a media statement. <br><br>In a statement, Dahlberg said that he
               "voluntarily returned to Singapore on 6 September to face charges 
              relating to an incident on 11 April 2010".<br><br>"I return to 
              co-operate fully with the Singapore authorities and abide by the due 
              process of the case before the Singapore courts," the options broker 
              said. He was accompanied by his father Bill Dahlberg. <br><br>Dahlberg 
              will face charges for voluntarily causing grevious hurt and a rash act 
              causing hurt under the penal code. He is represented by lead counsel 
              Wendell Wong from Drew &amp; Napier.<br><br>The Kiwi was due to face charges in July last year after being allegedly involved <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/businessmen-charged-drunken-cabby-fight-044314363.html">in a drunken attack on two taxi drivers and two passenger</a> at Suntec City in April two years ago. <br><br>He was granted a $25,000 bail on the condition he return to Singapore for sentencing. However, he <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/kiwi-bail-jumper-won-t-return-pore-face-093720556.html">did not return on 29 July 2011</a>,
               and is understood to have travelling to London and Hong Kong. A warrant
               for his arrest was issued on 12 September that year and he was listed 
              on the Interpol's list of wanted persons.<br><br>Two other foreign nationals, an Australian and a Briton, were also charged in court in July last year. <br><br>Dahlberg
               allegedly caused hurt to businessman Laurence Wong Seong, 39, and Paul 
              Louis Liew Kai Ming, 27 by swinging a punch at the former and pushing 
              the latter against a pillar.<br><br>Australian Nathan Miller, 36, 
              supposedly punched another cabby in the face and jumped onto the taxi's 
              bonnet. Miller was sentenced to three weeks’ jail in February this year 
              after pleading guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt.<br><br>Separately,
               Briton Robert Springall, 25, allegedly used a taxi without the driver's
               consent and crashed it. He was also said to have pushed the 58-year-old
               taxi driver's chest. Springall left and returned to Singapore after his
               application to leave for the United Kingdom between 25 August and 5 
              September last year was granted. However, it is unclear if Springall was
               asked to surrender his passport upon his return. <br><br>He left 
              Singapore in December without obtaining court permission and absconded. 
              Springall is still at large and a warrant of arrest has been issued for 
              him.</p>
