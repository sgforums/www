              <p>by Jeremy Au Yong</p>
              <p>THE Jewel of Muscat was welcomed to Singapore in fine style on 
              Saturday, with everyone from the sailors to the VIPs determined not to 
              let the bad weather ruin the occasion.</p>
              <p>The planned festivities for the ship, a gift from the 
              Sultanate of Oman to Singapore, carried on uninterrupted even as heavy 
              rain fell for long periods during the day.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo was the first to brave the bad 
              weather as he headed out to sea early in the morning to greet the ship 
              as it entered Singapore waters.</p>
              <p>Despite the heavy downpour, Mr Yeo turned down an umbrella 
              and chose to brave the rain with the sailors on the open deck of the 
              ship.</p>
              <p>Later, he would write on his Facebook page that the 'arrival
               of the Jewel in wind and rain gave a hint of voyage trials'.</p>

              <p><strong>Jewel of Muscat delegation visits Kampong Glam</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 04 July 2010 2033 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The delegation of the Jewel of Muscat from Oman was 
              given a special welcome to the historical Kampong Glam district on 
              Sunday morning.
              <br> <br> The delegation included the personal representative of Sultan Qaboos of 
              Oman, Sayyed Harib Thuwani Al-Said, and the ambassador of Oman, Sheikh 
              Humaid Ali Al-Maani.
              <br> <br> Senior Minister of State from Singapore's Foreign Ministry, Zainul 
              Abidin Rasheed, played host.
              <br> <br> The delegation viewed various cultural acts and toured the district 
              including a walk along Muscat Street.
              <br> <br> Zainul Abidin Rasheed, who is also the chairman of the Malay Heritage 
              Foundation, said the exchange not only signifies the bilateral exchange 
              of trade and commerce but also the beauty of arts, culture and 
              traditions.
              <br> <br> He said: "The threads of history link this Singapore neighbourhood, 
              called Kampong Glam, to the Middle East. 
              <br> <br> "Then located by the sea, Kampong Glam was named after the gelam tree, 
              whose bark was used by sailors to seal gaps in their boats.
              <br> <br> "As it was the seat of the Malay sultanate in Singapore and the centre 
              of the Muslim community, Kampong Glam naturally attracted Arab traders 
              who came to Singapore. 
              <br> <br> "The influence of these Arab traders remains visible today in the names 
              of some of the streets in Kampong Glam, one of which is called Muscat 
              Street. 
              <br> <br> "Singapore and Oman are working together to give Muscat Street (between 
              Arab Street and Kandahar Street) a distinctly Omani flavour. This is 
              another symbol of our close ties. 
              <br> <br> "This is more than just a ship. It symbolises the warm and close 
              relations between the Sultanate of Oman and Singapore, and essentially 
              reflects a determination to recreate the historical bilateral and 
              regional links between us."
              <br> <br> The dhow is a gift from the Sultanate of Oman to Singapore, as a symbol 
              of the historical, cultural and trade links shared between the two 
              countries for many centuries.
              <br> <br> It arrived in Singapore on Saturday after some four months at sea.
              <br> <br> The captain and crew, including two Singaporeans, also gave first-hand 
              accounts of their journey.
              <br> <br> They shared how they had to deal with stormy weather conditions while 
              navigating the 9th century Arabian dhow. 
              <br> <br> Captain Saleh Said Al Jabri said: "This is now 21st century. There are a
               million of ships crossing....and trying to avoid all the ships was a 
              dangerous itself and a challenge. Crossing the ocean, with rain, waves 
              and the big sea, it was dangerous."
              <br> <br> Captain Saleh Said Al Jabri, who is retiring after spending over 20 
              years at sea, said the voyage is something that is close to his heart.
              <br> <br> He said: "Very good, bring maritime heritage and promote Oman at the 
              same time. It's about our forefathers, how they live. I'm very touched, 
              I've cried. I will miss the ship. I did not think that I will leave the 
              ship at the end, because it has become part of my life, part of my body.
               I have taken care of it more than I have taken care of my family in 
              these four months."
              <br> <br> Singaporean Jeff Khoo, a 27-year-old officer with the Foreign Affairs 
              Ministry, was part of the dhow's crew during the first leg from Oman to 
              India. 
              <br> <br> He shared what it was like being part of the team.
              <br> <br> "The experience for me has been tremendous, very unique situation that I
               found myself in. I was doing something that was completely different 
              and spending a month completely removed from everything that I'm used 
              to. 
              <br> <br> "I have not been a professional sailor by training or experience. It was
               partially because of this project that I learnt how to sail. 
              <br> <br> "It was a great and very humbling experience, because I found myself 
              there and having to learn all these new things - how to handle the 
              ropes, how to help maintain the ship, how to essentially be a useful 
              crew member. 
              <br> <br> "It turned out to be the longest leg. In some ways it could have been 
              the safest - we had decent weather. Our concern was not too much wind 
              but too little wind. We spent quite some time drifting, waiting for the 
              wind, as they would have done in the 9th century. 
              <br> <br> "Before I left Singapore for Oman - this was in late January this year -
               I first had to learn how to sail properly. 
              <br> <br> "So I went for a very good course conducted by one of our marinas in 
              Singapore and spent five days out (at sea), and under a very competent 
              instructor. At the end of it, I had a certain amount of confidence that 
              when I got to Oman, I would not be completely clueless."
