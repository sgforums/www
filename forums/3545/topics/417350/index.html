              <p>MONDAY'S editorial ('Birth rates: Slow down to speed up?') was an 
              interesting read. I strongly believe there are many Singaporeans who 
              'really love being parents'. However, sometimes, love is just not 
              enough.</p>
              <p>I am a customer service trainer who gave birth to a lovely 
              Tiger boy in September. Having my first child has made me understand why
               the birth rate in Singapore hovers stubbornly at below the replacement 
              level, despite the many incentives given by the Government.</p>
              <p>Even while I was pregnant, I was considering having a second
               child, as I am already in my early 30s. However, the costs that added 
              up from the time of our wedding through to post-natal and infant care 
              have got me thinking again.</p>
              <p>My project manager husband and I married in May last year, 
              and got our Housing Board flat in December. Having worked for around 10 
              years each, we had accumulated a bit of savings to pay for our wedding 
              and flat renovation.</p>
              <p>Then I got pregnant.</p>
              <p>The monthly checks at the gynaecologist came up easily to 
              $1,500, of which only $450 was claimable through Medisave. When I gave 
              birth, I stayed in a four-bedded ward in a private hospital and had to 
              pay $4,000 in cash, after Medisave.</p>
              <p>During my maternity leave, I had help from a confinement 
              woman for the first month. I paid her $2,200. For the remaining three 
              months of maternity leave, I took care of my child alone.</p>
              <p>I sourced for help to take care of my child upon returning 
              to work and eventually decided to place him in a nursery with 
              infant-care facilities. This works out to $850 a month. Within a year, 
              the baby bonuses and Children Development Account top-ups would have 
              been fully utilised.</p>
              <p>And I have not mentioned costs like maternity and baby 
              clothes, diapers, vaccinations and all the other necessities that come 
              with having a child.</p>
              <p>As it is a personal decision to have a child, I am not 
              lamenting these costs.</p>
              <p>However, it would be good if we could move towards the 
              'French way' - one of the possibilities the editorial notes - with free 
              nursery schools and generous tax allowances. This would definitely help 
              ease the financial burden of families who wish to have more children.</p>
