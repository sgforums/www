              <h1 class="storyheadline">Wrong to blame foreign workers for stealing jobs</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Murali Sharma's Forum Online letter, "Firms should take 
              cue from Han's" (May 6), and would like to give my take from the hiring 
              experience of my brother-in-law's F&amp;B business.</p>
              <p>My brother-in-law is able to operate his two foodcourts 
              daily without much manpower disruption because he has a few foreign 
              workers who are willing to do menial jobs.</p>
              <p>Most local workers hired to do such jobs are not likely to 
              possess the same positive working attitudes.</p>
              <p>The public's disquiet over employers preferring to hire 
              foreigners over Singaporeans because the former are cheaper is a 
              misplaced conception. This is because there are hidden costs such as 
              worker's levy, food and lodging, medical and insurance fees which 
              employers will have to bear. When such hidden costs are added up, the 
              total can be close or equivalent to the salary of a local worker.</p>
              <p>Foreign workers keep our estates clean, tend to our sick, 
              get us around in our public transport system, build our HDB flats, and 
              do the dirty jobs in our shipyards, docks, container ports and so on. If
               we did not have them to take up jobs in these sectors, how would we be 
              able to achieve world-class status for our health and transport systems,
               public housing, hospitals and port?</p>
              <p>Finally, unskilled or low-skilled foreign workers do not 
              take jobs away from Singaporeans. How can the jobs be snatched away when
               they are jobs that Singaporeans have shunned in the first place?</p>

              <p>how can locals shunned banking, accounting, finance, call centre jobs leh? foreigners were hired because their wages are much lower as compared to the locals. is it a case of locals shunning jobs in these industries?</p>
              <p>if a bank hire a local to staff their call centre at $2,000. If they can hire a foreigner at a salary of $1200, that is $800 cost savings for them.</p>
