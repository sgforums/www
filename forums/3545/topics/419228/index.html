              <p>THE book, 1959-2009 Chronicle Of Singapore, Fifty Years Of Headline 
              News, carries a report published in The Straits Times on Nov 22, 1965 
              ('Chin Siong: Hurt in free-for-all'). This story, which claimed that my 
              late brother Lim Chin Siong had been involved in a fight in prison, was 
              established to be false back in 1966 itself.</p>
              <p>My brother had sued the paper for libel and the lawyer for 
              Straits Times Press (Malaya) had acknowledged that 'there is in fact no 
              truth' in the allegations made against my brother in the report (''Free 
              for all' libel action by Chin Siong is settled'; May27, 1966).</p>
              <p>The paper had also printed a correction and apology, and 
              'paid into court a sum of money in satisfaction of the plaintiff's claim
               in this action without admission of liability'.</p>
              <p>The book is a collaborative effort by Editions Didier Millet
               and the National Library Board. It is difficult to understand how a 
              story that had been acknowledged to be false escaped detection despite 
              all the corrective proof-reading such a major collaborative effort 
              involving a national institution would have entailed.</p>
              <p>As a key custodian of published national history, the 
              National Library Board owes members of the public a duty not to let 
              falsehoods be perpetuated as part of history.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">NLB didn't perpetuate any falsehood, says publisher</h1>
              <p>MR LIM Chin Joo's letter ('Chin Siong story in book was admitted to be
               false in 1966'; Dec 31) incorrectly suggests that the National Library 
              Board (NLB) failed in its duty to the public by allowing falsehoods to 
              be perpetuated.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim's suggestion is based on the mistaken belief that the
               book, Chronicle Of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News (1959-2009),
               was co-published by the NLB. It was not. The book was published solely 
              by Editions Didier Millet.</p>
              <p>EDM had earlier published similar books in Thailand and 
              Malaysia and came up with the idea of having one for Singapore. To 
              enable us to obtain material for the book, we requested NLB permission 
              to access its library materials. The NLB kindly agreed.</p>
              <p>Once access was granted, we researched and selected stories 
              for inclusion in the book, including the item which Mr Lim had raised. 
              After the selection, we completely rewrote the materials. We were also 
              wholly responsible for the conceptualisation, design and production work
               of the book.</p>
              <p>In the circumstances, the NLB did not co-publish, much less perpetuate any alleged falsehood.</p>
              <p>Far from failing to discharge its duties, in granting us 
              access, the NLB was in fact complying with its duty under the National 
              Library Board Act to provide a repository for library materials, 
              including newspapers, to facilitate access to such materials.</p>
              <p>In the book, we acknowledge the NLB as co-publisher, not to 
              suggest that it had any role in publishing the book, but to thank it for
               its assistance in granting us access to the materials.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Book publisher's reply raises more questions</h1>
              <p>PUBLISHER Editions Didier Millet took sole responsibility in general 
              manager Charles Orwin's reply ('NLB didn't perpetuate any falsehood, 
              says publisher'; Monday) to my letter about an error in a book his firm 
              'co-published' with the National Library Board ('Chin Siong story in 
              book was admitted to be false in 1966'; Dec 31).</p>
              <p>But Editions Didier Millet's (EDM) reply about the book, 
              Chronicle of Singapore: Fifty Years Of Headline News (1959-2009), raises
               further questions such as:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li>Was it appropriate for a national institution such 
              as the National Library Board (NLB) to agree to lend credibility to a 
              privately undertaken publication by having itself acknowledged as a 
              partner and co-publisher when, as EDM now says, it was not? </li>
              <li>Does a national institution, by allowing itself
               to be identified as a co-publisher of a privately undertaken 
              publication, associate itself with the accuracy of the contents?
              <p>As my letter stated, the book carries a news item which was established to be false in 1966.</p>
              <p>I have urged, as a matter of public interest, that falsehoods should not be perpetuated as part of our history.</p>
              <p>These were the pertinent matters raised that should have been swiftly and appropriately addressed.</p>
