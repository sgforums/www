              <p><strong>GIC Says Risk of Shocks May Trigger <span style="text-decoration: underline;">World Recession</span> `Sooner Than Expected'</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Bloomberg.com, 23 Jul 2010</span></p>
              <p><em>By <span class="author">Shamim Adam and Netty Ismail</span> - <span class="datestamp">Jul 23, 2010</span> </em></p>
              <p>The global rebound is “fragile” and shocks could push the world toward another recession, according to Government of Singapore Investment Corp., manager of more than $100 billion of the nation’s foreign reserves.</p>
              <p>Risks to the global recovery have increased due to Europe’s debt turmoil, continued deleveraging in the U.S. and protectionist pressures, <a title="Search News" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Tony%20Tan&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1&amp;partialfields=-wnnis:NOAVSYND&amp;lr=-lang_ja"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Tony Tan</span></a>, deputy chairman of <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="/apps/quote?ticker=GIC:SP"><span style="color: #0033cc;">GIC</span></a>, said in a speech in Singapore today. The fund is ranked the world’s sixth-largest state investment company by Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute in California.</p>
              <p>“The economic recovery, while real, is fragile and there is a risk that negative shocks could push the global economy towards a recession sooner than expected,” Tan said. “The strong rebound in global industrial production is peaking while monetary and fiscal policies, particularly in the larger emerging economies, are being normalized.”</p>
              <p>Policy makers in most developed economies have refrained from raising interest rates from record lows amid concern the global recovery will falter. The International Monetary Fund this month said financial-market turmoil has increased the risks to the rebound, and Moody’s Investors Service lowered its credit ratings on Portugal and Ireland.</p>
              <p>Bernanke’s Comments</p>
              <p>“The challenge for policy makers in many developed economies will be to convince markets that they have credible plans to ensure sustainable public finances over the medium to long term, while minimizing the negative short-term impact on growth,” Tan said. “While markets have focused on Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy, this risk remains high for the U.K., U.S., and Japan.”</p>
              <p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman <a title="Search News" href="http://search.bloomberg.com/search?q=Ben%20S.%20Bernanke&amp;site=wnews&amp;client=wnews&amp;proxystylesheet=wnews&amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;filter=p&amp;getfields=wnnis&amp;sort=date:D:S:d1&amp;partialfields=-wnnis:NOAVSYND&amp;lr=-lang_ja"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Ben S. Bernanke</span></a> said July 21 the economic outlook remains “unusually uncertain,” adding to concern the global recovery is losing steam. The comments sent crude oil and metal prices lower and triggered declines in stocks in the U.S. and Asia.</p>
              <p>Developed economies will take a “long time” to recover fully from the global crisis and emerging nations such as Brazil, Russia, India and China will gain importance, Tan said.</p>
              <p>The world economy may grow 4 percent in 2010, before expanding at a more moderate pace next year, he said. Growth in Asia excluding Japan may reach 8 percent this year, with China and India expanding 8 percent to 10 percent, Tan estimated.</p>
              <p>Emerging Markets</p>
              <p>“For investors, the rise of emerging markets will mean that a larger proportion of their investments will be in these markets,” he said. “Far from being a risky and perhaps optional part of their portfolios, emerging markets will become a core and unavoidable asset class in global portfolios.”</p>
              <p>GIC’s investments in stocks accounted for 38 percent of its portfolio in the year to March 31, 2009, while bond investments represented 24 percent, according to its annual report released in September. Allocations to alternative investments, including private equity, real estate and hedge funds, made up 30 percent of its portfolio.</p>
              <p>GIC bought stakes in <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="/apps/quote?ticker=C:US"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Citigroup Inc</span></a>. and UBS AG in 2008 as the collapse in the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2007 froze credit markets and led to almost $1.8 trillion in losses and writedowns at financial institutions worldwide.</p>
              <p>The global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 will likely “accelerate the shift in economic power from the developed to the emerging world,” Tan said. “Asia is at the cusp of the next stage in its development.”</p>
              <p>Domestic demand will be a key source of Asia’s economic growth, which has been largely dependent on exports, and “extensive” infrastructure investment will be needed as cities develop, Tan said. Higher wages and investment inflows will over time result in “significantly stronger currencies” in the region, he said.</p>
              <p>The need for capital to finance Asia’s growth will also fuel the growth of the region’s foreign-exchange, bond and equity markets as well as its financial institutions, he said. Asia, led by China, will also increase research and development of technologies that address environmental constraints such as renewable technology, he said.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Asia recovering well: GIC</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Gabriel Chen</p>
              <p>ASIA is recovering well from the financial crisis but there are still 
              risks to the world economy, including the turmoil in Europe and 
              protectionist pressures in many countries, according to Dr Tony Tan, 
              deputy chairman of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation 
              (GIC).</p>
              <p>Dr Tan told the Swiss Re Forum Singapore on Friday that the 
              global recovery is likely to continue into the next year but at a more 
              moderate pace.</p>
              <p>But he cautioned that the rebound is 'fragile' and 'negative
               shocks could push the global economy towards a recession sooner than 
              expected'.</p>
              <p>And while growth prospects are much better for Asia than for
               the developed world, Dr Tan does not see Asia 'aggressively 
              challenging' the global order, which has benefited the region for 
              decades.</p>
              <p>'Asian countries, including China, generally share the view 
              that a multilateral, rules-based international order is critical to 
              their long-term growth and development,' said Dr Tan. 'Asia's rise 
              therefore is not inevitably a zero-sum geopolitical game where the US 
              and Europe must decline as Asian countries grow.'</p>
              <p>Dr Tan flagged the turmoil in Europe, saying that growth 
              there should be weaker at around 1 per cent.</p>
