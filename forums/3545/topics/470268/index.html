              <p><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">Rachel Armstrong and John O'Callaghan</span> | <span class="provider org">Reuters</span> – <abbr title="2013-06-03T00:01:40Z">Mon, Jun 3, 2013 8:01 AM SGT</abbr></cite></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The email landed at a tough time for David 
              Chong, the colorful founder and chairman of Portcullis TrustNet, one of 
              Asia's biggest wealth advisory companies.</p>
              <p>By threatening to publish offshore companies and trusts held by his 
              clients, it hit a raw nerve at a company whose customers rely on its 
              discretion. But it also came as the wealth management industry faces a 
              wave of global scrutiny from regulators trying to weed out tax dodgers.</p>
              <p>The email from a group of investigative journalists said it wanted 
              to expose how the rich compound the world's economic problems by using 
              offshore tax loopholes to minimize tax payments.</p>
              <p>The message struck at the heart of a global debate over the moral 
              divide between savvy tax planning and exploitation of loopholes that 
              critics say mean governments miss out on corporate and individual tax 
              revenues.</p>
              <p>Singapore, like other wealth management centers, is in the 
              regulatory spotlight and Chong said the reporters unfairly singled out 
              Portcullis as one of the villains.</p>
              <p>"Portcullis sells companies like Victorinox sells knives," said 
              Chong, a lawyer by training who built up Portcullis over 25 years. "It 
              would be ridiculous to blame Victorinox because one of their knives is 
              used to commit a crime," Chong said in a rare interview in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Portcullis TrustNet describes itself as Asia's biggest independent 
              group of trust companies, and a one-stop shop for wealthy individuals to
               manage their money.</p>
              <p>Chong defends Portcullis's business and says he believes the firm 
              has complied with the necessary regulations in all the jurisdictions in 
              which it operates.</p>
              <p>He says it conducts extensive due diligence on clients, who, 
              according to press reports, include a member of the Philippines 
              politically powerful Marcos family, a former minister in the Thai 
              cabinet and a hedge fund manager now jailed for insider trading.</p>
              <p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), 
              which sent the email in March, said the company has 77,000 clients. 
              Chong declined to comment on specific clients or how many customers the 
              firm had.</p>
              <p>He dismissed the suggestion by the ICIJ, a cross-border network of 
              reporters who collaborate on large-scale investigations, that releasing 
              the information on Portcullis's clients was a vital expose of offshore 
              tax evasion.</p>
              <p>"There is a triumphalism out there, but this is all about data 
              theft," he said, calling the act an invasion of privacy akin to stealing
               from the Queen of England's bedroom.</p>
              <p>"Some of these journalists are waving the Queen's underwear in public and boasting "I have the Queen's knickers.'"</p>
              <p>The ICIJ says the data was leaked, not stolen.</p>
              <p>Singapore has grown in the last decade into Asia's biggest wealth 
              management centre as assets under management leapt four-fold to more 
              than $1 trillion. It is tipped in a number of surveys to overtake 
              Switzerland in the coming decade as the world's top wealth management 
              centre.</p>
              <p>To try to safeguard its reputation as an internationally compliant 
              wealth management centre, the government is set to adopt measures that 
              make it easier to share information on potential tax evaders with other 
              countries, including the United States.</p>
              <p>It is also bringing in rules that compel financial institutions to 
              identify and, if necessary, close accounts they strongly suspect are 
              held by tax cheats. After July 1, handling the proceeds of tax evasion 
              will be a criminal offence.</p>
              <p>Singapore, which has more millionaires per capita than anywhere else
               in the world, has reacted more proactively to the growing push for 
              transparency in private banking. Switzerland, for example, was forced to
               open up under enormous pressure from the United States, which led to 
              the closure of Switzerland's oldest private bank and formal 
              investigations into some of the country's biggest institutions.</p>
              <p>Chong believes the offshore finance industry is being unfairly 
              targeted when often, he argues, they are better regulated than some 
              onshore jurisdictions.</p>
              <p>"There is a shrill hysteria against the rich and powerful because of
               the hard economic times," said the bespectacled and bow-tie wearing 
              Chong. "To quote a leading tax case, ‘Whether poor and humble or wealthy
               and noble, a person has the legal right to pay the least tax 
              possible'."</p>
              <p>Still, many governments are facing rising public anger over tax 
              evasion at a time of economic austerity in many countries. The Tax 
              Justice Network, a UK-based advocacy group that supports transparency in
               international finance, estimates on its website that $250 billion is 
              lost in tax revenues each year owing to funds held offshore by 
              individuals.</p>
              <p>"OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE"</p>
              <p>Chong's company formed in 2004 when his firm Portcullis merged with 
              TrustNet, an advisory founded in the Cook Islands that specialized in 
              setting up offshore companies and trusts.</p>
              <p>A year later, Singapore passed rules that encouraged the growth of 
              trust companies, legislation that was a boon to the wealth management 
              sector.</p>
              <p>A Qing Dynasty scroll hangs in Portcullis's Hong Kong office, with a
               mantra written in Chinese characters saying "San Dai Tong Tang, Wu Shi 
              Qi Chang," meaning: "three generations under one roof, five generations 
              of prosperity".</p>
              <p>"I think there is no moral turpitude in wanting to protect your 
              family from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune," said Chong, 
              who was born in Malaysia and educated in Britain.</p>
              <p>Trust companies in Singapore and elsewhere operate in a "grey area" 
              of compliance, said Jason Sharman, a professor at Griffith University in
               Australia, who focuses on offshore financial centers, money laundering 
              and tax havens.</p>
              <p>"They may not be breaking Singapore laws but they may be making it a
               lot easier for foreign clients who break laws in those clients' 
              jurisdictions," he said. "There's often a large amount of turning a 
              blind eye."</p>
              <p>Wealth managers say their core client base in Asia has legitimate 
              reasons for wanting to keep money outside their home countries and to 
              keep the details secret, such as personal security and to protect 
              against political upheaval.</p>
              <p>"Privacy is important for someone from the Philippines because they 
              don't want a kidnap and ransom situation," said Angelo Venardos, an 
              Australian and former banker who runs the Heritage Trust Group in 
              Singapore. "For an Indonesian it means not having your financial affairs
               handed over to the wrong political party."</p>
              <p>After the data was lost, Portcullis faced a stream of calls from 
              worried clients looking to expunge their records or move their accounts 
              to another firm, several people familiar with the matter said.</p>
              <p>"Clearly there has been an impact on our business," Chong said.</p>
              <p>He doesn't believe there is any evidence of illegal activity in the 
              lost data but noted that what was legal a few years ago may not be now.</p>
              <p>"There has been this bad press but hopefully in due course we can 
              show that we have done no wrong," he said. "The goal posts keep moving 
              and we move with the goal posts."</p>
