              <p><strong>Cabby already dead when ransom demand was made</strong><br> <span class="update">By  Leong Wee Keat, <span style="color: #cc0000;">TODAY</span> | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 07 March 2011 2341 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE - When 
              cabby Yuen Swee Hong, 58, failed to return to his Serangoon home from 
              his shift on April 11, 2009, Madam Chan Oi Lin called her husband's 
              mobile phone and was met with a threat from a man with a mainland 
              Chinese accent. <br><br>He said that he had kidnapped Mr Yuen and that the cabby "is going to die".<br><br>He demanded $150,000 in ransom.<br><br>But unknown to Mdm Chan, her husband was probably already dead.<br><br>Opening
               the prosecutor's case in the High Court murder trial against Chinese 
              national Wang Wenfeng, 32, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Eugene Lee 
              also told the court that the cabby had up to five stab wounds on his 
              shirt and his taxi - found in a multi-storey carpark in Canberra Link - 
              was splattered with blood.<br><br>DPP Lee added that it was Wang who led
               the police to Mr Yuen's decomposed body, hidden in a forested area in 
              Sembawang on April 17, 2009.<br><br>He also led the police into a 
              forested area at Nee Soon Road where a haversack containing two knives 
              and other items such as gloves, cable ties and nylon rope were found.<br><br>In court, Mdm Chan recalled the shock and anguish when the ransom demand was made.<br><br>The widow told the court that she received another call and managed to reduce the ransom amount to $80,000.<br><br>Their son alerted the police.<br><br>The next day, Mdm Chan and the male caller settled on a sum of $5,000, to be delivered at Marsiling MRT station.<br><br>There, she received a text message to remit the money into a China Construction Bank account.<br><br>She refused as she wanted to hear her husband's voice first.<br><br>She waited there for many hours without avail and went home.<br><br>The man called again and asked her if she had remitted the money.<br><br>"I
               replied again that I did not know how to do so. He replied that he did 
              not care and ended the call abruptly. That was the last time I heard 
              from the male caller," said Mdm Chan.<br><br>The vctim's brother, Mr 
              Yuen Peng Yin, who was with Mdm Chan at that time, told the court that 
              they did not remit the money as they thought it was a scam. <br><br>Wang's
               wife, Mdm Gong Wenying, testified that her husband "was stressed over 
              money" and "appeared to be desperate" to raise money for his mother's 
              cancer treatment.<br><br>Wang, a general worker, had also mentioned selling his organs to raise money. <br><br>"I was not sure if he was serious but I advised him that we had time to make money as we were still young," said Mdm Gong.<br><br>Wang's
               co-tenant, Mr Chen Yongquan, said that on April 10 - the night before 
              the alleged murder - Wang left the flat with a haversack and claimed 
              that Wang said he "needed to do something outside". <br><br>When Mr Chen commented that it was already late, Wang replied "robbery".<br><br>"I thought he was joking," said Mr Chen.<br><br>Wang was arrested at People's Park Complex on April 13, 2009 after he collected a one-way ticket to Xiamen, China. <br><br>The hearing continues.<br><br>- TODAY</span></span></p>

              <p>So far some of the cases that  involved in foreigner/elites tend to get lighter sentence.  At least this is the impression that I get.  Some case can recall.</p>
              <p>1) A PRC that kill another and set fire to his factory get life sentence.</p>
              <p>2) A foreigner manager that molest a 12 yrs old girl in the lift get away with a fine.</p>
              <p>3) A drunk foreigner bash a taxi driver also get away with a fine</p>
              <p> 4) A hit and run case end up with a fine citing the reason that the sound proof of the car is too good that is why the driver can't hear that she hit someone</p>
              <p>5) A driver run over and kill someone while beating the red light and using the handphone (without handfree) also get away with it. </p>
