              <p>There are valid concerns about foreigners, such as service staff who cannot speak English and Singaporean males being disadvantaged by reservist training. But the backlash against foreigners is now escalating into hatred, racism and xenophobia. Such racism also affects relations between the three major races in Singapore and incidents such as that racist tweet are becoming more common.</p>
              <p>My best JC friend is a foreign student. Her work ethic puts most Singaporeans to shame. She may appear aloof, but she is very nice to those who know her. I have a severe physical disability and am very grateful to her for accepting and supporting me, unlike most Singaporeans. Remember that there are good foreigners too. Promoting racial harmony is also important to educate foreigners who came from ethnically homogenous nations.</p>

              <p>Since when did the UK or Australia have any open FT policy? They have strong labor laws to protect their citizens from getting disadvantaged by any foreign worker.</p>

              <p>Foreigners who wanna work there at least must have a skill in demand to qualify a work permit !!</p>
              <p>In Singapore, any Tom, Dick, and Harry could easily gain access without so much of a skill.</p>
              <p>Can any Singaporean gain easy access to these countries ? A Big NO !!</p>

                      I see your point  lah ! Are you stuck in Spore and very unhappy?  If so  then  there are many ways you can apply for Aussie land New Zealand or Canada ..1) Get a job with the skills they require - then apply for emigration. 2) Get a student pass first and get to do a course  or uni in those countries  then slowly explore opportunities. 3)  be a foreign bride lor! Aiya if you are young and energetic  and resourceful- no problems! there is always a place somewhere in the world you would be able to be happy with and call home,,,right? Grumbling and getting angry gets you  no where,  right?
