              <p>YOUR report ('Rise of the megachurches'; July 17), and in particular 
              its reference to Pastor Joseph Prince's father as 'an often drunk Sikh 
              priest...', displayed an unacceptable disregard for minority religions 
              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is entirely up to Pastor Prince to decide how he wishes 
              to describe his own father. But a national newspaper in a country which 
              prides itself on racial and religious harmony should have known better 
              than to report it.</p>
              <p>When a mainstream newspaper reports such a comment, it 
              conveys a false caricature of Sikh priests as drunkards and 
              irresponsible fathers. It also suggests that there was good reason for 
              Pastor Prince to convert from Sikhism to another religion.</p>
              <p>The report could have simply mentioned that his father was a
               drunkard. There was absolutely no reason for the reference to the 
              father's religion.</p>
              <p>The report has hurt the feelings of the Sikh community in 
              Singapore.</p>

              <p>1. The pastor was wrong to have used such a phrase. Seriously, what's with the whole 'drunk Sikh priest' thing? Would it be too hard to just say 'My father was a drunkard'?</p>
              <p>2. The newspaper editor should have noted the slur and simply changed it to 'The pastor described his father as a drunkard '.</p>

              <p>you're starting to sound like the kid up there ......</p>
              <p>let's consider this question. Why should the newspaper have any agenda at all, whether to make the pastor look a little better, by censoring out what he said about his sikh father, or bad, by simply repeating the pastor's own words ?</p>
              <p>The issue here is straightforward, to try to warp and stretch it by getting so philosophical about it is just silly, period. What is there about this particular incident to read so deeply into ? This is not the goverment trying to telling you foreigners are good for you, or that HDB resale are still affordable, mate ! *geez ...</p>
              <p>here's a rephrase of the question I posed to the kid; what sort of hidden agenda do you think exist ? Was it to insidiously make the sikhs look bad by printing what the pastor said ? or to insidiously make the pastor look bad by by printing what the pastor said ??</p>

              <h3>Jul 27, 2010 - ST Forum<br></h3>
              <h1>Reference to pastor's father was ill judged</h1>
              <p>YOUR report ('Rise of the megachurches'; July 17), and in particular its reference to Pastor Joseph Prince's father as 'an often drunk Sikh priest...', displayed an unacceptable disregard for minority religions in Singapore.</p>
              <p>It is entirely up to Pastor Prince to decide how he wishes to describe his own father. But a national newspaper in a country which prides itself on racial and religious harmony should have known better than to report it.</p>
              <p>When a mainstream newspaper reports such a comment, it conveys a false caricature of Sikh priests as drunkards and irresponsible fathers. It also suggests that there was good reason for Pastor Prince to convert from Sikhism to another religion.</p>
              <p>The report could have simply mentioned that his father was a drunkard. There was absolutely no reason for the reference to the father's religion.</p>
              <p>The report has hurt the feelings of the Sikh community in Singapore.</p>
