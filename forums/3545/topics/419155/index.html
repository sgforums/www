              <p>A MEMBER of the public went the extra mile on Wednesday by helping to 
              detain two youth suspects who were believed to be involved in a case of 
              snatch theft at Pasir Ris St 53.</p>
              <p>On Wednesday afternoon at about 1.45pm, a 70-year-old woman 
              was walking along the pavement of Pasir Ris St 53 when she noticed a 
              young couple behind her. One of them, a youth, ran towards the victim 
              and snatched her handbag.</p>
              <p>The suspect then fled the scene on foot with the handbag, 
              which contained about $66 in cash and other personal documents, while 
              his female companion walked off in another direction.</p>
              <p>Alerted by the victim's cries for help, a member of public 
              who happened to be in the vicinity responded immediately and stopped the
               female companion from leaving before calling the police. Then, spotting
               the male suspect at a nearby block, the member of the public managed to
               detain him as well.</p>
              <p>Shortly after, officers from Bedok Police Division arrived 
              at the scene and took custody of both suspects. The victim's valuables 
              were also successfully recovered from the male suspect.</p>
              <p>The 18-year-old male suspect will be charged in court on 
              Friday for the snatch theft, which carries a maximum punishment of seven
               years imprisonment and caning. The 15-year-old female suspect has been 
              released on bail pending further investigations.</p>
              <p>Acting Commander of Bedok Police Division, Superintendent of
               Police Jarrod Pereira commended the member of the public for his 
              public-spiritedness and said: 'This arrest showcases the importance and 
              effectiveness of police-community partnership in the fight against 
              crime.'</p>
