              <p><strong>Aug 9, 2011 - ST Forum</strong></p>
              <p>MY PARENTS and grandparents are very disturbed by the fact that 
              National Environment Agency (NEA) officers can now force their way into 
              an owner's house after just one unsuccessful home visit ('Easier to 
              check homes for mosquitoes now: Vivian'; last Saturday).</p>
              <p>While we understand that it is important to 
              keep our homes and surroundings free from mosquito breeding, are we 
              expected to apply for leave just to stay at home and wait for the NEA 
              inspection?</p>
              <p>My father recently had an unpleasant experience with 
              two NEA officers who entered the house without his consent while he was 
              occupied in the backyard. When my father questioned them, only one of 
              them apologised while the other unabashedly continued his 'routine' 
              inspection. This is unprofessional and uncalled for.</p>
              <p>A good relationship between the NEA and 
              residents should be one forged on the basis of mutual respect and 
              understanding - not one of fear, apprehension and cynicism.</p>
              <p>I hope the relevant authorities can clarify their stand on this matter.</p>

              <h1><span style="color: #000000;"> Forced home entries a last resort: NEA </span></h1>
              <p><strong>Aug 11, 2011 - ST Forum</strong></p>
              <p>WE THANK Mr Andy Tan for his letter 'Disturbed by new protocol on 
              home checks for mosquitoes' (Tuesday) and agree with him on the need for
               a good and close working relationship.</p>
              <p>We assure the public that the enhanced 
              protocols for faster home checks will be used for dengue clusters where 
              lives could be at stake. It will be used only as a last resort when all 
              attempts to contact home owners are unsuccessful.</p>
              <p>During routine inspections, the National Environment 
              Agency (NEA) officers would normally arrange for a return visit if the 
              premises are vacant. In the event of a dengue cluster, the NEA will step
               up its inspections. Should any premises be vacant, our officers will 
              attempt to make another visit, failing which a legal notice under 
              Section 35 of the Control of Vectors and Pesticides Act (CVPA) will be 
              served to require the owner/occupant to arrange an appointment.</p>
              <p>If the owners ignore the notice and 
              attempts to contact them via their neighbours, grassroots and 
              neighbourhood police fail, only then will we invoke Section 36 of the 
              CVPA to allow us entry within the shortest time possible.</p>
              <p>Every day of delay increases the risk to residents. 
              All such entries will be supervised by senior NEA officers, as well as 
              town council representatives. Thereafter, the premises will be resecured
               and a notice will be left in the mailbox to advise the owner to contact
               NEA for the keys.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan also referred to inspections by NEA officers. 
              We wish to clarify that NEA inspectors are required to seek permission 
              from residents before entering their compounds. Residents should 
              authenticate the identity of NEA officers through their authority cards 
              and/or call the NEA Call Centre on 1800 CALL NEA (1800-2255-632). 
              Samples of these cards can be viewed at <a href="http://app2.nea.gov.sg/">http://app2.nea.gov.sg/advisory_nea_officer.aspx</a></p>
              <p>The number of dengue cases last week was 218 which is
               lower than the previous week. However, dengue still remains a threat to
               all of us and we should not let our guard down.</p>
              <p>The NEA will continue to educate the public on dengue
               and work closely with the community to tackle the threat. If all 
              stakeholders play their part, we will be able to reduce the incidence of
               dengue in Singapore.</p>
