              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE - Being hard of hearing is no longer only an 
              affliction of the elderly. More younger people, particularly men, are 
              also being affected by the problem these days.<br><br>Statistics from 
              the Changi General Hospital (CGH) show that 40 per cent of those 
              diagnosed with hearing loss are younger than 40 years old.<br><br>This 
              figure is a two-fold jump from what CGH was seeing five to eight years 
              ago.<br><br>Dr Yuen Heng Wai, a consultant otolaryngologist at CGH, 
              explaining this trend, said males - more so than females - are more 
              frequently exposed to noise such as that at night outlets and from audio
               devices.<br><br>Acknowledging that higher awareness of the issue could 
              contribute to the figures, Dr Yuen is, however, more concerned about 
              getting youth to seek treatment.<br><br>"To them it is a big blow ... as
               hearing loss has always been associated with old age ... they feel they
               have become less complete (and stigmatised)," said Dr Yuen.<br><br>To 
              make matters worse, these hearing-impaired youths are resisting the use 
              of hearing aids.<br><br>At Raffles Hospital, one to two young men - 
              between the ages of 15 and 30 - are seen every week for the treatment of
               hearing difficulties.<br><br>The hospital's specialist in ENT surgery, 
              Dr Stephen Lee, noted that "there has been a perceptible increase" over 
              the past two years. He recommends that those who use audio devices go 
              for a test at least once to check if their hearing ability has been 
              affected.<br><br>Engaging in water sports is another emerging cause.<br><br>Bacteria
               in dirty water stays in the ear and causes discomfort, said Dr Yuen of 
              CGH. When patients try to ease the discomfort by "sticking all sorts of 
              things" into their ears, the situation worsens.<br><br>In the past year 
              alone, he has seen more than 10 patients who have experienced hearing 
              problems after swimming in places like the Kallang River and the sea off
               Batam Island.<br><br>There is also the need for regulation of working 
              conditions in sectors such as the construction industry, suggested Dr 
              Raymond Ngo, consultant at the National University Hospital's Department
               of Otolaryngology. He cited his concern over young construction workers
               and their constant exposure to excessive levels of loud noise.<br><br>But,
               fortunately, only a few of the afflicted have suffered total 
              irreversible hearing loss as most recover partial or full hearing 
              capacity after treatment.<br><br>One safety guideline for those who 
              could suffer impaired hearing would be to seek treatment if they 
              experience difficulty in understanding what others are saying or having 
              to ask them to repeat themselves, said Associate Professor Low Wong 
              Kein, director of the Centre for Hearing and Ear Implants at Singapore 
              General Hospital.<br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/rl</span> </span></p>
