              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong has again spoken of the need for Members of 
              Parliament (MPs) to stay connected with the people and enhance efforts 
              at bonding with residents.<br><br>This was after he revealed there had 
              been criticisms of the shortcomings of grassroots activists both in the 
              People's Action Party (PAP) and People's Association, in the aftermath 
              of the recent General Election.<br><br>Speaking at a dinner to thank 
              volunteers of Ang Mo Kio Group Representation Constituency (GRC), PM Lee
               acknowledged some of the criticisms were about MPs being shielded from 
              residents, not being responsive enough to the needs of residents, and 
              not candid enough in giving feedback.<br><br>Mr Lee's reiteration of the
               importance of engaging residents came just after his release on Friday 
              of the Rules of Prudence to all PAP members where he said "the elections
               have shown that voters have concerns which need to be addressed. <br><br>"The
               government will have to significantly improve our outreach to voters, 
              our approach to formulating policies, and our policies themselves. <br><br>"As
               MPs, you play key roles in all these areas. You have to listen hard to 
              voter concerns, help them to tackle pressing needs, reflect their 
              worries and aspirations to the government and persuade them to support 
              policies which are in their own long-term benefit".<br><br>Mr Lee, who 
              is also Secretary-General of the PAP, said clearly there were problems 
              which were missed and areas where the party can and must improve.<br><br>These
               include strengthening the party's presence on the ground, improving the
               way MPs and the grassroots network operate with more effective ways to 
              bond with residents, and reaching out to groups which the party needs to
               better connect with, including young adults, and residents who live in 
              private estates.<br><br>Mr Lee vowed to remedy the shortcomings and work hard to consolidate the PAP's support and strive to do better next time.<br><br>He
               stressed he would not blame the activists as the majority have 
              committed enormous time and energy to community work, and have done 
              their best to serve the residents.<br><br>He said volunteers and 
              activists have given their honest feedback, which unfortunately the 
              party sometimes failed to interpret correctly.<br><br>He said he hopes they will not be discouraged, but continue to work for the good of their residents.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
