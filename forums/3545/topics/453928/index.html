              Temasek Holdings Pte said the turmoil in Europe may result in a market slump rivaling the 2008 global financial crisis, creating opportunities for the Singapore state-owned investment company to make deals.
              
              Temasek, which managed S$193 billion ($150 billion) as of March 2011, may fund European companies expanding in growth markets like Asia and Latin America, or form ventures with firms seeking mergers or acquisitions, Chief Investment Officer Tan Chong Lee said in a June 11 interview. Temasek is prepared to make â€œsizableâ€� deals topping S$1 billion, he said.

              The MSCI World Index (MXWO) slumped 9 percent in May, its worst monthly performance in two years, as Europeâ€™s debt crisis intensified, the U.S. recovery showed signs of losing steam and growth slowed in China and India. European officials have tried to contain the situation as Spain sought a bailout of 100 billion euros ($125 billion) for its banks and a Greek vote this weekend may decide whether the country stays in the euro zone.
              
              â€œWe do not discount the possibility that another severe round of major dislocation could actually result from the current European crisis,â€� said Tan, 50. â€œItâ€™s hard to quantify or predict the magnitude of the potential correction, but one would imagine that there is no less reason why another major correction would not be as bad or worse than the global financial crisis that we saw back in 2008.â€�
              
              The European Unionâ€™s construct has created â€œinherent instabilityâ€� in the system, which is unlikely to improve until structural changes are made, Tan said at Temasekâ€™s headquarters.
              Investment Proposals
              
              Temasek is assessing investment proposals in areas it wants to focus on, such as retail, luxury, technology, health care, biotechnology and insurance, Tan said. These also fit its aim to invest in markets with a rising middle-income population.
              
              â€œGlobal markets are going to see a lot of volatility,â€� said Catherine Yeung, Hong Kong-based investment director at Fidelity Investment Management Ltd., which had $1.62 trillion of total managed assets as of March. â€œIt is important for investors to search for those growth opportunities and many of those growth opportunities lie in Asia Pacific.â€�
              
              Investments in Europe and North America make up 8 percent of Temasekâ€™s assets, trailing assets in Singapore and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. Past European investments that exceeded $1 billion include its 2 percent stake in London-based Barclays Plc, which it has sold, and 18 percent of Standard Chartered Plc (STAN), making it the U.K. bankâ€™s biggest shareholder.
              â€˜Return Requirementsâ€™
              
              â€œIn this environment, weâ€™re seeing sizable opportunities come our way and we are carefully evaluating those opportunities,â€� said Tan, whoâ€™s also considering smaller ventures. â€œWe are currently net cash, which means that we have the full flexibility to undertake significant transactions provided it meets our return requirements.â€�
              
              Temasekâ€™s assets slumped 30 percent to S$130 billion in the year ended March 2009 amid the global financial crisis when it sold its stake in Bank of America Corp. at a loss. The companyâ€™s holdings rebounded to S$186 billion the following year, and reached S$193 billion at the end of March 2011, according to Temasekâ€™s annual reports.
              
              Tan was hired in September from Bank of Americaâ€™s Merrill Lynch unit, where he was the Southeast Asia head of corporate and investment banking. Tan is also Temasekâ€™s co-head of the Americas alongside Boon Sim, who joined as president of North America this month from Credit Suisse Group AG. Sim was global head of mergers and acquisitions at the Swiss bank.
              
              Temasek, which is run by Chief Executive Officer Ho Ching, also hired John Cryan, the former chief financial officer of UBS AG (UBSN), as president for Europe in January.
              Holding Back
              
              While Temasek plans to be â€œnaturally cautiousâ€� with investments amid the crisis, according to Tan, stock market volatility is holding back others.
              
              CSR Corp., Chinaâ€™s biggest trainmaker by market value, is unlikely to act on proposed acquisitions in Europe this year because of concerns about the regionâ€™s economy and the future of its single currency, Chairman Zhao Xiaogang said in a June 8 interview in Beijing.
              
              â€œWe donâ€™t think itâ€™s time to actually enter,â€� said Kelvin Tay, chief investment strategist at UBS Wealth Management in Singapore. â€œWe are still advocating a cautious stance. It takes years, if not decades for all these issues to be completely resolved,â€� citing Europeâ€™s competitiveness, trade unions and unemployment.
              
              Tan said Temasekâ€™s holdings in financial services companies, which made up 36 percent of its assets as of March 2011, will continue to be an important part of its investments.
              
              â€œBanks are a very good proxy for riding on the growth of a particular economy or economies,â€� Tan said. â€œI donâ€™t see us diminishing or reducing our exposure in the financial services space.â€�
              Danamon Deal
              
              Temasek made its biggest deal in more than a decade in April with the pending sale of its 67 percent stake in PT Bank Danamon Indonesia to DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast Asiaâ€™s biggest bank. DBS will pay for Temasekâ€™s stake in the Indonesian bank with $4.9 billion of new stock, increasing its share of the Singapore bank to 40.4 percent from 29.5 percent.
              
              The transaction, also the largest in the regionâ€™s banking industry, faces headwinds as Indonesia threatens to restrict foreign ownership of its lenders. Foreigners are currently allowed to own 99 percent of an Indonesian bank.
              
              In China, Temasek sold $2.48 billion of shares in Bank of China Ltd. (3988) and China Construction Bank Corp. (939) in May, less than a month after paying $2.3 billion for shares in Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China Ltd. Temasek, which continues to hold more than $17 billion in Chinese bank shares, said the recent sales were part of a â€œrebalancingâ€� after the investment in ICBC, the worldâ€™s biggest bank by market value.
              
              â€œWe continue to believe in the long-term potential of China,â€� Tan said.
