              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A 
              22-year-old student was fined S$2,000 for perverting the course of 
              justice by bribing a property agent to take the blame for a traffic 
              offence she committed on January 22, 2008.<br><br>Evangeline Tay Su Ann could have been jailed up to seven years, fined or both.<br><br>Despite this, her lawyer, Lim Kia Tong, told the court that his client will still be appealing against her sentence.<br><br>Before
               sentencing the slim, fair-complexioned Tay, District Judge Jill Tan 
              said that it was not necessary to send the student to jail.<br><br>Tay was suffering from depression at the time of the offence and is undergoing treatment to address her condition.<br><br>Her psychiatrist has also noted an improvement in her condition, the court heard on Tuesday.<br><br>Judge Tan added that Tay has a low risk of re-offending and has been on the right side of the law since 2008.<br><br>Tay, who pleaded guilty to the offence in September last year, had driven her housemate's car without his consent.<br><br>She also did not possess a valid driving licence at the time.<br><br>Tay beat a red traffic signal as she was driving at the junction of Lornie Road and Sime Road.<br><br>As a result, her housemate received a summons from the Traffic Police in February 2008.<br><br>Tay
               approached 39-year-old Kelvin Choo Yew Beng, a former Police Deputy 
              Superintendent, and asked him to help her out of her predicament.<br><br>He managed to rope in 34-year-old Leung Man Kwan, who received S$1,000 from Tay for taking the blame on her behalf.<br><br>Tay
               transferred the money to Choo on 19 February 2008 and in turn, he 
              passed the amount over to Leung via an internet bank transfer.<br><br>Tay had already been fined a total of S$1,900 last year for her traffic offences.<br><br>For
               their roles in the ruse, Choo was jailed for six months in March, last 
              year, while Leung was jailed for three months in 2009.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>

              <p>yup, $2000 so cheap still want to appeal.</p>
              <p>Suffering depression is not a good enough excuse, might as well say colour blind.</p>
