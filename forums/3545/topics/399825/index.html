              <h1 class="storyheadline">Green study disregards Singapore's circumstances</h1>
              <p>THE study by the National University of Singapore and the University 
              of Adelaide reported in Friday's article ('Is Singapore the worst 
              environmental offender?') ranked Singapore, with Japan, Denmark, New 
              Zealand and Iceland, among the 20 worst-ranked countries on proportional
               environmental impact.</p>
              <p>The 10 best-ranked countries were Cape Verde, Central 
              African Republic, Swaziland, Antigua and Barbuda, Niger, Grenada, Samoa,
               Tonga, Djibouti and Tajikistan.</p>
              <p>However, the study compares cities like Singapore with large
               countries such as Australia, Britain and Japan. A more realistic 
              comparison would be with cities like Sydney, London or Tokyo.</p>
              <p>It is surprising that many of the findings are not borne out
               by facts.</p>
              <p>For example, Singapore is ranked fourth worst in its water 
              pollution index. It ignores our investing in a comprehensive used-water 
              network to ensure that all used water is collected and treated prior to 
              discharge into the watercourse.</p>
              <p>Our treated used water meets even more stringent standards 
              than the European Union's.</p>
              <p>The study grossly inflates Singapore's emissions by 
              including emissions from bunker fuels sold to ships and aircraft 
              transiting Singapore.</p>
              <p>This deviates from internationally accepted norms and 
              unfairly penalises Singapore, which is a major international maritime 
              and aviation hub. Under the United Nations (UN) Framework Convention for
               Climate Change, emissions from international bunker sales are excluded 
              because the emissions take place outside of Singapore.</p>
              <p>In fact, Singapore reduced its carbon intensity by 40 per 
              cent from 1990 to 2007.</p>
              <p>One author (Navjot Sodhi) claimed that Singapore lost 90 per
               cent of its forests due to rapid development in the last 30 years. This
               is untrue. Much original forest cover was lost prior to Singapore's 
              independence in 1965. To preserve what remained, we have by law 
              conserved nature reserves and implemented species recovery programmes.</p>
              <p>This, together with an islandwide network of parks and 
              streetscape, enabled Singapore's green cover to grow to almost 50 per 
              cent of the island. Despite rapid development, we have retained a 
              diversity of flora and fauna, including more than 2,000 native plant 
              species and 350 bird species. We continue to discover new species and 
              re-discover species previously thought extinct.</p>
              <p>We recognise the need for a scientifically credible and 
              robust evaluation tool to measure biodiversity conservation efforts in 
              cities. That is why Singapore is developing a City Biodiversity Index, 
              in partnership with the United Nations' Convention on Biological 
              Diversity, as a tool for cities to evaluate their progress in reducing 
              the rate of biodiversity loss.</p>
              <p>The index will be a more appropriate index to evaluate 
              biodiversity and good governance in cities.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Why researchers included Singapore in green study</h1>
              <p>WE WELCOME Wednesday's reply from the Ministry of the Environment and 
              Water Resources and Ministry of National Development ('Green study 
              disregards Singapore's circumstances') to last Friday's article, 'Is 
              Singapore the worst environmental offender?', which highlighted the 
              recent publication of our paper in PLoS One.</p>
              <p>In a telephone interview with The Straits Times reporter, 
              Professor Navjot Sodhi mentioned that Singapore had lost large amounts 
              of forests and species. We do not know how the phrase 'past 30 years' 
              was added to this statement.</p>
              <p>Another author, Mr Xingli Giam, had replied in an e-mail to 
              the reporter that 'in Singapore's case, deforestation was almost 
              complete by the end of the 19th century - primary forests were felled 
              for cash crop agriculture'.</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that we agree with the ministries that 
              these losses occurred between the late 1800s and early parts of the 
              1900s, well prior to Singapore's independence.</p>
              <p>As for the inclusion of emissions from bunker fuels, we 
              believe that bunker fuel should be accounted for in the environmental 
              impact rankings.</p>
              <p>By including the carbon emissions generated by bunker fuels,
               we are taking into account the environmental trade-off generated by 
              this often-excluded aspect of fuel consumption. However, we recognise 
              that this approach over-estimates the environmental impact to ports and 
              under-estimates the environmental impact to the home country of the 
              ships.</p>
              <p>Prof Navjot, in the telephone interview with the reporter, 
              had conceded that the study could be perceived by some as less than fair
               to Singapore and that more meaningful comparisons of environmental 
              impact could have been made with other major cities such as New York 
              City and Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, we thought it was still appropriate to include
               Singapore in this country-level study.</p>
              <p>We are acutely aware of Singapore's constraints and 
              environmental management initiatives.</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that Singapore has done well, particularly
               in recent years, in terms of good environmental practices.</p>
              <p>We sincerely hope that our study will be taken in a positive
               light and encourage those involved in environmental management to see 
              if more can be done for the environment in the years to come.</p>
              <p>We believe that good environmental management is the key to 
              human survival and well-being.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Face up to the green fact</h1>
              <p>IN A recent response by government officials to the study that ranks 
              countries for their environmental impact ("Green study disregards 
              Singapore's circumstances"; last Wednesday), the defence given for our 
              environmental record was the increase in green cover and our high 
              diversity of flora and fauna.</p>
              <p>However, almost half of this green cover (56 per cent of 
              Singapore's total land area) consists of golf courses, lawns, landscaped
               parks and streetscapes (27.5 per cent of the land area). Ecologically, 
              these are a far cry from forest cover, exhibiting impoverished 
              biodiversity.</p>
              <p>The rest of the green cover is under old-growth forest, 
              which houses most of our native biodiversity, and this makes up only 3 
              per cent of the land area.</p>
              <p>It is also important to note that of the "more than 2,000 
              native plant species" mentioned by the letter, more than 600 are already
               extinct in Singapore. Of the remaining native species, close to 1,200 
              are endangered and restricted to the fragments of old-growth forests 
              remaining in the nature reserves, and are highly vulnerable to 
              unpredictable effects such as climate change.</p>
              <p>As for the bird species, about half of the 350 are 
              non-residents, while of the resident species about 20 per cent is 
              conservatively estimated to be extinct. Taken in context, the occasional
               rediscoveries of supposedly extinct species have a negligible 
              significance, and only highlights our incomplete knowledge.</p>
              <p>Therefore, we should face up to the fact that our rapid 
              economic development has come at an environmental price. Only then can 
              we become wiser and pursue economic growth sustainably, and if possible,
               undo past damage.</p>
              <p>We share the hope of the Ministry of the Environment and 
              Water Resources and Ministry of National Development that the City 
              Biodiversity Index will be a fairer measure to gauge urban sustainable 
              development. If so, this will be more fruitful than dwelling on the 
              current state of affairs.</p>
