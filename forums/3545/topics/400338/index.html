              <h1 class="storyheadline">Little protection for older workers</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Thursday's letter, "Less than 3% of private firms cut 
              older workers' wages", sent in jointly by the Singapore National 
              Employers Federation, Ministry of Manpower and National Trades Union 
              Congress.</p>
              <p>Employers in Singapore have the flexibility to terminate an 
              older worker for a variety of reasons, including restructuring and 
              outsourcing. This has been practised quite often in the private and 
              public sectors. There is little need for them to keep workers until age 
              60 to have their wages reduced under the Retirement Age Act. This 
              probably accounts for the low percentage of employers exercising this 
              wage cut.</p>
              <p>I cite the case of a friend who has worked for 11 years in 
              regional business development for a local insurance company. He was 
              rated a good performer by the previous management. Recently, with a 
              change of top management, he was asked to leave and was offered a 
              compensation of only three months of salary.</p>
              <p>He asked for my assistance on how to make an appeal to the 
              Ministry of Manpower, as he still has a family and a sick elderly mother
               to support.</p>
              <p>I hope that our tripartite partners will recognise this type
               of difficulty faced by many Singaporeans. The current employment 
              practices offer little protection to workers, especially older ones, 
              when the top management outsources the work to contractors to reduce 
              their costs or replaces senior people with their own buddies.</p>
