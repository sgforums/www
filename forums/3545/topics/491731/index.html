Retired owner-parents who now feel burdened by inflation linked cost of living pressures and in need of gahmen subsidies for healthcare, siver-support $$$, higher GST rebate payouts etc are thus tempted to kick their kids and grandma out of the home so as to downgrade to a smaller HDB flat (to gain more access to such subsidies/ benefits).<br>There is thus little logic for the majority of singles/ newlyweds to stay apart from their parents except for the pressure of gahmen policy which divides many families who if given the choice would have prefered to stay united.<br>Many newlywed children, once burdened with the mortgage payments for their new HDB flat, find it difficult to find time to be with their parents possibly resulting in strained family ties. The grandkids also cannot remember grandma's name.<br><br>2) Decrease in birth rates:<br>- It is already VERY expensive to bring up kids in Singapore, it seems a double whammy as just as the kids are growing up and need more space to themselves (boys and girls might want a room each to themselves), parents have to weigh their higher costs of upkeep (education, daily needs) plus the costs of a bigger HDB flat versus the loss of multiple gahmen subsidies ranging from educational bursaries to healthcare (CHAS card/ medishield-life premiums) for the kids to GST credits + utility rebate reductions affecting the entire family. Some families survive the ordeal whilst others find themselves sandwiched due to obsolete/ blunderbuss gahmen means testing policy, with their subsequent negativity putting the brakes on the child rearing intentions of all couples around them.<br><br>The Singapore gahmen claims to have the welfare of all Singaporeans, old, young and yet to be born at heart, but turns a blind eye to the pain that their outdated, obsolete and inaccurate method of means testing is causing. <br><br>By the time too many Singaporeans have fallen through the enlarging cracks, maybe the PAP themselves will fall through too... and then a new dawn of politics in Singapore is born.<br><br>

These include broad-based schemes such as healthcare, education and training subsidies such as the SkillsFuture credit, marriage and parenthood package, lower foreign domestic worker levies for those with young children or elderly, as well as senior citizen transport concession.<br><br>She was responding to Mr Edwin Tong, Member of Parliament (MP) for Marine Parade GRC, who suggested the Government review its means-testing criteria so those who require assistance do not fall through the cracks. For instance, he said <strong>there are some living in private estates who may have little or no regular income. But because of the “good annual value” of their homes, they do not qualify for many of the social schemes that they might need to get by.</strong><br><br>“To this group of people, annual value is indeed something of a misnomer. And it is really no answer to tell these people that they should sell their homes and live off the remaining proceeds of the sale.<br><br>“<strong>We will only be dislocating many of them from their homes, the environment they are comfortable with, and this would directly undermine efforts at fostering social fabric within our communities here</strong>,” Mr Tong said.<br><br>His sentiment echoed that of other MPs such as Mr Zaqy Mohamad (Chua Chu Kang GRC) and Mr Lim Biow Chuan (Mountbatten SMC) who, during the Budget debate last week, urged the Government to<strong> remove housing type as a criterion for the Silver Support Scheme</strong>.<br><br>Ms Sim said appeals by those “who are in need and in exceptional circumstances” will be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis. “We will continue to review our means-testing criteria across all schemes to ensure that our assistance is targeted at those who need (it) most,” she added. <br><br>Lee Yen Nee<br><br><a style="color: #005688;" href="http://www.todayonline.com/business/annual-value-home-best-available-proxy-means-testing">http://www.todayonline.com/business/...-means-testing</a></td>
