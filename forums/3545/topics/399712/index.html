              <h1 class="storyheadline">Tackle organisational littering</h1>
              <p>DESPITE all the public education, we are still faced with a littering 
              problem that seems to be getting worse, and I can guess why. It is 
              because besides individuals doing it, some corporations or organisations
               appear not to take the issue seriously and are guilty of the same.</p>
              <p>I run nearly every morning at Pasir Ris Beach Park, and the 
              littering around the barbecue pits are a total disgrace, more so after a
               Saturday night.</p>
              <p>I wrote to NParks about this, but all I received was a reply
               to say that they already had a team of rangers to patrol the park. Yet 
              why has the problem not been tackled?</p>
              <p>I have also seen schools organising activities there, like 
              treasure hunts and games involving plastic bags of water bombs. The next
               day, the students leave behind ugly reminders of their presence - sheet
               of paper clues, plastic bags, coloured tape on the ground, and so on.</p>
              <p>Recently, NTUC Club organised a running event at the park. 
              The red and white colour cordon tape to mark part of the running route 
              (near to BBQ Pit 62) were still left lying there two days after the 
              event.</p>
              <p>If we punish individuals for littering, shouldn't we do the 
              same with organisations that leave behind their rubbish?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">NTUC Club: We did our part in clean-up</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the letter by Mr Peh Chwee Hoe ("Tackle organisational 
              littering"; May 18).</p>
              <p>In the running event that NTUC Club organised on May 9, an 
              event company was engaged and that included cleaning and disposing of 
              litter. We have confirmed with the company, Avivar Audience 
              Communications, that its crew and cleaners did perform all the necessary
               cleaning before, during and after the event to remove all litter and 
              dispose of it appropriately. To ensure that no litter was left in the 
              area after the event, its cleaning officer-in-charge inspected the 
              entire route as a secondary check.</p>
              <p>As vehicles are allowed into the park only on weekdays, the 
              removal of barricades, signs and props was done the next day on May 10, 
              where once again, another check was done by the operation 
              officer-in-charge to ensure that all the litter was removed.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Take ownership of clearing litter</h1>
              <p>NTUC Club's reply ("NTUC Club: We did our part in clean-up") last 
              Friday said the management of the event and waste disposal was left 
              entirely to an event management company.</p>
              <p>As to my seeing red-white cordon tapes at Pasir Ris Beach 
              Park ("Tackle organisational littering"; May 18) two days after it held 
              its running race on May 9, it said it had checked with the event company
               to confirm all rubbish had been cleared.</p>
              <p>It seems NTUC Club is leaving everything to the event 
              management company, even when a complaint had been lodged that suggested
               something was amiss.</p>
              <p>We will continue to have a littering problem if 
              organisations do not take this problem seriously.</p>
