              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Former 
              SMRT CEO Saw Phaik Hwa has continued to share her side of the story on 
              her personal blog, with a post on Saturday on how her leadership helped 
              to raise SMRT's revenue, preventing "huge fare increases". <br><br>Ms 
              Saw, who resigned in January after two major train service breakdowns on
               the North-South Line in December, said one of her main tasks when she 
              joined the company nine years ago was to improve the bottom line. <br><br>"This
               was the first time I was faced with a business whereby costs escalated 
              quickly but revenue did not grow at the same pace. Ridership was growing
               at a steady but slow two per cent annually, with limited or no fare 
              increase," said Ms Saw, whose retail background and suitability to run 
              SMRT had come under fire in the wake of the breakdowns. <br><br>As the 
              company "can never cut corners" to improve margins, the "most obvious 
              opportunity" was to make full use of its station assets - the space. <br><br>Ms
               Saw said the monies brought in from maximising retail and advertising 
              space benefited commuters. SMRT managed to raise commercial revenue from
               S$28 million to more than S$100 million, "averting the need for huge 
              fare increases". <br><br>Other key challenges when she became CEO 
              included improving LRT services, which were suffering multiple 
              stoppages, and managing the merger with TIBS.<br><br>"Delving deeper, we
               realised that the LRT was run as a separate company, not only legally 
              but also in every way. For example, the strong SMRT train team was not 
              involved in the running of the LRT trains," she said. "Thus, it was not 
              surprising that the young LRT team was in over its head. Its actions 
              were mainly stop-gap measures."<br><br>The company's train management 
              eventually merged with SMRT, and problems like its "badly-commissioned 
              geoloc system" and complicated power system were tackled. <br><br>As for
               the TIBS merger, which faced resistance due to "turf pride", Ms Saw 
              said this was eventually resolved by consulting all its staff on 
              defining its mission. <br><br>Ms Saw also addressed the criticism to her starting a blog, saying the negative comments did not surprise her. <br><br>She
               wrote: "Friends ask me to respond but I don't feel a need to. If you 
              have enjoyed what I've posted so far (and I know it's not a lot), thank 
              you for reading. If you have not found it interesting, then perhaps an 
              alternative blog or website might better suit you. I leave it up to 
              you."<br><br>Her last day at SMRT is April 5. <br><br>- </span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a></span></p>
