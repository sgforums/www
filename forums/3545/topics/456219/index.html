              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) on Wednesday revised its 2012 
              consumer inflation forecast for Singapore to 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent 
              from 3.5 per cent to 4.5 per cent. <br><br>This is because the central bank expects housing rentals and COE premiums to remain high.<br><br>However, the MAS kept unchanged its core inflation forecast of 2.5 per cent - 3.0 per cent for the year. <br><br>The
               MAS core inflation measure, which excludes costs for accommodation and 
              private road transport, moderated to 2.7 per cent in the April-to-June 
              quarter.<br><br>"It (core inflation) is likely to ease further and 
              approach 2 per cent by the end of the year. This is not far from the 
              historical average of 1.7 per cent," MAS managing director Ravi Menon 
              said at a news conference.<br><br>Local food inflation should remain relatively contained for the rest of the year, he added. <br><br>However, economists warn that food prices could trend up.<br><br>"We
               do have El Nino, there is potential risk of supply disruptions, we've 
              already seen inflation of certain food items from the US suffering from 
              the drought including higher wheat prices, higher corn prices," Song 
              Seng Wun, regional economist from CIMB, said.<br><br>Official figures on
               Monday showed Singapore's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation rate 
              rose to 5.3 per cent year-on-year in June from 5.0 per cent the previous
               month. The CPI rose by 5.1 per cent in the first half of the year, down
               from 5.5 per cent in the second half of 2011.<br><br>Mr Menon said 
              bringing down inflation remains one of the central bank's top 
              priorities. To keep inflation in check, MAS has tightened its monetary 
              policy to allow the Singdollar to appreciate.<br><br>"Our simulations 
              show that if this appreciation had not taken place, CPI-All Items 
              inflation this year would have been 6.5 to 7 per cent, rather than the 4
               to 4.5 per cent we have projected," he said.<br><br>The MAS said its current monetary policy stance remains appropriate.<br><br>The next monetary review is due in October. <br><br>UOB's
               senior economist, Alvin Liew, said: "Against the inflation outlook, it 
              is hard to see whether they (MAS) can tilt the monetary policy towards 
              an easing bias. Tightening is not on the cards as well, as the growth 
              outlook is on the weaker side for 2012." <br><br>On Singapore's economic
               outlook, MAS retained its projection that the economy would grow 
              between 1 per cent and 3 per cent this year. <br><br>But Mr Menon warned
               that Singapore's economic growth could dip below 1 per cent for 2012 if
               several downside risks take a turn for the worse.<br><br>These 
              scenarios include a recession in the US, significant escalation of the 
              eurozone crisis and a "hard landing" for China's economy. <br><br>Still,
               growth momentum is slowing and the MAS expects average growth in the 
              second half to be lower than the first six months of the year. <br><br>Singapore's gross domestic product grew an average of 4.2 per cent in the first half of 2012. <br><br>Mr
               Menon also said a deeper recession and a credit crunch in the eurozone 
              will affect trade and could cause a credit squeeze in the financial 
              system.<br><br>"But our financial system is sound and we should be able to weather the storm," he said.<br><br>"We
               have been carrying out periodic industry-wide stress tests. The tests 
              suggest that major financial institutions in Singapore would be able to 
              withstand adverse financial and economic shock."<br> <br>Mr Menon was speaking at an event to launch the central bank's annual report for the year ended March 31, 2012.<br><br>MAS
               made a net profit of S$2.77 billion in fiscal 2011/12, reversing from 
              the loss of S$10.94 billion in the previous financial year when the 
              strong local dollar reduced the value of reserves held in other 
              currencies. <br><br>Mr Menon said MAS made foreign investment gains of 
              S$12.1 billion, but overall net profit came in at S$2.77 billion due to a
               strong exchange rate.<br><br>- CNA/cc/ir/wm</span></span></p>
