              <p>this incident isn't really a big incident compared to other countries in 'western countries' where being shot is a norm and being hacked to death is a way common phenomenon. However, people still visit these countries for tourism and investment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real point is ....I doubt people in these 'western countries' ever fight over staring incidents.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>just look at australia, for starters. they claim their 'excellent' human rights record and INVITE killers to go there for some sort of freedom and they boast they 'saved' another soul by jailing him and giving him a lifetime supply of food at the expense of the aussie taxpayers. LOOK at the crime rate in australia as a result of their PEACE first policy: australia's been ranked top three in most violent nation with frequency of murders, rapes and armed robberies on a scale that worries many. WHY? cos we all know for sure, we can enjoy murder, and yet? enjoy our life with free FOOD, free LODGING and we taxpayers have to pay for those arse holes=)</p></div>

              <p>thats because its easier said than done.  it is always easy to say it behind the computer because there is no adrenaline rush.  most people tend to freeze when they encounter violence.  especially singaporeans.</p>
              <p>there is nothing unusual about it.  it isnt that nobody wants to help but nobody is sure how they can help.</p>
