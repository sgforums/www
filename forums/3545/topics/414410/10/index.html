              <p>okay get it strainght. we need to know</p>
              <p>(1) when the slashing happen darren demised has with him a few other friends. i believe media reported 2 of his buddies. where were the 2 buddies? running like road runner instead of the chao ah beng attitude when they confronted the other group some time before?</p>
              <p>(2) the 2 if still alive were they at the demised funeral? if so any punishment forom darren's ah gua ginah gangs? got code of honor and coduct mah, buddies kena hack why never share the fight and die together with buddy since they all ganga mah?\\</p>
              <p>(3) daren demised slahsers, why the one in intensive care flee? should also take chopper and slash police mah. why scare can jump down to swiming pool? then later tell people" pain  pain arh!" now at hospital suckle mama's nipples <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>(4)  those demised good buddoes in razor tv videos, are they going to fight and create trouble just like the moves on the other opponent ganag nmemebrs after plaw hangs them during their funerals and wake?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(5) if so pls state the location so i can also go there be reoprtor, see first hand information and news. but i think i better request police escort also. not that i fear death kia see but when i fight and kill i make sure i got a license. otherwise i like watching bengs and lians shoot and fight like ah guas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>create so many problem might as well charge at police also all of them then the police can just set the weapons to auto and take them all down. easier to write report and close the case now hospital busy, police and court busy, funeral parlor people busy, media also busy, internet and blog activity busy. everyone boeng only.</p>

              <p>It was never wise to assume that the deceased was blameless. Whatever he did, it doesn't change the fact that his attackers committed murder. It's an uphill task to demonstrate that they were provoked and get the charges reduced.</p>
              <p>Of course it's not right if the decease's companions did something wrong and get off scot-free, but that needs to be proved.</p>
              <p>You could say that my views are coloured by a personal encounter with one of these troublemakers in, of all places, a mosh pit. It was totally random, because I looked his way when he started shoving into me during the gig. Luckily we were in the front and the bouncer cooled things a little before I bailed.</p>

              <p>FOUR men were charged with the murder of polytechnic student Darren Ng Wei Jie yesterday, even as disconsolate mourners bid farewell to the teenager at his funeral.<br><br>Three were charged in court while a fourth, who hurt himself trying to flee from police and is now in intensive care, was charged in hospital.<br><br>Chen Wei Zhen, 19, Tang Jia Min, 21, Ho Wui Ming, 20, and Edward Tay Wei Loong, 18, were charged with causing the death of Mr Ng, 19, while being members of an unlawful assembly last Saturday. If convicted of murder, the four will be sentenced to death.<br><br>The three accused in court were clad in red polo T-shirts and dark shorts.<br><br>Chen, a full-time national serviceman, whose name was called first, walked in with a smile. Ho is a private student.<br><br>Tang, also a full-time national serviceman, has tattoos on his left arm and leg. He also had what looked like a faint number '3' tattooed on his forehead in between his brows. He wore two small plasters on his left hand.

              <p><br>Agree. </p>
              <p>Nobody deserves to die.  Nobody has to right to murder. </p>
              <p>Now who suffers?  Only Darren's family and the families of the murderers (it will never be easy to see own son being condemned and sentenced to death).</p>
              <p>sigh... see the father cried like that at the funeral.  so sad.  :(</p>

              <p><br>why now then cry? the father should have the right to teach his son what good firends to make. and in his funeral he even allow his friends to come. even after his sons die he still don;t know what is the root cause forit all. is his friends and the type fo fiends he chooses. or maybe father just wat t o collect more money. but i can say those rich family one really don;t know how to teach son, maybe go work too much already no time. hmm..mabye those act tough one are after the darren;s sister lah want to tackle her say lah</p>

              <p><br>ya, the friends very fierce.  Either they have very aggressive personality or they are very super duper upset.  But then, if they dun wan the family members to be disturbed, I'm sure the razor tv will just film from far and not interview anyone. </p>
              <p>they should know that razor tv quite ok oredie, unlike the paparazzi in Manila in the recent hostage incident who took pic of the dead bodies that were already lying the coffin.  if compare with them, razor tv very decent liao, only filmed the funeral.</p>
              <p>anyway... may Darren RIP and his family stay strong. </p>

              <p>now would it have been a different story if they had been nice to the reporters, offered them drinks and talked calmly about it. The reporters were doing their job and it's just business, nothing personal. They didnt make fun of them or anything.</p>

If we blame the attackers, wheres darren and possibly his friends in all this?
