              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Firstly, why no one at Downtown East helped
              Darren, the victim? Are Singaporeans being cowards or cold-blooded?
              Don’t you guys who saw that incident feel guilty? This isn’t the
              first time Singaporeans just STAND AND WATCH incident like this or
              even worse! Don’t you guys have sense or justice or even
              righteousness!? Do you guys know what conscience is!?<span> </span> Is that difficult to even call the police? I
              believe there is a big crowd at Downtown East right? Then if you
              guys stand out together, those sadists might have stop hacking the
              victim, then the outcome might not be that bad! Well just PUT
              YOURSELF INTO OTHERS’ SHOES, how you want the public to react? HELP
              OR WATCH? Have some reflection on yourself...</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Next, why there is no safety precautions
              made for such an event, where there are huge crowds!? Why there are
              no medical personnel or first aid around for emergency!? Is this
              how organiser should plan an event? Why aren’t there any police
              officials or even security guard there to manage the crowd and
              ensure law and order? This isn’t the first time I heard that such
              cases (due to some childish incident such as staring and etc that
              led to gang fights and eventually resort to violence) happened,
              especially some parts of Singapore such as Pasir Ris and etc. Then
              why police does not tighten the security at those parts of
              Singapore? And I believe that the police also notice about the
              gangs in Singapore right? Then why they did not disband them? When
              these powerless and aimless youngsters get together, they become
              gangster and once they feel that they are more superior to others
              things get nasty, and things like this happen. And nowadays in
              Primary, Secondary and even tertiary schools students get threaten
              and bully by these gangster and no harsh action is taken even those
              victims seek for help and some cases many innocent students go
              astray under those influences. Why why and why!? Actions taken seem
              to be very minute and unattended?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p><span>Last but not least, I really have to compliment
              the</span> <span>student nurse, who called herself Aina,
              happened to be working part-time at Sakura restaurant. She tried to
              stop the bleeding from Darren’s multiple wounds as she and one
              of Darren’s friends waited for an ambulance. Despite she
              knows that the victim will not be able to make it she did not give
              up. Despite she is only a student nurse, she possesses the sprit
              and courage that a true nurse should have or even some nurses or
              medical personnel does not have. Although she did not manage to
              save the victim, I think that she should still deem as a heroine
              and I think that she deserve a bravery award or so from the
              Singapore Red Cross Society or at least from her school.
              <span> </span>I think that all of us have to learn
              from Aina, lend people a helping hand whatever there is a need, who
              knows you will need someone’s help someday. As there is a quote
              “Kindness Begets Kindness!”</span></p>

              <p><br>really if a crow makes up a larger number than the 10 cheepie kias, and they all big big size one i am sure the outcome can be turned. the problem is the crowd hardly know the victim, nor know each other so rallying against any agression is unlikely. moreover the 10 cheepie kais are armed with melee weapons. if its me and remove the sg law from the equation, give me a full magazine of 30 rounds mp5 that's enough for me t take down all ten of them in semi short control bursts. </p>

              <p>If there was a proper response from the crowd (assuming a sizeable amount of able-bodied males), the incident wouldn't have escalated in the first place. It's blatantly obvious the kids who made up the group of ten wouldn't dare attempt anything if faced with a greater threat, hence their need to invoke the "safety in numbers" rule.</p>
              <p>I understand the whole "not my problem" attitude is prevalent here, which is logical in this scenario, but that's exactly what results in needless deaths like this.</p>
              <p>Look into the murder of Kitty Genovese and the bystander effect for comparison.</p>

              <p>you know, my wallet got swiped at the airport last sunday. When I was making a report at the police station, I was shocked to see a poster stuck on the wall, with the police's  "mission statement" .....</p>
              <p>which reads something like</p>
              <p>"to respond to emergency and urgent cases within 15 minutes of call"</p>
              <p>"and non urgent cases within 30 minutes"</p>
              <p>that's right ..... 15 farking minutes, the police promises to try to come within 15 farking minutes ..... you think it'll make a difference ?</p>
              <p>of course, to be fair, even if the police were on site within 5 minutes of call, on par with other first world standards, it would not have made much of a difference too anyways. The punks would have been long gone.</p>

              <p>Sure ? Staring is against the law, are you sure can report to police for staring cases ? Never heard of it. I had experienced some "pie kia" aunty staring at me.

              <p>Guys, if you are being stared at by someone, how will you react ? Just curious. Ever thought of that ?</p>

              <p>for one, i sure dont have a GIANT ego like yours to have to gather ur chums and bash that guy up. "hey! u! stupid! u stare at me! now that 'chio bu' girl dun like me! u think i freak? now i wan wack u! huh! hoo! hah! see? i cut ur pen**is off! whos freaky?" now i wan whack ur mother! mayb i take my fren fren we bash u! why? oh, becos some1 stare at me, and my ego bruised liao.</p>
              <p>?</p>
              <p>i have been stared at many times, and pls, look at the disabled on the roads will ya? u think they take their stick and swear and the countless ppl who stare at them? they got glares comin at them, sneers and yet they go abt their lives happily. u? u're perfectly fine and jus cos some guy stare at the gangster he wan to fight? *sigh* so immature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>before u question the rationale(if there is ANY to begin with) of 'staring', please think of the disabled will ya? "mommy, whats wrong with his eyes?"&gt;" nothing child, he's a freak, lets go."&gt;:eww, look at how she talks! eww!"  a normal person(gangster) get this EVERY WAKING DAY OF HIS OR HER LIFE? or is it that some arse holes got so low self-esteem or morale they feel insulted by a simple stare? if so, our disabled would have become killers long ago. stupidity at its best in the world today perhaps? normal peple cant stand a bit of staring, but REAL disabled ppl take it in their stride? wheres the sanity in all this?</p>

              <p><br>i called police. last time mrt station got some marler fucking their uncles cheepie kia pick trouble. call his cheepie equivalent frioends down. so cool. i called police. 2 hiuys with guns. total 24 rounds. i won;t hesitate to pick up that revolver if any one of the policemen down if fight really break out. and damn sure i am very confident of handling one. those cheapie kias not even train in BMT. the noise from firing probably will scare their marlers cheepie shrink into a virgin-like hole. police later come and told them starting is against the law. atenmpt to riot also. if i want i can press charge sand make a case. but i know law not going to compensateme for the legals fees so i stop.ed moreover those cheepie kia not worth of any shit from me. want to fight. meet in battle. we'll see who can fight better. if he also scared to fave me one against one, no problem ten come i also acceptthe challenge.</p>

              <p>It hard for us to speculate since we are not at the scene.</p>
              <p>I still remember when i was still in secondary school about 14-15, my friends and I  often fight with my schoolmates because of stupid,lame reasons too but after the fight we just end up in the <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><span id="search" style="visibility: visible;"><em>discipline master room shake hand and that all and we even become friends after the fight and just forgive and forget.The kids nowadays are really something they are brutally murdering someone in public.with no sense of shame, <strong>even laughing,showing Victory signs shouting their gang call</strong>,you can imagine how <strong>they are so proud of themselves for being a murderer!!!!!</strong>This is inhumane worst than any man eating beast because those animals are born in nature to feed on men and any weaker animals but humans are not.<br></em></span></span></p>
              <p>A fight occur,i believe even if i am at the scene,it hard to know who is right and who is wrong,even though  those murderers have ten people while the latter had two or maybe more.But if i am in the scene i <strong>will call the police</strong> because they are creating a <strong>public nuisance. I will not go over and help i do not know who is right or wrong in the first place, but if i saw that guys bleeding i will call 995 instead.Yes i am a corward but what happened if something happened to me,who is going to support my wife and raise my daughter?Hahha the SPF or the Government? </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong>How will the tourists react if they saw this brutal incident what are
                                              they impression going to be like,the business in downtown east are also
                                              affected it also spoil the day of many visitors from young to old
                                              seeing blood everywhere</p>
              <p>But in the first place how did they get their weapons?You mean they bring weapons to downtown east to shop,if that the case then we singaporeans should each of us carry a weapon maybe the SAF should issue every family one M16 or SAR 21 when we are out since we are sooooo frequently call back for reservists.</p>
              <p>My wife should also carry her kitchen chopper to shop for groceries, Singapore is not a safe city anymore,my kid should be enroll into a martial arts school too instead of studying maths,Science, etc i am pretty disappointed.</p>
              <p>As for that guy who got killed it quite sad hope that he can RIP and his family and friends will get <span id="main" style="visibility: visible;"><span id="search" style="visibility: visible;"><em>Justice</em></span></span>  serve from the law</p>
              <p>This guys really got guts, to murder someone in a public place with CCTV either they are brainless thinking that the police will not be able to track them with lots of evidences to be found so easily or they just want to challenge the Law and the SPF to show that their gang is even more powerful than the police in Singapore or maybe even the Singapore Armed Forces.</p>
              <p>I hope the country and law will do something to answer to the deceased family as well as to the public to ensure Singapore being a safe country to live in.</p>
