              <p>The mentioned race here must be Chinese, especially when it is being discussed seriously like this.</p>
              <p>If it is another race, then we will most likely see people making fun of the race of the concerned parties and making a joke out of their behaviour.</p>
              <p>But the reason why we had such reactions is also because majority of the forumers here are Chinese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's in our blood to stand together to protect our race, but it's not in our blood to stand together to protect our nationality because Chinese is only 1/4 of the race in Singapore. Still got Malay, Indian, Eurasian.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans won't feel the obligations and needs and loyalties because they only represent 1/4 of the identities involved since the creation of their country, Singapore.</p>

              <p>Seriously, life imprisonment is a fate much worse than death.
              You have to suffer in jail till the day you die, whereas hanging is
              just 10-15 seconds of agony. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Just because of 1 petty minor thing and a young life was lost. Wtf is going on with gangsterism out there? Is not like Darren owes them a million bucks, please. Dont they have a heart? It takes courage to stab someone. They kill without even batting an eyelid. Awesome.</p>
              <p>Those fellas are just totally brainless. They act without thinking of the consequences. Is it worth it to kill someone whom you barely know and end up paying with your own life? Think again.</p>
              <p>What's most infuriating is, those fellas who were caught were not even remorseful. One can even smile and wave in court. Well, when the day of hanging comes, i can only say to them all the best and make sure you dont pee in your pants, dudes! :B</p>
              <p>A life for a life. That's how it goes. Since you are ready to do it, make sure you also pay the price for it. Dont be a sore loser.</p>
              <p>Actually, it's also quite sad to hear that they face the death sentence. After all, they are still young and have a long way ahead. Maybe they did it out of a moments' folly. Nobody's perfect. But, if we are going to pity and forgive them so easily, then who's going to pity Darren whose young life was lost too as a result of this stupid and unfortunate incident?</p>

              <p>That's the best way if possible. Let it serve as a warning to all triad members out there. If you want to kill someone, be prepared to pay the price. 18 is not an excuse to avoid being hanged.</p>

              for one, i sure dont have a GIANT ego like yours to have to gather ur chums and bash that guy up. "hey! u! stupid! u stare at me! now that 'chio bu' girlÂ dun like me! u think i freak? now i wan wack u! huh! hoo! hah! see? i cut ur pen**is off! whos freaky?" now i wan whack ur mother! mayb i take my fren fren we bash u! why? oh, becos some1 stare at me, and my ego bruised liao.
              
              ?
              
              i have been stared at many times, and pls, look at the disabled on the roads will ya? u think they take their stick and swear and the countless ppl who stare at them? they got glares comin at them, sneers and yet they go abt their lives happily. u? u're perfectly fine and jus cos some guy stare at the gangster he wan to fight? *sigh* so immature.
              
              Â 
              
              before u question the rationale(if there is ANY to begin with) of 'staring', please think of the disabled will ya? "mommy, whats wrong with his eyes?"&gt;" nothing child, he's a freak, lets go."&gt;:eww, look at how she talks! eww!"Â  a normal person(gangster) get this EVERY WAKING DAY OF HIS OR HER LIFE? or is it that some arse holes got so low self-esteem or morale they feel insulted by a simple stare? if so, our disabled would have become killers long ago. stupidity at its best in the world today perhaps? normal peple cant stand a bit of staring, but REAL disabled ppl take it in their stride? wheres the sanity in all this?

              <p>well, if I am not wrong, these scumbags have been around since long ago, and it is still present. you can never get rid of them.</p>
              <p>in the past, I do believe CID or etc kept a tight lid on things but it has gotten worse. Teenagers nowsdays have more rage and no longer the 1 on 1, it has turned into a safari, like 10 hunting an elephant.</p>
              <p>while it is easy for me, sitting now and said that I could have help or stop or even shouted " police", it is never easy for those at exact time/location.</p>
              <p>lastly, as a father myself, I feel the pain of the dad of the victim, losing his only son. No doubt, he is at a loss and wants justice, but I hope it doesn't consume him.</p>
              <p>RIP and hopefully, this incident raises alert priority for the necessary authorities to do something. Going around with choppers/knives is an explosive incident waiting to happen no matter which angle you view it from.</p>

              <p>well, being online isn't it much easy to monitor? I don't think these SS is as complicated as some of the terrorists out there so our ISD should be competent enough to track/monitor.</p>
              <p>but the key is allowance of the authorities to have this grey area for these ss to operate. (if I am not wrong). same as many street-walkers out there.</p>
