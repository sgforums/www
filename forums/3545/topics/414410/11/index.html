              <p><br>come on of course when people trethen me i call the police lah. usually i act havor when the situation and conditions allow. at least time for me to press the 999 on th handphone. you must do it. when the buttons pressed they run like hell already. its people like you that make the ahbeng and seng activities thrive instead of reporting the police and make a case. its simple. get the someone to meetyou and then get the police down meanwhile. like that no need any help from your so-called gangs. and if you dare now give me that peerson who threaten you ad your gangs. i will call the police and get tthem all rounded up for good. that is if you dare now.</p>

              <p><br>i repeat myself again.</p>
              <p>(1) media has the right to flim from a distance away.</p>
              <p>(2) unless the direct relatives or parents of the demised asked for the friends to keep the media at bay then they can do it.</p>
              <p>(3) they are just friends so if they take the 'law' in their own hands the media can sue them for their obstruction</p>
              <p>(4) the friends if feel not appropriate should call the plice come down and make  case for the media if they feel the media actions are inappropriate. The friends cannot stop and use mild force to stop the media as shown in those video clips. shouting at people even if you are angry or sad or acting or trouble the receiver still can sue you and make a case out of it/</p>
              <p>(5) see how their friends dressing and behaviour and the way they handle situation? if it just some acqutamce or so called 'close;' friends then if darrens family haven't wake up they should see the light that the friends are the major causes for his death.</p>
              <p>(6) i say again the friends who wre with darren when the attack happed whre are they now? were they also at the funeral? if so why they ran and never come back and help pull darren out of the mess back then? fear right, peopple got 10 knives right?</p>

              <p><br>i repeat myself again.</p>
              <p>(1) media has the right to flim from a distance away.</p>
              <p>(2) unless the direct relatives or parents of the demised asked for the friends to keep the media at bay then they can do it.</p>
              <p>(3) they are just friends so if they take the 'law' in their own hands the media can sue them for their obstruction</p>
              <p>(4) the friends if feel not appropriate should call the plice come down and make  case for the media if they feel the media actions are inappropriate. The friends cannot stop and use mild force to stop the media as shown in those video clips. shouting at people even if you are angry or sad or acting or trouble the receiver still can sue you and make a case out of it/</p>
              <p>(5) see how their friends dressing and behaviour and the way they handle situation? if it just some acqutamce or so called 'close;' friends then if darrens family haven't wake up they should see the light that the friends are the major causes for his death.</p>
              <p>(6) i say again the friends who wre with darren when the attack happed whre are they now? were they also at the funeral? if so why they ran and never come back and help pull darren out of the mess back then? fear right, peopple got 10 knives right?</p>

              <p>Yes I agreed with your points.</p>
              <p>But yet, the police are handling this case too slowly.</p>
              <p>More fights and deaths on the way if police are still munching their kfc meal.</p>
