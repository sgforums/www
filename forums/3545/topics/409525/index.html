              <h1 class="storyheadline">Late Malaysian leader's daughter responds to remarks about dad</h1>
              <p>ON MAY 23, Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew delivered an eulogy at the 
              state funeral for former deputy prime minister Goh Keng Swee, who was 
              the cousin of my father, Tun Tan Siew Sin.</p>
              <p>In his eulogy, Mr Lee said: 'After we (Singapore) had joined
               Malaysia, we discovered we had been ambushed. He (Dr Goh) stood up for 
              our rights and fought to protect Singapore's interests against the 
              Federal Finance Ministry, whose Finance Minister was his cousin, Tan 
              Siew Sin, who was out to spite Singapore.'</p>
              <p>In deference to Mrs Goh Keng Swee, son Kian Chee and his 
              wife Siok Sun, I have waited until after the 100 days of mourning before
               responding to Mr Lee's unwarranted attack on my father.</p>
              <p>Despite their differences on policy issues, my father had a 
              high regard for Dr Goh whom he credited as the architect of Singapore's 
              stunning economic success.</p>
              <p>In his two-volume autobiography, Mr Lee wrote disparagingly 
              about my father. I had hoped that would be the end of his invective. I 
              am sad the Minister Mentor still harbours ill will against a man who has
               been dead for 22 years.</p>
              <p>My father's attitude towards Singapore is encapsulated in 
              his speech in Parliament on June 1, 1965, in which he said:</p>
              <p>'I would like to make it clear that we in the Central 
              Government, whatever our differences with the Singapore Government might
               be, have no quarrel with the people of Singapore. Not only do we wish 
              them well, but also we want them to progress as they should progress, 
              bearing in mind some of the great qualities which they possess in so 
              marked a degree.'</p>
              <p>These words - and his acknowledgement that Singapore 
              possessed some great qualities in a marked degree - refutes the 
              suggestion that my father was 'out to spite Singapore'.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee's continuing animus against my father makes memorable
               the tea that my mother and I had with Mrs Lee Kuan Yew in Carcosa (a 
              hotel which was once the residence of the British High Commissioner in 
              Kuala Lumpur) in September 2001.</p>
              <p>Realising that my mother's hearing problems inhibited 
              conversation, Mrs Lee - who was seated next to Tun Dr Siti Hasmah (wife 
              of then Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad) - broke with 
              protocol, came and sat next to my mother and conversed with her for a 
              few minutes.</p>
              <p>My mother and I will always cherish meeting Mrs Lee.</p>
