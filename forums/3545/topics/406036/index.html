              <h1 class="storyheadline2">He ran down Thai worker 
              crossing Kallang Road</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Khushwant Singh</p>
              <p>A CITYCAB cabby was so intent on looking out for customers that he ran 
              down a Thai worker along Kallang Road at about 3.30am on July 22 last 
              year.</p>
              <p>Although the traffic lights at the pedestrian crossing were 
              in the taxi's favour, a group of four Thai construction workers were 
              crossing the road. Mr Khwathijak Amornsak, 38, who was walking in front 
              of his friends, was the only one hit.</p>
              <p>The cabby stopped and drove the severely injured Thai and 
              his three friends to Raffles Hospital. Mr Amornsak was by then 
              unconscious and not breathing. Resuscitation attempts by medical proved 
              futile and he was declared dead at 4.15am.</p>
              <p>On Thursday, the cabby, Lester Fernandez Ng, 50, was fined 
              $8,000 and disqualified from driving all vehicles for five years for 
              causing the death by a negligent act.</p>
              <p>Investigations revealed that the Thais had been drinking 
              beer at a coffee shop in Beach Road and were walking back to their 
              dormitory in Kallang Road.</p>
              <p>Pleading for leniency for Ng, defence counsel N.K. Rajarh 
              said that his client, a divorcee, was a bankrupt and driving the taxi 
              was his only source of income. His hiring arrangements with CityCab had 
              been terminated a day after the accident and Ng has been unemployed 
              since.</p>

              <p>Is this sentence fair?</p>
              <p>It was the guys fault and the guy was drinking too and the cabby also got drive them to hospital after that.</p>
              <p>It seems that the justice system in singapore is flawed.</p>
