              <p>When custody battles turn deadly<br> <span class="update">By Cheryl Fox | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 04 October 2011 1706 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: On the 
              morning of 22 September, the bodies of a mother and her 
              three-year-old-son were found in Bedok Reservoir, in what is believed to
               have been a suicide triggered by a custody tussle. <br><br>The bodies of Madam Tan Sze Sze and her son Jerald Chin were found two days after they were reported missing. <br><br>Both were clad in red tops, fingernails painted red and their wrists bound by a red thread.<br><br>The Chinese believe that wearing red signifies they plan to return as vengeful spirits.   <br><br>But what did the 32-year-old mother want revenge for?<br><br>Madam
               Teo Guek Lai, mother of the late Tan Sze Sze, said: "(My daughter's 
              husband) kept forcing her to let their son go over to his place. But 
              she'd rather die than do that."<br><br>Ms Tan Sze Wah, who is the sister
               of the late Madam Tan, said: "Sometimes, I'd bring Jerald to (meet his 
              father). But (his father) doesn't really play with (Jerald). <br><br>"He kept on threatening my sister. He told my sister to prepare to go to jail if she doesn't let his son go over." <br><br>Ms Tan's family said a bitter row began after Jerald came home with a bleeding nose after visiting his father.<br><br>When
               contacted by the "Get Rea!" team, Mr Willy Chin, husband of the 
              deceased, insisted it was an accident and spoke of his frustrations at 
              not being allowed to see his son.<br><br>"I've already appealed to the 
              court and even the police, but their family (would) lock the door and 
              (disallow me) to see my son. There's nothing much (I can) do. You don't 
              expect me or the police to barge in," Mr Chin said.<br><br>Mr Chin had applied to the courts to grant him access to his son, but his wife refused to comply and was even fined. <br><br>The
               Family Court said it does not have a breakdown of the number of parents
               who have applied for custody, access and/or care and control of their 
              children.  <br><br>But the rising number of divorces and annulments in Singapore could be telling - some 7,400 in 2010, up from 6,900 in 2005. <br><br>For more, catch the "Get Rea! Special" on Tuesday at 8pm Singapore/Hong Kong Time, with an encore at 11.30pm.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
