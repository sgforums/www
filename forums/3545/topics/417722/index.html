              <p><cite>ANN - Monday, Dec 13</cite></p>
              <p>Johor Baru (The Star/ANN) - The number of Malaysians working in 
              Singapore has been on the decline in the past four months, said 
              Malaysia's labour department.</p>
              <p>This is due to the tightening of conditions on the hiring of foreign
               workers in Johor which has resulted in Malaysians being hired to fill 
              up vacant posts.</p>
              <p>Department director-general Datuk Sheikh Yahya Sheikh Mohamed said 
              that there were about 300,000 Malaysians working in the republic but the
               numbers had remained stagnant.</p>
              <p>It is decreasing now," he said after attending a job placement 
              programme at Danga City Mall here Saturday (December 11).</p>
              <p>Sheikh Yahya said the department was also encouraging companies to 
              offer competitive salaries to attract Malaysians.</p>
              <p>Companies have also started offering better salaries because of 
              more stringent policies on hiring foreign labour.</p>
              <p>We have told them that they have to meet national standards and not
               offer remunerations that will only attract cheap foreign labour," he 
              said.</p>
              <p>Sheikh Yahya said this had resulted in better salaries, especially 
              in Johor.</p>
              <p>This is a good sign and next year, we estimate that an additional 
              3,000 high income jobs will be available from several big projects 
              within Iskandar Malaysia," he said.</p>
              <p>State Unity, Human Resource, Science, Technology and Innovation 
              Committee chairman M. Asojan, who launched the event, urged employers to
               reduce red tape when hiring workers.</p>
              <p>I believe it would be better if employers were more direct and 
              immediately inform candidates if they have a chance or not," he said.</p>

              <p>I support the My gahmen on their move. SG should do the same. come one we know its not sgrean wages causing looseout in competitiveness. almost a decade sgreans have been lowballing their wages like beggar to saty comeptitive. locals been low skilled and highly paid is nonsense. once we take out teh supply of floor traps, gahmen will really sit down and face the truth on why they are lossing out businesses. and i can tell you its not wages.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see all the things and jobs outsource to other foreugn countries. some really hit rock bottom. do you think with the material pricing you can get things that work? its either that or they don;t have quality assuracne at all!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i ever encounter sme material suppliers the suppir chain although we are their custoer have to beg them like vice versa, because they have rock bottom cheap rpices. ended up when the quality tema work with them they have vague iuncomplete COC, our customer feedbackproblem with producst and we suspect its their material issues their end no one answer call. and when you call abbout placing more material orders they call you back on the double.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>come one lahthose scholars and papy really you should learn from the people working on the ground. we see the things more clearly then them up there! you think you can buy one dollar things at one dollar value? if so its either the things got problem or they are really short on the quality end.</p>

              <p><br>yeh sheap rite? but they don;t know the mindsets of these florr traps. it will be soon that they learn about their low wages (although to them the money means more than what they can get with their skills and education back in cheena) and they will start getting greedy, disastisfied thatjapan invade chin 70 years ago, that why sgreans getting more than them forgetting they are really an alien to spore, trying to compare more and cheat or hook up sg men if they have the chance, create more law and legal problems for people locals and sg . . . balance that with tthe quality of the work cheap labor will produce, back repuation for their business and the sevice industries on the whole</p>
