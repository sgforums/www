              <p>we are all aware that the current strength of oppositions are on
              a weak level. Symptoms of strong opposition would give a feeling of
              rising dominance which we have yet felt that; and before that
              happens, we would also sense the existing govt take tough measures
              against them...to date, it is far from alert levels...</p>
              <p>i m saying this to state the facts of the situation. My earnest
              advice to strengthen oppositions is not within, but from without.
              As i have mentioned many times, since Sg is a highly dependent on
              external powers and markets, that indicates that the determinant is
              an external party formed with powerful alliances that could affect
              the markets and inevitably the whole island. That also implies that
              we would also be vulnerable to such external powers that could
              wrought many Sg lives beyond our control. </p>
              <p>The internal dissensions would act as a catalyst to expedite the
              weakening of the existing govt with the dominance of external
              powers and threats - with that, victory of oppositions would then
              be assured.</p>

              <p>What make you so sure there is external forces that only exist in opposition? Why not the other way round. Oppositions haven't the ability to rule yet so where is the threat?</p>
              <p>Aren't Singapore feel like part of PRC? What's the intent?</p>
              <p>Has the Great Singapore Sale started?</p>

              <p>Let's just focus on the disunity among the ministers in PAP.  This is enough to cause problems.  Oppositions are in no position to cause any problem to us now as they are not the ruling party.</p>
              <p>With regard to the article, it is imperative that PAP ministers come together put forth their suggestions, ideas, solutions, policies and make it as one voice so as not to confuse the public.    They are to put the interest of the public first on the list to discuss, create policies and so on to better the life of the people who feed them.   Without us, there is no PAP.</p>

              <p>Let's just focus on the disunity among the ministers in
              PAP.  This is enough to cause problems.  Oppositions are
              in no position to cause any problem to us now as they are not the
              ruling party.</p>
              <p>With regard to the article, it is imperative that PAP ministers
              come together put forth their suggestions, ideas, solutions,
              policies and make it as one voice so as not to confuse the
              public.    They are to put the interest of the
              public first on the list to discuss, create policies and so on to
              better the life of the people who feed them.   Without
              us, there is no PAP.</p>

              <p>True. It is a BIG problem. Their confusion is losing them votes indeed. How can you trust an organisation that doesnt know where they are heading for. =X<br><br>And Singaporeans ain't stupid. Our memory isn't that poor.</p>
