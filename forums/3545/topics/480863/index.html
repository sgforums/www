              <p>SINGAPORE
               - A woman popped out for a karaoke session with her residents' 
              committee on Monday, only to return home to the sight of her husband and
               grown son's bodies at the foot of her block.</p>
              <p>The 66-year-old man and his 30-year-old son were found dead that 
              afternoon, after apparently falling from Block 605, Clementi West Street
               1.</p>
              <p>The husband, identified by Shin Min Daily News as Mr Song Ya Cai, was
               on the ground while their son, Mr Song Shen Long, was on the roof of a 
              covered walkway.</p>
              <p>The older Mr Song's wheelchair was later discovered on the 17th floor. The family lives in a flat on the seventh floor.</p>
              <p>Neighbours said they heard two loud thuds around 2.30pm, about 10 
              seconds apart. Several got out of their flats to take a look and 
              discovered the bodies.</p>
              <p>Mr Song's wife returned home around 4pm and immediately went into shock, wailing in distress, reported The New Paper.</p>
              <p>At times, the woman's daughter, the youngest of her three children, 
              believed to be in her 20s, had to restrain her mother, who took out her 
              grief on a policewoman at the scene by hitting the latter.</p>
              <p>Her other son, who is the oldest child, was seen comforting his mother.</p>
              <p>A close friend of the wife for several years was distraught when interviewed. She said the wife had been depressed lately.</p>
              <p>The friend added that the wife had problems with her husband for the last five years, and they quarrelled often.</p>
              <p>She said the husband had dementia and had trouble with his mobility. He also could not control his bladder and bowel movements.</p>
              <p>But relatives and friends also told Shin Min that the father and the 
              son who died had a close relationship. When the elder Mr Song spent a 
              few months at a care facility, his son often went to visit him and 
              bought food for him as well.</p>
              <p>Police have classified the case as unnatural death and are investigating.</p>
