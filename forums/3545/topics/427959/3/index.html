              <p>dunno wat to say abt LHW</p>
              <p>She mentioned last yr abt cutting long distance bus routes citing that they appeared before the MRT appeared.</p>
              <p>Actual fact was, many of the long distance bus routes appeared during the MRT rationalisation program. Sv 30, 51, 154's long distance mileage was all thanks to the MRT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">. Long dist Sv 66 was introduced as a totally new bus service in 1989 during the MRT rationalisation program.</p>
              <p>I think the young govt policy makers got their facts all wrong.</p>

              <p>Why do nationalized trains work but not nationalized buses?</p>
              <p>MRT lines are nationalized, their operators aren't and the lines are drawn up by govt studies. As a result it works very well up to its capacity. If a private company only provides 8 trains per hour, can the govt fund a 9th and 10th? Can the same approach work for buses?</p>
              <p>This means everyone will get a chance to board. The govt will determine crowding standards and if operators are not happy about losing money, why should the govt be so quick to use its power everywhere but not here?</p>
              <p>We need to streamline traffic flow, not just limit cars. Why is going down Orchard Road quick but going in the opposite direction so slow? Because the roads are not rationalized towards public or any much transport. The same in towns.</p>
              <p>The closest thing I've seen is the $36M Stamford Road tunnel, which doesn't help buses much because there was already a bus lane. I suspect ever since, re-laying roads has been a political suicide move.</p>
              <p>We supposedly have the best paid, best brains in the govt to solve such problems.</p>

              <p>Eh.. SMRT dun own the train, the carriages are purchased by e govt.</p>
              <p>So you want more train, ask them during the budget.</p>
              <p>SBS's coming was during the days the govt had no means onto running a bus co. Furthermore by 1970s, UK's nationalised industry began to show a lot of problem.</p>
              <p>In fact, ComfortDelgro bids for bus routes in London - which used to be nationalised.</p>

              could allocate land for bus int w/o even looking at the long term
              needs (Why I say tis is because during the construction Tuas
              developed, NTU's intake increased lots) and operational needs (bus
              freq resulting in no of buses in int at any time during e peak

              <p><br>Let me explain to wat I feel abt e MRT.</p>
              <p>Marine Parade 1stly is only an Estate not a New Town. Back then in 1980s, $3bn on NSEWL was alrdy pretty costly (didn't go fully underground, it would have cost us more). Any case Marine Parade has semi express 36 to Suntec &amp; Orchard.</p>
              <p>CCL was more of an accidentally conceptalised MRT line to relieve e CBD MRT interchanges. Any case e CCL is only 3 carriage and the peak hr freq based on the no of trains procured, it could only maintain 5 - 7 mins peak hr freq.</p>
              <p>NTU &amp; NUS is pretty difficult to justify for MRT. Esp more of NTU. 1st thing uni academic term only takes up 1/2 of the calender days (Even extending MRT to Tuas more worth it as ppl do take it on weekends as they work at places like shipyard).</p>
              <p>Furthermore SBS provides double decks to NTU, which can carry some 130 ppl with bus freq at around 2 mins per bus. An LRT can only carry 80 - 90 passengers at e same frequency.</p>

              <p>True on NUS&amp;NTU catchment but I wonder how so many CCL stations have less catchment than them. Vacant areas there may be developed later but I can't say the same of stations along the upcoming CCL4&amp;5. What's up there?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand running any new line Eastwards between the EWL and the coast is impossible, but at very least Marine Parade deserves a dogleg of the CCL.</p>
              <p>Also in the CBD, we have 4 lines and the newer ones have mostly had to go under streets to avoid existing buildings. Is it safe to say there will be no further lines into the CBD, anything new will connect to existing lines at interchanges?</p>

              <p>Actual fact was, many of the long distance bus routes appeared
              during the MRT rationalisation program. Sv 30, 51, 154's long
              distance mileage was all thanks to the MRT <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">.
              Long dist Sv 66 was introduced as a totally new bus service in 1989
              during the MRT rationalisation program.</p>
