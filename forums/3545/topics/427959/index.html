              <p><strong>Apr 16, 2011 - Straits Times</strong></p>
              <p>By 
              				Rachel Scully</p>
              <p>MINISTER in the Prime Minister's Office Mrs Lim Hwee Hua disagrees 
              with the Workers' Party manifesto suggesting that Singapore's public 
              transport system should be nationalised.</p>
              <p>'I think the underlying motivation for suggesting that public 
              transport should be nationalised is that it can be cheap. But 
              nationalising in many other countries has led to a lot of inefficiency. 
              And ultimately you get cheap transport but it doesn't quite work out,' 
              said Mrs Lim who is also the Second Minister for Finance and Transport.</p>
              <p>Speaking to the media at a dinner-cum-dialogue session with residents
               of Hwi Yoh Court, Mrs Lim, who is an MP for Aljunied GRC, explained the
               pros and cons of privatising a HUDC estate.</p>
              <p>Residents of Hwi Yoh Court from Blocks 128 to 134 in Serangoon North 
              Avenue 1 have been on a privatisation drive of their HUDC estate since 
              1997.</p>
              <p>In order for the privatisation deal to go through, 75% of owners in 
              the estate would have to agree to the move. Currently, only 180 of 264 
              owners have signed. Three more are required to fulfill the 75% 
              requirement.</p>

              <p>PAP should fully let the public transport privatized. Currently they are many private bus companies who are not SBS ans SMART providing routes for the passengers in either booked or illegally. It make more sense to have MORE private bus companies coming in to fight for market. Our bus transport quality have dropped since the good old days.</p>

              <p>This is wat's going on in London these days</p>
              <p>The bus co just bid for the routes using some criteria. The govt pays them a fixed amount annually.</p>
              <p>But problem is, it becomes I'm only operating it. Things like innovation (farecards, iris) aren't likely to appear.</p>
              <p>Sometimes things are pretty funny, some projects could be started by e state, some are from private sector. The bus stop bus arrival panal was moltivated aft SBS launched the iris.</p>

              <p>the MRT project is nationalised actually.</p>
              <p>Because SMRT dun spend any single cent on the MRT station and trains. It's like everything belongs to LTA, but it's given to SMRT to run and get to keep ops profit. SMRT didn't spend $33bn to build CCL, it's entirely taxpayers $$</p>

              <p>the MRT project is nationalised actually.</p>
              <p>Because SMRT dun spend any single cent on the MRT station and trains. It's like everything belongs to LTA, but it's given to SMRT to run and get to keep ops profit. SMRT didn't spend $33bn to build CCL, it's entirely taxpayers $$</p>
