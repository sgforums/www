              <p>a bus co easily has some 5800 bus drivers, it's macham size of an army div.</p>
              <p>I think if as wat WP claims of nationalising, I think they'll soon keep e money into reserves instead of spending it on things like iris.</p>

              <p>Lim Hwee Hua forgot that nationalising can involve providing 4 buses per hour if SMRT only provide 3. The govt only needs to pay for 1.</p>

              <p><br>Already with only 2 companies we have SMRT's irritaing advertisements singing to us.</p>
              <p>Can you imagine what kind of advertising campaigns that waste $$$ we would have with MORE companies?</p>
              <p>We also cannot think only of consumers....because we have a stake in the companies as well simply because we share the same economic space.</p>
              <p>In any case, competition has the tendency to lead to <em>over-produce</em> if the companies compete in quantity, which is the case here, if we do not use the standard supply-demand and use instead game theories to predict outcomes which have proven to be rather accurate.</p>

              <p>Aunty Hwee Hua like her other colleagues speak against anything that don't help them make more profits.    This one also should be out of parliament.   Please, as it is their transport fare system is  benefitting the people.   We keep paying more and more each year for them to carry on to reduce the frequency of buses even during peak hours.    It is no value for money for the commuters to keep paying rising cost and get lousy service.</p>
              <p>Some months back she responded heartlessly to risk arising in cyclists cycling in pedestrian pathway.   Claimed nothing can be done about it and ask both pedestrians and cyclists to tolerate each other.    Pay her millions to shirk responsibility, shit!    Like that anyone of us also can take over her and get paid million.   </p>

              <p>Why do nationalized trains work but not nationalized buses?</p>
              <p>MRT lines are nationalized, their operators aren't and the lines are drawn up by govt studies. As a result it works very well up to its capacity. If a private company only provides 8 trains per hour, can the govt fund a 9th and 10th? Can the same approach work for buses?</p>
              <p>This means everyone will get a chance to board. The govt will determine crowding standards and if operators are not happy about losing money, why should the govt be so quick to use its power everywhere but not here?</p>
              <p>We need to streamline traffic flow, not just limit cars. Why is going down Orchard Road quick but going in the opposite direction so slow? Because the roads are not rationalized towards public or any much transport. The same in towns.</p>
              <p>The closest thing I've seen is the $36M Stamford Road tunnel, which doesn't help buses much because there was already a bus lane. I suspect ever since, re-laying roads has been a political suicide move.</p>
