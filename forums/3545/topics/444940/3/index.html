I just came back from China after spending 2 weeks there for a holiday and my observation of the Mainland Chinese is that they litter and spit everywhere and anywhere.

              <p>Sorry man. SG is a small country. China is a big country... with a very, very big population. No matter how many quality individuals SG creates, China's superior quantity of low quality humans will ALWAYS triump. The world is depending on the success of China and India. This is our sad reality. That's why China can do such things. Because to them, humans are expendable. Hooray for communism. *sarcasm*</p>

              <p>I don't think so. In my eyes, SG is kind of transitioning from 3rd world to 1st world. Singapore and her people are wealthy. But I know most Singaporeans still ''bow down'' to Europeans and the Japs and Koreans. This is a 3rd world mentality. Plus, many Singaporeans have a sense of belonging to either China, Malaysia or India depending on their race. They don't consider SG as their homeland. This is another 3rd world mentality. Last but not least, Singaporeans are too open to globalization. As a result, the Singaporean society is too vulnerable to foreign intervention. It might take 10 - 50 years or 2 - 3 more generations to solve these problems. Not to forget, the government plays a big role as well. SG is not spiralling downward, but rather a crossroad. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Thanks. Glad to see there are others who realize the problem for
              what it actually is. Nowadays, it's about pointing fingers, about
              finding that scapegoat, that someone to blame. We tend to blame our
              governments for everything. No one man or force is to be held
              responsible for a problem, it's always a string of men or forces.
              That ''string'' includes us as well, more than
              often. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>yeap. We always accuse this person and that person and always fail to realise many a times the fault may lie with us too. I always believe that one person can influence another person, then a group, then more and more people. We should all start to do something :D</p>

              <p>Whether it is in Singapore or else where in the world, litter will fall and  accumulate at public places all over the world. It just a matter of whether there are sweepers or not.</p>
              <p>The poor sectors, ie the slum areas, usually do not have sweepers or have sweeping irregularly. So the litter present an unkempt sight there.</p>
