              <p>Jan 6, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>I HAVE been visiting Singapore for over 10 years and in the past two 
              years I have noticed a steady decline in the state of cleanliness of the
               environment.</p>
              <p>I used to sing the praises of 
              Singapore as a modern and clean country. However, the amount of rubbish 
              littering housing blocks and common areas makes such claims dishonest.</p>
              <p>While jogging around Chinese Garden, I found 
              piles of discarded plastic bags, bottles and other rubbish strewn by the
               lake side, within sight of rubbish bins.</p>
              <p>Every morning, I go to the bottom of my tower block and find fresh piles of trash.</p>
              <p>This problem needs to be tackled at source: 
              The proliferation of plastic rubbish is overwhelming and merely printing
               'Reduce, Recycle, Re-use' on plastic bags that are given out like 
              confetti will do nothing to reduce consumption.</p>
              <p>A plastic bag has an average use life of 20 
              minutes but persists in the environment for hundreds of years. A system 
              of charging for bags should be introduced. As a small city state, 
              Singapore is in a position to enact a rigorous and efficient waste 
              reduction and recycling programme to regain its reputation as a clean 
              city.</p>

              <p>here's an observation from a long time ago...</p>
              <p>there was a SAF family day at the chinese garden... being SAF family day, you will not find any foreigners there.. and also it was at a time when there weren't so many foreigners here yet...</p>
              <p>i went past there before the family day.. the place was nice although everyone knew the chinese garden was going to be renovated after the family day...</p>
              <p>then on the day itself, the chinese garden was packed.. really packed...</p>
              <p>after the family day festivities were over, i passed the place.. and saw the whole place literally COVERED in trash... you almost could not see the grass, the lawns.. the whole place was full of plastic bags, wrappers, bottles, miscellaneous litter..</p>
              <p>no.. you can't place all the blame on the foreigners when local people are horrific litterbugs..</p>
              <p>who cannot seem to be able to teach values to their children since they have none themselves...</p>
              <p>personal responsibility is sorely lacking in people these days.. and this is one of the results...</p>

              <p>i better clarify.</p>
              <p>my initial comment werent intended to blame it on the FTs and absolve locals.</p>
              <p>i only meant to say our current cleaners can cope with local litterbugs but cant cope anymore with 2 million more foreign litterbugs joining us.</p>
              <p>i.e. both locals and foreigners are equally to blame.</p>

              Toyko  maybe 70-80% local, 20-30 foreigner including tourist.
              SG  most likely 30-40% local, 60-70% foreigner including tourist.  How to compare?
              
              Last time SG is maybe like Toyko 70-80% local, 20-30 foreigner, so can be very clean like toyko.
              
              Anyway the TS mention Chinese Garden, i thought nowadays this place is mainly for foreigner as I went there a few times, the visitor is like 90% foreigner and 10% local most of the time.
