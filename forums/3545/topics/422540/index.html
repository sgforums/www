              <p>ON SUNDAY evening, I took my family to the River Hongbao carnival to 
              understand and get to know more of the country I am trying to embrace as
               my permanent home.</p>
              <p>We enjoyed it a lot and were really impressed by the decorations, atmosphere, cultural programme and fun rides for the children.</p>
              <p>But amid all the fun and extravaganza, I felt a little out 
              of place. Most of the signs in the food stalls and the price lists were 
              in Chinese. I wanted to try the food but did not know what to ask for as
               I do not eat pork and beef for religious reasons. Even the compering 
              was exclusively in Mandarin. I felt like an outsider, not welcome to 
              join in the festivities.</p>
              <p>I understand that the festivities are to commemorate the 
              Chinese New Year, but in cosmopolitan Singapore, where people from 
              various cultural and ethnic backgrounds live together harmoniously, a 
              little sprinkling of English can go a long way.</p>
              <p>Bilingual compering in English and Mandarin, and names of 
              food items and price lists in English would have made us feel more at 
              home, more comfortable and truly integrated.</p>

              <p>Uhh... hello? It is a <em>Chinese</em> festival, no? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>There's just no pleasing some people.</p>
              <p>You make the festival billingual, people will complain that it has lost its authenticity.</p>
              <p>You make the festival Chinese, this joker will complain that he cannot understand.</p>
              <p>So if I were to attend a Punjab festival in India, must I expect all the signs there to be in English?</p>

              <p>When you visit another country, you want your experience to be as authentic as possible. You want the locals to do as they always do, cook as they have always cooked, and perform as they have always performed.</p>
              <p>Once they start doing things differently to cater to tourists, the authenticity is lost. Sure, you may be able to understand the experience better, but the experience is no longer real.</p>

              <p>When you visit another country, you want your experience to be
              as authentic as possible. You want the locals to do as they always
              do, cook as they have always cooked, and perform as they have
              always performed.</p>
              <p>Once they start doing things differently to cater to tourists,
              the authenticity is lost. Sure, you may be able to understand the
              experience better, but the experience is no longer real.</p>
              <p>If language is such a barrier to you, you can always go to a
              tour agency and hire an English-speaking guide.</p>
              <p>Heck, this is Singapore. If you don't know what is going on,
              just ask. Even most old aunties and uncles know enough English to
              get by.</p>
              <p>If anything, the impression I get from this guy's letter is that
              he works in Singapore (I quote: '<em>..... to understand and get to
              know more of the country I am trying to embrace as my permanent
              home</em>').</p>
              <p>So why can't he just get a local colleague to help show him
              around?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I would agree that I want my experience to be as authentic as possible. However, I would not be able to have any experience whatsoever if I don't understand any of what is going on. And why would the experience be diluted if it is no longer spoken in completely in it's original language? For example, you see tae kwon do being taught all over the world, when it was originally from Korea. Is the essence of the art lost when the language changed from Korean? Or for Islam, while people study Arabic to fully understand the Qu'ran, the book was first translation into the language of the people to be converted too.</p>
              <p>Give them a sample before letting them choose if they want the whole course. Not dump them in the soup tureen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand the problem of catering to tourists. Looking at places like Rome, it is said that the original Italian culture is lost to the tourist traps all around. However, I think it would be good, and sufficient for signs around with explanations in various languages, including the original one at the top. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Language isn't really much of a barrier for me here. I am Singaporean too. But looking at places, like Japan for example (aside from Tokyo), Japanese is almost exclusive used, and the locals there are too shy or just do not know how to explain in the languages I do know.</p>
              <p>In this case, he isn't asking for signs in Punjabi or some other obscure language. He is asking for one in English. You know, the administrative language of Singapore? (Or we could put signs in our National language, but that would kill almost the entire new generation... =P )</p>
              <p>(You say hire a tour guide. How do you know the tour guide isn't going to take you to the known tourist traps? Not to mention that the better tour sites are usually off the map. ;) )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He is looking towards Singapore as a permanent home, not looking to China. Why does he have to learn Chinese to understand an event in Singapore? Or else, for that matter, we should have Christmas in Italian (or whatever the original language was). Why spoil the cultural experience for such an important event?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A local friend would help his experience, but it would only help 1 person/group. Why not help the rest?</p>

              <p>actually, no.. some do not have basic grasp of english.. because of people like our writer there, who insist on their adopted country catering to them, do not learn the common and unifying language of the country...</p>
