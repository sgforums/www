              <p>Ang Mo Gow Sai will now be able to buy landed property. Before this they were restricted from buying landed, only condos, except Sentosa Cove,</p>
              <p>Several years ago, Lee Kuan Yew said 'Landed property ownership
              will remain the sole preserve of Singaporeans so that
              Singapreans...will feel special compared to foreigners'. LKY then was
              'dead set against' foreiners owning a landed.</p>
              <p>Mah Bow Tan,
              Minister for National Development, said in June 2007 that SINGAPORE HAS
              NO PLANS TO OPEN UP its landed property market to
              foreigners"</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters during a four-day visit to the north-eastern
              Chinese city of Tianjin, Mr Mah Bow Tan said any change to the rules would deny
              Singaporeans a chance to own such homes, which are in short supply in
              the land-scarce country. 'Landed property has to be treated as a
              special category. It is important for us to maintain certain privileges
              for our citizens.'</p>
              <p>Now the PAP has changed their mind.</p>
              <p>Soon landed property prices will rise and the average Singaporean can no longer afford a landed. Landed property prices will experience sharp jumps resulting in even
              greater frenzy in the property sector. Cost of living will jump again.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are just laughing stocks for people in other countries.</p>
              <p>This will lead to public disquiet Landed-property ownership is one of the 'privileges of being Singaporean'. We are no longer the  creme de la crem.</p>
              <p>This
              new rule is sneakily reported in the Straits Times Oct 19 2010 page A4.
              Again we see the PAP trying to trick Singaporeans and sneak in a new
              rule that will be unfavourable to us. Lack of transparency.</p>
              <p>But my point is not lack
              of transparency. My point here is that landed is no longer a preserve
              for Singareans. So what's the point of holding Singapore citizenship?</p>
              <p>In 2007, it was reported that “the restrictions on foreign ownership of landed property is unlikely
              to be eased because it is an emotional issue. It involves (putting) a
              tangible, physical part of Singapore in foreign hands,” said Mr Colin
              Tan, director for research and development at Chesterton International.
              <br> <br> “Landed properties should not be priced out of Singaporean’s reach (or)
              it could lead to disgruntled Singaporeans, which would be a cause of
              concern for the Government,” said Mr Charles Chong, chairman of the
              Government Parliamentary Committee for National Development and
              Environment.</p>
              <p>So
              we have no more stake in our own country. So what's the point of being
              a true blue Singaporean? As Leesiewhoi (from this forum) said that
              right now in Singapore, so what if you are a local born true blue
              Singaporean? You are no better or special than any other foreigners
              here.</p>
              <p>I strongly urged true blue Singaporeans to move out of
              Singapore to other countries, then return to Singapore as an expat and
              receive all the privileges of expats.</p>
              <p>Finally, Singapore will
              soon become like London. When you visit London, White Londoners are
              almost extinct. London's population is now Non-White. Similarly in
              Singapore, Singaporeans will become extinct in 10 years time. Singapore
              will become an ang mo (foreiner) country. It's like the ang mos are
              avenging themselves on us for taking over London and New York.<br><br>It's totally pointless to complain to PAP because PAP will pass the bill anyway.<br><br>PAP is diabolical.</p>
