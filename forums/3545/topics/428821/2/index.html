              get all industreies service to manufacturing!!make $$$$ for all citizens and everyone be happy is all dats needed.
              
              throughout history of  mankind from china manufacturing of porcelain in dynasties....these were what n how gold ended up in china and the country somewhat prospered.
              
              all human civilisation needed manufacturing in the past to present.even if u could get a printer to build physical objects at home u still need people to build n asssemble that special gizmo.
              
              aircrafts to zips.they all make $$$ .thats bwhy they have a finNCIAL economic feasibility b4 setting up company in spore.this is usually done by the accountants of corporations from spore and overseas corporation.
              
              big companies like AMD wouldnt want to build their microchips in spore as they would find it not economicallly viable as they can get it cheaper elesewhere.
              
              so it boils down to that people in that country.if that country has people who can only plant veggies n butcher cows.....what kinda industries do u think they have??agriculture of course!
              
              and if another country has people who can design,build machines like breathing air.then that country is engineering with manufacturing in it.
              
              and if another knows only macdonalds,stock exchange of spore&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;service industries...of course.if country can do it as easily as breathing air then u get the best $$$$$ making industries....
              
              its economic feasibility if people in that

              <p>well i'll just answer sbst and elite hitman together ya.</p>
              <p>Those swedish conglomerates mentioned no doubt are mega brands but they dwarf in comparison to the service sector. Just do some research and one will find that many of the developed economies, especially the european ones are focused highly on service sectors....say 70% easily? Well, I'd like to think of taiwan too as one with a high focus on services eg tourism and entertainment with the manufacturing sector easily in their shadows.</p>
              <p>And what do we mean by a service economy or a manufacturing economy? Does it means it's entirely services or manufacturing in that respect? No lol....hope we understand that. Nobody says we should do away with manufacturing too...that's suicidal! It's just a re-shift of focus. Perhaps that's why Tan Jee Say was misunderstood too.</p>

              <p>well, of course we shouldn't be wholly dependent on one sector...that's like the old adage of putting all the eggs into one basket. Problem is, if you rely too much on manufacturing for a developed economy, wages are going to be continuosly low. So that's what people get if they vote PAP. Which MNC isn't here on our shores because we offer skilled albeit cheap labour? By that, I'm talking about our engineers too.</p>
              <p>Of course, if the idea is to give Singapore a very high population, then labour is needed and the shift of emphasis on services won't come about anytime soon. Manufacturing expansion suits PAP's strategy on import of foreigners to a T.</p>

              <p><br>In fact contary my believe, manufacturing sector in some ways has better edges as in you can find ways to improve productivity be in work flow or machinary.</p>
              <p>W/ a local maybe broad it out, engineering industry you can do test trials of new systems locally. Things like thermal scanners came from our local engineering/ science labs.</p>

              <p>That's where you happen to have SMEs who meet Toyota's standards and get to supply a giant. But I believe more parts are made by Valeo and now Wanxiang etc than SMEs.</p>
              <p>When someone wants to print some banners, it's like throwing a piece of meat to be snapped up by the lowest bidder. I won't generalise but SMEs don't exactly offer upgrading of either themselves or their employees' skills and hence profits / pay.</p>

              <p>Casino can only reduce the money supply in the local economy, more money back in government hands, less money in circulation, less multiplier effect, that's why you see local businesses faltering. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
