              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Two-thirds of Singapore workers said their workload has increased when 
              compared with six months ago, according to a survey by online job portal
               JobsCentral.<br><br>Of them, 83.3 per cent said that their work stress has also increased in the last six months.<br><br>Only 1.1 per cent said that stress level has dropped, while 15.5 per cent indicated that it has stayed the same. <br><br>A
               total of 2,281 respondents took the survey and respondents consisted of
               employed individuals from all levels of occupation and income groups. <br><br>Sixty
               per cent of the respondents reported that they stay in the office for 
              at least an hour after work hours at least three days a week. <br><br>One
               in three said they bring their work home to complete, 22 per cent said 
              they have worked from home while on sick leave, and close to one-fifth 
              said they have worked while on vacation. <br><br>Ms Michelle Lim, chief 
              operating officer of JobsCentral Group, said: "Singapore's workplace 
              environment is a tough and demanding one. Workers place career as one of
               the top priorities in their lives and often make personal sacrifices 
              for job advancements. <br><br>"On the other hand, employers faced with 
              increasing manpower cost embark on the unending quest for higher 
              productivity. It is not surprising that our workers are feeling more 
              stressed and working longer hours."<br><br>She added: "Technology such 
              as 3G and wifi on smartphones, tablets and laptops means that you can 
              take work with you wherever you may be. And it also means that employers
               have the expectation that you are available even after office hours. <br><br>"However,
               both employees and employers should learn to respect after-work hours 
              and reasonable allocation of work in order to avoid burning out in the 
              long-term." <br><br>The JobsCentral survey results also found that higher earners have more "workaholic" tendencies. <br><br>They
               are more inclined to work longer hours, bring work home to complete, 
              work while they are on sick leave and even while on vacation. <br><br>Of those who said they clock hours after official knock-off time, most earn more than S$5,000 per month. <br><br>In another section of the survey, it showed that almost one in four Singapore workers said that they feel bullied at work. <br><br>Seventy-four per cent of the respondents who said they were bullied indicated that colleagues are the biggest bully. <br><br>Sixty-two
               per cent of them said that they were bullied by their superiors and 21 
               per cent said they were bullied by their clients. <br><br>The largest 
              group of workers (34 per cent) who said they are bullied are aged 41 to 
              50, and more females (27 per cent) than males (21 per cent) also felt 
              the effects of bullying behaviours. <br><br>Administrative staff were found to be more vulnerable to bullying than PMETs. <br><br>Common
               bullying behaviours reported by respondents include unfair and biased 
              allocation of workload, verbal abuse and personal attacks, ostracising, 
              wrongful accusation, abuse of seniority or power, and gossip.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>Been there.. stressed at the prime of career, stucked in there, not know what to do and bills to pay...bully by colleagues in a multi-national big company who choses to cut cost and have very "powerful" foreign talents...   until a mindset change, until i recognise self empowerment, that we only choose to be bullied by choice. (ok, don't hit me, but seriously first step is to always change self, stand up for self)</p>
              <p>there are alot of "distractions" in this fast growing country, only way is to stay in own path, and identify, or know how to "optimise" the tools that are suitable for own self.  I see so many people chasing after things of other people, so-called success of other people, one can get lost in this jungle.. </p>
              <p>my hope is to see more and more people recognise this and walk their own path... and connect with people more from the heart.</p>
