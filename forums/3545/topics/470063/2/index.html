            <div class='col-md body'>This trend has been practised by most fast food chain restaurants like McDonalds, Burger King &amp; KFC since in the late 70s until now...some customers are considerate enough to clear their thrash before leaving and of course there are others who are inconsiderate to do likewise...so this happens..it is human nature.</div>

But how is it then somehow as we grow up we forgot all about it, I believe it is not that we are not gracious but it's really about us growing up. We start to process our buying habits better, we start to weigh the amount of money we pay for a plate of food and other than satisfying our hunger we also expect the service staff to help us clear since we pay service charge or we feel we paid quite an amount for our food thus we do not need to return our trays anymore. It could also be due to the constant rush we have living in a concrete jungle in Singapore , we rush for lunch and we rush back to work, we rush to eat our food and rush to catch a movie.It became a norm that we inevidently rsush for everything. The only solution I can think of to encourage people to return their trays is to add a small amount to the meal bought such as an additonal 20cents and upon returning of trays this 20cents will be returned to the consumer. Yes we may argue that returning of trays should come as a gracious move and not motivated by monetary but I believe this solution is only temporary and in time to come should be aable to abolish this system and people will start returning their trays automatically. This movemet will only work if the service staff is also appreciative of the consumers returning their trays, I have encountered service staff whom are actually annoyed I returned my own trays but also some with a Thank you and a big smile. The latter was well worth more than 20cents I would say. </p></div>

              <p><br>very difficult one. gahmen shik shiojk think eay just implement the dogs follow wag tail only then news report for show everyone had a laff.</p>
              <p>so many cheap foreigners in sg hwo to implement. tehy should not be here in the first place. who let them in - no need to tnk everyone know the answer.</p>
              <p>return tray is for show only. like when i am around those like to wayang one will show return the tray in front of me. when i am not around no show they fook care.</p>
              <p>you cannot force people to return tray one. you implement 20cent i takeaway eat elsewhere. people implement 50cents for packaging there are those who bring their own contrainers, there are those who just pay and walk away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you cannot force people. you have to educate and caltivate it naturally.</p>
