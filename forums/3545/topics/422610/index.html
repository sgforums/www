              <p><em>A Chinese man’s salary dispute with Budi Centre brought a secret of his to light. (Photo: The New Paper)</em></p>
              <p>Using fake documents, a Chinese national managed to work in Singapore on the pretext of being a monk.</p>
              <p>For nine months, Mr Liu Bing worked as a monk at a Buddhist centre in Geylang.</p>
              <p>The 38-year-old from Shandong province claimed he went through an 
              agent in China who provided him with the fake documents to get 
              employment as a worker in religion.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu said he did general cleaning work under the guise of a monk while working at the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Budi+Centre&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Budi Centre</a>, which is currently being investigated by the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=ministry+of+manpower&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Ministry of Manpower (MOM)</a>.</p>
              <p><strong>Paper trail</strong></p>
              <p>His counterfeit documents included a “certificate” with a photo of 
              him in monk’s robes, stating he was initiated into monkhood in the 
              Shandong Weifang Foshan  Buddhist Temple in 2008. It also bears the seal
               of the “Shandong Province Buddhists Association”.</p>
              <p>There was also an additional “document” allegedly issued by the Linqu
               Notary Public Office, in Shandong, stating that the embossing seal in 
              the first certificate is authentic. Mr Liu also had English translations
               of the documents.</p>
              <p>However, a closer look at the “certificate” shows that it could have 
              been printed on ordinary paper using an inkjet printer. Also, a printed 
              photo of another man showed underneath the passport-size photo of Mr 
              Liu.</p>
              <p>The photo of him in monk’s robes appears to be the same one used in 
              his passport, where he’s seen dressed in ordinary clothes. Mr Liu told <em>The New Paper</em> that the agent had used a computer to “paste” his face onto someone else’s body wearing the monk’s robes.</p>
              <p>“The agent told me that if I pretended to be a monk, I could make 
              $1,000 a month doing odd jobs in a Buddhist centre in Singapore. If I 
              worked elsewhere in Singapore, I would earn only $700.”</p>
              <p>“I asked him if this was okay, and the agent assured me that foreign 
              workers in Singapore used fake documents all the time,” he said. The 
              father of two children, aged 12 and two, added that he went along with 
              the plan as the salary was tempting.</p>
              <p><strong>After arriving in Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>In July 2009, Mr Liu arrived at Changi  Airport dressed in ordinary 
              clothes, but he later changed into the monk’s robes to look convincing 
              when he passed through immigration.</p>
              <p>He also started work at the Budi Centre that month. His job included 
              cleaning the floors and learning to cook for worshippers. But he did not
               speak to the worshippers as he had no religion and knew nothing about 
              Buddhist teachings.</p>
              <p>During his work from 7 am to 7:30 pm daily, Mr Liu would wear a white
               T-shirt and grey trousers instead of the monk’s robes. He expressed his
               discomfort in having to impersonate as a monk and claimed that it was 
              like being “in prison”. He could not leave the centre at night and 
              “hated” wearing the robes as they were “too warm”.</p>
              <p>The fake documents came to light only after he got involved in a salary dispute with the centre.</p>
              <p>Mr Liu said that during the first nine months, his monthly salary of 
              $700 was paid to the agent as “agent fees”. When he would have been 
              entitled to his full salary, the centre dismissed him for no apparent 
              reason.</p>
              <p>He also alleged that the centre did not pay him for overtime work and
               for working on weekends and public holidays. He had approached the MOM 
              regarding his salary dispute and after he revealed using fake documents,
               he was investigated.</p>
              <p>After leaving the centre, he became a packer and was at the same time
               assisting MOM with investigations. He has since stopped work and said 
              that he will be deported back to China on Saturday.</p>
              <p><strong>His words of caution</strong></p>
              <p>An MOM spokesman said that the ministry will investigate Mr Liu’s   
              claims that he was assigned general cleaning work within the temple by  
               his employer even though he was employed as a religious worker.</p>
              <p>By sharing his story, he wants to caution other foreign workers 
              against using fake documents when applying for jobs. “Now I must return 
              to China, and it’ll be harder to support my family. It’s not worth the 
              trouble,” he said.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, Budi Centre’s abbot, Venerable Hui Kuan confirmed that Mr Liu used to work in the centre.</p>
              <p>When queried on the fake documents, he said, “How are we to know if 
              they real or fake? When he applied for the job, this is what we got.” He
               declined to comment further.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Buddhist+Federation&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Singapore Buddhist Federation’s</a> secretary-general, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Venerable+Seck+Kwang+Phing&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Venerable Seck Kwang Phing</a>,
               told the same paper that he was shocked to hear about the story and it 
              was the first time he heard of a foreign worker posing as a monk.</p>
              <p>However, he said that the federation will not be taking action 
              against Budi Centre as it employed workers on its own and not through 
              the federation. But, Venerable Seck added that temples and centres must 
              stringently check the documents of potential employees.<br></p>

              <p>In the olden days, new monks have to do everything in the temples including cleaning and cooking and slowly they were promoted to leading the crowd for chanting. Nowadays, most of the temples (but don't know why this temple is different) hire aunties and uncles because there are very few monks around.</p>
