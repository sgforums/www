              <h1 class="storyheadline">Chiam: Vacating Potong Pasir a personal sacrifice to strengthen
               opposition</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Michael Tan's letter last Saturday ('Chiam should have 
              spared a thought for loyal voters').</p>
              <p>I must balance the interest of Singapore and the interest of
               the residents of Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>To have a strong democracy, Singapore must have enough 
              opposition in Parliament to balance the strength of the People's Action 
              Party. Singapore has had only two opposition MPs for far too long, 
              without the prospect of a successful opposition bid in capturing a group
               representation constituency (GRC).</p>
              <p>I have decided to make a sacrifice by coming out of my 
              comfort zone to capture a GRC in order to expand the strength of the 
              opposition. I have not abandoned the residents of Potong Pasir. Their 
              interest is always with me and so, for this reason, I have chosen my 
              wife to take my place and represent me in Potong Pasir. She has been 
              helping me all these years in parliamentary and constituency work.</p>
              <p>I chose her because she is able and trustworthy, and not 
              because she is my wife. Unlike Mr Low Thia Khiang (the other opposition 
              MP, for Hougang), who is much younger than me, I have completed six 
              elections. It is time for me to move forward to help the opposition 
              grow. I seek your understanding and support for my decision, which was 
              not an easy one to reach. In time, I hope Mrs Chiam will be able to earn
               the residents' trust to serve them.</p>
              <p>I thank all residents for their unwavering support all these
               years and for my choice of the new candidate.</p>
              <p><strong>Chiam See Tong <br>MP for Potong Pasir </strong></p>
