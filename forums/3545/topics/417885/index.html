              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : A 
              57-year-old man was fined S$2,000 for using threatening words on the 
              chairman of the Young PAP Marine Parade Branch.<br><br>He claimed that 
              he would incite hatred among the different races in Singapore.<br><br>Peethambaran
               Dilip also indicated to 36-year-old Nancy Quah Suat Lay that he would 
              sow discord between Singaporeans and Malaysians.<br><br>The unemployed 
              man did so at the party's Marine Parade Branch at Block 46 Marine 
              Crescent as he was not satisfied with the level of aid provided to him.<br><br>Peethambaran
               had been visiting the branch since July last year as he needed help 
              from relevant government agencies after being unemployed for some time.<br><br>He
               visited it at around 11pm on 28 October 2009 to follow up on his 
              previous applications for aid and was served by Ms Quah.<br><br>However,
               Peethambaran soon became agitated and threatened her as he was not 
              satisfied with the service he received.<br><br>Alarmed by his words, Ms 
              Quah referred the matter to the branch secretary, 42-year-old Ong Shang 
              Jim, who then informed the police.<br><br>Peethambaran's lawyer Noor 
              Mohamed Marican told the court that his client has realised his mistake.<br><br>Based
               on a report from the Institute of Mental Health dated September 20 this
               year, Peethambaran is also suffering from delusional disorder.<br><br>He
               has a history of mental problems and was first sent to the old 
              Woodbridge Hospital in July 1976.<br><br>For using threatening words on 
              Ms Quah, Peethambaran could have been fined up to S$5,000.<br><br>-

              <p>This PAP is quite useless, they must be voted out.</p>
              <p>so what exactly did he say to incite violence between Malaysian and Singaporeans?</p>

              <p>Harry Lee Kuan Yew apparently also wanted to instigate riots and disorder in Singapore in order to provide a pretext for the british to suspend the constitution; end the political process in Singapore and thus block the left wing from coming to power:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In a conversation with Selkirk, on 28 July 1961, at time of the formation of the Barisan Sosialis, Moore reported Lee Kuan Yew's tactics in the following terms:</p>
              <blockquote style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px;">He went on to suggest that in order to avoid the Communists taking over, he would create a situation in which the UK Commissioner would be forced to suspend the Constitution. This might be done either by the Singapore Government inviting a Russian trade mission to Singapore thus forcing a constitutional crisis, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">or by instigating riots and disorder, requiring the intervention of British troops.</span></span></strong> I did, however, form the impression that <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">he was quite certain he would lose a general election and was seriously toying with the thought of forcing British intervention in order to prevent his political enemies from forming a government</span></span></strong> (CO 1030/1149, p. 95, para 3).</blockquote>
              <p><br><br>The 'anti-colonial fighters', the PAP leadership, wanted to ride to power on the backs of British armoured carriers.</p>

I beg you to ...<br><br>Mr Speaker: No, I will give you one minute.<br><br>Enche' Chia Thye Poh: Sir, when the Prime Minister talks of defending our country, we find it hollow. This Government has betrayed all the vital interests of the people to the British. It has no right to talk of defending the nation. This Government is oppressing the people; more than 200 political leaders and trade unionists are in the jails of Singapore. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Our Secretary- General, Mr Lim Chin Siong, is in Changi and political dwarfs like Mr Lee Kuan Yew can strut around and talk big only when giants like Mr Lim Chin Siong are kept out of the political arena</span></span></strong> (interruption).<br><br>Mr Speaker: Do not disturb him.<br><br>Enche' Chia Thye Poh: The Prime Minister has spoken about the communal riots in Singapore. He says that the Indonesians and the Communists caused it. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We are from Singapore and we know that this is just to cover up the real culprits. </span></span></strong>The Prime Minister of Singapore is telling, in Europe, that the UMNO politicians have caused it. The UMNO in Singapore says that the P.A.P. has caused it. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">We who are in Singapore know that the communal riots were the work of the UMNO and the P.A.P. who were indulging in a bitter fight for power . All this nonsense about the Indonesians and the Communists causing these riots is just to hide the truth that the main culprits belong to the ruling parties.</span></span></strong><br><br>SOME HONOURABLE MEMBERS : Nonsense! Lies<br><br>Enche' Chia Thye Poh : We challenge the Government to have a public enquiry into this. When the riots started . . . .<br><br>Mr Speaker : Order, order! Your time is up—it is already one minute.<br><br>*****<br><br>2 years later, at the age of 26, Member of Parliament for Jurong Mr Chia Thye Poh was arrested and detained without charge or trial. He spent a total of 23 years in prison and another 9 years under restrictive orders in Sentosa. Upon his release in 1998, he publicly called for the abolition of the ISA. He attained his phD recently, but his last known whereabouts are uncertain.</p>
