              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Former minister for foreign affairs George Yeo said he is thinking hard about running for the Presidential Election.<br><br>Writing on Wednesday on his Facebook page, Mr Yeo said he is "praying for wisdom".<br><br>He also indicated many Singaporeans had asked him to reconsider his decision.<br><br>Mr Yeo had previously said he did not have the temperament to become President.<br><br>The Elections Department on Wednesday distributed seven certificates of eligibility for the Presidential Elections. <br><br>First to pick up the forms was seventy-year-old Ooi Boon Ewe.<br><br>Mr Ooi failed in his bid to contest the recent General Election as an independent candidate.<br><br>He
               said he has resigned as chairman of his political party -- the People's
               Liberal Democratic Party -- in order to run for President.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               former People's Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament (MP) Tan Cheng 
              Bock also collected his certificate of eligibility.<br><br>Dr Tan said 
              he would go back to his roots to rally support, and intends to carry out
               walkabouts at his former ward of Ayer Rajah.<br><br>He said he came 
              personally to collect the forms along with supporters to show he is 
              serious about contesting the Presidential Election.<br><br>Dr Tan said he believes Singaporeans should vote for a presidential candidate based on individual merit.<br><br>"I would prefer that people take a deep analysis of the individual candidate, irrespective of his (past) party," Dr Tan said. <br><br>"I will lose some votes maybe because of my past association with PAP. But that's all in the game, it's ok. <br><br>"If
               they don't like me because I belong to the PAP, they are free not to 
              elect me. But I want to believe that Singaporeans generally would assess
               me on a slightly different view."<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>Like all PAP MPs, Tan Cheng Bock is a good man and is suitable to be our next President.</p>
              <p>But personally I think Lim Boon Heng is a better choice. After all he lead the NTUC and fought for us workers!</p>

              <p>If george yeo runs, it's a tough choice. Nice chap but he has never really spoken up for the people before. And it's only until recently where you see him speaking about change within the PAP. Can't blame him on that either...he's often overseas as the FM and he doesnt attend meet the people sessions. Plus....he's also close to the Lee family. There shouldn't be a chance of him turning against his old friends?</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, never doubted that he genuinely meant it when he said "change".</p>
              <p>Tan cheng bock on the other hand has over the years, spoken about the need to help the less advantaged singaporeans. Not very highly profiled but still, his track record shows.</p>
              <p>Can we have a third candidate pls?</p>
