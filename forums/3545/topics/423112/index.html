              <h3>Feb 18, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>WHILE the buzz leading to today's Budget is palpable, I am less enthused for two reasons.</p>
              <p>First, my home address. Based on my pay, I am considered 
              middle-income. But because the Government chooses to look instead at the
               address written on my identity card, rather than my income, I am 
              invariably disqualified from receiving the many incentives handed out on
               Budget day.</p>
              <p>My father, an ordinary civil servant, had the foresight to 
              invest in a landed property long ago and so, I have lived in a landed 
              property since my birth.</p>
              <p>But because of my father's foresight, I am considered 'wealthy'.</p>
              <p>The other reason I don't look forward to the Budget is that I am single.</p>
              <p>Being single makes one feel that one does not really matter in the scheme of things.</p>
              <p>It does not matter that I am living with my parents and caring for them.</p>
              <p>Because I don't come attached with a husband and/or children, I am not important.</p>
              <p>So while everyone is wondering how the Budget will benefit 
              them, my hope is that the Government stops coming up with rules and 
              regulations that make it difficult for a single person to live in 
              Singapore and care for her parents at the same time.</p>

              <p>First of all, I have to congrat her for being born in a well-off family with a landed property and a well-pay income. Under such a comfortable environment where the parent gave her the best of the world, what on earth is she still asking for? tax-rebate? still-virgin rebate?</p>

              <p>Dear Ms Lee:</p>
              <p>- You live in a landed property which is worth a lot, and I truly applaud your father's foresight.</p>
              <p>- If living in a landed property antagonizes you that much, then you can persuade your father to sell it and downgrade to a HDB flat. Then you can keep the remainder in the bank and qualify for more Budget 'goodies'.</p>
              <p>- Taking care of your parents is not easy. However, there are married people who must take care of a spouse, children AND parents.</p>
              <p>- In the end, it would do you a whole lot of good to realize that there are a lot of other people out there who have it far, far worse than you are.</p>

              <p>there is a point there. most of you just missed it.</p>
              <p>if there is a benefit, it should benefit all who can benefit from it, and not have various conditions attached to it. so if govt want to give 1000 to every citizen, then it shall be so. poor get 1k, rich oso get 1k.</p>
              <p>as for disincentives, those should be meted out for specific sets of items. such as personal income tax (the more you earn, the more the govt takes from you, cos govt knows you will still prefer to earn more than to earn less) and luxury items. you dont need them to enjoy life in SG, but if you wanna keep up with the jones, we'll gladly tax u for it.</p>

              <p>there is a point there. most of you just missed it.</p>
              <p>if there is a benefit, it should benefit all who can benefit
              from it, and not have various conditions attached to it. so if govt
              want to give 1000 to every citizen, then it shall be so. poor get
              1k, rich oso get 1k.</p>
              <p>as for disincentives, those should be meted out for specific
              sets of items. such as personal income tax (the more you earn, the
              more the govt takes from you, cos govt knows you will still prefer
              to earn more than to earn less) and luxury items. you dont need
              them to enjoy life in SG, but if you wanna keep up with the jones,
              we'll gladly tax u for it.</p>

              <p>The point of Budget goodies is simple.</p>
              <p>You live the good life, you get less.</p>
              <p>You live a hard life, you get more.</p>
              <p>You may argue that giving the same amount to everyone is egalitarian.</p>
              <p>But think about it: what is $1k to a blue-collar uncle earning $1.2k a month, living in a 1-room rental flat?</p>
              <p>And what is $1k to a middle-class woman earning $3k, and living in a landed property?</p>
              <p>Think about it.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Single? Don't blame Govt for fewer goodies</h1>
              <p>I AM puzzled by Miss Yvonne Lee's lament ('Single woman sings the middle-income blues'; last Friday).</p>
              <p>Miss Lee suggests she has the right to a government handout 
              because living in a landed property bought by her father has left her in
               a predicament which prevents her from receiving many goodies from the 
              Budget - never mind the potential windfall she was 'born' into when her 
              father bought the landed home.</p>
              <p>Consider a well-off person joining a queue for food relief 
              meant for the poor and disadvantaged, and asking why when he is denied 
              the handout.</p>
              <p>Getting Miss Lee out of her predicament is not the business of the Government or any other public agency.</p>
              <p>As citizens, we should be aware that such Budget goodies are meant to lighten the burden of the less well-off and the poor.</p>
              <p>Choosing to remain single is a personal decision, whose social cost is not the Government's responsibility to finance.</p>
              <p>By contrast, an ageing population, for instance, is an issue
               that the Government must tackle because of its direct repercussions on 
              Singapore's survivability.</p>
              <p>So, while I empathise with Miss Lee, it would be unfair to pass on the expenses of one's personal decision as a social cost.</p>

              <h3>Feb 18, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>WHILE the buzz leading to today's Budget is palpable, I am less
              enthused for two reasons.</p>
              <p>First, my home address. Based on my pay, I am considered
              middle-income. But because the Government chooses to look instead
              at the address written on my identity card, rather than my income,
              I am invariably disqualified from receiving the many incentives
              handed out on Budget day.</p>
              <p>My father, an ordinary civil servant, had the foresight to
              invest in a landed property long ago and so, I have lived in a
              landed property since my birth.</p>
              <p>But because of my father's foresight, I am considered
              'wealthy'.</p>
              <p>The other reason I don't look forward to the Budget is that I am
              single.</p>
              <p>Being single makes one feel that one does not really matter in
              the scheme of things.</p>
              <p>It does not matter that I am living with my parents and caring
              for them.</p>
              <p>Because I don't come attached with a husband and/or children, I
              am not important.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">So while everyone is wondering how the Budget will benefit them,
              my hope is that the Government stops coming up with rules and
              regulations that make it difficult for a single person to live in
              Singapore and care for her parents at the same time.</span></p>
