              <p>Second, if the Government is truly concerned about the

              <p>Are single children less filial just because they have chosen not to start their own families?</p>

              <p>Dear Ms Lee:</p>
              <p>1. The distribution of aid seems rather fair to me. You live the good life, you get less. You live a hard life, you get more.</p>
              <p>You may disagree that you are living a good life. Ask yourself, though: how do you compare to your similarly-earning colleagues who live in a HDB flat? Should you fall on hard times, your father can liquidate his landed property, downgrade to a decent HDB flat, and still pocket a rather substantial profit.</p>
              <p>Your similarly-earning colleagues living in a HDB flat do not have such a luxury.</p>
              <p>2. Staying single is your choice, and caring for your parents is a duty. I applaud your sense of fillial piety.</p>
              <p>However, married people must care for their spouses, their children, their parents, AND their spouses' parents. As you can see, their responsibility is significantly greater than that of singles.</p>
              <p>As a recently-married man, I can vouch for that fact.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>

              <p>Seriously, Ms Lee is dense.</p>
              <p>There is no way any handouts from Govt is going to be fair. All systems have loopholes. If the Govt can be fair, then the Govt is able to perform the following:</p>
              <p>Measure each person's earning capability, skill acquisiton ability, sustenance ability, ability to upgrade. Each family total assets, amount of asset distribution in the family etc etc etc.</p>
              <p>Can they? No Government can do that.</p>
              <p>è�½ç½‘ä¹‹é±¼.</p>
              <p>Too bad she's the minority and too bad she's arguing without emphasis of her hardship, her obstacles and seemed to be just another Gov/handout whacker.</p>

              <h3>Feb 24, 2011 - ST Forum<br></h3>
              <h1>Rules stacked against filial singles</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Kenny Liu's response ('Single? Don't blame Govt for fewer goodies'; Tuesday) to my letter last Friday, ('Single woman sings the middle-income blues').</p>
              <p>I had only wanted to make two points. First, if the Government really wants to share with its citizens, it should be fair in the distribution of aid.</p>
              <p>I work in a voluntary welfare organisation and am a middle-income earner, but I am not looking for a 'handout'. I am merely pointing out the 'unfairness' in a flawed system.</p>
              <p>Second, if the Government is truly concerned about the greying population and also about their welfare as they age, why put obstacles in the way of single children who wish to care for their parents?</p>
              <p>Are single children less filial just because they have chosen not to start their own families?</p>
              <p>Staying single is my choice. Taking care of my parents is also my choice. I only ask that the Government does not add to the challenges I face.</p>
