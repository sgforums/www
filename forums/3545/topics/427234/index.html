              <p><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">Alicia Wong</span> | <span class="provider org">SingaporeScene</span> – <abbr title="2011-04-07T06:17:21Z">2 hours 25 minutes ago</abbr></cite></p>
              <p>Controversial socio-political website <em>The Temasek Review</em> (TR) will be shutting down sometime after July this year following several years of operation.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive email interview with <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>, 
              editor Amanda Tan said that the editorial team of seven made the 
              decision partly because of uncertainty over funding for the site, which 
              is not for profit and runs on donations.</p>
              <p>"TR's popularity has exceeded all our expectations, and with 
              increased readership demands for hardware rises (sic), and it would 
              reach a level which the TR team can no longer comfortably afford," she 
              said.</p>
              <p>TR now has 5,000 unique visitors per day with 100,000 page views.</p>
              <p>"TR was never meant to 'live' forever. It was set up to help 
              cultivate political awareness among fellow Singaporeans and we felt that
               we have achieved that," said Tan.</p>
              <p>"We have started the ball rolling and it is time we work on getting 
              back our lives and spending more time with our family," she said.</p>
              <p>Since it started, the site has made waves online with its famous -- 
              or infamous -- reports critical of Singapore's ruling People's Action 
              Party.</p>
              <p>Last year, Singapore's state investment company, <span id="lw_1302160018_0" class="yshortcuts">Temasek Holdings</span>,
               asked the website to change its name, claiming TR was trying to 
              capitalise on the goodwill and reputation linked to the name "Temasek 
              Review".</p>
              <p>Tan stressed that there was no "external influence" pressuring them 
              to close the site, which has garnered a reputation for being stridently 
              anti-government.</p>
              <p>Claiming TR is "not against any institution or anyone in particular",
               she said, "We really do not believe that the government is all out to 
              shut us down because with their vast resources, they would already have 
              done so if they had wanted to."</p>
              <p>Noting that the closure — which will take place after they resolve 
              all matters to do with TR Debit Card orders — is "a question of when, 
              not if", Tan said, "The sale of our domain and donations did in a way 
              help keep the site alive, but what about next year, the year after and 
              so forth?"</p>
              <p>Tan added, "It is indeed a difficult decision for our team of seven, 
              but we realised that inevitably it is a path we have to take, and (we 
              have to) learn to move on."</p>
              <p>Recently, the team has been dropping hints of an impending closure. 
              In a post this month, Tan urged those involved with TR to buy its debit 
              card and "own a 'piece' of history when TR is no more".</p>
              <p>Did last year's reports that general practitioner Joseph Ong was TR's
               founder influence the team's decision? No, said Tan. "When we took 
              over, it was a fresh team."</p>
              <p>Ong told the media he was involved with the site from 2007 but had stopped in 2009.</p>
              <p>While Tan said there is a possibility for the site to be handed over 
              to a "new dedicated team", it would be "difficult to find a team we can 
              trust".</p>
              <p>In October 2010, the TR domain was sold to a business woman. If a new
               team is not found, the buyer would likely sell the domain name, said 
              Tan.</p>
              <p><strong>Will the team finally reveal itself?</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p>"We will be meeting up for <span id="lw_1302160018_6" class="yshortcuts">Christmas</span> and surely pictures will be taken. If anyone of us gets too drunk, we 
              might "accidentally" email some to The Online Citizen," Tan quipped.</p>
              <p>While it is still early days, it is unlikely the team will get together again to start another TR-type project, said Tan.</p>
              <p>She said, the team hopes for other online sites to "carry on such spirit of <span id="lw_1302160018_2" class="yshortcuts">citizen journalism</span>" in <span id="lw_1302160018_4" class="yshortcuts">Singapore</span>.</p>
              <p>"Such citizen journalism augments Singapore's mainstream media to 
              provide an overall balanced coverage to Singaporeans. In this way, the 
              society moves forward as a whole."</p>
              <p><strong>A loss for the <span id="lw_1302160018_5" class="yshortcuts">blogosphere</span>?</strong></p>
              <p>Professor Ang Peng Hwa, acting head for the division of journalism and <span id="lw_1302160018_9" class="yshortcuts">publishing</span> in <span id="lw_1302160018_1" class="yshortcuts">Nanyang Technological University</span>, said this is "definitely a loss for the blogsphere and also for critical discourse in Singapore".</p>
              <p>"I personally don't agree with many of the comments made in TR, but I
               think it's an outlet for ideas worth talking about," he said, wondering
               also if the team has lost its "passion".</p>
              <p>Founder and editor of commentary website New Asia Republic Donaldson Tan said the website will be "greatly missed".</p>
              <p>Its anonymity allows the site to play an important role in covering 
              controversial news stories but also constraints its ability to raise 
              money from the public, he noted.</p>
              <p>"It would easily cost at least $500/month to run a <span id="lw_1302160018_3" class="yshortcuts">web server</span> with very high bandwidth and <span id="lw_1302160018_7" class="yshortcuts">DDOS</span> protection," said Tan, who suggested TR consider downgrading its 
              internet infrastructure after the General Election rather than shutting 
              down.</p>
              <p>Tan said that there may be bloggers aspiring to "fill the big shoes" 
              of TR but they would lack the site's organisation. "It take years to 
              fine-tune the operation run by voluntary bloggers, to build a reputation
               and to achieve the level of online popularity Temasek Review has 
              achieved."</p>
              <p>He urged for TR to continue operations at least until GE 2011-12 is over.</p>
