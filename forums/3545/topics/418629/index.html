              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A TAXI driver was jailed for three weeks on Wednesday for doing a rash 
              act to endanger the personal safety of others.</p>
              <p>Dany Lu You Cong, 55, who had pleaded guilty, had reversed 
              his cab with its front door open, resulting in it hitting a carpark 
              enforcement team leader's shoulder.</p>
              <p>The incident took place at the multi-storey carpark of Block
               291F Bukit Batok Street 24 on April 30, 2010. Mr Kahar Sulong was doing
               his rounds at the carpark with a colleague at about 2am that day when 
              they saw that the tabs of a coupon in Lu's taxi were folded and not 
              torn.</p>
              <p>After taking down the particulars, Mr Kahar, 25, decided to 
              return later to make a check on the coupon when the driver returned. 
              Subsequently, the two men approached Lu as he was opening the door to 
              his taxi.</p>
              <p>After identifying himself, Mr Kahar asked Lu to hand over 
              the carpark coupon on display but he refused and shouted to them to move
               away. He started the engine with the door still open and while 
              reversing, the door hit the back of Mr Kahar's right shoulder.</p>
              <p>Lu, who had two other charges considered, could have been 
              jailed for up to six months and/or fined up to $2,500 for the rash act.</p>

              <p>tis is really two groups of peopple who cannot handle the situation properly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know some security or personal jus cos they work or represent a certain law they sometimes tends to abuse it. once i took photos at a certain place and the area where i took can use flash, the security guards come and tell me cannot use and follow me everywhere to ensure i don't use any flash. i am now waiting one fine day good back there and do it in front of them and if they approach me i will bring out my printed copy of the dos and don;t of the place and show them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the cabby should not have droved off. he should have just torn the ticket and tell them prob he in a rush and missed it. if the two still pursue that means they are pobably trying to pick on him. in fact the two security should advice the cabby to just torn the ticket and move on, tell him that he should do it eveyrtime he park there. case close. the cabby if after doing that should immediately call the police and tell the police the two secirity guards refuse to let him leave even after his ticket was torn off.</p>
