              <p>I HAD an accident at work last June. Initially, the interim hospital 
              bill from the National University Hospital indicated a subsidy.</p>
              <p>But when the final bill was given to me, I was shocked. The 
              bill for my stay at a C-class ward amounted to an unsubsidised total of 
              $147,000.</p>
              <p>I was discharged on Aug 13 last year and the reason for the 
              difference between what was stated in the interim bill and the final one
               was not explained at all.</p>
              <p>Only after I asked was I told that the Ministry of Health had withdrawn the subsidy as the accident was work- related.</p>
              <p>About a month after my discharge, I applied for a waiver of 
              the outstanding amount of about $122,000 through my MP. This was after 
              my company had paid $25,000.</p>
              <p>As far as I am aware, the hospital did not reply to the appeal.</p>
              <p>Three months later, after more deductions from my MediShield
               ($41,000) and Medisave accounts ($31,000), I was informed that the 
              hospital was in the process of scheduling an instalment payment plan for
               the remaining $50,000.</p>
              <p>Needless to say, my family and I are plagued by anxiety. I 
              am 54 years old and work in the construction sector; my wife works 
              part-time and my daughters are still in their teens.</p>
              <p>How can an average Singaporean worker like me support a 
              family, pay off a huge hospital bill and still find more money to pay 
              for subsequent medical requirements arising from the accident and 
              treatment?</p>
              <p>If I had been given a subsidy, I would not have been burdened by this unexpectedly trying financial circumstances.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Patient turned down advice on subsidies</h1>
              <p>MR TAN Guan Seng spent most of his hospitalisation at the 
              high-dependency and intensive-care units during his two-month stay at 
              the National University Hospital.</p>
              <p>His hospitalisation charges were originally pegged at the 
              subsidised rate as our admission office staff had overlooked that it was
               a work-related injury. We apologised to him for this.</p>
              <p>When Mr Tan's wife made a request to upgrade him to a 
              private ward, the hospital's staff informed her that the estimated bill 
              would exceed the quantum to be borne by Mr Tan's employer under the Work
               Injury Compensation Act.</p>
              <p>Under the Act, Mr Tan's employer is liable to pay medical 
              expenses for up to one year from the date of the accident, subject to a 
              cap of $25,000.</p>
              <p>However, hospitals are given the discretion to downgrade 
              patients admitted for work-related injuries and who have financial 
              difficulties to subsidised status, if they meet the criteria after a 
              financial assessment.</p>
              <p>We empathise with Mr Tan's situation. In our bid to assist 
              him, we advised him to undergo a financial assessment to confirm if he 
              could qualify for higher subsidies for his medical expenses. Mr Tan did 
              not take up the offer.</p>
              <p>He was also advised to check with his employer if his medical expenses could be covered under the company's insurance policy.</p>
              <p>In September, Mr Tan appealed for a waiver of the 
              outstanding amount through his MP. We considered his appeal and 
              explained that as he was appropriately charged for the treatment 
              provided, we could not accede to his request.</p>
              <p>As he did not take up our earlier offers for financial assessment, we were unable to explore other forms of assistance.</p>
              <p>In consideration of his appeal, we offered Mr Tan an 
              instalment plan to settle the outstanding amount. The offer was rejected
               by Mr Tan.</p>
