              <p>DO women make better neighbours than men? Maybe they do, if this 
              year's awards are any indication.</p>
              <p>At the Good Neighbour Award ceremony on Friday night, they 
              clearly took centrestage - nine of the 11 national recipients were 
              female.</p>
              <p>Organised for the second year by the Housing Board (HDB) and
               the People's Association, the awards received more than 2,500 entries, 
              with roughly equal numbers for the open and the student categories. The 
              latter was started this year to promote neighbourliness among youth.</p>
              <p>The youngest winner, from the student category, was primary 
              school pupil Nur Darwisyah Durrani Mohamad Yusof, 9.</p>
              <p>She helps to keep her neighbours' shoes in the shoe-rack 
              when common corridors are being washed, among other things.</p>
              <p>'When my sisters are unhappy, she would bring her pet rabbit
               to let them play with it,' said neighbour Sumaiya Parween Mohd Sadiq, 
              11.</p>

              <p><strong>6 youths receive Good Neighbour Award</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi / Dylan Loh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 26 November 2010 2239 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Six 
              youths from primary and secondary schools were among 11 people 
              recognised on Friday as "good neighbours" for going the extra mile to 
              care for their community.<br><br>They won the award under the Student 
              category, introduced for the first time this year by the National 
              Development Ministry.<br><br>13-year-old Cheyenne Chong impressed the 
              panel in the way she mobilised her community to search for her 
              neighbour's missing dog.<br><br>Although they were unable to find the 
              dog, what she did touched the hearts of many in her block and pulled 
              them closer together as a community.<br><br>Another young recipient, 
              11-year-old Tan Yu Yun, keeps a blog of her experiences in helping her 
              neighbours, in order to inspire her friends to do the same.<br><br>Senior
               Minister of State for National Development Grace Fu, who presented them
               with the awards, said while these may be simple acts, what these young 
              award recipients did make an impact on their community.<br><br>She said 
              they brought the community closer together and inspired others to be 
              good neighbours.<br><br>She added that in high density housing estates, 
              consideration for others is more critical than ever.<br><br>Citing a 
              recent example, Ms Fu related how a ceiling leak that originated from 
              the upper floor couldn't be fixed as the upper floor neighbour refused 
              to allow the repair works to proceed.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
