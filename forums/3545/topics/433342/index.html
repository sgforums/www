              <h3 class="date_story">Jun 27, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>ON A recent trip to Singapore, I again visited the Kranji War 
              Memorial site. I am a proud Australian, appreciative of the sacrifices 
              made for the Commonwealth of Nations and the presentation and 
              maintenance of this site is so beautiful.</p>
              <p>At the entrance gates, there was a group of people, probably
               aged between seven and 50 years old, and numbering at least 30. They 
              were apparently enjoying some sort of competitive run and were in high 
              spirits. The members of this group approached the memorial site, 
              running, shouting and exhibiting great exuberance. Their task was to 
              identify a group of names from one of the walls, have their photograph 
              taken and then report to the team leader.</p>
              <p>I found their behaviour most inappropriate and spoke to a 
              woman who seemed to be one of the supervisors. She told me the group was
               from the Rock of Ages Church and they were having a fun day out. She 
              said she "supposed" they knew the significance of their chosen 
              recreation spot.</p>
              <p>My husband and I were not the only people visiting the site 
              but the fun-lovers were pushing their way around the walls with no 
              respect or, I suspect, awareness of the symbolism of this beautiful and 
              (usually) serene place of memory.</p>
              <p>I watched the members carefully and not one even gave a 
              glance at a single headstone. I cried as I walked between the rows of 
              young people who gave their lives and I became quite angry.</p>
              <p>The lawns and gardens are maintained so beautifully and so 
              respectfully that I was shocked to see the grounds used as a public 
              park, and so I feel compelled to bring the matter to your attention.</p>
