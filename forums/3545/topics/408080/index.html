            <div class='col-md body'><p>I'm from the US and working in Sing for a few years. I had visited here before, but living here has been an entirely different situation. Over the year+ that I've lived here I've come to really thing Singapore is "perfect." Little pollution, great public transport, low crime and what appears to be an American-like "do whatever you'd like as long as it doesn't hurt anyone else" type of attitude. However, I can't help but feel that I'm wrong and what I'm seeing as perfect might just be a well controlled illusion. So, can someone tell me what the deal is? What are some problems in Singapore that most of us outsiders aren't aware of?</p></div>

              <p>Assuming he's really an "ang moh." His English reads a little differently from typical American-English. </p>

              <p><br>There is no perfect country. All countries have their problems.</p>
              <p>Singapore is like Disneyland. All is fun and laughter if you have money. You won't have as much fun or enjoy yourself as much without cash in Singapore eh?</p>
              <p>Anyway, I guess the biggest problem right now is the income gap between the rich and the less privilaged. As much as the Government try to conceal/control, the income divide is getting bigger and bigger and will just worsen.</p>
              <p>I guess the best way is to experience it. Try going around pretending that you are down and out without cash, and maybe you will lose this surreal feeling.</p>

              <p>In short, the strict laws. Appears to be "do whatever you like as long asit doesn't hurt anyone else" ???? No way, try protesting....over some thing like price hike, inflation or Union strike, the govt will send you back to your home country at the first chance.</p>
              <p>No spitting, no chewing gum, no loittering. Punch somebody you get a $3000 fine plus risk being jailed for months. If Mel Gibson had been here and uttered those apparently reported remarks, he would have been jailed and fined. What a fine country !</p>
              <p>And don't play play with drugs. Mandatory death sentence. You carry 10gm also can die. In a sense this is good because the country is almost drug free not like in the USA, where drug trade has killed thousands of people and many hollywood stars, crime is high with the Mexican gangs, Black gangs, Mafia and White Supremacists groups that ply the drug trade. In Singapore, crime related to drugs is significantly lower and prisons are less crowded thanks to the mandatory death sentence for drug smuggling. That is something positive to look to.</p>
              <p>Prison is the worse place for reform, most Americans enter jail only to come out to be even more hardened criminals and likely to break the law. Prisons are places where prisoners get their network and recruit new gang members for the outside world. Now, American taxpayers are burdened with 2 million prison population, of which 30% are drug related criminals. Mandatory death sentence would have solved the problem. Not to mention, drug smugglers should not be spared because they kill so many innocent people, mafias and gang-bangers kill so many innocent people in Mexico and USA. In Colombia millions of people get displaced and become refugee no thanks to FARC, the main exporter of the world'sheroin. Taliban is using the drug trade to finance its operations. So if one thinks its cool to take drugs, think again, think of how many people you kill in other countries, in order for the drug to be sent to you. Get high so that many people in Colombia, Afganistan and Mexico get killed.</p>
