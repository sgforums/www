              <p>Westernization is a bitch, they've invaded the minds of our
                  society.  Unfortunately, Singapore was so young when it lost
                  its innocence to the western culture, we barely have the time to
                  develop our own.</p>
              <p>Look at the enormous billboards of white women and men, barely
                  clothed, larger than life-size, in your shopping malls and along
                  the streets of Singapore.  This doesn't just occur magically,
                  you've been brainwashed since the day globalization and consumerism
                  took place in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Disneyfication occurs, white people's image is sold to you every
                  single day through our multi-media, TV, movies, books and internet.
                  We subconsciously idolize white people, some of us even dye our
                  hair blonde, put color contact lenses, because they're perplexed by
                  their own identity. Ultimately, we've lowered ourselves to the
                  white people by thinking they're a better race, we developed inferiority complex, that's also one of the reason why we fear( hum ji and kan si) that allowed some of the white people to
                  be impudent towards us.</p>
              <p>Guess what, even I'm stuck in this western cesspit, I'm using
                  English language to express myself! What happens, happens already,
                  just bear with it, for now. Remember this, when the movement for
                  change is here, join in the movement and don't ever just sit around
                  there, thinking that someone else will do it because that is what
                  the power wants you to behave, they want you to do nothing.</p>

              Let's face it . We can't really generalise . There as good ang mohs and there are also insufferable ones! 
              
              But one thing is for sure  as locals we must never "kow tow" to someone just because he or she is an ang  moh! The rules and the laws a swell a s services must apply fairly to all whether local or  ang mohs.
              
              You will note that in some food/retail outlets , the service staff will perk up with a smile and with the greatest politeness greet any angmoh who walks into their establishment. But when a local walks in, they don't even  bother to greet or attend to.  As a local , must you accept such discriminatory service standards?  No you shouldn't! 
              
              In such instances,  I walk up to the service staff  and tell them exactly what I think, and then also follow up with a letter to the management of the establishment.

              <p>Don't be so sure... the status quo is changing rapidly. In the next 50 years both the U.S and Europe will be totally at the mercy of human capital flight from poorer countries. These days, brain drain is the biggest killer.</p>

              <p>Westernization is a bitch, they've invaded the minds of our
              society.  Unfortunately, Singapore was so young when it lost
              its innocence to the western culture, we barely have the time to
              develop our own.</p>
              <p>Look at the enormous billboards of white women and men, barely
              clothed, larger than life-size, in your shopping malls and along
              the streets of Singapore.  This doesn't just occur magically,
              you've been brainwashed since the day globalization and consumerism
              took place in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Disneyfication occurs, white people's image is sold to you every
              single day through our multi-media, TV, movies, books and internet.
              We subconsciously idolize white people, some of us even dye our
              hair blonde, put color contact lenses, because they're perplexed by
              their own identity. Ultimately, we've lowered ourselves to the
              white people by thinking they're a better race, we developed
              inferiority complex, that's also one of the reason why we fear( hum
              ji and kan si) that allowed some of the white people to be impudent
              towards us.</p>
              <p>Guess what, even I'm stuck in this western cesspit, I'm using
              English language to express myself! What happens, happens already,
              just bear with it, for now. Remember this, when the movement for
              change is here, join in the movement and don't ever just sit around
              there, thinking that someone else will do it because that is what
              the power wants you to behave, they want you to do nothing.</p>

              <p>Singapore is 75% chinese wah. Why it is necessary to go and use some alien ang moh language as dominant language?</p>

              <p>Singapore chinese is not 10%, not 20%, not 40%, not 50%, not 60% but <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">75%.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p>Why the hell need to use alien ang moh as dominant language?</p>

              <p>You go to hell lah Lee Kuan Yew, fucking bastard.</p>
              <p>And how the hell is english a "neutral language"? It's the fucking language of the british wah.</p>
              <p>Neutral what fucking neutral?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a</p>
              <p>`non-Asian' language, English is `neutral' to every racialised Singaporean.  As it</p>
              <p>has to be learned as a `foreign' tongue by all, everyone supposedly competes, at school</p>
              <p>or work, on an equal footing, through their acquired skill in the English language.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">That English is a `neutral' language is, of course, an ideological illusion.</span></strong> Since</p>
              <p>Singapore was a British colony for 150 years, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">English was already a common language</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">among the privileged local population who worked for the colonial administration</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and whose children had access to the limited opportunities of learning the language.</span></strong></p>
              <p>This<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> included the first generation of political leaders who, as English speakers, had</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">access to British university education immediately after the second world war. </span></strong>The</p>
              <p>ideological promotion of English as a `neutral' language to all ethnic Asian children</p>
              <p>has suppressed this class dimension. The political utility of this illusory `neutrality' is</p>
              <p>that it enables the state to articulate, in English, its own interests distinctly, apart from</p>
              <p>the interests of all racial groups. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It also effects a separation of state/national interests</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">from those of the racial majority, and prevents state/national interests from being</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">captured by the racial majority. </span></strong>The position of monolingual Chinese speakers</p>

              <p>Malay was the original tongue in Singapore so my dream is that all Singaporeans communicate in Malay. That said, although I dislike angmos, our ability to converse in english give us an advantage in the internet. I observe people in China selling their things on ebay and their english is really bad. With our proper grammar, we can sell things more easily and read foreign newspapers which are unbiased.</p>
              <p>Also u will hate me for saying this, but God has planned it such a way that through english we might come to know Christ and his saving grace and be able to read the scriptures. Nothing happens without a reason. Everything is already predestinated.</p>
