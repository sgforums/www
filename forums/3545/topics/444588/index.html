              <p>Let SPGs have their own fun. You cannot control them. Many situations we cannot control. This is one of them.</p>
              <p>However, you can control your attitude toward them. Laugh at them, mock them, regard them with contempt and ridicule,</p>
              <p>One secret which I learnt from experience, which I'm not sure is a secret tip or not, is that if the SPG in your office walks past u with her nose in the air, the next time u see her, walk past her, with  your nose also in the air and NEVER SPEAK TO HER and ACT LIKE SHE'S INVISIBLE. Do u know what will happen in a few months time? She will be so puzzled by your ignorance of her (she considers herself something when she is nothing) that she will eventually say something to you.</p>
              <p>Your reply to her would be 'o really!', 'is that so!', 'fancy that!' and your look will be one of indifference, kind of like you hear what she is saying, but at the same time u couldn't care less.</p>
              <p>That's one way of 'befriending' SPGs. Other than that, other things are beyond your control.</p>

So i'm more able to understand d psychology of women, in particular stuck-up women like spgs whom i can easily ignore or dismiss. My feelings against whites are harder to explain bec i don't fully understand it.

              <p>I wasn't referring to yours, but if people have the right to express their ignorance then I have the right to shoot them down too. The failings and fawning behaviour of fellow Singaporeans is not a reason to spite all white people. Direct your anger properly.</p>
