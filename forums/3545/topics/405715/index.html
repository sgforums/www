              <h1 class="storyheadline">Futile to block radical sites</h1>
              <p>BLOCKING radical websites would be a futile exercise as the 
              architecture and reach of the Internet make it practically impossible to
               interdict all such sites, said Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng in 
              Parliament on Monday.</p>
              <p>Responding to questions from MPs on what the Government is 
              doing to counter the continuing threat of jihadist radicalisation, Mr 
              Wong, who is also the Home Affairs minister said there are several 
              thousand radical sites and the number is growing.</p>
              <p>'If we bring down one website, it can easily resurface under
               another name or in another jurisdiction. To be effective, we would not 
              only have to block terrorist websites, but also popular social 
              networking platforms like YouTube and Facebook, which would clearly not 
              be practicable,' he explained. 'The same Internet that empowers ordinary
               individuals unfortunately also serves radicals.'</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said education is critical to inoculate the society 
              against jihadist ideology. Terrorists are increasingly exploiting the 
              Internet as an effective means to propagate their radical ideology, 
              promote their cause and recruit potential operatives. To extend their 
              reach, their messages have been posted online in different languages, 
              including English.</p>
              <p>The Internal Security Department (ISD), for example, has for
               many years held briefings and talks to schools and community groups, to
               share its concerns about radicalisation. The Religious Rehabilitation 
              Group (RRG) also gives public talks, forums, media interviews and 
              written articles to alert the general Muslim public to the falsehoods of
               jihadist ideology. Several other Muslim leaders and organisations have 
              also initiated and organised community counter-ideology programmes.</p>
              <p>'The common goal of these efforts is to help Singaporeans 
              who chance across radical teachings in the guise of religion to see 
              through the falsehood and not be led astray. These community efforts are
               a positive development and we hope even more community organisations 
              and leaders will step forward to do likewise,' said Mr Wong.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong said Singaporeans themselves must play their part to
               help loved ones turn away from the path of radicalisation. 'They must 
              not turn a blind eye or be unwilling to heed warning signs. Fadil and 
              Muhammad Thahir bin Shaik Dawood had let people close to them know that 
              they were interested in militant jihad, and these people had noticed 
              that they were surfing radical websites,' he said, referring to the two 
              detainees under the Internal Security Act.</p>
              <p>'However, none of them sought help from the religious or 
              government authorities. Instead, they brushed aside Fadil and Thahir's 
              jihadist talk as not serious. Had they contacted the authorities at an 
              earlier stage, things might have turned out quite differently for Fadil 
              and Thahir, and the two of them might not have had to be detained or 
              placed on Restriction Orders.'</p>
              <p>Mr Wong emphasised that early intervention is the best way 
              to save a relative or friend from the road to radicalisation. 'It gives 
              him the best chance to be guided back to the correct path. This is the 
              socially and morally responsible thing to do; it should not be seen as 
              betrayal, because such action helps both the individual and our 
              society,' he added.</p>
              <p>'We should not be paranoid. But as a community, we need to 
              be discerning enough to distinguish mere 'viewpoints' from 'something 
              more sinister', and have the moral courage to seek help from MUIS and 
              the government authorities when required.</p>
              <p>'Not reporting suspicious warning signs could not only hurt 
              innocent lives, but also strain communal and familial relations if the 
              individual becomes thoroughly radicalised and does something disastrous.
               Reporting warning signs is thus a necessary first step towards 
              countering radicalisation in our midst, and I can assure you that no 
              further action will be taken if it turns out to be a false alarm.'</p>
