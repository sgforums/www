              <p>went to chiang mai in march this year. while on a one day trip fm chiang rai to neighbour country. ( forget what country, very poor type ) by small boat. b4 going bk to the boat, suddenly, i take out my wallet. to everyone, there r beggers. to me, they r poor kids. give out 20 baht each. mostly younger kids. abt 10 kids. not a lot of money. </p>
              <p>bk on the boat, ya whole boat full of singaporeans. someone say i generous. i told him my salarly not more than 2 k. i dare to say every single one of them is richer than me. but only i give. so i must be the only hypocrite ppl, n not the boat full of singaporeans. </p>
              <p>to my fellow singaporeans, 200 baht means money. </p>
              <p>to me, 200 baht is what i can do for these young poor kids at that point of time. if only i can get my hands on bill gate money.</p>

              <p>Be honest and let these uneducated women know exactly what you are. </p>
              <p>Dont pretend to be something you are not. If they choose to get married to a financial wreck, that's their choice. If they choose to marry a deadbeat ex husband, that's their choice... If they want a diehard Mama boy, they better be informed well ahead of time. </p>
              <p>Buying a bride doesn't allow the woman time to get to know the man, that's why men and women date...to get to know each other before the big leap. </p>
              <p>Marriage after some time of dating is already a gamble. Marrying blind is a BiGGER gamble... Now why would any man fresh out of divorce want to jump into it again?</p>

              <p>Dont pretend to be something you are not. If they choose to get married to a financial wreck, that's their choice. If they choose to marry a deadbeat ex husband, that's their choice... If they want a diehard Mama boy, they better be informed well ahead of time. </p>
              <p>Buying a bride doesn't allow the woman time to get to know the man, that's why men and women date...to get to know each other before the big leap. </p>
              <p>Marriage after some time of dating is already a gamble. Marrying blind is a BiGGER gamble... Now why would any man fresh out of divorce want to jump into it again?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I would say, no. There are many stories about foreign spouses cheated Singaporeans a considerable amount of money. Furthermore, is it extremely difficult to find a local wife in Singapore? If is it difficult, perhaps you might want to visit some dating sites to look for a local partner who you might find it suitable to date. TS, if you are not afraid of being cheated by foreign spouses, by all means, do so. </p></div>

              <p>Because SG men easier to hook.</p>
              <p>Men in these women homeland got so many women to choose from, women are a dime a dozen there... Third world country people tend to reproduce more....</p>
              <p>SG men like cheap cheap , as long as is cheap and easy to get, they will take. They don't really care about quality lah.. You get what you pay for lor. That's why BATA is so popular in SG. - Buy And Throw Away.</p>
              <p>BAta is low and cheap quality shoes in Singapore. When I went to switzerland it's a expensive high quality boutique brand. </p>
              <p>European men like high quality. SG men like cheap low quality. </p>

              <p>I think you shld do what ur heart tells u and ignore those negative comments. I have colleagues who are even younger than u married foreign ladies. So far i don't see any side effects and he's more happy than before :) as he has a son to take care of so finding him a 2nd mother will be essential. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for your case, i'm not sure..but if u're looking for a lifetime partner and lost hope in local women, please go ahead and look for foreign ladies. :) all the best! </p>
