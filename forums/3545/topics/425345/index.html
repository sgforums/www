              <p class="style25"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png"> As I had taken a whole week’s leave to go on a short 
              three day holiday with my family, I decided to make myself useful and be
               productive for the remaining days of my leave by helping the Seeds of 
              Hope, home visit team.</p>
              <p class="style25">As Tzu Chi foundation was
               preparing to launch the Seeds of Hope bursary programme for 2011, I was
               given a list of schools to call, most of which are not yet 
              participating in our programme or have yet to respond to our proposals.</p>
              <p class="style25">One of these calls I made
               was to the Vice Principal (Admin) of a secondary school in Bedok area, 
              Mdm Tan. My initial conversation with her received an apathetic 
              response. After making my brief introductory spiel about Tzu Chi and 
              explanation about the bursary programme structure, she reciprocated 
              with, “What’s the catch?” I proceeded by clarifying that our objectives 
              are sincere and that our motives are unconditional.</p>
              <p class="style25">Her reservation towards 
              us was understandable. I later learned that the previous person in 
              charge had probably misunderstood our intentions when Tzu Chi volunteers
               first made the presentation to the school last year and the 
              misinterpretation could have been attributed to time constraint leading 
              to an inconclusive presentation.</p>
              <p class="style25">It was this understanding
               that was passed down to Mdm Tan when she joined the school staff in 
              2009 that caused her to be wary of our intentions.</p>
              <p class="style25">Eventually I was able to 
              persuade her to grant us an appointment on the morning of 27 Sep 2010. 
              Mdm Tan was met by a team of Tzu Chi volunteers led by Sister Wu Yu Chin
               who made the presentation clarifying the misconceived issues of the 
              past presentation. With doubts cleared and objectives understood, one 
              more school became a participating member of the Seeds of Hope Bursary 
              programme for 2011.</p>
              <p class="style25">During the meeting, our 
              volunteers were pleasantly surprised to learn that Mdm Tan possessed 
              ideals that were similar to ours. She graciously shared with us her own 
              experience which was both touching and inspiring.</p>
              <p class="style25">A single mother, Mdm Tan 
              left her job as a Regional Finance Controller with an insurance broking 
              firm to spend much needed time with her teenage daughter and took on the
               post of Vice Principal (Admin) of this school two years later. Although
               it meant a pay cut she felt it was worth it as it allowed her more 
              quality time with her only child.</p>
              <p class="style25">Outside of school 
              parameters, Mdm Tan also firmly believes in contributing to society and 
              actively volunteers in her church activities. She is also an active 
              affiliate member of one of the largest women’s organization in the world
               known as Aglow International, an American based movement that provides 
              care, support and mentorship for women and men in a Christian 
              environment. With such personal cultivation, it is little wonder that 
              she is able to reach out when the need arises.</p>
              <p class="style25">As she continued to 
              convey her encounters, one of the incidents she shared was that of a 
              student whose elder brother was suffering from cancer. The care 
              recipient in this case however, was the younger brother who had been 
              neglected by his parents as all the attention had been directed to his 
              cancer-stricken brother. Apparently his school fees had been compromised
               due to the mounting medical fees of his brother’s treatment.</p>
              <p class="style25">This incident triggered 
              Mdm Tan’s compassionate nature and she reached out to this family. Due 
              to the extensive network she created while in her former profession, she
               was able to amass the necessary resources to help resolve this family’s
               predicament. (Note: Due to sensitivity and recognizable nature of this 
              case, the method by which this family was helped cannot be disclosed.)</p>
              <p class="style25">Another incident Mdm Tan 
              shared with the volunteers was a case of an international student from 
              China who had an abusive mother. The abuse was known to have taken place
               up to four times in that year, each time escalating into a police case.
               On the eve of the ‘O’ level examinations, the mother, for some reason, 
              in a fit of rage abused the student to the extent of tearing her 
              uniform. Subsequent consequences of the incident exposed the student to 
              the risk of being deported back to her home country.</p>
              <p class="style25">Mdm Tan felt for the 
              student and decided to go beyond the call of duty. She acquired 
              financial help from the Lion’s Club of Singapore who covered her arrears
               in school fees and managed to find a private sponsor who not only paid 
              for her ongoing tuition fees but also her living expenses as well. The 
              police however, after handling her case, referred her to the welfare 
              department of MCYS who secured for her a legal guardian so that she 
              could remain in Singapore and continue her studies. Mdm Tan’s compassion
               however, is not without condition; one important thing is expected of 
              her care recipient: ‘succeed (in everything you do)'.</p>
              <p class="style25">Mdm Tan’s endeavour is 
              paying off; this student is now continuing her studies at a local 
              Polytechnic and is heading toward a bright future.</p>
              <p class="style25">In our cosmopolitan 
              Singapore where many are preoccupied with careers and financial 
              security, it is refreshing to see that there are individuals like Mdm 
              Tan who are focused on reaching out and helping those who have fallen 
              through the cracks of society and require much needed help.</p>
              <p class="style25">With her available 
              resources and willingness to apply them to her many present 
              undertakings, Mdm Tan is not only a valuable asset to the school where 
              fundraising activities is concerned but also a force to be reckoned with
               when it comes to volunteerism and selfless compassion.</p>
