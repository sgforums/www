              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">SINGAPORE - Former Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said he is convinced bilingualism is possible in Singapore, with English as a master language, and it would be a bonus if Singaporeans could have a third language. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"It's best (for the Chinese) to have Malay as a third language. </span></strong>If you can understand it and speak it, you will be up to date with happenings from Malaysia and Indonesia. It is a plus point," said Mr Lee in Mandarin, at the launch of the Mandarin edition of his latest book, Lee Kuan Yew: Hard Truths to Keep Singapore Going, yesterday. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Noting that the use of English has propelled Singapore's position in the world, while Mandarin has enabled Singaporeans to take advantage of a rising China, Mr Lee felt that children should be exposed to two languages at an early stage to make bilingualism achievable. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">"My Chinese, I had no total immersion. So it was a constant struggle to overcome one difficulty after another, so that in the end I'm able to speak without much effort," he said. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">"I think if we arrange our education system, especially in kindergarten and pre-school in such a way that our children are exposed to two languages straightaway, we will make bilingualism a reality and easily achieved by all."</span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Mr Lee, who also turned 88 yesterday, was serenaded by guests at the launch with Happy Birthday in both English and Mandarin. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">The Mandarin edition of Mr Lee's book comes nine months after the first edition in English was released. Published by Singapore Press Holdings, it is based on 16 interviews with Mr Lee. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">It caused a controversy earlier this year, when some of Mr Lee's remarks in the book on Malay-Muslims in Singapore being "distinct and separate" drew protest from Malay-Muslim groups. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">Mr Lee later issued a statement saying that he "stands corrected", and noted that the interviews had been done two to three years ago.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;">The comments have not been removed from the Mandarin edition, but Mr Lee's full statement is appended in the book. </span></p>

              <p>In my opinion, currently the status of Malay as a "national language" but without instruction medium to all Singaporeans is a pretense act.  Please teach to all Singaporeans rather than hang an empty name or sing in National Anthem only.</p>
