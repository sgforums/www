              <p><span>SINGAPORE: The number of fallen trees dropped by up to 70 percent 
              last year compared to nine years ago.
              <br> <br> Last year, some 1,000 cases of tree failures were reported.
              <br> <br> The number is 2,100 less than that in year 2000.
              <br> <br> The number of tree failures in June this year however jumped by 170 
              percent to 240 cases, compared to the same month last year.
              <br> <br> In a written reply to a question asked in Parliament, National 
              Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said the increase was due largely to 
              the adverse weather.
              <br> <br> He said NParks is reviewing its tree management programme in response to
               increasingly unpredictable weather conditions.
              <br> <br> He added that it will also explore new technology to better assess the 
              condition of trees.
              <br> <br> NParks also carries out regular tree pruning to remove weak or overgrown
               branches.

              <p><span>SINGAPORE: A driver was killed when a tree fell and hit the car he
               was in during heavy rain Tuesday afternoon at the junction of Thomson 
              Hill Drive and Yio Chu Kang Rd.
              <br> <br> The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) said the victim was pronounced 
              dead when its personnel arrived at about 2.50pm.
              <br> <br> The SCDF said the car was badly damaged.
              <br> <br> Rescuers took about 20 minutes to remove his body, using two hydraulic 
              spreader cutters. - CNA/jm </span><span class="update"></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">NParks steps up tree pruning</h1>
              <p>THE National Parks Board (NParks) will continue its stepped-up effort 
              of pruning trees and focus on mature ones where road traffic is high.</p>
              <p>NParks CEO Ng Lang, in a statement on Wednesday, said it has
               already completed the inspection of 2,000 mature trees and reduced 
              their crowns.</p>
              <p>'This intensified maintenance regime will continue,' said Mr
               Ng, in response to the death of a 32-year-old man, who died after a 
              rain tree uprooted and smashed into the car he was driving on Tuesday 
              afternoon during a heavy downpour.</p>
              <p>The motorist, Mr Chua Loong Wai, was pinned to his seat and 
              died of injuries to his spine. The accident happened at the junction of 
              Thomson Hills Drive and Yio Chu Kang Road at around 2 pm on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Expressing his condolences to Mr Chua's family, Mr Ng said 
              the incident was caused by an intense weather condition known as 
              microburst - which are localised strong columns of very rapidly 
              descending air.</p>
              <p>'They are known to knock down big trees. The wind speed at 
              the location at the time of the incident was as high as 65 kmh, and it 
              was accompanied by heavy rain,' said Mr Ng.</p>
              <p>'NParks is fully aware that this unfortunate incident can 
              raise concerns about the safety of our trees. We want to assure the 
              public that we share these concerns, especially in view of the recent 
              spate of intense weather conditions.'</p>
              <p>He added that an NParks team has been deployed at the 
              location where the microburst occurred on Tuesday to inspect and ensure 
              the safety of the trees there.</p>

              <p>by Carolyn Quek</p>
              <p>IN an accident eerily similar to Tuesday's fallen tree tragedy, three 
              passengers made a lucky escape after a tree fell on their car in Ang Mo 
              Kio on Thursday during another heavy downpour.</p>
              <p>The incident happened at about 7.45am at a road junction 
              near Block 226, Ang Mo Kio Street 22.</p>
              <p>The passengers managed to get away with some scratches but 
              their car - a Blue Chevrolet - was badly damaged with its back 
              windscreen completely shattered.</p>
              <p>The passengers remained in their car until the Singapore 
              Civil Defence Force came to their aid.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Falling trees due to weather</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Hoe Pei Shan</p>
              <p>THE recent spate of falling trees are the result of severe weather 
              conditions - not because the trees had been poorly maintained.</p>
              <p>The National Parks Board said it had in fact stepped up its 
              15,000-tree a month inspection to include an additional 2,000 large, 
              mature trees in the past two months, when unstable weather first hit 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>Meeting the media on Thursday, NParks' director of 
              streetscapes Simon Longman said that there was no emerging pattern as to
               what sort of trees or areas were more prone to such accidents.</p>
              <p>'There was no trend in the species, the size, nor the 
              location of these recent cases, and it really boils down to the 
              individual circumstances like wind and rain,' said Mr Longman, who added
               that the recent severe weather conditions have made NParks' work 
              particularly challenging.</p>
              <p>'For the tree that fell in Yio Chu Kang, it had a 
              well-formed root system and yet was completely uprooted by the 
              microburst.' Thunderstorms and microbursts, which are powerful gusts of 
              air, contributed to 240 incidents of fallen trees or branches in June 
              alone.</p>
              <p>In light of more severe weather expected this weekend, the 
              intensified maintenance regime - which targets trees along roads with 
              high vehicular traffic - will continue. Mr Longman also assured that 
              NParks has been carrying out a 'very rigorous and systematic' tree care 
              programme, with regular tree safety inspections for signs of poor 
              health, disease, pests or strcutural defects performed since the 1980s.</p>

              <p>by Daryl Chin</p>
              <p>TWO Angsana trees that have stood outside Liat Towers in Orchard Road 
              for more than 30 years were chopped down on Monday after showing signs 
              of decay.</p>
              <p>The National Parks Board (NParks) decided to fell the 
              20m-tall trees following a routine inspection, to lessen the risk of an 
              accident in an area which sees heavy pedestrian and vehicular traffic.</p>
              <p>This normally involves a visual examination to spotsigns of 
              defectand may be followed by secondary checks using high-tech equipment.
               The extent of the decay was confirmed after a detailed inspection using
               a decay detection drill, said Mr Simon Longman, director of streetscape
               at NParks.</p>
              <p>Last month, there were 240 incidents in which branches or 
              entire trees fell, largely due to bad weather such as strong winds and 
              heavy rain.</p>
              <p>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan said recently that
               despite the rise in recent spate of 'tree failures', actual numbers are
               down from 3,100 in 2000 to 1,000 last year - a decrease of about 70 per
               cent over the last 10 years.</p>
              <p>Last Tuesday, a man was crushed to death in his car when a 
              rain tree was uprooted and fell onto his car.</p>
