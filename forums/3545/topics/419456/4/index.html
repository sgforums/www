              <h1>Alleged rape victim's alcohol level 3 times legal limit</h1>
              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">THE blood-alcohol level found in a young woman at the time of an alleged rape by Ong Mingwee was more than three times the legal limit for drink driving.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The 255mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood was above the toxic level but below the lethal level of 350mg, said a forensic pathologist.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Senior consultant forensic pathologist Wee Keng Poh testified on Friday at Ong Mingwee's rape trial that the level found on the then-22-year-old woman would physically or mentally incapacitate her.</p>
              <p>She would also not be capable of giving consent. Dr Wee said the alcohol she had taken would reduce her ability to protect herself, impair her judgment, her perception of others, as well as her ability to resist both physically and verbally.</p>
              <p>Ong, 28, is said to have raped the woman at a flat above his family-run minimart at Toa Payoh North in the early hours on Feb 12, 2009.</p>
              <p>After calling 14 prosecution witnesses, the prosecution closed its case. District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim called on his defence. Ong, who elected to give evidence, will take the stand when hearing continues on Feb 14. The maximum penalty for rape is 20 years' jail and fine or caning.</p>

              <p>FYI ...... most women who do get raped are not who you think, rape is a HATE crime NOT a SEX crime which is why most people dun get it, what a stoopit thing to say that a woman deserved to get raped? Most likely a modestly dressed woman is more likely to be raped than a sexily dressed one ......... why power . that's why . rapists see the sexy ones as wildcats who will fight back but the modest or in this case drunk ones , as weak </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about kids who get raped do THEY deserve it......... maybe some six year old girl runs around naked cos her mom didn't dress her then gets raped DOES SHE DESERVE IT???? what about that Russian girl( 7 years old ) who was legally adopted by an American man who then promptly made videos of their sexcapades ....... DID she deserve it????</p>
              <p>What about the dozens of incest victims in Malaysia, and I am sure some un-reported ones in Singapore, do they deserve it?????</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Man denies detaining and raping woman</h1>
              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A  MAN accused of raping a young woman he met at a club told a district
               court on Monday that he had sex with her with her consent.</p>
              <p>Ong Mingwee, 28, who helps run a family minimart business in
               Toa Payoh North, denied raping the 22-year-old woman in the flat in the
               early hours of Feb 12, 2009.</p>
              <p>He said he neither forced her to have sex with him nor did he tell her that she could not go home unless she had sex with him.</p>
              <p>Ong had met the woman for the first time at Zouk earlier 
              when he went clubbing with his elder brother. He was introduced to the 
              woman, who danced with him that night. When the club closed, he offered 
              to take her home. He claimed that while they were in the taxi, they 
              started kissing and she agreed to go his place.</p>
              <p>In the flat, he took her to his room while he went to ease 
              himself and have a smoke. When he returned, he heard her cry, saying she
               was scared and wanted to go home. Shocked, he tried to calm her down 
              and assured her that he would not harm or hurt her in any way.</p>
              <p>The court heard earlier that the woman called her mother and
               her girlfriend, who had been with her earlier at Zouk, telling them she
               was scared and wanted to go home. But she had no idea where she was. If
               convicted Ong faces a jail term of up to 20 years and a fine or to 
              caning.</p>
