              <p>Moral of story, if U drink, (i) don't drive, (ii) don't go home with strange men.<br> <br> Better still, dun drive to drink, dun drink in the company of strange men/ less then trust worthy people.<br> <br> Its perhaps best not to drink at all.<br> <br> Anyhow, dis should be an interesting case as it involves a female lawyer
                           defending her male client against the allegations of rape; judge also 
                          is female- how they discuss and decide upon culpability would be an 
                          interesting point to see.<br> <br> The poor victim should take this as a stiff and permanent lesson and 
                          hopefully abstain from alcohol and its associated troubles; though this 
                          doesn't abstain Mr Ong MW from blame (he should be more punctual in 
                          court too- stupid dumb dumb!!!).<br> <br> Whatever the case, I think that sweeper uncle is the ultimate hero in 
                          this case. He truly deserves special mention for going out of his way to
                           help the poor girl whom <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_620118.html">nobody else stopped to help</a>.<br> <br> Kudos sweeper uncle, you are a hero to us all.<br> <br> <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://singsupplies.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">.</p>

               flat</h1>
              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>A MAN accused of rape claimed that the woman was the one who tried to 
              seduce him while they were dancing at a popular nightspot.</p>
              <p>Ong Mingwee, 28, who runs a family provision shop, stated 
              that the 22-year-old woman had agreed to have sex with him, and no force
               was used.</p>
              <p>He is alleged to have raped the woman at a flat in Toa Payoh
               North in the early hours of Feb 12, 2009. In his statements, which were
               admitted in evidence on Wednesday, he said he did not understand why 
              the woman had lodged a report against him.</p>
              <p>Investigation officer Station Inspector Azman Mohd Hussin, 
              read out the statements he recorded from Ong in court. Ong stated that 
              when he met the woman and her friend for the first time at Zouk, she was
               quite high.</p>
              <p>He said they were together most of the time that evening. 
              While drinking, he said she pulled him to the dance floor and the sexy 
              way in which she danced, made it seem she was trying to seduce him.</p>
              <p>After the club closed, they left in a taxi for home. They 
              started kissing and when he asked if she wanted to go to his place, she 
              agreed, he said. But when they were at his flat, she started to cry, 
              saying she was scared and wanted to go home.</p>
