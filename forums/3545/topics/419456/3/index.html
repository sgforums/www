              <h1 class="storyheadline">Alleged rape victim's alcohol level 3 times legal limit</h1>
              <p>by Elena Chong</p>
              <p>THE blood-alcohol level found in a young woman at the time of an 
              alleged rape by Ong Mingwee was more than three times the legal limit 
              for drink driving.</p>
              <p>The 255mg ethanol per 100 ml of blood was above the toxic 
              level but below the lethal level of 350mg, said a forensic pathologist.</p>
              <p>Senior consultant forensic pathologist Wee Keng Poh 
              testified on Friday at Ong Mingwee's rape trial that the level found on 
              the then-22-year-old woman would physically or mentally incapacitate 
              her.</p>
              <p>She would also not be capable of giving consent. Dr Wee said
               the alcohol she had taken would reduce her ability to protect herself, 
              impair her judgment, her perception of others, as well as her ability to
               resist both physically and verbally.</p>
              <p>Ong, 28, is said to have raped the woman at a flat above his
               family-run minimart at Toa Payoh North in the early hours on Feb 12, 
              2009.</p>
              <p>After calling 14 prosecution witnesses, the prosecution 
              closed its case. District Judge Hamidah Ibrahim called on his defence. 
              Ong, who elected to give evidence, will take the stand when hearing 
              continues on Feb 14. The maximum penalty for rape is 20 years' jail and 
              fine or caning.</p>
