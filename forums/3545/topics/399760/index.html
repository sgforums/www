              <p><strong>No compromise to concept of IRs, with small portion for gambling</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 18 May 2010 1803 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : There will be no compromise to the government's 
              concept of an Integrated Resort (IR) - that allows only a small 
              proportion for gambling.
              <br> <br> Senior Minister of State for Trade and Industry, S Iswaran, made this 
              point while addressing a question in Parliament.
              <br> <br> For punters, it is clear that the main draw to Singapore's two 
              Integrated Resorts - Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) and Marina Bay Sands 
              (MBS) - are the casinos, which were launched during Phase One openings 
              of the resorts.
              <br> <br> Mr Iswaran said such phased openings are common for large scale 
              projects.
              <br> <br> "From an operational perspective, phased openings are necessary to allow
               the IRs to work through operational issues and to allow employees to 
              familiarise themselves with their new roles and gain confidence for the 
              ramp-up in activities," he said.
              <br> <br> "It allows developers to work out operational issues and iron out staff 
              training. We must recognise that these are multi-billion and 
              multi-decade projects," he added.
              <br> <br> But the casino licenses will be granted only when authorities establish 
              that at least 50 per cent of the Gross Floor Area (GFA) is completed and
               at least 50 per cent of the Development Investment (DI) has been 
              expended.
              <br> <br> Mr Iswaran said: "This was to ensure that the casino would be allowed to
               operate only when a significant amount of non-gaming facilities were 
              opened and the integrity of the Integrated Resort concept upheld."
              <br> <br> As committed, when the IRs are fully open, gaming areas will take up 
              less than 3 per cent of the Gross Floor Area for Marina Bay Sands and 
              less than 5 per cent for Resorts World Sentosa.
              <br> <br> Mr Iswaran pointed out that both IRs have, in fact, opened significant 
              non-gaming facilities.
              <br> <br> He said: "RWS soft opened with Universal Studios Singapore (USS), its 
              theatre, part of the Festive Walk, and four hotels. The next phase of 
              its development will include the addition of new attractions in USS, the
               premier of a locally created circus theatre show, a Marine Life and 
              Water Theme Park, and a Maritime Experiential Museum.  
              <br> <br> "MBS' preview opening included a significant amount of non-gaming areas 
              such as 963 hotel rooms, retail outlets, restaurants, bars and MICE 
              facilities. MBS expects to open its remaining facilities such as the 
              Skypark, Theatres and Museum by end-2010."
              <br> <br> He also addressed concerns from opposition MP Low Thia Khiang that many 
              Singaporeans were hitting the casinos. He felt there is a novelty factor
               at play, but pledged that agencies are monitoring the trends closely.
              <br> <br> Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang said: "There are reports that most visitors 
              to the casinos are actually Singaporeans, is that a concern of the 
              government?" 
              <br> <br> Mr Iswaran replied: "Obviously we want to ensure that Singaporeans who 
              choose to go to the casinos give due thought to that before they go in 
              and not do it on an impulse - which is why we have a whole slew of 
              measures that have been put in place. 
              <br> <br> "It would be fair to say that there is a novelty factor in place, and to
               say that whatever we see at play in terms of numbers, in terms of 
              performance in the first few weeks and months is an accurate predictor 
              of what will be happening 12 months, 24 months down the road, I think 
              may be stretching the argument a little bit."
              <br> <br> "I think what I can assure the member is that the agencies are 
              monitoring the situation closely and I think once we have a better sense
               of the patterns and trends, then I think we will better know how the 
              measures we have put in place are working."
              <br> <br> On hiccups faced by conference organisers at Marina Bay Sands recently, 
              Mr Iswaran said Singapore's reputation as a top city for MICE events is 
              not determined by the outcome of a single event.
              <br> <br> Singapore hosts 6,000 business events annually, accounting for a quarter
               of such meetings held in Asia.
              <br> <br> "You see the integrated resorts having teething problems regarding its 
              hotel rooms, its conference facilities, its roller coaster but funnily 
              enough not their casinos," said Nominated MP Calvin Cheng.
              <br> <br> The conference by the Inter Pacific Bar Association was besieged with 
              problems, ranging from a power failure to lack of air conditioning.
              <br> <br> Mr Iswaran replied: "It is not uncommon for projects of such a scale to 
              encounter operational glitches when they commence operations. 
              Nevertheless, it is regrettable that delegates at a recent conference 
              found their experience at MBS to be unsatisfactory.  
              <br> <br> "I understand that MBS has taken the feedback of its clients into 
              consideration and is already taking steps to address these issues. To 
              put it in perspective, Singapore plays host to 6,000 business events 
              annually, and accounted for more than 25 per cent of the meetings held 
              in Asia in 2008.  
              <br> <br> "Notable MICE events we have hosted in the past include the IMF-World 
              Bank meetings in 2006 and the APEC Summit in 2009, as well as business 
              events such as the World Dental Federation Congress of 2009."
              <br> <br> It may still be early days to say just how much the IRs will contribute 
              to Singapore's tourism dollar, but together, both IRs have contributed 
              more than S$12 million worth of investments. 
              <br> <br> They are creating about 20,000 jobs - of which about 80 per cent have 
              already been realised, with a significant proportion going to locals.
