              <p>I AM the widow of the patient mentioned in last Friday's report 
              ('Patient at NUH for brain scan falls to his death').</p>
              <p>I would like to set the record right concerning the 
              insensitive and irresponsible reference in the report that my husband 
              'had a history of mental illness'.</p>
              <p>I wish to categorically refute any claim that my husband had
               a history of mental illness. Throughout his life, he had never been 
              referred to, consulted or confined to any mental institution.</p>
              <p>At a time of deep grief, my family had to endure added 
              injury by having to explain to well-wishers that my husband never had a 
              period of mental illness before or after he was admitted to the National
               University Hospital (NUH) voluntarily for a medical examination 
              recently.</p>
              <p>Given the report's prominence, I am extremely disturbed by 
              the impact of this callous statement on the future image of my husband's
               family members, especially his children.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times owes my husband and his family at least a 
              prominent apology.</p>
              <p>On the day my husband died, my family and I were told by NUH
               that he walked out of the room midway during a brain scan and threw 
              himself out of the window.</p>
              <p>Despite our disbelief and protest, no explanation or details
               were offered.</p>
              <p>We were also discouraged from visiting the site where my 
              husband reportedly fell. Reluctantly, we left the hospital with many 
              doubts.</p>
              <p>Imagine the shock and agony when my family read details of 
              my husband's death in the newspaper two days later.</p>
              <p>It is humiliating that his immediate family learnt these 
              details not from his caregivers at NUH but from the newspaper, along 
              with complete strangers who read the news the same day.</p>
              <p>NUH could have been completely honest and forthcoming with 
              us from the onset. NUH owes my husband and his family an apology.</p>
              <p>Lastly, regardless of what was going through my husband's 
              mind before his death, the report in the papers exposed a glaring lapse 
              in procedures on patient security at NUH.</p>
              <p>The actual circumstances of how and why my husband died will
               come to light at the Coroner's hearing. He should not have died in 
              vain. The Ministry of Health should ensure that such an incident never 
              happens again.</p>

              <hr>
              <p><strong>Editor's note</strong></p>
              <p>OUR report, which said The Straits Times understands that Mr
               David Low had a history of mental illness, was based on two sources. 
              The reporter had tried to interview Mr Low's family, but they declined. 
              We note what Madam Chua Lay Tin and the hospital now say, and apologise 
              for the inaccuracy in the report which has added to the family's grief.</p>
