              <div class="byline">By

              <div class="byline"><br></div>
              <div class="byline">THE newborn baby boy was not only found with a trash bag twisted like a
               rope around his neck, but he had also been - for good measure - buried 
              in a rooftop garden of a Eunos Crescent block.
              <p>But the person or persons who did this did not count on the infant's will to live - and to cry.</p>
              <p>Retiree Tay Kim Sia, 60, looking for the source of a mewing 
              noise, unearthed the baby from his shallow grave in the garden atop 
              Block 31A, a multi-storey carpark block, on Monday.</p>
              <p>The child, his mouth stuffed with mud and dried leaves and 
              his umbilical cord still attached, has since been taken to the KK 
              Women's and Children's Hospital, where he is in a stable condition.</p>
              <p>The police are still trying to track down his next of kin.</p>
              <p>Mr Tay said he was smoking at the sixth-floor garden at around 2pm when he heard soft mews.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Mother of baby found buried alive arrested</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Tham Yuen-C</p>
              <p>THE mother of the newborn baby found buried in a rooftop garden in Eunos Crescent has been arrested.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old was nabbed near Eunos MRT station at around 
              9pm on Sunday. She is believed to be an Indonesian who overstayed here.</p>
              <p>Her newborn son was found buried in a flower bed at the 
              sixth-floor garden of a multi-storey carpark on Monday last week. A 
              plastic bag had been tied around his neck.</p>
              <p>Retiree Tay Kim Sia, 60, found the baby after he heard what 
              he thought was a cat mewing while he was having a smoke in the garden. 
              He looked among the plants and saw a tiny foot sticking out from the 
              soil. His friend told him it was probably a battery-operated toy but he 
              decided to investigate further. What he dug out that afternoon was a 
              baby boy, muddied but still alive.</p>
              <p>Police investigations are ongoing, but it is believed the 
              boy was delivered among the plants, in the same spot where he was 
              buried. Police that day recovered some bloodied clothing just metres 
              away from where the baby was found. There were also drops of blood at a 
              stairwell on the same floor.</p>
              <p>The baby's mother is believed to have worked here as a maid.
               But her work permit had already expired when she was arrested. She will
               be charged today with overstaying while the police continue to 
              investigate her role in her son's abandonment.</p>
