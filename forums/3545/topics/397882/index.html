              <h1 class="storyheadline">Yes, YOG shop is dull and unappealing</h1>
              <p>I AGREE with Ms Carrie-Ann Lee last Saturday about the Youth Olympic 
              Games (YOG) shop at Ngee Ann City - that 'the overall look and feel were
               not welcoming' ('YOG shop').</p>
              <p>After seeing the advertisement flashed on the screen of the 
              DBS ATM, I visited the YOG shop at Ngee Ann City. I was unable to find 
              the shop and needed assistance from the information counter. I was 
              shocked to see a makeshift booth with a limited selection of 
              merchandise. I wanted to buy some YOG caps but was told they were not on
               the YOG merchandise list.</p>
              <p>YOG is such a big event in Singapore. I hope the distributor
               will consider better promotion of merchandise and have more outlets 
              than just two (Ngee Ann City and Changi Airport).</p>
              <p>Let Singaporeans show their great spirit in supporting the 
              YOG by wearing T-shirts as we did during the National Day celebration.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Thanks, YOG store will be improved</h1>
              <p>I THANK Ms Carrie-Ann Lee for her enthusiasm and support of the Youth 
              Olympic Games (YOG), which will be held from Aug 14 to 26 ('YOG shop: 
              The overall look and feel were not welcoming.'; last Saturday). We 
              appreciate her suggestions on improvements to the Olympic store at Ngee 
              Ann City, and will work with our master licensee to address them 
              immediately.</p>
              <p>YOG merchandise is now available for sale at outlets which 
              include Singapore Post offices, all four transit terminals at Changi 
              Airport, as well as the online store on our Singapore 2010 website.</p>
              <p>Last week, a new outlet was opened on level three at Ang Mo 
              Kio Hub and more outlets will be opened at other locations all around 
              Singapore, such as Jurong Point, West Mall and Parkway Parade in coming 
              weeks. Next month, we will open the Olympic Superstore, the largest 
              Olympic store in Singapore, which will be in Orchard Road, outside Ngee 
              Ann City.</p>
              <p>An open-concept design has been introduced at the Ang Mo Kio
               outlet, and where possible, this new design will be adapted in the new 
              outlets opening in the weeks ahead. A new range of merchandise is being 
              rolled out progressively and the full range, which is 10 times more than
               the current merchandise range, will be out before the YOG.</p>
              <p>We share Ms Lee's sentiments that the Olympic stores should 
              go beyond merchandise sales. They should also be a channel for the 
              public to find out more about the YOG. We will continue to work towards 
              this.</p>
              <p>We welcome everyone to visit our stores or <a href="http://www.singapore2010.sg/">www.singapore2010.sg</a>.</p>
