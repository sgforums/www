              <p><strong>Final safety checks underway ahead of soft opening of Universal Studios</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hoe Yeen Nie | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 16 March 2010 1850 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Final safety checks are underway as Universal Studios 
              Singapore gets ready for its soft opening on Thursday.
              <br> <br> After months of waiting, the public will finally be able to go on the 
              rides.
              <br> <br> The Universal Studios theme park includes existing crowd pleasers like 
              its Water World show. Members of the public can also check out the 
              attraction based on the animation film Madagascar, the only one in the 
              world
              <br> <br> 18 of the 24 attractions planned for the park are either newly created 
              or adapted for the Singapore park.
              <br> <br> No theme park would be without a rollercoaster, and the Battlestar 
              Galactica trumps them all. It is Asia's first duelling rollercoaster, 
              and the world's tallest too. 
              <br> <br> At several points, riders on the two rollercoasters whizz by one another
               with just inches to spare. It is certainly not for the faint-hearted!
              <br> <br> When MediaCorp journalists visited the studio on Tuesday, some rides 
              were closed briefly due to technical and safety glitches. The park said 
              this could happen from time to time, lasting anywhere between a few 
              minutes and a few hours. But it expects the rides to be fully 
              operational come opening day.
              <br> <br> John Hallenbeck, director of Operations, Universal Studios Singapore, 
              said: "We've been testing attractions for months, and that's just part 
              of the process. And it's not just the testing phase, but every day every
               attraction gets looked at - not only from a technical or mechanical 
              standpoint, but also from an operational standpoint. 
              <br> <br> "As far as the processes that we have (are concerned), checklist, 
              everything gets put together to ensure that we're 100 per cent safe. 
              There are times when attractions will have technical difficulties - 
              that's just the nature of theme parks and Universal Studios Singapore 
              won't be an exception on that."
              <br> <br> Robin Goh, assistant director for Communications at Resorts World 
              Sentosa, said attractions may be closed to make "creative adjustments". 
              "For example, we have to make sure that the dinosaurs, for example, at 
              Jurassic Park Rapids Adventure pop out at a certain time. We expect the 
              park to be fully operational and fully running by Thursday." 
              <br> <br> Tour agents said packages to the theme park are selling fast. And 
              observers believe spinoffs to Singapore's tourism sector will be 
              considerable.
              <br> <br> Travel agent Eric Seetoh said: "Usually tourists to Singapore, they 
              would only stay two to three days. But nowadays, I notice that because 
              of the theme park, they're willing to stay in Singapore for more than 
              four days or even five days."
              <br> <br> About 4.5 million visitors are expected to the park each year.

              <p><strong>70% of merchandise at Universal Studios theme park exclusive to S'pore</strong><br> <span class="update">By Hoe Yeen Nie | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 17 March 2010 2002 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Southeast Asia's first Universal Studios theme park 
              opens to the public on Thursday. Many of the rides are making their 
              world debut.
              <br> <br> At Universal Studios Singapore, it's all about the movie experience. You
               can take a picture with your favourite star or take home your very own 
              Oscar.
              <br> <br> With over 6,000 products to choose from, visitors are spoilt for choice.
              <br> <br> Said one man in the street: "There are tee-shirts, mugs and just so much
               that I want to come back again!"
              <br> <br> 70 percent of the items for sale can only be found in the Singapore 
              theme park such as the Betty Boop pins with the Chinese Zodiac or a 
              clapperboard photo-frame.
              <br> <br> Resorts World Sentosa said only the Singapore theme park has the full 
              range of the clapperboard merchandise.
              <br> <br> There are 30 food outlets in the theme park alone, serving burgers and 
              fries along with briyanis and chicken rice.
              <br> <br> Noel Hawkes, vice-president, Resort Operations, Resorts World Sentosa, 
              said: "We've got our very own nasi lemak, beef rending and chicken rice.
               We also have beef burgers, milkshakes and our Mel's Diners and all 
              that. We're catering to just about anybody. 
              <br> <br> “Many of these restaurants are in fact Halal because we recognise the 
              importance of looking after our Muslim guests who dominate this region. 
              Let's face it, Indonesia and Malaysia are at our doorstep and we expect 
              those markets to become very important to the success of Universal 
              Studios in Singapore." 
              <br> <br> There are six Halal food outlets in the theme park.
              <br> <br> The theme park also expects tourists from the Middle East to take up a 
              growing slice of the tourism pie.  - CNA/vm </span></p>

              <p><strong>Same-day tickets for Universal Studios on sale from Monday</strong><br> <span class="update">By Wang Eng Eng | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 21 March 2010 0027 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Starting Monday, Universal Studios Singapore will 
              release tickets that can be bought on the day itself. 
              <br> <br> Tickets that were sold since the theme park opened on March 18 had to be
               purchased at least a day in advance. 
              <br> <br> But for 600 underprivileged children visited the park on Saturday, they 
              were invited to join in the fun for free.  
              <br> <br> The children from various charities such as Mendaki and the Children's 
              Cancer Foundation arrived early for their one-day visit to Universal 
              Studios Singapore.
              <br> <br> They started their visit by watching a performance at the theatre and 
              they also took part in quizzes.
              <br> <br> Ivan Wong from Make-A-Wish Foundation was of the children. 
              <br> <br> He said: "I took pictures with Kung Fu Panda. Later I am going to take 
              roller coasters."
              <br> <br> Despite the rain, the number one attraction at the park was Battlestar 
              Galactica. 
              <br> <br> Universal Studios Singapore has welcomed thousands of visitors since it 
              opened. And there are plans to admit more. 
              <br> <br> Robin Goh, assistant director, Communications, Resorts World Sentosa, 
              said: "Considering this is only the soft opening phase, and we are only 
              third day into our operations, we have limited the number of tickets 
              that are available, which accounts for the park not looking as crowded 
              as it is. 
              <br> <br> "However, it will be ramped up as we ease in the operations, the rides, 
              and the retail and F&amp;B as well. "
              <br> <br> Resorts World Sentosa is looking into the possibility of extending the 
              theme park's opening hours on weekends. 
              <br> <br> Its opening hours are from 9am to 6pm daily. - CNA/ms </span></p>
