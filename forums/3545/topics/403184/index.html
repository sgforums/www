              <h2>Marina Bay Sands SkyPark: A view to die for</h2>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">By Angela Lim – June 21st, 2010</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p>After months of anticipation, the “surfboard” sitting atop the Marina
               Bay Sands (MBS) is ready to be unveiled to the public this Thursday.</p>
              <p>Yahoo! Singapore got an early sneak peek at what is officially known 
              as the SkyPark, and all I’ve got to say is — prepare to be wowed.</p>
              <p>Standing at a dizzying 200m, the S$150 million SkyPark is a spacious 
              lifestyle venue the size of two football fields or 10 Olympic-sized 
              swimming pools. Designed like a tropical resort, the Skypark features 
              stone walkways lined with timber decks and palm trees surrounding the 
              infinity pool and jacuzzi tubs.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">The public observation deck offers a glorious view of both the city 
              skyline and the Marina Bay seafront.</div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left"><br></div>
              <div class="tm-l align-left">
              <p>Enhancing the stunning landscape is the 150m infinity pool – the 
              highest swimming pool in the country – that fittingly seems to stretch 
              endlessly into the horizon. Hotel guests get to splash in and enjoy a 
              luxurious dip more than 50 storeys above ground.</p>
              <p>The up-and-coming rooftop hangout also houses a variety of 
              restaurants and bars perfect for soaking in the breathtaking view. At 
              $20, $14 and $17 for adult, child and senior citizen admissions 
              respectively, the SkyPark costs less than the Singapore Flyer (S$29.50 
              for adult admission), which it overlooks.</p>
              <p>For those who have been watching the progress of the SkyPark’s construction, the ”surfboard” is actually curved like a 
              boomerang when one is viewing it from one end to another. Rimmed by 
              2m-high glass panels,visitors can get right up to the edge of the 
              observation deck  jutting out over the hotel towers for a spine-tingling
               view.</p>
              <p>As part of its opening celebration this Wednesday, MBS is hosting the
               first-ever World Championship Climb in which 21 professional climbers 
              will scale the facade of the three interlinked 55-storey hotel towers to
               the SkyPark on the 57th floor.</p>
              <p>Hot favourite Team Commonwealth climber, Tim Emmett, 36, tells Yahoo!
               Singapore that this competition is a “first ever” for him and that MBS 
              is the tallest building he’s scaled so far.</p>
              <p>“It is a beautiful piece of architecture with the infinity pools 
              and an incredible view. Can’t wait to take a splash after I’m done with 
              the climb!” he gushes.</p>
              <p>22-year-old student Marcus Chan tells Yahoo! Singapore, “The S$20 
              admission is slightly pricey but I’m curious to find out if the view 
              from up there is really that amazing.”</p>
              <p>MBS CEO Thomas Arasi sums up the top-of-the-world experience best by 
              saying, “It is like a stage set before the city and the waterfront…When 
              you are up at the Skypark, you will feel as if you are sitting on a 
              cloud overlooking everything around you.”</p>

              <p><strong>MM Lee tours Marina Bay Sands ahead of grand opening</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 22 June 2010 2148 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said it will take up to 
              seven years for Singapore's second Integrated Resort to reach capacity.
              <br> <br> He made the comments after touring Marina Bay Sands, one day ahead of 
              its grand opening.
              <br> <br> With Las Vegas Sands' Sheldon Adelson by his side, the Minister Mentor 
              spent about 1.5 hours at Marina Bay Sands.
              <br> <br> He said he wanted a tour of the area to form his own impression on what 
              he thinks are the chances of the project succeeding. 
              <br> <br> MM Lee said: "I am interested to see what are the backroom workings of 
              it and I make my own impressions on what I think the chances of it 
              succeeding are.”
              <br> <br> For that, Mr Lee was brought to the convention centre, one of Southeast 
              Asia's largest, the retail strip, casino and the finale - a breathtaking
               view from the Sky Park.
              <br> <br> All around, workers were busy putting last minute touches in preparation
               of the grand opening on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said: "It's a striking, splendid building. It adds to the 
              landscape in a dramatic fashion and what I've seen in the inside, it 
              justifies the outlook. I think now is to make sure it draws in customers
               as it's supposed to and when it does that it will transform the 
              nightlife of Singapore."
              <br> <br> Mr Lee said with a project this scale, the US$5.5 billion Marina Bay 
              Sands could take three to seven years to reach full capacity.
              <br> <br> That's when results from tourism and convention trade can be seen.  
              <br> <br> MM Lee said: "It's a very big project. When it's all filled up, it will 
              increase our tourist trade and people who come here for conventions 
              multi-fold. That's quite a job to do in a couple of years. The word has 
              got to spread. It can't spread with just one news conference or one 
              display. People have to come here, enjoy it, and word of mouth will 
              bring more in."
              <br> <br> However the Sands chairman was a lot more upbeat.
              <br> <br> Sheldon Adelson, Las Vegas Sands chairman, said: "I think the Minister 
              Mentor is a little too pessimistic. I think we'll be up and running at 
              full speed by 2011. A property like this has to ramp. 
              <br> <br> "I'm simply a garden variety plain vanilla entrepreneur doing big 
              buildings and I think the Minister Mentor is right and word has to go 
              around and people got to know about it. We'll ramp up and do extremely 
              well, the indications are very positive now."
              <br> <br> From Thursday 2pm, the observation deck at the Sky Park will be opened 
              to the public.
              <br> <br> Tickets sold to give the public access to this area on Day One have been
               snapped up, a good indication of the highly anticipated grand opening 
              of one of Singapore's iconic destinations.  - CNA/vm</span></p>
