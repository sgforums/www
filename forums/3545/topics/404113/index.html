              <h1 class="storyheadline">Banning lorries for transport is wrong</h1>
              <p>THE current obsession with banning lorries from transporting workers 
              following a recent fatal accident is unreasonable.</p>
              <p>The issue of transporting workers in such vehicles should be
               considered in a balanced way, and we need to take into account the 
              needs of all the concerned parties. For instance, if army personnel can 
              be transported by lorries, why not workers?</p>
              <p>Many jumped to hasty conclusions following the fatal 
              accident on June 22, in which three foreign workers died after the lorry
               they were in skidded and crashed off the Pan-Island Expressway.</p>
              <p>Many who are pressing for a ban on using such vehicles to 
              transport workers do not understand the practicalities of operating a 
              small business.</p>
              <p>The immediate consequence of restricting worker transport to
               buses or vans for small construction and service companies is a sharp 
              spike in costs, as these firms are forced to buy vans or small buses and
               hire additional drivers.</p>
              <p>Second, the vehicle population will swell by a few thousand 
              buses and vans.</p>
              <p>Assuming that there is a small job that requires five or six
               workers with some materials to be transported, the company will have to
               ferry the workers by van to the site and use another lorry to transport
               the tools and materials.</p>
              <p>The van and driver will remain idle for a long stretch until
               it is time to pick up the workers in the evening.</p>
              <p>Are Singaporeans willing to pay for such a sharp increase in
               costs?</p>
              <p>Can Singapore businesses remain competitive?</p>
              <p>And what does it say about productivity when transport 
              vehicles and drivers have nothing to do for such long stretches daily?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Introduce speed limiters for goods vehicles</h1>
              <p>I SHARE the sentiments of Mr Stewart Sanjay in his letter last Saturday
               ("Speeding by lorry drivers the deadliest danger").</p>
              <p>Mr Sanjay was spot-on when he mentioned that speeding is the
               main cause of most accidents involving heavy vehicles. To be fair, 
              however, only a handful of drivers are guilty of speeding.</p>
              <p>These days, foreign nationals, mainly from China and India, 
              are employed by companies to transport goods and passengers. These 
              drivers lack experience in handling heavy vehicles and worse, are 
              unfamiliar with our roads.</p>
              <p>They speed and take evasive action by jamming on the brake 
              suddenly, resulting in an increasing number of vehicles overturning.</p>
              <p>Perhaps the authorities should consider making it compulsory
               for goods vehicles and heavy vehicles to be fitted with speed limiters.
               Drivers should also attend defensive driving courses before being 
              allowed to drive heavy vehicles.</p>

              <p>There are speed limiters for heavy vehicles alrdy.</p>
              <p>But come to think of it, e written test ruling for foreigners to drive the light vans has to be revised.</p>
              <p>Seriously I've ever seen them driving in and out of 2 lanes on expressways and behind is a bus. Or switch lanes w/o signal.</p>
