              <h1 class="storyheadline">Isn't GRC system affirmative action?</h1>
              <p>I REFER to last Thursday's report, 'Foreign Ministry responds to UN 
              expert's comments'. On the sensitive issue of race, Singapore's Ministry
               of Foreign Affairs noted that United Nations Special Rapporteur Githu 
              Muigai appears to advocate some form of 'affirmative action' to help the
               Malays progress in the area of education.</p>
              <p>This approach, according to the ministry, 'has been tried by
               many countries without notable success'.</p>
              <p>Even the president of the Islamic Religious Council of 
              Singapore (Muis) told Mr Muigai that the Malays in Singapore do not need
               any affirmative action policy because 'the Malay community had a deep 
              sense of pride in its own ability to achieve steady progress under the 
              national system of meritocracy'.</p>
              <p>If affirmative action is frowned on by minorities 
              themselves, why does the Government insist on keeping the group 
              representation constituency (GRC) system in the political landscape? The
               GRC system, as propagated by the Government, ensures minority 
              representation. Thus it is an affirmative action policy.</p>
              <p>Does it make sense that the minorities in Singapore need 
              affirmative action only to protect their political rights and everything
               else can be based on meritocracy?</p>
              <p>The minorities have spoken. They have the ability to achieve
               progress under the national system of meritocracy. The Government 
              should recognise that and abolish the GRC system.</p>
              <p>We are no longer living in the past. The tumultuous period 
              of our early years can only serve as a lesson for all ethnic groups to 
              maintain racial harmony at all costs. The past should not impede the 
              desire of our multiracial populace to achieve the goal of becoming one 
              nation, one people.</p>
              <p>The GRC system, as an affirmative action policy, can take 
              our nation only one step forward in theory and three steps backward in 
              nation-building.</p>

              <div class="kicker">UN official's remarks</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Why we need to be wary of external experts</h1>
              <p>I APPRECIATE the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' clarification of Mr Githu
               Muigai's comments regarding Singapore's internal policies ('Foreign 
              Ministry responds to UN expert's comments'; last Thursday). What is 
              apparent is that the short time Mr Muigai spent in Singapore was not 
              sufficient for him to appreciate how well certain policies have worked 
              for the country.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans need to be wary of such findings by external 
              experts, as different yardsticks, cultural contexts and varied criteria 
              of living standards are used, not to mention the personal biases of the 
              researcher himself.</p>
              <p>Various international surveys have ranked Singapore poorly 
              on human rights and freedom of speech. Yet, in the same breath, 
              Singapore is ranked highly on its transparent and uncorrupt government, 
              and as one of the safest countries in Asia. This may be due to a 
              variance in the sample groups.</p>
              <p>In every country, there may be an underprivileged or 
              disadvantaged group, whether by heritage or race. What a government must
               do is to not only help the marginalised group, but also increase its 
              investment in the group's human capital so the group can help itself.</p>
              <p>Our society cannot improve if it is constantly spoon-fed and
               protected. We must also be wary of turning assistance into welfare as 
              welfare policies do not work in the long term for any state.</p>
              <p>Singapore does not have to prove itself to anyone. Its 
              credibility in giving citizens a safe country and stable government has 
              been proven.</p>
              <p>There is always room for improvement in every country and 
              its policies. Singapore-bashers (including Singaporeans) should make 
              constructive comments and not just throw brickbats.</p>
