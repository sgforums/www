              <p><br>May you can elaborate more and quote reliable sources on the claims in bold.</p>
              <p>what were his ambitions and what grudges between the leaders?</p>
              <p>In my opinion it was some differences that lead to LKY make alternate solutions.</p>
              <p>As for present, many singaporeas are unhappy with the white paper and is his son;s creation not his creation.</p>
              <p>10,20,30 years down the road anything can happen. what malaysia and singapore wil do is do our best to corporate and work together on grounds that benefit both parties.</p>
              <p>as for singapore we will always be working on self substaining our own water and manage our economy.</p>
              <p>within singapore now is the problem with popualtion.</p>
              <p>what we need is to rebuild our own native singaporeans (malays, minority, indians and chinese, and maintain  minor healthy number of new citiznes and PR) and maintain foreign populatio (labors and talents) at healthy level.</p>
              <p>we also need to really work on the white paper as it is not logical to have such a high population of foreigners that cannot be used alone as factor to contribute to the labor and service we now look to on productivity andcreativity, instead of cost alone without quality.</p>

              Bilateral ties with Malaysia strained again as a result of Lee Kuan Yewâ€™s remarks
              
              Singaporeâ€™s ties with Malaysia has come under unnecessary strain again as a result of another of Lee Kuan Yewâ€™s uncalled for remarks on Malaysia.
              
              During a recent interview with the New York Times, the octagenarian Lee criticized Malaysia for its â€œracistâ€� politics and claimed that the PAP would have improved inter-racial relations had Singapore remained a part of Malaysia.
              
              â€œI think if the Tunku (Malaysiaâ€™s first prime minister) had kept us together, what we did in Singapore â€“ had Malaysia accepted a multiracial base for their society â€“ much of what weâ€™ve achieved in Singapore would have been achieved in Malaysia. But not as much, because itâ€™s a much broader base. We would have improved inter-racial relations and an improved holistic situation,â€� he said.
              
              [Source: New York Times, 9 Sep 2010]
              
              He also described Malaysia to be in a most â€œunhappyâ€� situation and that inter-racial relations there have plummeted to a new low.
              
              His statement polarized public opinion in Malaysia with the Malay newspapers such as Utusan Melayu lampooning him for harboring a secret agenda to divide Malaysia and the Chinese papers calling on the government to reflect what Lee had said.
              
              Utusan Melayu made use of Leeâ€™s words to issue a veiled threat that the Malaysia and Singapore may re-merge if the opposition Democratic Action Party (DAP) and its allies form the government:
              
              â€œReading Mr Leeâ€™s interview with The New York Times, we are not sure what his motives are by talking about his sadness over the separation of Malaysia and Singapore. Everyone knows he is a great strategist. The question is, does he harbour ambitions of seeing Malaysia and Singapore reunited? This is not impossible. If the DAP and its allies gain control of Malaysia, the two countries could re-merge.â€�
              
              [Source: Utusan Melayu, 15 Sep 2010]
              
              DAP is an offshoot of the PAP during its disastrous foray into Malaysia politics in the 1964 general election where it won only one single parliamentary seat in Bangsar, held by the late Devan Nair.
              
              After Singapore was ejected from Malaysia, the Malaysian branch of the PAP regrouped to form the DAP, led by lawyer Lim Kit Siang. DAP currently held 29 seats in the Malaysian parliament and governed the state of Penang together with its opposition allies.
              
              Leeâ€™s statements was not welcomed by the Malaysian leaders as well with many speaking out against him including President of the Malaysian Chinese Association Dr Chua Soi Lek.
              
              Being a minister in the cabinet, Lee should be more careful with what he said as his views may be misconstrued to represent that of the Singapore government.
              
              Malaysia and Singapore are now two separate sovereign states and we have absolutely no business in commenting on the internal affairs of our neighbors.
              
              Lee has the penchant, or rather unhealthy fetish for courting controversies with his most untimely and unwelcomed comments on Malaysian politics which remains a thorn in bilateral ties between the two countries.
