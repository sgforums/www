              <h1 class="storyheadline">Tweak system to avoid loan shark woes</h1>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">THERE seems to be a serious procedural gap in the current processes 
              for Housing Board resale transactions.</h1>
              <p>The legal completion (second appointment) denotes the buyers
               as the rightful owners of the flat, and they have to update their 
              addresses on their ICs to open utilities and other related accounts. 
              Although the seller is required by law to update his address within 28 
              days, the system does not ensure that this is followed through.</p>
              <p>This leads to problems such as loan sharks harassing the new
               owners for debts owed by the previous owners. Also, some sellers cash 
              in their flats during property booms without thinking through how they 
              are going to secure alternative housing, and end up in dire straits.</p>
              <p>The usual time span between the first and second 
              appointments for a resale transaction is six to eight weeks. There is 
              enough time for sellers and anyone else living in the house to update 
              their particulars at any neighbourhood police post. Even if they have 
              not found a permanent abode, they could update their particulars using 
              their temporary addresses, supported by documents attesting to that.</p>
              <p>On the completion of sale, the sellers should be asked to 
              provide documentary proof of having changed their address (as well as 
              that of all others living in the house) in order to receive the proceeds
               from the sale.</p>
              <p>While this will not eliminate all problems, it is fairer to 
              the buyers. They can at least rest assured that the previous owners will
               not be using their address and implicating them in any illegal acts.</p>
              <p>Should any loan shark harassment occur even after that, it 
              is not difficult to track down the original borrower as the new address 
              of the previous owner will already be on record.</p>
              <p>It will also hopefully ensure that sellers think through 
              their future options before committing to the sale of their flat.</p>
              <p>This suggestion is fair to both buyers and sellers and can 
              be implemented almost immediately.</p>
              <p>Purchasing a flat should be a joyous occasion and should not
               be marred by loopholes when they can be fixed easily.</p>
