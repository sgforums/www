              <p>HAs the Govt done anything to give a better life to normal, simple Singaporean? It's not about issues such as lift upgrades and building a nice garden nearby. It did help to beautify the environment, but does it benefit ALL people directly? Definitely to some like the older people, etc. But there are other issues that the Govt has not been focusing on. Like the working class or younger generation, people who do not earn huge amt of $ but still decent enough.</p>
              <p>What the focus is, is on the current property price which has escalated soo crazily that it post alot of problem to alot of younger generation especially couples. Prices for a normal 4 Rm flat at decent locations such as Clementi, Commonwealth, Bishan, ,etc can cost up to more than half a million $!! People who wish to get marry and yet only started working for a couple years with combine income of $9k can't afford this kind of house at all! (It's not because of being picky about location, but sometimes work or family limit the choices) Especially for couples who do not have support from family, relatives or friends. Because to buy a simple house say at punggol or choa chu kang is around 300k to 400k... and you have to fork out cash of down payment maybe min $30k + depleting all your CPF $. Then you'll have to have more cash to renovate, buy all the furnitures and pay for utility. Subsequent years, you have to have even more cash because you want to have babies. Of cos there is this beautiful thing call 'Installment', which can turn out to be ugly if u're unlucky to have other commitments like medical, or some unpredictable situation. Not everyone will have this kind of cash on hand to start with. This kind of tight and rigid budget really turns off lotsa couples. And people will decide to work and save enough till everything is in an affordable-comfort level, which by then, everyone will have grown old and decides to have only one baby or none. Or maybe people will just migrate out to other countries. This is definitely contradicting with what the Govt's campaign of promoting marriage and birth rates. Is the Govt trying to attract the rich whether Singaprean or foriegner, and segregate them with the not so rich? They should do more on property prices than just auctioning more land for developers. Cos the developers can purchase the land, yet hold back the constructions and ultimately squeeze the housing supply (by building slower) and continue to push up the price of houses! And the taxation on 2nd home or rentals is only like a small itch, because people who are able to have house for rent or 2nd home are people who are damn rich! or speculating only. This people whether Singaporean or foreigners, can just step into the showroom and buy 1 or 2 house on the spot like buying cars. This is a big problem that somehow the Govt did not spot!</p>
              <p>Is this why the Govt extend the retirement age of working classes?? On fear that people will default on their housing loan payment???</p>
              <p>The Govt should do more to solve this financial cum social issue. If they can pull down the price like 10%-20% within a couple month's time, maintain it, maintain the normal income then it's bravo and claps for them... if not, it's just *sighs and maybe disappointment...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The income ceiling of $8k i believe is for buying first hand house.. for resale flats, income above $8k still can buy, you just go to the bank and borrow, payment by installment. The bank will suck your blood every year with their high interest rate after the 1st 2 years... Hopefully when u're preparing to retire, you still have something left to survive on, if not, U follow what the Govt says - extend your retirement plan.</p></div>

              <p>singaporeans generally  can earn enough to live a normal life. UNLESS YOU HAVE KIDS .</p>
              <p>one kid now costs $1m to rear until university. and the costs will only go up in the near future</p>
              <p>even as singapore pulls out of recession i think the birth rates will continue to be dismal.</p>
              <p>too much workplace instability still lingering from the recession. chinese are a thrifty race. and this newer generation are not so into the confucious  family stuff anymore</p>
              <p>thats the price the government paid for its success.  in the 80s and 90s they were punishing parents who had more than 2 children.   </p>
              <p>no wonder singaporeans not having kids now. except a certain race ahem... haha</p>
