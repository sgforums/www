              <p>When property price increases, there will always be two groups of people - Buyer and Sellers.</p>
              <p>The Sellers are happy that they made a Handsome profit, while the Buyer will be unhappy that they need to pay more for a unit. Competition is very real in Singapore, there are people who are richer than you, in fact better than you. The "Welcome" policy of our government surely did not help the property prices as more Foreign/PRs compete in the Market.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, its the chicken and egg senario. No house, New couples will delay marriage thus risk having no children, on the other hand, Government wanted concrete population solution rather than "Forces of Nature" They decides to allow more New Citizens. New Citizens takes up properties as they call this place their HOME.</p>

              <p>Told by a property agent just last night:</p>
              <p>When foreigners come in as PRs, they buy the resale flat. Then when they get citizenship 1-5 years later, they apply for the new flat which is much cheaper coupled with subsidies. And they sell the old flat, making a handsome profit because of property prices rising like hell over the past few years. These are the ones who can pay a hefty COV and create an upward pressure on property prices.</p>
              <p>Loophole? It definitely is.</p>

              <p>Told by a property agent just last night:</p>
              <p>When foreigners come in as PRs, they buy the resale flat. Then
              when they get citizenship 1-5 years later, they apply for the new
              flat which is much cheaper coupled with subsidies. And they sell
              the old flat, making a handsome profit because of property prices
              rising like hell over the past few years. These are the ones who
              can pay a hefty COV and create an upward pressure on property
              prices.</p>
              <p>Loophole? It definitely is.</p>

              <p>The agent snook you la. They will be considered as 2nd timer applicants, assuming they took up the CPF housing grant, which mean an income ceiling of $8k.</p>
              <p>The probability of getting a new flat from HDB recently as a 2nd timer is low too.</p>

              <p>apart from what eagle has said, if they can afford the initial COV and the payment monthly, good.. because for new PRs, the probably won't have any CPF</p>
              <p>and if they can do that, and they go for the "BTO" place, they are put to the end of the queue..</p>

              <p>When property price increases, there will always
                  be two groups of people - Buyer and Sellers.</p>
              <p>The Sellers are happy that they made a Handsome profit, while
                  the Buyer will be unhappy that they need to pay more for a unit.
                  Competition is very real in Singapore, there are people who are
                  richer than you, in fact better than you. The "Welcome" policy of
                  our government surely did not help the property prices as more
                  Foreign/PRs compete in the Market.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, its the chicken and egg senario. No
                  house, New couples will delay marriage thus risk having no
                  children, on the other hand, Government wanted concrete population
                  solution rather than "Forces of Nature" They decides to allow more
                  New Citizens. New Citizens takes up properties as they call this

              <p>You are generalising. It's not necessary that the Buyer will be unhappy.</p>
              <p>The Buyer can also be happy because they think they bought cheap. Paying more doesn't mean it's not cheap in their eyes. They will just think the Seller is dumb to sell at a small profit.</p>
