              <p>well if your loan interest rate are low enough your property price will continue to go up. But as inflation creep up those low interest rate are going to evaporate thus property price may stall.</p>

              <p>if currency depreciates, it means it is more worthless, which in turn means your money is worth less and can buy less things.</p>
              <p>That means inflation, and property prices will go higher.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Next, loan interest rate is one factor only. One of the major push factor is pple are cash rich. Why? Just look at the number of en blocs. One Farrer Court alone gives an en bloc amount of $2.1 billion, and turn &gt;750 household into millionaire households. Multiply that by the number of en blocs, and you will know how cash rich Singaporeans are. This excludes foreigners coming in to buy &gt;1 properties at one go. They do not need any loan to buy at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Property prices will only fall when pple urgently need $$, and need to sell off at fire-sale prices to get quick cash. Unless a credit crunch comes over to sg, else property prices will very usually be sticky downwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, I do not have sufficient funds to buy a full property yet (especially when I want to go for a HDB first). I stand by my view and continue accumulate undervalued REITs because of my reasons. It has been rewarding so far.</p>

One Farrer Court alone gives an en bloc amount of $2.1 billion, and turn &gt;750 household into millionaire households. Multiply that by the number of en blocs, and you will know how cash rich Singaporeans are. This excludes foreigners coming in to buy &gt;1 properties at one go.

              <p>Some of the points raised in this thread about the relevance and role of currency and the property market are nothing short of hilarious and farcical.</p>
              <p>Firstly, as any rational mind would understand, the FX market works in pairs - if USDSGD decreases, then obviously SGD-denominated assets would surge in value (this is strictly considering a simple context where the world has only asset denominated in USD and SGD) <em><strong>relative</strong></em> to the USD. The key point here is relativity. How the SGD performs against the CNY or EUR (or any other currency for that matter) could be different relative to various other currencies, which directly influences the purchasing powers of holders of such currencies. Unless you actually have a reliably accurate demographic breakdown of the property buyers (and work on the exclusive premise that such buyers have their assets exposed to just one solitary currency - ie. assume they don't hold significant interests in other currencies which provide a further variable to their overall portfolio's worth - which is unlikely to be the case to begin with) by nationality, how the impact of currencies will have as massive an impact as some morons are making it out to be is beyond me. To illustrate this rationale, if the USD/SGD were to increase by 3%, it does not necessarily guarantee every single currency out there too would rise 3% relative to the USD and maintain its exchange rate parity with the SGD before and after the increase - if that were the case, there wouldn't be a market for FX trades (easily the most highly traded asset class with USD3.2 trillion in turnover daily according to the BIS) and FX traders would be out of jobs!</p>
              <p>Secondly, interest rates may do little to weed out inflation in economies where interest rates are not a key facet of monetary policy. Singapore, unlike the US and some major economies out there, does not utilize the interest rate to control monetary policy and by extension, the SGD exchange rate. The SGD is controlled by what's effectively known in the industry as a "dirty peg" - in such an instance, since interest rates are determined by market forces driven by supply and demand, I fail to see how an increase in interest rates would necessarily provide the effect required in stemming property prices. To suggest a burgeoning economy would lead to an increase in demand for properties which will then require the inflation be halted by raising the interest rates is economically senseless in this context - that's effectively doing nothing more than drawing a line of best fit derived from a set of data and arguing that is a sensible way of extrapolating an extension of a set of data whose scope is not necessarily confined to your existing scope of research. By any sensible understanding of the principles of regression, it's necessarily true that the correlation between the line drawn and data obtained must be extremely strong!</p>
              <p>Relying on prevailing market trends to halt existing trends is hardly a sensible form of policy-making, is it?</p>

              <p>Thanks for the detail anaylsis on the currencies and trends, etc...</p>
              <p>The point is, what do you see the Govt doing in helping people who merely just want to have a roof, and live a average life? I believe not everyone are into all these currency, foreigners, inflations, YOG stuff... it's not dat they are not interested, but dun expect everyone to be a genius, professor or analyst when making a simple decision to spend $ on house or anything..</p>

              <strong>Moratorium on the renting out of a whole HDB flat</strong><br> Until HDB flat prices come down to a 'decent level' there ought to be a moratorium on the renting out of a whole HDB flat.<br> <br> This is because Public Housing ought to remain public, meaning for the good of Singaporeans and whomsoever is granted PR status.<br> <br> Rich Singaporeans who are staying in pte housing and renting out their 
              HDB flat are hogging public apartments at the expense of poorer 
              Singaporeans who can ill afford public housing, since many such 
              apartments are not appropriately used as citizens housing but as rental 
              houses for profit (foreigners being the principle tenants I believe).<br> <br> The renting out by SG owners of whole HDB flats would have been 
              acceptable during a period of HDB flat glut, but where such public 
              housing is in short supply (to the extent of impacting upon public 
              housing affordability and thus national birth rates), then the time has 
              come, I think, for a policy change that bars such practice.<br> <br> (A family may however be allowed to own both pte and HDB properties- but
               in this case, the family MUST stay in the HDB property- the pte 
              property would then NOT be considered the main abode and as such the 
              owner NOT be entitled the owner occupied property tax discounted rate of
               4% rather then the normal p.tax rate of 10%)- failing which, a forced 
              sale of the HDB flat should be enforced.<br> <br> No owner of a public housing flat should be so distanced from the 
              'Public Housing' lifestyle that he should choose to live in luxury 
              whilst directly profiting from a 'subsidized' public housing scheme.<br> <br> One cannot have one's cake and eat it. A family enjoying pte living 
              benefits from BOTH i) property tax discounts for owner occ. property 
              (pte property) ii) rental profit from the renting out their HDB flat 
              (property tax even at full rate is nominal because of govt policy/ 
              discounts etc).<br> <br> Additional legislature should HDB flat supply still NOT meet population 
               demands would be to restrict the size of HDB flat owned to 'the number 
              of registered inhabitants + 3 rooms'. i.e a single registered 'occupant'
               may only own an up to 4 room apt etc. (some time exceptions/ 
              concessions may be given to families with deceased members to comply)- 
              this would ensure that all HDB flats are optimally used. Only Citizens 
              and PRs can be reg as 'occupant(s)', foreigners have to be reg as 
              'tenants' and their numbers do NOT count towards ownership right to a 
              HDB flat for a larger size.<br> <br> Post script:<br> - The BAR on renting out of full HDB flats would ensure that ALL 
              foreigners to SG are able to either (i) stay with a Singaporean in a HDB
               flat (contribute financially to Singaporean family and 'integrate' as 
              well), or, (ii) are of a talent and income sufficient to deserve private
               housing.<br> <br> Reference:<br> - [TR22Jun2010]: 'YPAP leader and new citizen Sinha Shekhar complains about low rent of his resale' [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/06/22/ypap-leader-and-new-citizen-sinha-shekhar-complains-about-low-rent-of-his-resale-flat/">link</a>]</div>
