              <h1 class="storyheadline">Let's not use founders' names for indirect gain</h1>
              <p>NTUC Income took out a full-page advertisement last Saturday entitled 
              "Genesis". It showed a picture of the late Dr Goh Keng Swee together 
              with one of his speeches.</p>
              <p>Whether or not it is a tribute to Dr Goh in conjunction with
               Income's 40th anniversary, the use of such a name to support and 
              endorse an event should be discouraged.</p>
              <p>Let us respect Singapore's giants and refrain from using 
              their name for indirect commercial gain. Other commercial companies may 
              take the cue from Income and start using the names of other founders of 
              Singapore who were involved with their companies in one way or another.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Ad gave insight into Dr Goh's contribution</h1>
              <p>I DISAGREE with the points raised in yesterday's Forum Online letter by
               Mr Francis Chen, 'Let's not use founders' names for indirect gain'.</p>
              <p>Many are not aware of Dr Goh Keng Swee's pivotal role in 
              establishing NTUC Income three decades ago. I myself discovered this 
              only last Saturday after reading the full-page advertisement entitled 
              'Genesis'.</p>
              <p>In fact, I do not treat the full-page write-up as a form of 
              advertisement; I consider it additional reporting on Dr Goh's 
              contribution to society. Besides, this announcement did not appear at a 
              more appropriate time, especially when Income is celebrating its 40th 
              birthday.</p>
              <p>Income has come a long way since Dr Goh made his speech on 
              Nov 18, 1969. Many of us, both policyholders and agents, have benefited 
              from this insurance cooperative.</p>
              <p>The write-up gave me an insight into yet another great 
              contribution by Dr Goh in caring for the well-being of the people.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Only right to honour man behind Income's creation</h1>
              <p>I THANK Mr Francis Cheng ("Let's not use founders' names for indirect 
              gain"; Wednesday) and Mr Jeffrey Law ("Ad gave insight into Dr Goh's 
              contribution"; Thursday) for their letters which carried divergent views
               on NTUC Income's tribute to the late Dr Goh Keng Swee on our 40th 
              anniversary.</p>
              <p>Dr Goh played a decisive role in setting up NTUC Income. In 
              his desire to help the workers of Singapore, Dr Goh had inspired the 
              labour movement to start a cooperative movement, and specifically 
              advised that its first cooperative be in life insurance. He also 
              nurtured NTUC Income in its infancy as our chairman for the first 10 
              years.</p>
              <p>As rightly pointed out by Mr Law, this is not something 
              which is widely known in Singapore today.</p>
              <p>Our two million policyholders today are beneficiaries of 
              NTUC Income's social mission made possible only because of Dr Goh's 
              foresight.</p>
              <p>For the reasons above, when NTUC Income turned 40 on May 29,
               we felt that it was only right that on that day, we should honour the 
              man who was instrumental in our creation by celebrating his 
              extraordinary life and reflecting on his immense contributions to the 
              people of Singapore.</p>
              <p>As Mr Cheng pointed out, as one of Singapore's most 
              illustrious founding fathers, Dr Goh deserves the same respect and 
              decorum reserved for our national leaders in their posthumous years. 
              That was precisely our intention in publishing the tribute - to honour 
              Dr Goh with respect and decorum. It is unfortunate that our intention 
              has been misconstrued by some members of the public.</p>
