              <p>WITH reference to Dr Thomas Lee's letter ("Self-testimonials: False 
                  modesty is a liability"; Nov 27), I believe we under-promote ourselves 
                  too much.</p>
              <p>I keep seeing jobs going to foreigners in my office simply 
                  because they stand out in their ability to market themselves, even in 
                  corporate reviews. Westerners are also very good at viewing negative 
                  traits as challenges, not liabilities.</p>
              <p>One concern about students writing their own testimonials 
                  has to do with how their teachers would vet them. If the teachers are 
                  predisposed by cultural conditioning to be critical, they may vet "down"
                   a student's write-up.</p>
              <p>Teachers play a critical role here. We should promote a more
                   nurturing mindset among teachers in schools. They have to learn how to 
                  bring out the best in our students beyond academic achievements.</p>
              <p>They have to see students' non-academic abilities as 
                  "pluses" and not "minuses", even if these abilities do not contribute 
                  directly to grades.</p>
              <p>As a people, we are too conditioned to tell ourselves we are
                   just not good enough. Our parents and their parents were also not 
                  trained to encourage their children. Instead, they preferred to 
                  discipline through pointing out mistakes. We are culturally conditioned 
                  to think negatively of ourselves.</p>

              <p>But until we have a credible opposition, I'd rather keep the PAP. Or else, what would you want? So easy to say "vote PAP out". And then what? Honestly speaking, is there anyone else currently who you'd trust to run our country? Again, I repeat. Wait until the opposition becomes more credible (and they're taking small steps in that direction now), then can consider.</p>

              <p>lol ... u vote PAP out and this will solve all the problems?
                  time to step out of the well, little frog ... and see the
                  competitive world in which we live in ... the world that the PAP
                  has given to us on a silver platter by making us more competitive
                  in a global environment ...</p>
              <p>I'm not saying PAP is perfect. I don't agree with quite a few of
                  their policies.</p>
              <p>But until we have a credible opposition, I'd rather keep the
                  PAP. Or else, what would you want? So easy to say "vote PAP out".
                  And then what? Honestly speaking, is there anyone else currently
                  who you'd trust to run our country? Again, I repeat. Wait until the
                  opposition becomes more credible (and they're taking small steps in
                  that direction now), then can consider.</p>

              <p>I hope that you can spend some time to know more about opposition parties and their plans for the future of Sinkapore, before you cast your votes, their difficulties are numerous, including a cap on their funding by gov, the gov is watching every move that the opposition makes with simple rules like for every donations that people makes, they have to leave their actual name and NRIC number down and those names have to be submitted to the gov. All these little things discouraged people from having much contacts with opposition parties, thus leaving opposition without enough pool of people to chose as candidates, plus a press controlled by PAPist.<br><br>There's nothing great about PAPist, they made mistakes, Mass Media wipes their bum, you never knew what went wrong also. Do not forget white collar crime is the hardest to prove. <br><br>In Edwin H. Sutherland 1949 monograph White-Collar Crime he defined a white-collar crime "approximately as a crime committed by a person of respectability and high social status in the course of his occupation."</p>
              <p>I wish to remind everyone, this is the last chance to vote, a citizen genocide is currently underway, replacing older citizens with newer citizens, citizens who are highly skilled simpletons who will accept the rule of PAPist unconditionally, may heavens have mercy on us all.</p>
