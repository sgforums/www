              <p>INCREASED enforcement against loan sharks may have the unintended 
              result of increasing business for licensed moneylenders. ('Loan-shark 
              woes: Expect more arrests'; Jan 22).</p>
              <p>With the amendments to the Moneylenders Act in 2008, 
              moneylenders were allowed to charge interest and other fees without any 
              cap on loans above $3,000 or to borrowers who earn more than $20,000 
              annually.</p>
              <p>Moneylenders have been charging whatever the market can 
              bear. Based on recent cases we know of, some have increased interest 
              charges to a high of 260 per cent flat per annum.</p>
              <p>In addition, late-payment charges amounting to a flat rate of 520 per cent annually are levied.</p>
              <p>If borrowers want to settle early, the repayment charges are hefty and discourages them from doing so.</p>
              <p>The courts can intervene to review the charges but for 
              obvious reasons, moneylenders will avoid resorting to legal action to 
              recover their loans, leaving borrowers with little recourse.</p>
              <p>One may argue that if borrowers agree to pay such high 
              rates, the transaction is between a willing borrower and a willing 
              seller. One may also contend that it is better for an individual to 
              borrow from a licensed moneylender than an illegal loan shark.</p>
              <p>But these arguments beg the question of whether the rates 
              charged are any different between an illegal loan shark and a legal 
              moneylender.</p>
              <p>Moneylenders do indulge in aggressive collection tactics, 
              knocking on doors and various forms of harassment and pressure which 
              also distress borrowers.</p>
              <p>Clearly something is wrong with existing laws and regulations that allow such usurious rates for borrowers.</p>
              <p>There is a demand for small loans that is also not met by financial institutions.</p>
              <p>The Moneylenders Act should be reviewed to gauge whether the
               amendments have achieved the desired results of making available credit
               at affordable prices to individuals, or have made their plight worse.</p>
              <p>Existing bank regulations governing unsecured credit should 
              also be reviewed to check if they can be relaxed further to be more 
              inclusive of individuals who do not meet the present income requirements
               and must turn to moneylenders.</p>
              <p>For example, banks are now permitted to issue credit cards 
              with a credit limit of not more than $500 to individuals without any 
              income requirements.</p>
              <p>This limit is too small and unattractive for banks. If the 
              limit was raised to say $1,000, this may encourage more banks into the 
              microloan arena to meet the need for small loans and compete with 
              moneylenders.</p>
              <p>The authorities may also consider having one body in charge of unsecured lending, including moneylending.</p>

              <p>EIGHT licences were revoked and four were not renewed last year as the
               authorities clamped down on licensed moneylenders with suspect business
               practices.</p>
              <p>The industry regulator, the Registry of Moneylenders, also 
              received 64 complaints against these moneylenders last year, more than 
              three times the 18 it received in 2009.</p>
