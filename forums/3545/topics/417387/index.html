              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A 
              40-year-old managing director of a landscaping company involved in the 
              Orchard Road Mall enhancement works project was fined S$55,000 for 
              corruption.<br><br>Tan Kok Keong from Kok Keong Landscape gave a bribe 
              of S$1,500 to an arborist, Victorine Noella Vijeysingha, in November 
              2008.<br><br>He handed over the money so that Ms Vijeysingha, who was 
              the project's resident technical officer, would be lenient when 
              supervising work done by his company.<br><br>The pair was at Orchard 
              Road in October that year when Ms Vijeysingha hinted that she wanted him
               to bribe her.<br><br>Tan agreed as the work completed by his company 
              would have to first pass her scrutiny before the National Parks Board 
              conducted its inspections.<br><br>He then told Ms Vijeysingha that he 
              could give her S$1,500.<br><br>Tan did not want delays as they could 
              lead to additional costs for his firm.<br><br>Tan had also promised to 
              give Ms Vijeysingha a bribe of S$30,000 in March last year.<br><br>This,
               after she had told him that she could help him try to win a contract 
              for a separate project at Nassim Park condominium.<br><br>Court 
              documents stated that Ms Vijeysingha told Tan that she could recommend 
              him to the firm in charge of the project, SCDA Architects.<br><br>She 
              had originally wanted a 10 per cent commission from the total value of 
              the million-dollar landscaping job.<br><br>But Tan later promised to 
              give her S$30,000 instead - which was about three per cent of the total 
              value.<br><br>The court heard that, in the end, no agreement was reached
               between the two.<br><br>Ms Vijeysingha hasn't been charged in court 
              over her role in the offences.<br><br>Those convicted of corruption can 
              be jailed up to five years and fined up to S$100,000 for each charge.<br><br>-
