              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The 
              government is carrying out a five-year study in Marine Parade to assess 
              the implications and needs of an ageing community.<br><br>Speaking at St
               Hilda's Community Services Centre's Christmas High Tea on Sunday, 
              Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong said the findings will then be applied to 
              the rest of Singapore.<br><br>75-year-old Abdul Rahman Karidin suffered a
               stroke eight years ago and became depressed over time.<br><br>But the 
              rehabilitative activities at St Hilda's have cheered him up, bringing 
              new meaning to "active ageing".<br><br>He said: "Once you go there and 
              exercise, you got friends. I meet Malay, Chinese...and even elderly men 
              like me."<br><br>Mr Goh commended organisations like St Hilda's for 
              reaching out to vulnerable groups in society.<br><br>He said the elderly
               are a special group, and Singapore would need more young people to 
              engage older Singaporeans to help them grow old graciously.<br><br>He 
              noted that one in five Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above by 2030.<br><br>But
               Marine Parade is 20 years ahead, with one in five residents currently 
              aged 65 and above.<br><br>That is why the government is conducting a 
              five-year study there to understand the needs of the ageing community.<br><br>The
               findings would then be applied to the rest of Singapore.<br><br>MediaCorp
               understands that the Community Development, Youth and Sports Ministry 
              and other government agencies will partner grassroots organisations in 
              Marine Parade to carry out the study.<br><br>The study will look at what
               Singaporeans aged 60 and above would need, such as physical amenities 
              and other services.<br><br>Mr Goh said: "By 'old', I do not mean those 
              that are frail, unable to move on their own alone. It is 65 and above, 
              and hopefully, it is to help them age actively. So if you regard Marine 
              Parade as an ageing community, it is in fact a community of retirees in 
              fact to come, people getting older, retiring in place."<br><br>He added:
               "We hope that a survey of their needs will be able to help us identify 
              the gaps that we must put in place to support an ageing population. 
              After the needs are identified, we would then have to work out measures 
              which may include national policies to serve the older population, and 
              of course later on, we got to do an evaluation as to whether what we try
               to do will be done in a most cost-effective way."<br><br>Details of the
               study are expected to be announced on Monday.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>
