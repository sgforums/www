              <h1 class="test1">Singapore sovereign fund Temasek Hldg sees profits plunge</h1>
              <p><span class="datetime">On Thursday 8 July 2010, 15:23 - AFP</span></p>
              <p>Singapore's influential state-linked investment firm Temasek Holdings 
              said Thursday its net profit in the year ended March had fallen 26 
              percent due to the lingering impact of the global crisis.</p>
              <p>The 
              firm's net profit of 4.6 billion Singaporean dollars (3.33 billion US) 
              compared with 6.2 billion dollars the previous financial year, the 
              sovereign wealth fund said.</p>
              <p>The decline was due to "lower profit 
              contributions from some of the portfolio companies which were impacted 
              by the global financial crisis," it said as it released its annual 
              report.</p>
              <p>The city state's sovereign fund has been a major investor 
              behind the phenomenal growth story that has characterised much of Asia 
              in recent years.</p>
              <p>But among the victims of the global crisis that 
              struck in the third quarter of 2008 following the collapse of US bank 
              Lehman Brothers were companies that Temasek had invested in.</p>
              <p>Temasek
               had taken a stake in Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch but divested its 
              interest when the US firm was bought by Bank of America. It also bought 
              into British lender Barclays but later off-loaded that stake.</p>
              <p>Temasek
               is estimated to have lost more than 5.4 billion US dollars from the 
              sale of its holdings in the two banks, according to Dow Jones newswires.</p>
              <p>On
               Thursday Temasek said the total value of its investments worldwide 
              stood at a record 186 billion dollars as of March 31, up from 130 
              billion dollars the year before and reflecting a strong recovery from 
              the recession.</p>
              <p>The amount was higher than the pre-crisis value of 
              its global portfolio, which was 185 billion dollars in March 2008.</p>
              <p>Nearly
               80 percent of Temasek's investments are in Asia, including Singapore, 
              the company said.</p>
              <p>Executive director Simon Israel said Temasek was
               likely to increase its exposure to Asia in the next 10 years.</p>
              <p>But
               he added the company "will continue to maintain the full flexibility to
               shift our portfolio stance in response to major developments, trends or
               market opportunities".</p>
              <p>During the last financial year, Temasek 
              made new investments totalling 10 billion dollars, including stakes in a
               platinum producer in South Africa and a Canada-listed oil and gas firm.
               It made six billion dollars in divestments.</p>
              <p>Earnings have 
              declined since the record 18 billion-dollar net profit achieved in the 
              financial year ended March 2008.</p>
              <p>"We expect global growth to be 
              slower in the medium term, with Asia maintaining its secular long term 
              growth path," Temasek chief executive Ho Ching said in a statement. "Our
               focus on Asia will continue."</p>
              <p>As of March 31, 2010, Temasek's 
              underlying exposure to Singapore was 32 percent, while the rest of Asia 
              excluding Japan stood at about 46 percent, the firm said.</p>
              <p>Investments
               in the OECD -- the Paris-based group of industrialised nations -- and 
              other economies totalled 22 percent.</p>
              <p>Temasek chairman S. 
              Dhanabalan cited protectionism in developed countries and asset bubbles 
              in developing economies among the risks for the global economy.</p>
              <p>"Protectionism
               may rear its head as developed markets struggle to cope with high 
              unemployment, weak fiscal positions and mounting debt burdens," 
              Dhanabalan said.</p>
              <p>"On the other hand, developing markets risk asset
               bubbles, and loose lending may haunt their banking system down the 
              road."</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Temasek's portfolio up 43%</h1>
              <p>THE market value of Temasek's portfolio rebounded to a new financial 
              year-end high of S$186 billion - up by $56 billion from a year ago, with
               a total shareholder return of over 42 per cent.</p>
              <p>The book value of its portfolio rose to S$150 billion for 
              the year ended March 31, up from S$50 billion 10 years ago, underpinned 
              by the secular growth of its group of companies and Temasek's own 
              investment activities.</p>
              <p>Mr Simon Israel, Executive Director of Temasek Holdings, 
              briefing journalists at the release of the state investment firm's 2010 
              annual report, said: 'In terms of performance, we have done well.'</p>
              <p>He said the rise in portfolio value matched that of two 
              years ago, and the shareholder return of 42 per cent worked out to a 
              return of 17 per cent compounded annually since Temasek's inception.</p>
              <p>'This set of robust results is in part the result of the 
              global recovery in the financial markets, and partly due to the 
              investments we made during the crisis. They repressent a one year 
              snapshot in our journey as a long-term investor,' said Mr Israel.</p>
              <p>Going forward, Temasek will continue to focus on Asia, where
               it has been stepping up its exposure, said the annual report.</p>
              <p>Since launching its Asia strategy in 2002, Temasek has 
              invested actively in the region, with nearly 80 per cent of its 
              underlying portfolio exposure in Asia this year. Mr Israel said the new 
              investments made by Temasek over the past eight years have given the 
              company 'a good return' of over 23 per cent,' boosting its exposure to 
              Asia 'much faster than what we had expected.'</p>
              <p>He said Temasek had managed to keep its cool and focused on 
              what it needed to do as a long-term investor through the financial 
              meltdown last year. 'We maintained a liquid posture, kept our powder 
              dry, made sure the home base was secure, and invested and divested 
              steadily, taking advantage of opportunities that dame along,' said Mr 
              Israel.</p>
              <p>'Some investments had not turned out as expected, while most
               other investments did well. Where we thought the risks were not 
              acceptable, or when we had other better opportunities, we were ready to 
              do what we thought was best for the long term, despite any short-term 
              pain.'</p>
              <p>Chairman of Temasek S. Dhanabalan said the group has 'been 
              committed to create and deliver sustainable value as an active active 
              investor and shareholder of successful enterprises.</p>

              <p><strong>Temasek Holdings portfolio value hits record S$186b</strong><br> <span class="update">By Desmond Wong | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 08 July 2010 1415 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The value of Temasek Holdings'portfolio climbed 43 per
               cent to a new record high of S$186 billion in the 12 months to March 
              this year, beating the previous high of S$185 billion set in 2008. 
              <br> <br> Temasek is seeing better investment returns with a rising stock market.
              <br> <br> According to its latest annual report released on Thursday, Temasek 
              closed the financial year with a comfortable net cash position.
              <br> <br> The market value of Temasek's portfolio rebounded to a new financial 
              year-end high of S$186 billion as at March, an increase of S$56 billion 
              from a year earlier.
              <br> <br> Total shareholder return by market value grew 42 per cent on-year during
               the period. This reverses a negative 30 per cent return in 2009.
              <br> <br> Since its inception in 1974, Temasek said its total shareholder return 
              by market value has grown a compounded 17 per cent annually.
              <br> <br> But the financial crisis took its toll in the short term, as the 
              investment company's net profit for the year fell 26 per cent.
              <br> <br> It's net profit for the 12 months to March 2010 fell to S$4.6 billion, 
              as revenues slid 4 per cent to S$76.7 billion.
              <br> <br> Temasek said this was due to some of its blue chip holdings being hit by
               the downturn.
              <br> <br> Leong Wai Leng, chief financial officer, Temasek Holdings, said: "On the
               whole, our portfolio companies have performed well, but some of them 
              are more severely impacted. For example, NOL, and SIA - they're 
              publicly-listed companies and you have seen that in their results."
              <br> <br> Temasek said it made S$10 billion in investments over the year, and S$6 
              billion in divestments, with most of its recent investments in the past 
              few months being in the resources and energy sectors. 
              <br> <br> Temasek's annual report also stated that its investment focus remains 
              firmly in Asia, which now accounts for about 46 per cent of its fund 
              allocation.
              <br> <br> Singapore assets take up some 32 per cent, while OECD economies account 
              for 20 per cent, with other countries - mainly in Latin America - taking
               up 2 per cent of the allocation. 
              <br> <br> Temasek said it plans to increase its exposure in Asia and remains 
              overweight on the region in the near future. But it sees risks in the 
              near term for both developed and developing economies. 
              <br> <br> Looking ahead, Temasek believes the worst of the economic downturn is 
              over but said structural imbalances remain in the global economy with 
              the European debt crisis having the potential to slow recovery. 
              <br> <br> It also identifies deleveraging by governments and consumers, tightening
               regulations, the threat of trade protectionism and credit availability 
              as risks ahead.
              <br> <br> Simon Israel, executive director, Temasek Holdings, said: ""Deleveraging
               will continue. Policy risks will be higher and the regulatory 
              environment tougher. Inflation rises are muted in the near term except 
              perhaps in the developing economies."
              <br> <br> However, Temasek said that China and India will be the anchors for 
              future regional growth.  It added that it plans to stay liquid and 
              continue to invest and divest at a steady pace.
              <br> <br> The firm is also pushing ahead with plans to grow SeaTown Holdings, a 
              wholly-owned subsidiary with over S$4 billion in capital commitment. 
              <br> <br> SeaTown aims to invest in a broader range of asset classes and 
              geographies, away from Temasek's own equities and Asian focus.
              <br> <br> But Temasek said it will take at least three to five years for SeaTown 
              to establish itself before sophisticated co-investors are brought in.
              <br> <br> On the question of succession, Temasek executive director, Simon Israel,
               said: "There is no active immediate search for a CEO. Ho Ching is CEO 
              and remains CEO."
              <br> <br> Last Feburary, former BHP Billiton CEO Charles Goodyear was appointed to
               succeed Ms Ho, but left the firm after a 7-month transition process due
               to strategic differences.
