              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Deputy 
              Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said an experiment conducted recently by 
              the police showed Singaporeans were "generally complacent" about the 
              possibility of a terrorist attack here.<br><br>In the experiment, cars 
              rigged with tell-tale signs of a bomb were left parked at nine 
              locations, including Orchard Road, Shenton Way and Marina Bay, from 8am 
              to 7pm.<br><br>Of the roughly 7,200 people who passed within 10 metres 
              of the vehicles, only 260 or 3.6 per cent noticed the vehicle.<br><br>And
               of these, only 52 people acted immediately and alerted police or civil 
              defence officers. <br><br>Another 44 people had noticed something amiss,
               but admitted they did not intend to report it.<br><br>Mr Wong said the 
              experiment showed Singaporeans were "generally complacent" about the 
              possibility of a terrorist attack, though it gave authorities "some 
              satisfaction" that there were some who did act on their suspicions.<br><br>Mr
               Wong said security planners in Singapore must rethink ways to best 
              engage the community to remain vigilant.<br><br>In his first address as 
              Coordinating Minister for National Security, Mr Wong said rather than 
              attain a uniform level of preparedness across society, it may be more 
              pragmatic and sustainable to develop an activist cadre in specific 
              domains.<br><br>In this respect, he said the Community Engagement 
              Programme started in 2006 has been successful in grooming a small but 
              active pool of grassroots volunteers.<br><br>He said a change of mindset
               is needed, because over time, people become less vigilant about 
              security matters.<br><br>And this was an observation made not just in 
              Singapore, but also in other countries that had experienced terror 
              attacks.<br><br>Mr Wong also cautioned against becoming "overly 
              preoccupied" with the latest terror attack, and neglecting to place them
               in context of past terrorist incidents.<br><br>"The fact is while these
               threats demonstrate creativity and an adaptive quality, they are seldom
               completely brand new. Often they are revisions of past efforts in the 
              same vein," Mr Wong said.<br><br>So for instance, parcel bombs like 
              those recently discovered onboard flights from Yemen to the US, were 
              already popular among Palestinian terror groups in the 1980s.<br><br>And
               here, academics and researchers can offer valuable insight and 
              historical perspective into how future threats may evolve, says Mr Wong.<br><br>Mr
               Wong was speaking at the annual National Security Seminar, held at the 
              Civil Service College.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>Not quite. Islam was spread by the conquering of neighbouring nations around Mecca when it first came about. See also how the Prophet Muhammed "persuaded" Mecca to become Muslim. I don't think you can have conquests without plenty of death on both sides. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_of_Islam"><span style="color: #000000;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_of_Islam</span></a>)</p>
              <p>Also, </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">2:190-193</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">Fight in the cause of God</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">, those who fight you, but do not transgress limits; for God loveth not transgressors. And</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">slay them wherever ye catch them</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">, and turn them out from where they have turned you out: For tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter;</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">But fight them not at the sacred Mosque unless they first fight you there; But if they fight you, Slay them</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">. Such is the reward of those who suppress faith. But if they cease, God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. And</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;"> </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">fight them on until there is no more tumult or oppression</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">, and there prevail justice and faith in God; but if they cease, Let there be no hostility except to those who practise oppression."</span></p>
              <p>So killing is allowed, just until the opposers back off. That's fine, most countries do this. (In the name of their country, not Islam.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though they do have a particular like for Jews and Christians.</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';"><span style="line-height: normal; font-size: medium;">9:5 But when the forbidden months are past, then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them, and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practice regular charity, then open the way for them: for God is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.</span></span></p>
              <p>Seems a rather "accept Islam or face our wrath" kind of thing. (I've no idea what this forbidden months mean though. It is mentioned in 9:1 about four months something.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Note: To any Muslims out there, I do not mean to offend. I understand that this is the English translation of the Arabic text and the words translated may have been altered to have its meaning harsher that what it should be. If you have a better translation of the original text or an explanation of why your book says this, I would be happy to try to understand from your point of view. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also, not saying that other religions don't have violent histories either. (Christianity - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades"><span style="color: #000000;">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades</span></a> , etc.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But coming back to the OP yeah, we are rather apathetic, in general. =P</p>

              <p>WTF? Actually 3 near-terrorist attacks almost happened, but were uncovered before the plan succeeded. One in Yishun MRT, one in Changi Airport and the other at Orchard MRT.</p>
