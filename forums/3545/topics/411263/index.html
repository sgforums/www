              <p> </p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : The Acting Information, Communications and the Arts 
              Minister said his ministry is unlikely to agree to all the 
              recommendations made by the Censorship Review Committee in its report 
              issued on Wednesday.
              <br> <br> Mr Lui Tuck Yew described the report as a well-considered and thoughtful
               one, and said his ministry will give its response within the fortnight.
              <br> <br> The Censorship Review Committee spent nearly a whole year looking at 
              various issues, conducting surveys and going in-depth into different 
              areas, said Mr Lui.
              <br> <br> And the team has managed to reconcile the conflicting views of many 
              interest groups.
              <br> <br> Mr Lui said: "We are in agreement with many of the recommendations but 
              we are unlikely to agree with all the recommendations. What is 
              encouraging is that CRC (Censorship Review Committee) had understood 
              full well the need to continue to protect the young, to safeguard our 
              racial and religious harmony, and also ensure that our societal values 
              are kept intact. 
              <br> <br> "Going forward, it is partnership that parents, industry and arts 
              groups, and government... to come together to make sure that we arrive 
              at the appropriate equilibrium for Singapore and Singaporeans."
              <br> <br> One of the key recommendations of the Censorship Review Committee is 
              about parental empowerment. The committee recommends that parents use 
              optional internal filters on an easy-to-use parental lock system for 
              Internet and TV content when it comes to their children. 
              <br> <br> The filters would replace the current symbolic ban on 100 websites, but 
              the government should retain the power to ban websites that are seen as a
               threat to national security, such as terrorism and extreme racial or 
              religious hate sites.
              <br> <br> As for keeping up with technological changes, Mr Lui acknowledged that 
              parents do have some concerns as to whether they could keep up with the 
              pace.
              <br> <br> Mr Lui said: "So parents will have concerns if the government leaves it 
              completely to them, whether they are equipped to do what is necessary. 
              We need to educate not only the youngsters, we need to have programmes 
              for parents who are interested and want keep up with this. 
              <br> <br> "That's one thing that needs to be done and that's in line with the 
              recommendations of the CRC."
              <br> <br> The Censorship Review Committee also recommends introducing a PG-13 
              rating to allow for more nuanced classification of films. And 
              accordingly, certain PG-rated films could be allowed on free-to-air 
              channels before 10pm.
              <br> <br> The R21 rating will be retained, but such films may be shown in 
              heartlands cinemas, subject to certain advertising and timing 
              restrictions. R21 films aired on pay-TV should also carry more prominent
               warnings.
              <br> <br> Mr Lui said when responding to the wide-ranging report, the government 
              will also present its role going forward in this environment. - CNA /ls</span><span class="update"> </span><img style="visibility: hidden;" src="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/imagegallery/store/phpvBlWWB.jpg" alt="" width="1" height="1"></p>
