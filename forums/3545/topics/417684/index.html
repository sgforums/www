              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: 
              Singapore's labour movement, the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), 
              will give extra significance to leadership renewal at its next National 
              Delegates Conference in 2011, which will also see elections to its 
              Central Committee.<br><br>Sharing plans for NTUC's 50th anniversary 
              celebrations next year, labour chief Lim Swee Say said the search for 
              his successor has also started.<br><br>A key highlight for next year 
              include a mega rally for May Day at the Indoor Stadium as well as a 
              grand dinner scheduled on May 13, at the Marina Bay Sands.<br><br>Mr Lim
               said the delegates conference next year would be extra significant 
              because "many of our top leaders will be reaching official retirement 
              age of 62 and they have expressed their desire to flow on". <br><br>Mr 
              Lim said this would create a platform to identify the next generation of
               leaders. <br><br>Mr Lim, who had been the Secretary-General of the NTUC
               for the past four years,said a key task for him now is to identify and 
              groom likely candidates who can be nurtured to take on the role of the 
              next secretary-general. <br><br>He added this is a challenging task, but
               progress is being made.<br><br>"Be prepared to dare to do the right 
              thing. For us to prepare for the future, we may have to bear the pain 
              today, in order to enjoy the gain tomorrow. <br><br>"So the leaders we 
              are looking at must be (those) who (are) prepared to bite the bullet, do
               the right thing even though it is not popular," he said.<br><br>Mr Lim 
              added that it was important to continue to attract, nurture and identify
               future union leaders, especically those in their forties and thirties.<br><br>This
               is to ensure that leadership renewal can grow from strength to strength
               for a long time to come.<br><br>Mr Lim also said union leaders must 
              possess some special qualities.<br><br>He added that the delegates 
              conference in 2011 is important because it is a platform for them to 
              "take stock of how far have we achieved in repositioning the labour 
              movement towards what we call an All Collar, All Ages and All 
              Nationalities (CAN) labour movement". <br><br>He added: "(The conference
               is important because) it is for us to look ahead for the next five 
              years. Having re-positioned the labour movement towards 2011, how do we 
              build on the foundation towards LM 2015 so that by 2015, at our next 
              delegates conference, we would be able to take stock of our progress in 
              terms of inclusive workforce, three-generation membership and inclusive 
              leadership?"<br><br>Mr Lim said the labour movement in Singapore has 
              been progressive and innovative. <br><br>"We intend to build on this 
              foundation as we continue this journey of tripartism in Singapore," he 
              said.<br><br>"On the part of the workforce, we will continue to think of
               new ways to ensure that our workforce will be an inclusive one (to 
              include) low wage workers, back-to-work women, matured workers and the 
              PMETs as well."<br><br>Mr Lim said over the last 30 years, NTUC had 
              built a strong foundation in serving workers, members and unions, adding
               that he was confident NTUC could do even better in the next 50 years. <br><br>Since
               1979, the Secretary-General of the NTUC has also served as a member of 
              the Cabinet in the Singapore government.<br><br>They include the 
              previous secretaries-general Mr Lim Chee Onn, the late Mr Ong Teng 
              Cheong and Mr Lim Boon Heng, the immediate past Secretary-General.<br><br>Employer
               leaders say the future NTUC chief may be groomed from the cohort of 
              candidates to be fielded in the next general election.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
