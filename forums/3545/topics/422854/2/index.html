              <p>Pitiful some of the singaporean. They can't even believe what their government told them. Government told them the number is less than 300 cases, they still cheating themselve that the number is &gt; 300 to console themselve that they are right to support the abolishemnt of such scheme so that they won't feel guilty by focring the PR and some of the singapore siblings right to the corner.</p>
              <p>Apparently,HDB abolishes the scheme are mainly to console all these imbalance singaporean. But they should think of the root cause of the incidence. MP should study the demand and supply of the HDB instead of sitting in the office and drawing the high salary and wait for succeed in next election by just taking some last min action to cool down the market.</p>

              <p>Just a quick question, why dun the PR take up citizenships?  So far Singapore is one of the countries that treat the PR nearly like citizen.  Look into all countries, none of them allow PR to buy public housing (HDB type) other than Singapore.  Some countries even had additional personal income for PR or charge PR additional tax when they purchase pte property there.</p>
              <p>When I am overseas, I accept all this because I know that I am just a guest there and unless I convert to their citizenship (which have a great barrier), I dun have a right to complain.  Guess Singapore is that only country that the foreigner felt that they should have the same right as citizens.  Please remember this statement - "With equal right come equal responsible".  Just for a quick info for u, back in Taiwan early when they have NS, even a 30 plus first generation PR, he will be require to serve NS.</p>

              <p>Agreed withLlazybumi that PRs are being treated nicely in SG as compared to PRs in other countries. Actually many of them will accept the fact if SG government does not allow them to have property / enjoy same benefit as Singaporean as this is part of Singaporean's right as Citizen. However, if complain just for the sick of complain, which cause difficulties to PR is an  irrational behaviour. Be friendly to each other. Thats why many PRs eventually becomes Singaporean after they stay here for many years. Is not easy to give up their original citizenship, this is not  as easy as just buying things from super market. Lots of factors to be considered. However, SG is really nice country to stay. Just the hike in HDB price dreating conflict between PRS and Singaporean. Imagine HDB even encourage PRs to buy resale HDBs in 1997 when the HDB is over stock...</p>
              <p>HDB should reinstate the rules to allow both of them to buy HDBs since the number of cases is less than 300.They should review their roles and responsibilities and study the demand and supply properly.  No eye to see if the MP win the next election. This will prove that Singaporean just complain PRs for the sick of complain. Who cause the problem all this while...</p>

              <p><br>I think most of the complain come in becos Singaporean had start to view that there not much different between Citizens and PR which cause the unhappiness (and this is also the reason why most PR are not willing to take up citizens as they enjoy the best of both world, their home country and singapore).  And to be fair, it is not only Singaporean are the only one that complain.  As recently when some of the right of the PR are taken away or unleast reduced, many of the PR's complained abt all this development on both the media and internet.</p>

              <p>one of my friend applied for SG citizen last year but failed to applied PR for his mother.

              <p>Should we abandon our parent just because SG government take more stringent action after their citizen complain? Does it mean even after we realised that SG is a good city to stay,we think this is better country and we want to apply for citizen but we need to give up our parent? SG may just need the young blood but the young blood won't leave their parent just becuase this. Imagine one day you were working in a better country ( eg: Canada) for more than 10 years  and you think you want to become their citizen there and they tell you that we only need you but not your parent.

              <p>U might not like it, but if u travel aboard other than SG, u will know that this is practice by all countries.  It is part and parcel when one decided to take up another countries citizenship. I dun need to imagine what u are say as I had work overseas before.  Plus just on one point that I think u point dun make sense, u mean that if they are only PR in singapore, they are not leaving their parents alone at their home country? </p>
