              <p></p>
              <div class="byline">By Jeremy Au Yong</div>
              <p>BOTH opposition MPs yesterday dismissed the Town Council Management Report that gave their town councils the lowest scores.</p>
              <p>In an e-mail statement sent last night, Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang suggested that the whole grading exercise might simply result in residents having to pay more.</p>
              <p>He said: 'Such an exercise... which inevitably requires much resources put in by the town councils, would translate into higher operating costs, and residents will eventually end up paying higher service and conservancy charges.'</p>
              <p>He made it clear that he had been sceptical of the whole undertaking from the start.</p>
              <p>For example, it was not feasible to assess town councils with a 'common denominator', given the differing constituency profiles.</p>
              <p>Opposition town councils start from a disadvantaged position, as they are at the bottom of the queue for estate upgrading.</p>
              <p>'Considering this, for the Hougang Town Council to be given a ranking of four for maintenance, as against a three and below given to a PAP town council with all the various upgrading given them by the HDB, it is an accomplishment,' he said.</p>
              <p>Town councils were graded 1 to 5, with 1 being the best grade.</p>
              <p>Mr Low declared that his town council had responded well to challenges faced. 'This confidence arises from feedback from residents and my own inspection of the estate,' he said.</p>
              <p>As for the poor grades the town council received for arrears management, he said that the town council was 'sympathetic towards residents in financial difficulty', though it does take legal action against errant residents.</p>
              <p>He stressed that he does not believe in writing off the debts of those who repeatedly fail to pay, just to reduce his arrears.</p>
              <p>Hougang Town Council emerged with a set of the poorest scores in yesterday's report card on the 16 town councils.</p>
              <p>Only Potong Pasir Town Council chalked up poorer grades.</p>
              <p>When contacted, Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong was in a defiant mood. He curtly dismissed the report as a ploy to discredit his town council.</p>
              <p>'They want to thump Potong Pasir down,' he said, when approached at his Meet-the-People session last night.</p>
              <p>Looking clearly upset, the opposition veteran added: 'Potong Pasir is the best town council in Singapore, what do you expect me to say?'</p>

               poor

              <div>
              <p>HDB residents in Potong Pasir and Hougang are
               surprised by the
                                      first Town Council Management Report (TCMR) card
               released by the
                                      Ministry of National Development (MND).</p>
              <p>Out of the 16 town councils listed in the 
              report, two
                                      opposition wards, Potong Pasir and Hougang, had 
              the lowest scores.
                                      The town councils were assessed on areas 
              including estate
                                      cleanliness and maintenance, lift performance 
              and management of
                                      arrears in service &amp; conservancy charges 
              (S&amp;CC).</p>
              <p>Potong Pasir and Hougang’s low scores were 
              due mainly to
                                      the bigger proportion of homes failing to pay 
              their S&amp;CC for at
                                      least three months. The two best performers are 
              Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu
                                      Kang led by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and 
              Tanjong Pagar
                                      headed by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

              Yahoo! Singapore spoke
                                      to were surprised by their estate’s low scores.</p>
              <p>Hospital worker Dave T. , 28, who’s been 
              living in Potong
                                      Pasir for the past 25 years, “I don’t see 
              anything wrong with the
                                      cleanliness and I am surprised other estates 
              fared better because
                                      when I visit my relatives elsewhere, the 
              cleanliness in their area
                                      is worse.”</p>
              <p>Hougang resident, car salesman Jastin H., 31,
               who lives in
                                      a five-room flat in Hougang, doubts the efficacy
               of a report card
                                      in gauging an estate’s cleanliness.</p>
              <p>“I’m just wondering if the evaluators went to
               each estate at the
                                      same time. Who knows, one could be up for 
              cleaning while the other
                                      has already been cleaned. It’s very subjective,”
               he said.</p>
              <p>In releasing the report, the MND stressed 
              that the objective is
                                      not to compare estates but to see how each is 
              doing over time. The
                                      report will be issued every six months.</p>
