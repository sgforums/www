              <p><strong>Town councils fare generally well in first management report</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi / Jeremy Koh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 10 June 2010 1157 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Town Councils across Singapore have fared generally 
              well in the first Town Council Management Report.
              <br> <br> They were assessed in four areas, cleanliness, maintenance, lift 
              performance and management of service and conservancy charges arrears.
              <br> <br> All 16 town councils scored at least a level 2 for cleanliness on a 
              scale of 1 to 5 with one being the best and 5 being the worst.
              <br> <br> In the other areas of assessment, most town councils also achieved at 
              least a level 3.
              <br> <br> However, town councils in opposition-held estates didn't fare as well.
              <br> <br> Potong Pasir for instance scored a level 5 in several areas of 
              assessment including maintenance and arrears management.
              <br> <br> Hougang estate also scored 5 for arrears management.
              <br> <br> No other estate scored a five in any area of assessment.
              <br> <br> On the other hand, the town councils which fared the best were Tanjong 
              Pagar and Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang. 
              <br> <br> Putting things in context however, the National Development Ministry 
              says the management report should not be used as a basis for comparison 
              between towns.
              <br> <br> That's because each town differs in terms of its residents' profile and 
              property profile.
              <br> <br> Hence, it says a more appropriate use of the result is for monitoring 
              the performance of towns over time.
              <br> <br> The towns were assessed over six months from last October to this March.

              <p><strong>Town councils fare generally well in first management
              report</strong><br> <span>By Mustafa Shafawi / Jeremy Koh |</span> <span>Posted: 10 June 2010 1157 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Town Councils across Singapore have fared
              generally well in the first Town Council Management Report.<br> <br> They were assessed in four areas, cleanliness, maintenance, lift
              performance and management of service and conservancy charges
              arrears.<br> <br> All 16 town councils scored at least a level 2 for cleanliness on a
              scale of 1 to 5 with one being the best and 5 being the
              worst.<br> <br> In the other areas of assessment, most town councils also achieved
              at least a level 3.<br> <br> However, town councils in opposition-held estates didn't fare as
              well.<br> <br> Potong Pasir for instance scored a level 5 in several areas of
              assessment including maintenance and arrears management.<br> <br> Hougang estate also scored 5 for arrears management.<br> <br> No other estate scored a five in any area of assessment.<br> <br> On the other hand, the town councils which fared the best were
              Tanjong Pagar and Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang.<br> <br> Putting things in context however, the National Development
              Ministry says the management report should not be used as a basis
              for comparison between towns.<br> <br> <strong>That's because each town differs in terms of its residents' profile
              and property profile.<br><br> Hence, it says a more appropriate use of the result is for
              monitoring the performance of towns over time.<br><br> The towns were assessed over six months from last October to this
              March. - </strong> CNA/jy</span></p>

              <p>So they were accessed differently??? <br><br>Ang Mo Kio HDB flats look damn old, dirty and unmaintained, in my opinion, as compared to the older flats in Toa Payoh.</p>

              <p>Arrears Management is debt collection of outstanding owed by residents?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Hougang and Potong Pasir did not chase their debtors for arrears when those families are in financial difficulty? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For PAP estates if there are arrears, they will probably sent agents to sell your apartment and make good the debt, that's why PAP held estates will score a 1 for debt collection. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline2">Town councils don't fare so 
              well in terms of maintenance: Report</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Sue-Ann Chia &amp; Teo Wan Gek</p>
              <p>HDB residents can now gauge how well their town councils are doing 
              their job, following the release of the first report card on the 
              performance of the 16 councils in Singapore.</p>
              <p>The two best performers are Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang led by 
              Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, and Tanjong Pagar headed by Minister 
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, according to the government's Town Council 
              Management Report.</p>
              <p>The two worst performers are run by the opposition: Hougang,
               by the Workers' Party's Low Thia Khiang, and Potong Pasir by the 
              Singapore People's Party's Chiam See Tong.</p>
              <p>Their low grades are due mainly to the bigger proportion of 
              homes failing to pay their service and conservancy charges (S&amp;CC) 
              for at least three months.</p>
              <p>But take away the level of arrears, and the gap between the 
              performance levels of the councils run by the People's Action Party 
              (PAP) and the opposition narrows significantly.</p>
              <p>In releasing the report yesterday, the National Development 
              Ministry stressed that the objective is not to compare one against the 
              other but to see how each is doing over time. The report will be issued 
              every six months.</p>

              <p><br>prettty obvious you are all the way out to quarrel.    If the electrical box is haywired it has nothing to do with the resident, it is between Town Council and /Singapore Power.   If you want, I can ask my friend for the Tg Pagar Town Council tel number for you to call to verify.</p>
              <p>YOU still want to quarrel even when the fact is told to you.    I have nothing against PAP on this.   In fact, I am thankful to the PAP MP for assisting me on one matter.   If you insist you are right and wants to continue to quarrel that is your problem.   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
