              <p>Town council assessment carried out objectively</p>
              <p><br><span class="update">By Joanne Chan | </span><span class="update">Posted: 13 June 2010 1718 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span class="update"><span>SINGAPORE: Senior Minister of State for National Development, Grace Fu, has refuted claims by some opposition MPs who say the Town Council Management Report (TCMR) is "unfair" and "subjective". <br><br>She said the six-month assessment was carried out objectively and data collected for half of the indicators (lift performance and S&amp;CC arrears management) came from the town councils themselves. <br><br>Data on cleanliness and estate maintenance were collected during inspections carried out by HDB officers. <br><br>Ms Fu was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a community event on Sunday. <br><br>In the inaugural TCMR report, the two opposition-held wards stood out for their less-than-stellar performances. <br><br>Hougang and Potong Pasir town councils were the only ones with level 4 and 5 scores, with 5 being the poorest. <br><br>Potong Pasir scored level 5 for four indicators while Hougang scored two level 5 and one level 4. <br><br>The People's Action Party wards received a level 3 or better on all indicators. Tanjong Pagar town council fared the best, scoring level 1 for all indicators except one. <br><br>Responding to claims by the opposition that they do not receive funding to improve the estate, Ms Fu said all town councils are provided funding based on the number and type of households in their wards. <br><br>"The operating funds, the grants, are exactly identical," she said. <br><br>She also noted that the opposition wards have been included in the Lift Upgrading Programme or LUP. "There will be flats which are eligible for LUP, including the opposition wards. So all the divisions who are eligible for LUP will get their LUP done. <br><br>"As for other upgrading, for example Neighbourhood Renewal Programme or Home Improvement Programme, that's actually depending on our available resources, and then the allocation will also depend on the needs of the local areas. <br><br>"So not all PAP divisions will have the same upgrading done as well. There are some who get more and some who get less. So it doesn't apply just to opposition towns...." <br><br>Ms Fu stressed that the TCMR is not meant to rank the town councils. Instead, it should act as talking points between residents and the management. <br><br>For example, if residents are happy with a level 3 for cleanliness, no further action is needed. <br><br>Should they wish for a better grade or a cleaner estate by having more frequent washings, residents may have to consider the trade-off of paying more in fees. <br><br>When asked about how some town councils gave longer grace period for residents to pay their S&amp;CC arrears out of compassion and were hence graded poorly in the report, Ms Fu said town councils need to decide how best to manage their resources. <br><br>Ms Fu said the report's framework will be assessed to see if adjustments are needed, but the current criteria are likely to remain for the next four reports. <br><br>She said the National Development Ministry is looking at including financial indicators related to the use of sinking funds. <br><br>- CNA/ir <br></span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">No action taken on faulty lift</h1>
              <p>   </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I READ with interest last Friday's article ("It's 
              official: HDB estates are clean but...") on the Government's Town 
              Council Management Report.</p>
              <p>I have lodged several complaints over a faulty lift in Block
               111, Jurong East Street 13, which often does not open on the first 
              level. Almost every other day, my family members, including my 
              three-year-old son, get trapped inside the lift and have to press the 
              alarm for the automatic rescue device to kick in and move the lift to 
              the next nearest floor landing.</p>
              <p>Every time I call the Emergency Maintenance Service Unit, 
              the hotline staff's standard reply is that they would get a technician 
              to look into the problem. However, it has been months and this problem 
              has not been fixed.</p>
              <p>When I ask the hotline staff to update me on the case, their
               reply is that it is not part of their standard operating procedure, but
               that they will definitely refer the case to a technician.</p>
              <p>Last Saturday, my son and I were once again trapped in the 
              lift. I understand from many neighbours that they have called in as 
              well, but gave up after they did not see any action being taken.</p>

              <div class="ststory_large">
              <p> </p>
              <p>I THANK Mr Tan Kam Weng ('Things have changed in Potong Pasir - for the worse', last Wednesday) for his comments and feedback, and Mr Liew Kai Khiun ('Little evidence of significant decline in Potong Pasir', last Thursday) for his positive and encouraging comments.</p>
              <p>Potong Pasir Town Council has been engaging competent contractors for all estate maintenance work and our team of estate officers is always there to ensure that the work is carried out effectively.</p>
              <p>I am not surprised at the rankings in the Town Council Management Report (TCMR), which was published in the media. It is not at all appropriate to compare the performances of the town councils as the profile and age of the properties are totally different. There is also an inequality in the funds granted among the town councils and the improvement works carried out by the Government.</p>
              <p>Potong Pasir is a mature estate where the blocks are 25 to 35 years old. Constant efforts are being made using our available resources to maintain the estate as best as possible.</p>
              <p>Our lift maintenance company was already replacing some of the automatic rescue devices during the reporting period of the TCMR. Anyway, there were no issues concerning this matter. I categorically state that all the automatic rescue devices in our estate are working and in serviceable condition. Potong Pasir residents need not worry about it.</p>
              <p>With regard to arrears as reported by the TCMR, we do make provisions for doubtful debts due to the unfavourable economic condition in Singapore, by allowing residents to pay by instalments on compassionate grounds.</p>
              <p>It is not our policy to write off the debts just for the sake of making our report look good. Our approach of collection is systematic, practical and, when required, we have taken the necessary steps to recover the dues.</p>
              <p>I have been managing Potong Pasir Town Council for the last 25 years as diligently as I can and will continue to do my best.</p>
              <p><strong>Chiam See Tong <br>MP for Potong Pasir &amp; <br>Chairman of Potong Pasir Town Council </strong></p>
