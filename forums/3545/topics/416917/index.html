              <div class="kicker">SPECIAL REPORT ON YOUTH AND RELIGION</div>
              <div class="kicker"><br></div>
              <div class="kicker">THE Saturday Special report last week ('God wants youth') stated that 
              religious groups were determined not to lose a generation to 
              godlessness, especially now with youth gangs in the news.
              <p>It also noted that what is at stake is the potential of 
              losing the youth to cynicism, violence and even fanaticism.</p>
              <p>These remarks suggest a prejudice against those without any 
              religious affiliation.</p>
              <p>The last census in 2000 showed that roughly 15 per cent of 
              Singaporeans did not have any religious affiliation.</p>
              <p>The article essentially suggested that this group, 'the 
              godless', are cynical and prone to violence.</p>
              <p>As a society for non-believers, the Humanist Society 
              (Singapore) disagrees.</p>
              <p>The reality in societies everywhere is that there is no 
              difference between non-believing youth and the religious youth in their 
              propensity towards violence. There are actually higher levels of 
              violence among those who identify themselves as 'religious' or 
              'faithful'.</p>
              <p>As for cynicism, there is certainly no correlation between 
              non-belief and a cynical attitude. Many non-believers are involved in 
              the world around them, trying to make it a more humane, compassionate 
              place.</p>
              <p>The two largest charitable donations in the history of the 
              world were by atheists: American investor Warren Buffett and his fellow 
              American Bill Gates of Microsoft donated US$30 billion (S$39 billion) 
              and US$11 billion respectively to the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation,
               a charitable organisation whose main goals are to enhance health care 
              and reduce poverty worldwide.</p>
              <p>I know of many non-believers, people who identify themselves
               as humanists, atheists and agnostics, who regularly donate to charity. 
              Many also do volunteer work for humanitarian causes.</p>
              <p>One does not need to have a religion to lead a good, happy 
              and meaningful life and to have compassion for our fellow human beings.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Help youth with no strings attached</h1>
              <p>THE Saturday Special report last week ('God wants youth') may not sit 
              well with those without religious affiliations.</p>
              <h1 class="storyheadline"></h1>
              <p>The bad behaviour of many of our youth probably stem from a 
              combination of relentless peer influence and inadequate supervision by 
              their parents or guardians.</p>
              <p>This is a social problem and it is presumptuous to suppose 
              that their plight is a consequence of straying from any celestial being 
              and that it can be solved by divine intervention.</p>
              <p>The report also gives the impression that godlessness is bad
               and is responsible for much of the trouble with our youth. It also 
              suggests that something is not quite right with youth who do not believe
               in a god and must be saved by the mere act of surrendering themselves 
              to a faith.</p>
              <p>Nothing is farther from the truth.</p>
              <p>The growing number of secular humanists in the world is 
              testimony to the belief that we all can be moral and lead happy and 
              fulfilling lives without belief in a god or dogma.</p>
              <p>Mankind is forever indebted to this group, especially the 
              scientists, who have helped their fellowmen conquer ignorance and fear, 
              and taught them to better understand the world. I laud the efforts of 
              the various faiths to lure troubled youth away from self-destructive 
              behaviour.</p>
              <p>If such programmes can be implemented successfully without 
              proselytising them, well and good. Otherwise, they will be viewed only 
              as nothing more than surreptitious attempts at conversion, which is not 
              so good.</p>
              <p>Let's extend a sincere gesture to help them turn their lives
               around with no strings attached.</p>
              <p>What we must not do is mislead them into believing that a 
              deity will save them. Like the rest of us, they must make an effort to 
              save themselves.</p>
