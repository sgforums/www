              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;">THE former chief
              executive of the Housing and Development Board and the Urban
              Redevelopment Authority, Dr Liu Thai Ker, confidently said that
              "the quality of life in Singapore will not be affected even if the
              population were to hit 7.5 million people" ("S'pore has room for
              7.5m people: Ex-HDB chief", Sept 9).<br> <br> His optimism appears to be underpinned mainly on the premise that
              "since we have planned for 5.5 million people (in the Singapore
              Concept Plan 1991), if we increase to, say, 6, 6.2 million, I think
              that additional 10 to 12 per cent will not make a huge
              difference".<br> <br> However, 7.5 million people is a whopping 36 per cent increase and
              elasticity must surely have its limits, with an eventual snapping
              point, which could have disastrous repercussions and
              consequences.<br> <br> Dr Liu's experience in the housing sector may have blinkered him
              into thinking only of providing accommodation for any increase in
              numbers.<br> <br> A 50-storey block of flats would, of course, be able to house
              double the number of a 25-storey one but would it be possible to
              provide the necessary corresponding infrastructure and supporting
              facilities as well to ensure that "the quality of life in Singapore
              will not be affected"?<br> <br> That is debatable, despite Dr Liu's lecture on "the importance of
              urban planning". As that well-known phrase goes: "The best-laid
              plans of mice and men oft go awry" and so too do theoretical
              calculations and projections.<br> <br> For example, the less-than-3 million population in the early '90s
              has burgeoned to more than 5 million today but, despite the many
              improvements, public transport is not the projected breeze.<br> <br> The MRT stations were designed so that a very definite six-coach
