              <p>by Jeremy Au Yong</p>
              <p>A FULL-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces has been 
                      detained under the Internal Security Act, said a statement from the 
                      Ministry of Home Affairs on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid, 20, had become self-radicalised 
                      after searching the Internet for jihadist propaganda and videos.</p>
              <p>He was influenced by the teachings of radical clerics posted
                       online 'and became convinced that it was his religious duty to 
                      undertake armed jihad alongside fellow militants and strive for 
                      martyrdom,' said a statement from MHA.</p>
              <p>Fadil initiated communication with radical cleric Anwar 
                      Al-Awlaki and expressed a desire to undertake militant jihad in places 
                      like Palestine, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was detained on April 4.</p>
              <p>Two other Singaporeans - Muhammad Anwar Jailani, 44, and 
                      Muhammad Thahir bin Shaik Dawood, 27 - were also placed on Restriction 
                      Orders for two years from June 23, added the MHA statement.</p>
              <p>Separately, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) member Ibrahim Mohd Noor 
                      was released on a Suspension Direction under the ISA on June 1.</p>
              <p>Ibrahim, a trained operative, fled Singapore in December 
                      2001 following the arrests of Singapore JI members in an ISD security 
                      operation, but was arrested and detained under the ISA in April 2007 in a
                       joint operation with a regional security agency.</p>
              <p>'He had cooperated in investigations and shown significant 
                      progress in his rehabilitation. He was assessed to no longer pose a 
                      security threat that required preventive detention,' said MHA.</p>

              <p><strong>20-year-old self-radicalised S'porean detained under ISA</strong><br> <span class="update">By Mustafa Shafawi &amp; Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 06 July 2010 1614 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Authorities have arrested a self-radicalised 
              Singaporean under the Internal Security Act (ISA) and put two others 
              under Restriction Orders.
              <br> <br> 20-year-old Muhammad Fadil Abdul Hamid was detained on April 4. He is a 
              full-time national serviceman in the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) who 
              drew most of his ideas from the Internet.
              <br> <br> Singapore's Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said Muhd Fadil avidly surfed
               the Internet in search of jihadist propaganda and videos when he was 
              studying in a local polytechnic.
              <br> <br> Over time, the ministry said, he became deeply radicalised by the 
              lectures of radical ideologues such as Sheikh Feiz Muhammad and Anwar 
              al-Awlaki.
              <br> <br> Muhd Fadil then became convinced that it was his religious duty to 
              undertake armed jihad alongside fellow militants.
              <br> <br> To undertake militant jihad overseas, Muhd Fadil went online to search 
              for information on bomb-making.
              <br> <br> He also produced and posted a video glorifying martyrdom and justifying 
              suicide bombing.
              <br> <br> The MHA said that Fadil did not have any plans to undertake 
              jihad-related activities in Singapore but to pursue them in places like 
              Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq.
              <br> <br> Responding to media queries, Singapore's Defence Ministry said Muhd 
              Fadil was an NSF trainee undergoing section leader training in Pasir 
              Laba Camp at the point of his arrest.
              <br> <br> It added investigations have shown that this case involves an individual
               who took the wrong path.
              <br> <br> The ministry said at the national level, there are appropriate security 
              processes and systems to monitor and guard against potential security 
              threats.
              <br> <br> Separately, two others have been placed on two-year Restriction Orders.
              <br> <br> They are 44-year-old Muhammad Anwar Jailani and 27-year-old Muhammad 
              Thahir Shaik Dawood. 
              <br> <br> The MHA said Muhd Anwar is an unaccredited religious teacher who had 
              distributed CDs containing Anwar al-Awlaki's lectures, calling on 
              Muslims to undertake militant jihad.
              <br> <br> Muhd Thahir, who runs a small business, was one of Muhd Anwar's 
              students.
              <br> <br> He travelled to Yemen to seek out Anwar al-Awlaki and other radicals 
              with a view to participating in armed jihad.
              <br> <br> While in Yemen, he however had doubts and was persuaded to drop his 
              jihad cause. - CNA /ls</span></p>
