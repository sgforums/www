              <p>Full of chinese people. Become a territory for them. Just "oh so uniform" is what makes it Singapore. Partners up with China's economy to make it's economy boost up for a little while. It  will boast its market to be SEA greatest with it's allied forces combined then will eventually crash because of the upcoming bubble burst. Oh well. But still. It will be filled with their people looking for jobs here and there as a result. Good or bad?</p>
              <p>Anyone kind enough to send me a msg in the future can tell me if I was right or wrong. I will accept either one. This one's kind of a fun topic heh.</p>

                  Morely likely scenario would be the West Malayisa unrest and
                  Philippines take the opportunity to 'free Sabah' while Sarawak hold
                  a consensus to declare independence Brother if you read history you
                  would realize that China does not invade but consolidate its
                  territories which means the disputed islands are as good as
                  theirs</p>

              China had invaded Tibet. I can't really blame the Israelis for being suspicious and distrustful towards the Arabs in the middle east. After 6 million Jews were executed in WW2 they have to protect themselves. That region before WW1 was under the Turkish Empire which was called the Ottoman Empire, an Islamic Empire. After WW1, that empire was dissected and divided by the Western powers to the Arabs for the monopoly of oil. In my opinion, maybe China would like to have a greater influence in the south east region...create a new world order with Russia....spratly islands dispute is the beginning of their plans...they don't even respect ASEAN organisation request for a code of conduct to settle that spratly islands dispute instead they build military base on thos islands...they even try to influence the African continent and South America...Russia and China have a new world bank for third world countries which is going to be compatible to IMF which is under the control of western countries. My opinion as long China is reign by the Communist Party....they can always do like what they did to Tibet...by the way they are also good at propaganda and monopoly...like Cambodia and probably Myanmar too.
