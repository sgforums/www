              More retirement homes with nursing facilities. Freedom of movement. They could live there  and work / volunteer to help the needy there or simply retire and do whatever they want to do plus they could have companionship/friends while they are there. They would not be lonely. No need to sell their flats but instead rent out their flats for their monthly income plus payment for their retirement accommodations/nursing treatment. For volunteers free accommodation while helping the needy there. Those who are bed ridden, an administrator need to be appointed to manage their flat/estate/finance. No need to stay with their children and burdening them. The old singles or old couples are given options to choose how to live their life hence they are more independent then having to depend on their married children for financial support. Their children could visit them during their free time or bring them home to spend time with their family.
              
              However, this could only be successful if the retirement homes are manage by the Government.
              
              I hope to see more elderly people to be more independent financially/happier with the existence of Retirement Homes.

              For many young Singaporeans, studying or working abroad would give them good status and respect in Singapore society. And it shall remain so in the future. It is their aspiration and goal to succeed in their lives abroad. Once they are abroad, they see many opportunities. They learn to adjust and adapt their lives abroad. 
              
              It has been known since in the 19th century, 80% to 90% of migrant/foreign workers went back to their own countries after living in Singapore for many years. Now and in the future, Foreigners who are a new citizens in Singapore will return to their own countries or migrate to other countries after living in Singapore for many years. 
              
              Then new breeds of foreigners from all over the world will come to Singapore to replace those Singaporeans and foreign workers who had left Singapore for good.

              <p>This is how I see Singapore in the future:</p>
              <p>Well, first off, education. Me, as a student, would want to see even more improvements in schools. The major problem is the time. Schools in the US have pushed back their reporting time to around 10 am. And the result is that students are more alert and energetic during school hours than compared to students waking up around 6 am and start school at 7. Although the time change isn't major, a few studies says that it is a very effective way to help students focus more in school. And some study even suggests that students should sleep in on school days.</p>
              <p>Secondly, political and social views. Only 20% of Singapore's population are pure Singaporeans. Because of Singapore's rapid growth, they need more manpower in defending the country and in other parts of the governmental sectors. Plus, to add in another factor, pure Singaporeans' birth rates has been decreasing tremendously these past few years. Thus, the government would want to let in more foreigners. Pure Singaporeans will then rebel and go against the idea and thus fights would start and the people's opinions would change.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, Singapore's economy. Since these few years, the world economy has been very bad. I predict that Singapore's economy would also go down. There is a major sign already in front of us. In latest news, <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/business/psa-international-s-full/2615902.html">Singapore's PSA International's net profit went 9.8% lower</a>.</p>
              <p>There are many things that can be predicted. Whether or not the government wants it to happen, it's up to the citizens to decide.</p>
