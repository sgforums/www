              Hmmm....
              
              My sister-in-law was from Hong Kong. She and her mother migrated here in the 70s I think. Now she and my elder brother migrated to Canada.
              
              My other sister-in-law was from Thailand, ChangMai. My second elder brother married her in the 80s. My niece was born in Singapore. And 5 years ago the whole family migrated to Thailand, ChangMai. My niece is studying Medicine in the University of Bangkok now.
              
              I think for foreigners who are living in Singapore....well...you have to wait maybe 20 to 30 years down the road to really see whether you can stay in Singapore forever...

              <p>As Singapore invests in smart technologies to become a smart nation, the government must ensure that the people continue to have employment opportunities in the country, even as technology replaces labour.</p>
                              
                              <p>Like all countries, we must ensure that even as we globalise, we must not forget our roots and lose our cultures. Language is the key. We should make Chinese, Malay and Tamil as our first languages, and English as our second language - instead of the other way round. Community events (in school, it's PE, morning assembly, concerts/celebrations/events) can be English-Medium, while the academic subjects of Math, Science and Arts can be in Chinese, Malay and Tamil. This way, we can have social integration, and recognise our roots and strengthen our cultures at the same time.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Those who lived in Singapore long enough (i.e. 10 years) will get to know that Singapore is not a sustainable place to live for life. <br><br>Singapore is a good city for expats and foreigners to live for a short while to accumulate wealth and experience in a highly economic environment. However once they accumualted enough wealth and experience, they will leave for other cities, probably to less expensive cities to retire or start a family after enhacing their wealth in other countries based on their accumulated strong Sing dollar wealth. <br><br>Cities, especially those that are already overcrowded and too expensive to live in, will see more brain drain and human resources losses once they rapidly achieve their tipping points. <br>Thus if the relentless plan to go towards 6.9 million people is forced to achieved within the next 15 years, it will not bonde well for the country. The younger generation will feel more frustrated because their monetary wealth gets smaller in value. Getting a car and a flat will be even more expensive and difficult for them and aspirations for the younger generations will continue to diminish. <br>The younger school children will feel even more competitive with the bigger population and have a higher tendacy to become the lower tranche of the education system if they do not work hard enough and thus be even more stressed to work even harder. Think of a tank filled with prawns. Those swim hard enough will be swiming near the surfaces. Those who don't will lie dead at the bottom of the tank and these formed the majority of the base of the hierarchy. <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15.2px; line-height: 19.696px;">Probably it is good that the younger generation starts to venture overseas opportunities after garduate or during university studies. Overpopulation is never a good thing to sustain for long.</span><br>The elderly generation, I think the situation won't be any better. It will be very expensive to retire and pay off your medical bills for the future elderly. Their CPF and monthly incomes will probably be wiped out by higher medical costs and costs of living in future. <br><br>And as the global food yield changes and reduces in future due to changing climates and increasing global population, the basic needs is going to be very expensive. Thus I see no need to even increase the population now because the global population will reach its peak by 2050 to about 10 billion before it goes to a decline (the numbers I believe might even be lower to 7.5 million if food, water and resources becomes more scrace in the near future). So I think aiming 6.9 million people by 2060 will be a more sustainable choice for Singapore to continue to grow at a steady and sustainable pace for its long term survival and allow generations of Singaporeans to continue to live life with aspirations and compete in a sustainable competitive environment, and not a surpressing one.</p>

              <p>I think it's already happening. Countries like New Zealand and Malaysia are beginning to welcome Singaporeans to migrate there, citing attractive reasons like more living spaces, less stressful lifestyles, etc. <br><br>If they have the opportunity, why not?</p>

              He said, "Joe, you know. The land in Singapore doesn't belong to the Government only. It also belong to the people of Singapore. Without the people there is no Government.

              <p>Today, a foreigner spoke to me something about the Singapore
              Government. He has been living in Singapore for 20 years now.</p>
              <p>He said, “Joe, you know. The land in Singapore doesn’t belong to
              the Government only. It also belong to the people of Singapore.
              Without the people there is no Government. And the people has the
              right to say something about it but they don’t, why? I’m sorry,
              your Government is <span>GREEDY</span>!”</p>
              <p>This is not the first time I have received such a remark from
              foreigners living in Singapore and foreigners from abroad.</p>
              <p><span>FOREIGNERS LIVING IN SINGAPORE AND FOREIGNERS

              <p>Have to really agree on this.</p>
              <p>Even foreigners are able to see the whole picture. This government is really about greed, wealth and power. Their greed for their million dollars ministerial salaries, increasing population numbers and taking more from the people with increasing costs of living. And making the lives of Singaporeans worse off in the recent years. </p>
              <p>Just look at the costs of living that increases barely a year after the GE. This is not the first time, but repeated cycles for decades that causes costs of living to surge so high in just a decade.</p>
              <p>But sadly, there are still many dumb and ignorant Singaporeans who don't see or refuse to see that the country is going downwards because of this government. </p>
              <p>I see no future here for the future generations. It's going to get worse for them in future. If you really care about the future generations, stop having kids or more kids, and let them become this government's future economic and political pawns. Stop listening to the Government calls for more kids to fulfill their greed for more people in this overcrowded small country. </p>

              Hmmm...maybe. Britain has shown a very good example to the First World Countries that having united as One Community Nation with the combination of Eastern Europe Countries was a disaster. In the past we had seen the collapse of U.S.S.R. and Yugoslavia. As for ASEAN Community, I see it like a joke and I don't think it's a strong group too. China is manipulating the South China Sea current issues and secretly telling the leaders of Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar what to do for the benefit of her own gains.
