              He knows is a bad idea but as a leader he has to show support to his subordinates for the public to see. Showing signs of disunity within the party to the public will not be good for them. This idea could be brought up by some members of the ruling party who aren't so sure whether he is good for the post or not. This is just to show he is doing his job. In 2011, the numbers was still great but I'm not sure for 2012. I'd already left and went into semi-retirement. If you want to see whether it is still a large number, if you are free just take a sit at the waiting area at WPSC at tanjung pagar complex work permit dept and EP employment pass dept at Boat Quay. You can see for yourself and judge from there.

              Precisely, that is my point. We carry weapons and given the right to shoot and kill in war. We can drink beers at NCO Club or SAFRA Club but yet they disallowed NS men to enter nightclubs or watch X rated movies. Thats funny isn't it.

              3 places come into my mind. Penang, Thailand and China.  Penang because I have friends there so understand from them both the cost and standard of living.  Thailand as I have Singaporean friends that actually retired there but for his cases it is more easier as he have a thai wife.  As china, because I had work and stay a period of time there (though it is not easy for foreigner to get a resident right in china).

              Good. If you retire in Malaysia, Penang, you will not have problems because Malaysia and Singapore have similar background, ethnics, languages and cultures. You can blend very nicely and you have to process your resident status there. About Thailand, I understand what you mean. My brother is also married to a Thai national too who became a Singaporean but now they have already migrated there with their daughter. There are many foreigners retired there too. About China, I have no idea and I've never been there either. 
              
              Whatever your decision, I wish you good luck. I think the best thing for you to do now if possible before you decide to retire in whichever country permanently, you must get familiar with the place and adapt with the environment there because its very much different from Singapore. So stay there for awhile and see whether you are ok with it. Through my own observation, I know many Singaporeans will not be able to totally retire in a rural kampung area. Usually, Singaporeans will adapt very well in an area just outside the cities or towns.
