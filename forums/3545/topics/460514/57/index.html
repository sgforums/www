              Based on my crystal ball,  on top of dealing with an ageing,  shrinking population and astronomical  medical cost,  we will be dealing with an ageing population because previously people only gave lip service about going green.  We did not heal the ills of the country  environmentally and socially. People at first minimum 2 ailments increased to minimum 5 ailments after medical treatment  (considered as the healthiest group of people) 
                  
                  Air pollutants  like smoking, burning of carcinogenic incense (regardless of religion), fogging, forest burning from neighbouring countries, spraying of anything,  so many people unknowingly use gas to cook had caused unborn fetus, children and healthy people to have chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases at an early age. 
                  
                  Cyber bullies kept using derogatory,  unkind words to kill their targeted victims indiscriminately causing many to commit suicide
                  
                  Patients with chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases  due to being poisoned by the air pollutants,  hidden food toxins,  hidden toxins found in prebiotic drinks like sugar and artifical colouring were prescribed with the medicine with multiple effects without  knowing they cannot treat poisoned bodies with more poisons. But the patients did not check the side effects first consuming are to be blamed too. 
                  
                  To avert this undesirable disaster, we have to do the right thing now:
                  1. Stop all the air pollutants including car emission
                  2. Stop all cyber bullies plus non cyber bullies by meting out harsher punishment so that you can warn potential bullies about the consequences 
                  3. People should avoid processed oil, processed salt and processed  sugar, artificial flavouring, GMO food, any hidden toxins like sulphite and nitrite in tidbits, hot dogs, etc. 
              4. Eat natural food like banana for natural salt and sugar,  scaly fish/unsalted nuts sparingly to get the natural oil
              5. Avoid eating or drinking man made,  modified products
              6. Empower the mind with knowledge in order to know the facts
              7. Stop blaming the wrong culprits for the health problem like family history,  eggs.  Basically all the health problems start during gestation.  Whatever food the pregnant  mother eat or drink plus air quality inhale will determine that foteus' medical fate in the future.  Growing up the child also eats whatever the mother feed. 
              8. Eat all the meals at regular intervals.  Skipped meals can cause chronic diseases. Dinner taken too late can cause acid reflux triggering cancers

              9. Since food,  drink and air quality are the root cause of all health problems,  in order to heal they must be tackled.  Therefore, the correct solution is eat what your body needs and not what you want to eat.  Don't sell carcinogenic products then people won't burn.  One smoker or one incense burner can harm multiple non smokers.  Foetuses and children whose immunity system are not fully developed  will end up with chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases later in their life. Some will end up getting chronic skin diseases  cancer at a very young age.  This explains why some kids get cancer even though there is no family history.   </code>
