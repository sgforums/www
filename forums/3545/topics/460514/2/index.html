            <div class='col-md body'>I see within 5 years from now, there are more Electric cars on the roads of Singapore after Malaysia. This is because it is more Environmental friendly. Singapore is small and electric cars is suitable for Singapore roads too. It is efficient, cost effective and cleaner.

              The death penalty sentence in Singapore has been amended and look into seriously. And I'm very pleased and happy about it. 
                  
              So now, I predict that in 2014, there will be an evolution of the Constitution Laws in Singapore. One of them is, Singaporean prison inmates will be allowed to vote too during Elections.

              <blockquote>
              <p>GOOD DAY, EVERYBODY. THIS MIGHT SEEM SUDDEN AND UNBELIEVABLE, BUT I'M ACTUALLY FROM THE FUTURE WHERE TIME-TRAVEL IS INVENTED. <br><br>MY NAME IS ALEXANDER ELMO MANKALI GORDON FERNANDEZ, AND I'M CAME BACK TO THE YEAR 2012 FROM 2063. I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE BORNED ON THIS VERY YEAR, EXACTLY TWO MONTHS FROM NOW. NOBODY SEEMS TO BELIEVE MY STORY AT ALL, BUT I HOPE THERE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BELIEVE ME. <br><br>BESIDE THE POINT, I'M HERE TO WARN ALL OF YOU OF THE FUTURE HAPPENINGS. BY YEAR 2049, THERE WILL BE A WAR. I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO DISCLOSE MUCH INFORMATION, AS THE SECRET SERVICES FROM THE FUTURE MIGHT COME AND ERADICATE ME. I'M TAKING THIS HUGE RISK TO SAVE ALL OF YOUR ASSES. SO PLEASE HEAR ME OUT.<br><br>BY YEAR 2022, A POLICY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED WHERE FOREIGNERS IN THIS VERY COUNTRY WILL BE GIVEN EXCLUSIVE LIVING AND WORK ENVIRONMENT. WHEREAS, THE LOCAL NETIZENS REMAIN IN THEIR CURRENT SITUATIONS, BE IT THEY ARE WELL-OFF OR POOR. OBVIOUSLY, THE LOCALS WERE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE UNFAIR TREATMENT, SO THEY STARTED TO REBEL AGAINST THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES. I WAS 10 YEARS OLD THEN, AND HAD NOT MUCH UNDERSTANDING IN POLITICS AND MUCH OF THE WORLD. THINGS BEGAN TO GET VIOLENT, AND THE HIGHER AUTHORITIES HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO IMPLEMENT MEASURES TO CONTROL THE SITUATION. THERE WERE RIOTS AND STRIKES EVERYWHERE, IT WAS SO AWFUL. I HAD BEEN STRIPPED OFF MY PRIVELEGE OF STUDYING IN A SCHOOL AS THE STAFFS ARE MOSTLY OUT IN THE REBELLION AND IT IS DANGEROUS TO EVEN STEP OUT ON THE STREETS. <br><br>THIS WENT ON UNTIL 2024, WHERE THE GOVERNANCE HAD ENOUGH OF ALL THE RUCKUS. THEY HAVE DECIDED TO FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE, AND COMPLETELY DICTATE THE ENTIRE STATE. THE MILITARY WERE SENT IN TO ELIMINATE THOSE WHO WERE IN THE REBELLION, WHETHER THEY ARE JUST ON STRIKE, OR INVOLVE IN VARIOUS RIOT ATTACKS. EVEN SOME INNOCENT PEOPLE HAS BEEN SHOT DEAD, I HAVE SEEN IT FROM MY HOUSE WINDOW.<br><br>YEAR 2026 CAME, AND IT WAS THE MOST DEVASTATING AND PAINFUL YEAR OF MY ENTIRE LIFE. THE WHOLE COUNTRY HAS BEEN UNDER THE COMPLETE DICTATORSHIP OF THE AUTHORITIES, AND THEY WILL SPARE NOBODY WHO HAS THE SLIGHTEST HINT OF DISATISFACTION AND DEFIANCE. IT WAS THAT VERY DAY, I SEEN MY FAMILY BEING TAKEN AWAY FROM ME AND I HAD NEVER SEEN THEM AGAIN EVERY SINCE. THEY WERE INNOCENT! I WAS ALL ALONE, AS EVEN MY HOME WAS SALVAGED AND TAKEN OVER BY THE AUTHORITY. <br><br>I SPENT 4 YEARS, RUNNING FROM TOWN TO TOWN IN FEAR, SEARCHING FOR SCRAPS OF LEFT OVER FOOD AND WATER FOR SURVIVAL. SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO SURVIVE MANY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS. IT HAS BEEN MADE SO THAT ANYONE WITHOUT A REGISTERED HOME ARE EITHER PUT TO SLEEP, OR CAPTURED AND BROUGHT TO SOMEPLACE WHICH I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY WILL DO TO US. I AVOIDED MANY CAPTURE ATTEMPTS AND LIVED THRU THE ENTIRE ORDEAL FOR FOUR WHOLE YEARS.<br><br>YEAR 2030, I FELT THAT I HAD ENOUGH OF RUNNING, SO I DECIDED TO LEAVE THE STATE. WHEN I WENT TO THE BORDERS, I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE SO MANY BORDER PATROLS, HEAVILY ARMED. I GUESS THEY DO NOT WANT PEOPLE LEAVING THE COUNTRY. BUT I HAD NO CHOICE. I HAD JUST ENOUGH. I JUMPED INTO AN EMPTY MOTOR NITROS BOAT AND SPED AWAY. BEFORE I KNOW IT, THERE WERE SOUND OF GUNFIRE SHOOTING AT ME. IT'S QUITE STRANGE THAT THE PATROL UNITS ARE USING SUCH OUTDATED GUNS. I PRESUMED THE DICTATORS HAVE BEEN INDULGING THEMSELVES WITH THEIR PERSONAL PLEASURES, RATHER THAN PLACE THE EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE INTERNAL SECURITY. THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST ARM THEM WITH HIGHER TIER TECHNOLOGIES, LIKE THE LASER GUNS AND TASER SNIPER RIFLES. WELL, BUT I GUESS THOSE LAYBACK GUNS WOULD HAVE SUFFICED AS THE STARTED FIRING AT ME, I TOOK A FEW BULLETS AND I FELL INTO THE SEA.<br><br>THE NEXT THING I KNEW, I AWAKEN IN EHWAHEHWAHEHWAH (PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS MALAYSIA, MANY YEARS BACK). IT WAS A MIRACLE THAT I MANAGED TO SURVIVE, BUT MY ABDOMEN HURTS, AS I CAN FEEL THE STING OF THE BULLET IN MY BODY. I LIMP TO THE NEAREST TOWN AND DECIDED SPENT THE REST OF MY LIFE THERE, SCAVENGERING FOR FOOD. FORTUNATELY, I WAS TAKEN IN BY A POOR FAMILY, AND LIVE OFF WITH PLAIN BREAD AND WATER EVERYDAY. THIS ALL HAPPENED, UNTIL YEAR 2063, WHERE I WENT DECIDED TO GO BACK TO MY HOMELAND AND SEE THE SITUATION.<br><br>I HAVE KNOWN THAT TIME TRAVEL IS INVENTED, BUT STORED IN A HIGHLY GUARDED PLACE. OKAY, SO I SNUCK IN AND STOLE ONE. I DON'T WANT TO EXPLAIN IN DETAILS, LET'S JUST SAY I GOT LUCKY. <br><br>THAT'S THE REASON I'M HERE. OKAY? SO, IF YOU HAVE AN ENQUIRIES REGARDING THE FUTURE, JUST ASK AWAY. IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE.<br><br>RIGHT NOW I JUST WANT TO FIND MY FAMILY, AND TAKE THEM AWAY AT ALL MEANS.</p>

              I just want to say this, it will be like when E. Germany and W. Germany were reunited again. It will take time to heal the people of Korea and the world would try to help United Korea. However, this outcome depends on the N. Korean whether they want to be a Korea with Democratic policies. Communism in N.Korea has been supported by China and they are close allies...like big brother and small brother. So, the small brother will listens to the big brother. The coming US Presidential Election result would be an important issue for PRC and N.Korea. Depending who will become the US President. If it is Mitt Romney....there would be alot of Foreign Policies changes for the US...and it is quite frightening to see Mitt Romney to become the next US President...especially for China and Iran. So since I'm here, I will predict that if Mitt Romney wins the coming US Presidential in Nov 2012 and becomes the next US President, Singapore Economy will be affected very badly.

              What do you want Singapore to be like in 2022?
              By Jeanette Tan | Yahoo! Newsroom â€“ Sat, Oct 20, 2012
              
              How do you want Singapore to be governed in 2022? What kind of Singapore do you want to live in, 10 years from now?
              
              These were the questions asked of 140 Singaporeans in a series of workshops between June and August organised by the Institute of Policy Studies.
              
              From their answers, three possible and plausible versions of Singaporeâ€™s future were mapped out.
              
              During a briefing on Thursday held at the National University of Singapore, IPS said the Prism Scenarios project aims to get Singaporeans thinking about the kind of Singapore they want to live in a decade from this year, and also to start talking about how they would like their country to be governed.
              
              â€œ(The Prism Scenarios are about) reperceiving, thinking afresh, challenging ourselves and trying to look at the big picture of Singapore in 2022,â€� said IPS senior research fellow Gillian Koh, who leads the project, the first of its kind to be done here.
              
              Participants came together from varying sectors and industries - young Singaporeans, new citizens, civil society, the arts, culture and media, academics and public intellectuals, business people and members of the public sector.
              
              From the project, three possible scenarios - or prisms - of Singapore were constructed: they were called SingaStore.com, SingaGives.gov and WikiCity.sg.
              
              Under SingaStore, the government focuses on economic growth, ensuring that its social and economic policies are primarily pro-business.
              
              Driven by a strong sense of trust in the credibility of the government, as well as a material definition of success, the government bestows the best rewards for the cream of the crop to constantly help the most promising talent go furthest.
              
              At the same time, generous assistance in the form of vouchers, surplus-sharing programmes and insurance schemes is available to the needy, quite like the way it is done today.
              
              In SingaGives, a new government is imagined - one that is formed by a splinter group from within the former ruling party that focuses on developing a more equal policy framework, which heavily subsidises goods like healthcare, education and housing.
              
              Social safety nets are also strengthened and made accessible to all, regardless of income level or potential, made possible by spending a larger percentage of investment returns on the national reserves than in the past.
              
              Foreigners working in Singapore are also treated with equal dignity, but fewer people are admitted because residents here have become more productive and self-reliant. Growth will be lower in this scenario, though.
              
              In WikiCity, there is no central power because in this world, political unhappiness from a government that was disconnected from ground sentiment resulted in a low level of trust among the people.
              
              The state looks after foreign relations, trade and law and order, while keeping taxes and regulations as light as possible, much like the way the British ran Singapore in the 1960s.
              
              Because of this, though, communities are independently formed to help one another and provide essential services and assistance. International companies will withdraw their investments due to the instability but high net worth individuals who settled abroad will return to invest in promising enterprises and spare productive capacity here.
              
              The three scenarios will be presented in an interactive arts exhibition that Singaporeans will be invited to participate in and experience over the second and third weeks of November, and their thoughts from their experience will be measured in surveys, the findings of which will later be presented at a conference in January next year.
              
              With a target of roughly 3,000 respondents and participants from the public, the experience and surveys can also be done online, IPS director Janadas Devan said the team is not trying to determine which scenario is the most popular one with Singaporeans but more to start the thinking process, as an accidental complement to the ongoing Singapore Conversation.
              
              â€œThe aim would be to ask both the people who took part in the process as well as the immersive arts experience to pause and ponder - there is no conclusion in mind, there is no end in mind, just these are the scenarios, these are the possibilities, take them into account and consider the possibilities,â€� he said.

              Govt can support but must not end up doing too much: Minister of State Lawrence Wong
              By Deborah Choo | Yahoo! Newsroom â€“ Fri, Oct 19, 2012
                  
                  
              The government will support bottom-up youth initiatives but doing too much may end up being counter-productive, said Senior Minister of State Lawrence Wong. 
                  
              Speaking to 60 youths during a forum at The Colonial @ Scotts on Thursday evening, Wong said the government is looking at empowering youths to find their own solutions, especially as the country strives forward to build and debate a more inclusive, caring society as part of the Singapore Conversation.
                  
              â€œWe, from the ministry itself â€“ from the governmentâ€™s point of view â€“ would like to facilitate, would like to encourage, motivate. What we can do is perhaps connect the groups together, help them find synergies among themselves, provide resources â€“ these are things we can do for them,â€� said Wong, who is also the chairman of the National Youth Council. 
                  
              Wong cited the example of how National Youth Council building was transformed into a Hub Singapore cafÃ©, which now serves as a platform for social entrepreneurs to gather. 
                  
              The minister called this building an â€œeco-systemâ€�.

              Ok cool. I visited the site. Hmmm...quite interesting feel like joining them and order a drink call 'Ticket To The Moon' which you can find in Bali and it can really make you see the future I guess. Its a mix of mushroom which the Balinese called Magic Mushroom. I never tried it but I saw tourists that took that drink ended up being robbed. So don't drink that Ticket To The Moon drink when you visited Bali ok. Hey, thanks for the reference to EDMW link. I won't join them because I think having SG Forums is good enough for me because I have no time to get involved too many forums internationally and locally like I did in the past. You have a nice day Summer hill.
