              The bankruptcy and divorce rates amongst young Singaporeans will continue to rise simply because they have so much debts to pay. They have spend beyond their means to maintain their lavish lifestyle.
              
              One Malaysian worker told me this recently, "I know many Singaporeans are not happy and they stressful because they do not have enough money and they have so much debts to pay."

              Well, there is no longer off peak hours concession fares for senior and adult Singaporeans for MRT train rides. Only whole day fare is available.
              
              There will be an increase in concession cards cheating and abuse usage of the concession cards; and also for student and children passes.
              
              The adults will abuse using those passes by using senior concession cards or student cards or children cards :).
              
              The students will abuse using children cards :).
              
              There will be an increase of train rides fare jumpers too, especially amongst foreign workers :).

              In the past, during the 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s, going for Picnics, Camping, BBQ and Swimming at Changi Point Beach and East Coast Park Beach were very popular venues for outdoor activities.
                      
              Now, with the presence of salt water crocodiles or crocodiles within Singapore sea or rivers, it is quite alarming and dangerous for the public.
                      
              I recently spoke to a mother and she disallowed her children to swim in the sea because of the danger of salt water crocodiles presence. She said that the authority must do something about this danger and do not wait until someone get eaten up then they will do something about it.
                      
              I have to agree with her. We did not have crocodiles in Singapore water in the past except at the crocodile farms in Singapore.

              The old way of reading will come back and remain alive in people's life again.
                  
              More people will start reading hardcopy books, magazines, newspapers and etcs. These hardcopy reading materials will be more lasting and meaningful than smart phones and computers. You do not have to worry about charging the smart phones, data usage, wifi availability, the internet and cyber viruses. 
              
              Furthermore, the hardcopy reading materials can be shared to others and also can be given as gifts. It can be pass down from generation to generation. It can even survive in time through decades, centuries, hundred and thousand of years.
                  
              More passengers in the public transports will be seen reading hardcopy reading materials. It's a good sign :). And I'm one of them :).

              It has been quite sometimes now Singapore had any Air Raid and Food Rationing Exercises. We had that done frequently during the 80s.
              
              In the event of war, 
              
              1. Many Singaporeans would not know where are the nearest bomb shelters to seek for safety.
              
              2. I think many Singaporeans would be in confusion and probably they would also rush to the supermarkets, wet markets and provision shops to buy or steal whatever food they could for themselves and their families for survival.
              
              3. I think many Singaporeans too would try to get out from the country instead of staying back and defend their country, especially those who are wealthy and the politicians too would run with their family overseas to save their own families.
              
              4. Many parents too would not allow their sons to fight and defend the country because they do not want to see their sons get killed. One good example in peace time, many parents already worried too much about their sons safety during Military service in peace time....especially those with only one son...so how about during war time?

              There are security lapses at the MRT Stations.
              
              The security officers are only present from 7.30am to 8.30pm in all MRT Stations. This is because most of them are Malaysian security officers on work permits. They need to go home to Johor Bahru early everyday and wakeup early morning the next day for work. Most of them ended up sleeping while on duties.
              
              Security is the most important element for MRT stations and they should be present until the MRT stations are closed. Only a handful of Singaporean security officers are willing to work within the security industry. And in comparison to security officers in the Philippines and Indonesia, most security officers in the MRT Stations are physically unfit, old and mentally not motivated to do their job well.
              
              Malaysian / Singaporean security officers are afraid to stop the commuters and check commuterâ€™s bag because they are afraid of being scorned or scolded by the passengers. They are afraid of complains from the passengers.
              
              Should there be an attack on any MRT stations after all the Malaysian security officers went home, the first question come to mind to all Singaporeans isâ€¦.WHERE ARE THE SECURITY OFFICERS. WHY THERE ARE NO SECURITY OFFICERS PRESENCE AFTER 8.30 PM?
              
              These security lapses are a potential threat to Singaporeâ€™s security.

              At Singapore International Changi Airport, are the combine security force team (A police officer and three SAF soldiers) well trained in self defend and hand to hand combat while Patrolling within Changi Airport? They could easily be overpowered and killed by a season terrorist or terrorists. These terrorists could easily grab hold of those automatic weapons to launch their terror attacks within Changi Airport. The terrorists probably look at them like kids with weapons but are hapless and open to be attack anytime.
                          
              Imagine what would happen should this happen at Changi Airport.

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">Here are some of the cases caught from one station only. It was a random checked for a few hours only. It was not a hundred percent checked and only those who had tapped the gantry gate (that showed yellow light) were stopped upon exiting from the MRT station.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">10/1 - A female adult (Poly Student) was caught using Children pass (travel free)</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">13/1 - 1) A female adult student using her boyfriend's student pass. 2) A female student using children pass (travel free)</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">15/1 - A male working adult tailgating.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">18/1 - A female adult student using her brother's student pass.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">24/1 - 1) A working male adult using his mother's concession pass. 2) A male working adult using a Children pass (travel free).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">2/2 - A male working adult using his mother's concession pass.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;">All were Singaporean passengers. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 13.65px;"><span style="font-size: 13.65px;">Two SMRT staff were immediately terminated when they allowed a family member used their travel passes to travel free. This took place sometime last year in 2017. </span></p>
