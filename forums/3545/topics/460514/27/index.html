SS groups are very advance nowadays with members savvy in IT networks...like opening up cybercafe for illegal gambling in the internet..etcs...like shown in the Crime Watch programme..

              St John's Island
                  
              St John's Island, southern island, famous for having been a penal settlement but now a holiday resort.
                  
              St John's Island has a significant history tied to Singapore. Sir Stamford Raffles, sailing on the Indiana actually anchored off this island on 28 February 1819 before taking a small ketch to get to the shores of Singapore the next day. By February 1823, the island had the signal flagstaff moved there from Pulau Tambakul (Goa Island, then later renamed Peak Island). When hordes of immigrants began making their way to Singapore bringing not only wealth but sicknesses, St John's Island was the station for the "report boat" for the Marine Department (1823) to bring news of immigrants until the cholera epidemic of 1873 which saw 357 deaths prompted the Master Attendant, Henry Ellis to call for a lazaretto to be built at St John's. The plans included a floating police station, a hospital at St John's and a quarantine burial-ground sited at Peak Island. The lazaretto was completed in November 1874 at St John's, just in time it seems, to attend to more than 1,300 cholera-infected Chinese coolies brought in by the S. S. Milton. Victims of beri-beri were also brought into St John's lazaretto beginning in 1901. Such was the fame of St John's lazaretto, that by 1930, she had gained world recognition as a quarantine centre screening Asian immigrants and pilgrims returning from Mecca.
                  
              When the mass immigration was closed, the island was used to house detained political prisoners and ringleaders of secret societies. Later the holding areas were converted into a drug rehabilitation centre and in 1975, it became a holiday campsite popular with schools and students.
                  
              Currently, St John's is going through another major change. At least 1/3 of the island on the eastern end has been acquired by the Prisons' Department for the setting up of a Prison Detention Centre for illegal immigrants and drug addicts. The western end, on the other hand, has been given a facelift with the construction of the S$30 million Marine Aquaculture Centre where the marine research facilities would take another 1/3 of the island. The work on this, the first of Southeast Asia's deep-sea fish farm, which began in April 1997 is expected to finish in April 2000.

              Inmate Story's Introduction
                  
              Dear readers, my name is Jer, known as ''Ã�h Bee'' during my days in prison. I am  the founder of Singapore Prison Stories (SPS). I am an ex-convict who has served my jail term from July 2011 to August 2011. I was imprisoned in CPC (Changi Prison Complex) for a month, and served the remaining of my sentence under PPP (Home Detention Program). Throughout my 'short' two months of incarceration and the home detention program, I have come across and met a number of ex-convicts who have committed all types of offences. They shared with me their backgrounds and personal stories, all of which have taught me so much, and made me better understand and appreciate the meaning of life itself.
                  
              I sincerely hope that my life story here can actually help out any of you readers or the people around you. Think twice before you commit a crime and always be prepared to face the consequences â€“ jail time, caning, a fine, and even the social stigma when you are released. Committing a crime is always never a necessity, but an option. You have the power to choose.

              4.  Can I have a good conversation with my family/friends without my mobile phone?
              5.  Can I enjoy my holiday without my mobile phone?
              6.  Can I forget about my mobile phone?
              7.  Can I enjoy watching the television without my mobile phone?
              8.  Can I just off my mobile phone and don't bother about it.
              9.  Can I leave my mobile phone at home and go anywhere without it?
              10. Can I survive without any mobile phone?
                  
              If your answer is yes, then you are ok. If not, then you are letting your life being control by the mobile phone or internet world.

              <p>It is only a one time investment. No need to pay monthly fee as in Starhub Cable, Singnet Mio, M1 Box, Questwest.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">It can be as low as $39 to a high of $180 depending on the specifications.</span></p>
              <p>All and the latest movies, dramas, variety shows, cartoons etc can be watched on the big TV screen for FREE with a TV box.</p>
              <p>An android TV box is just like a mini pc eg surf the internet, play games, video chat, call and conference, download movies, music etc to be watched and listened later, take photo and video, use words, excel and powerpoints etc</p>

              ISRAEL BOLSTERS DEFENCES AMID SIGNS U.S. PREPARING SYRIAN STRIKE 
                  
              Israelâ€™s military bolstered its defences near the northern border and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned against any retaliatory attack on his country amid signs the U.S. is preparing to strike Syria over its alleged use of chemical weapons.
                      
              The moves come as Iran vows to retaliate to any strikes on Syria with an attack on Israel.
                      
              â€œIn case of a U.S. military strike against Syria, the flames of outrage of the regionâ€™s revolutionaries will point toward the Zionist regime,â€� Iranian MP Mansur Haqiqatpur told the Fars news agency.
                      
              With talk of war escalating, the prime minister sought to reassure Israelis they were in safe hands. â€œThere is no reason not to follow routine,â€� Netanyahu said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. â€œAt the same time, we are preparing for any scenario. The Israeli military is ready to protect the people of Israel and to respond forcefully against any threat.â€�
                      
              Military spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner said the government approved a â€œlimitedâ€� reserves call-up, primarily personnel from the air force, military intelligence and home front units. â€œRight now we are only calling up a few hundred, but have approval for more if needed. We are also deploying air defences as needed,â€� Lerner said, without elaborating.

              Syria allies: Why Russia, Iran and China are standing by the regime
                  
              (CNN) - Allegations of a chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime last week have heightened tensions internationally. There's been tough talk from Western leaders and a flurry of activity by the United States - all of which seem to suggest that a military strike against the regime could be in the offing.
                  
              But through it all, Syria seems to retain the support of some good friends.
                  
              Why do Russia, Iran and China continue to support a regime that's accused of slaughtering tens of thousands of civilians in the 2-year-old civil war?
                  
              Here's why.
