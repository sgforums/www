              <p>Good morning, my name is Aldora Chong, I am born on 30th October 2012.I am sorry that I lied about my birthdate on the forum registeration. I can't go any date further than my birthdate because the "matter will collasped" if I ever to have two self at the same timeline.<br><br>I here to warn of the things to to come. In 2026, North Korea and South will start a war, with China on North Korea side, and USA on south korea side. Other countries tried not to participate in the war until China and North Korea tried to take over Asia, invading Japan first. They suceed, and they managed to take over Singapore as well. However, millions died in the war and a virus plauged the military and civilian population. Meanwhile, USA gets attacked by internal terrorism and is unable to help it's allies in Asia.<br><br>I was 18 years old then, I was a life sciences student and was forced by the army to help out in their lab which involves developing biological weapons and mind control techiques.My family members was taken away from me and I do not know what happened to them. My father, my mother, and my 6-year old brother.<br><br>It was horrible. I personally killed several people with lethal injection. I don't want to kill anyone. I feel so guilty when I tied them down and forced chemicals into their bodies. From what I know, they were trying to find a cure for that virus and was trying to infect the opposing military.<br><br>But I had no choice. I will be their lab rat if I ever resist or even say "no" to their commands. There was very little food there and I have 2 meals per day. Simple vegetables and rice. No meat. I was lucky. Well, that's only because they need me. I have see women like me being raped and being experimented on by student surgeons but they need them desperately to treat their injurded soilders at India-Pakinstan border. <br><br>I do not know so much, I only know that a war did happen on 2026. Since then, I don't know anything about time as I spent my years in a lab full of virus and biological weapons and my watches and clocks were taken away from me.<br><br>Of course, during those time I spent there, I was interrograted to test my loyalty to the new "country" called Asia. Then, they began developing time travel. I studied along with them. They build a massive building, designed to create a wormhole on Earth itself. It was a success. They managed to learn so much military secrets that they managed to take over the world. (this is what I heard from my supervisor.)<br><br>But, I am feeling so guilty. I killed so many people, I have seen their tears streaming down their faces and begged me not to kill their children, and to killed them instead. My team of 6 even onced locked a family of 5 in a gas control room, we were trying to find out how much oxy-carbate gas it takes to kill a person. When one of the children collasped, the mother and father was trying to do CPR on them to keep them alive. Non of the family members survived.<br><br>I have decided to break away from the so called "Wonderful saviors medical team" and embarked on the time machine. I turn the clock to this day, knowing the facts of the time travel well enough that i cannot exist as a two entirely at a timeline. I am going to died on 30th October, 3 days later. I know that I am never gonna survived and even if the futuristic soilders did find me, I will be send to the death camps anyway. <br><br>I am here to stop the scary future. Please understand and read the text above. Thank you<br><br>- Aldora Chong</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting Summer hill. Yeah, I read her posting in the internet. She said she was born on 30th Oct 2012 and she can't travel back in time beyond that....I'm just wondering how she managed to post her message on 27th Oct 2012...if she can't travel back in time beyond her birthdate and the matter would collapsed if she did so because having 2 selves presence at the same year. Anyway, take a lookout for any news pertaining to unknown young woman approximately about 14 years of age found dead in Singapore. It could be Aldora Wong. Anyway, the good news is she will be 'reincarnated' and born again on 30th Oct 2012 in Singapore. Thanks Summer hill for sharing Aldora Wong message with us.</div>

              Albert Einstein and the Fabric of Time 
              
              Surprising as it may be to most non-scientists and even to some scientists, Albert Einstein concluded in his later years that the past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. In 1952, in his book Relativity, in discussing Minkowski's Space World interpretation of his theory of relativity, Einstein writes:
              
              Since there exists in this four dimensional structure [space-time] no longer any sections which represent "now" objectively, the concepts of happening and becoming are indeed not completely suspended, but yet complicated. It appears therefore more natural to think of physical reality as a four dimensional existence, instead of, as hitherto, the evolution of a three dimensional existence.
              
              Einstein's belief in an undivided solid reality was clear to him, so much so that he completely rejected the separation we experience as the moment of now. He believed there is no true division between past and future, there is rather a single existence. His most descriptive testimony to this faith came when his lifelong friend Besso died. Einstein wrote a letter to Besso's family, saying that although Besso had preceded him in death it was of no consequence, "...for us physicists believe the separation between past, present, and future is only an illusion, although a convincing one."
              
              Most everyone knows that Einstein proved that time is relative, not absolute as Newton claimed. With the proper technology, such as a very fast spaceship, one person is able to experience several days while another person simultaneously experiences only a few hours or minutes. The same two people can meet up again, one having experienced days or even years while the other has only experienced minutes. The person in the spaceship only needs to travel near to the speed of light. The faster they travel, the slower their time will pass relative to someone planted firmly on the Earth. If they were able to travel at the speed of light, their time would cease completely and they would only exist trapped in timelessness. Einstein could hardly believe there were physicists who didnÃ¢â¬â¢t believe in timelessness, and yet the wisdom of Einstein's convictions had very little impact on cosmology or science in general. The majority of physicists have been slow to give up the ordinary assumptions we make about time.
              
              The two most highly recognized physicists since Einstein made similar conclusions and even made dramatic advances toward a timeless perspective of the universe, yet they also were unable to change the temporal mentality ingrained in the mainstream of physics and society. Einstein was followed in history by the colorful and brilliant Richard Feynman. Feynman developed the most effective and explanatory interpretation of quantum mechanics that had yet been developed, known today as Sum over Histories.
              
              Just as Einstein's own Relativity Theory led Einstein to reject time, FeynmanÃ¢â¬â¢s Sum over Histories theory led him to describe time simply as a direction in space. FeynmanÃ¢â¬â¢s theory states that the probability of an event is determined by summing together all the possible histories of that event. For example, for a particle moving from point A to B we imagine the particle traveling every possible path, curved paths, oscillating paths, squiggly paths, even backward in time and forward in time paths. Each path has an amplitude, and when summed the vast majority of all these amplitudes add up to zero, and all that remains is the comparably few histories that abide by the laws and forces of nature. Sum over histories indicates the direction of our ordinary clock time is simply a path in space which is more probable than the more exotic directions time might have taken otherwise.
              
              Other worlds are just other directions in space, some less probable, some equally as probable as the one direction we experience. And some times our world represents the unlikely path. Feynman's summing of all possible histories could be described as the first timeless description of a multitude of space-time worlds all existing simultaneously. In a recent paper entitled Cosmology From the Top Down, Professor Stephen Hawking of Cambridge writes; Ã¢â¬ÅSome people make a great mystery of the multi universe, or the Many-Worlds interpretation of quantum theory, but to me, these are just different expressions of the Feynman path integral.Ã¢â¬ï¿½  
              
              (below is not in book)
              
              What is still not quite resolved in modern physics is how to properly combine Quantum theory with Einstein's Relativity Theory. It appears evident that time is purely a direction in space but how then do we explain the uncertainty of quantum mechanics? Why does it appear that God plays dice with the world. The two theories, each having been proven by their usefulness, do of course tell the same story about this one universe, but we just haven't learned yet to hear the story right. The best modern theory going is probably the No Boundary Proposal, put fourth by Stephen Hawking and Jim Hartle. This theory introduces a second reference of time which has been inappropriately named Imaginary time. Hawking, writes of the no boundary proposal, "The universe would be completely self contained and not affected by anything outside itself. It would neither be created nor destroyed. It would just BE." 
              
              In my book Everything Forever, and here at my website, I explain how fourth dimensional spatial directions travel through a series of independent three dimensional block-like spaces, which in science we call states, but  they can also be thought of simply as patterns. Hawking has already proposed that imaginary time can be found at right angles to ordinary time. I further explain that it is possible in an objective way to understand the universe to be like a book or a movie film. Each moment is a separate universe just like each frame of a movie or page of a book is separate. Yet those separate states simultaneously form the larger whole of the movie or the book. Seeing each moment as a continually existing place sheds light on why particles would then travel as a quantum wave, rather than linearly from point a to point b. This is explained better elsewhere, but if each moment of ordinary time is a solid, static, "block of now", or field of space, then time each new moment is a distinctly different universe. What we call time is a spatial direction that travels through many static three dimensional universes. 
              
              In such a model, what we call time is created purely out of space. Special directions in space travel through each static three dimensional space, therein producing a new realm of space beyond three dimensions, which we call time. The interesting quality this produces, is how the inhabitants of this fourth dimension of space travel a linear path from past to future, but the surrounding environment of each path is shifting from one pattern to the next. This sends particles from one position in four dimensional space to the next without moving linearly. As a result, each individual observer in the fourth dimension experiences a continuous linear time, even though everything in their immediate environment is moving sequentially from place to place. Hence each temporal environment of four dimensional space is constructed relative to each independent observer.
              
              One can imagine oneself smoothly traveling a direct and interconnected path through time, but in looking around at one's environment, one sees that all other directions of time are broken, causing particles to appear to sequentially leap from one place to another. Paradoxically, everyone observes their own path and experience of time to be linear, while all else around them is sequential. In fact, when we explore time as a direction through many 3D spaces, we find qualities of curvature, time dilation, and spatial contraction, precisely as relativity describes those qualities within our own spacetime.
              
              There is one quote I have found from Einstein which is more or less a contemplative mental thought about the notion of infinite spaces, which doesn't directly relate to my own approach of describing a shape to all possible spaces, but it does at least open up the subject of an infinite number of spaces to speculation. And it also shows the open minded nature of Einstein's thoughts about empty space, which some have thought were closed.
              
              When a smaller box s is situated, relativity at rest, inside the hollow space of a larger box S, then the hollow space of s is a part of the hollow space of S, and the same "space," which contains both of them, belongs to each of the boxes. When s is in motion with respect to S, however, the concept is less simple. One is then inclined to think that s encloses always the same space, but a variable part of the space S. It then becomes necessary to apportion to each box its particular space, not thought of as bounded, and assume that these two spaces are in motion with respect to each other...
              
              Before one has become aware of this complication, space appears as an unbounded medium or container in which material objects swim around. But it must be remembered that there is an infinite number of spaces, which are in motion with respect to each other... 
              
              The concept of space as something existing objectively and independent of things belongs to pre-scientific thought, but not so the idea of the existence of an infinite number of spaces in motion relatively to each other. This latter idea is indeed unavoidable, but is far from having played a considerable role even in scientific thought.
              
              I can testify that Einstein's speculations revealed here concerning infinite spaces in motion do at least carry us in the right direction in how they suggest space might have an unseen and possibly infinite content. Similar ideas were introduced by David Bohm, who claimed there are two kinds of order in nature, what he called explicate order and implicate order. Implicate order for Bohm was a way of acknowledging how quantum mechanics reveals a hidden order where our world is influenced by the whole of all possible states. However, that order is much more visible than Bohm ever realized, as explained in part two. 
              
              Unfortunately it wasn't until Einstein died that scientists began to consider the a Many Worlds Theory in science. It's safe to say that in Einstein's time we were still getting used to the idea of the Big Bang, adjusting to the ever more visible vast sea of other galaxies, and the possibility of alien life on other planets. The universe and reality were still primarily considered purely solid and material based. Quantum theory, which eventually led to the theory of many worlds, had not yet fully withstood the test of time. Einstein even rejected its implications, saying "God does not play dice" with the world, even as he himself established that there is more to the universe than a single evolving moment of now. 
              
              In my explorations of timelessness I reveal that ordinary space is not merely full of other empty spaces, but empty space is actually the whole of all physical realities; all the universes of the many worlds theory. Profound as it may be, if the theories I propose are correct, space is full, rather than empty. Material things are less than the fullness of space. In fact, it may be that space must include all possibilities in order to seem empty to us. So in summary, the universe we see is just a fragment nested in a timeless (everything) whole, rather than a single material world magically arisen above some primordial nothing. All universes exist without beginning or end in the ultimate arena of time, and each moment we experience exists forever.

              Parallel Universes Theory : The Basics
              
              Parallel Universes 
              
              As the human population lives longer and longer on planet Earth, we continually discover more and more about our universe. Many once thought the Earth was flat; sail your shallop too far and off you drop into oblivion. As our quest for knowledge took to the skies, the thought that we were the center of the universe prevailed. The more we learn, the more we realize how much we truly donÃ¢â¬â¢t know. Many scientists believe in the big bang theory, in that the universe was created by the reaction of things moving outward after a huge implosion. So technically speaking, the big bang is the resulting actions of an event that happened just prior to it.
               
              Paralel Universe Theory And Science
               
              A physicist by the name of Alan Guth came up with a parallel universes theory based on many observations. References to his theory are called inflationary universe or inflationary theory of cosmology. Professor Guth is currently the Victor F. Weisskopf Professor of Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Many of Professor GuthÃ¢â¬â¢s peers believe that his theory is correct. He believes that when the universe began, instead of a gravitational pull to keep things together, there was a reverse type of gravitation working and instead repelled everything from it, which he coined a Ã¢â¬Åfalse vacuum.Ã¢â¬ï¿½ As scientists have proven our world is constantly expanding, this theory seems plausible.
               
              Another part to Professor GuthÃ¢â¬â¢s theory allows that at the time of the big bang, the Ã¢â¬Åfalse vacuumÃ¢â¬ï¿½ began to decay, creating amazing amounts of particles. These particles are the same as those which began our universe. According to his theory, the universe is much larger than anyone had predicted. If this theory is true, these extra particles started as the decay became bubbles, much like the bubble he believes began our universe. The more the Ã¢â¬Åfalse vacuumÃ¢â¬ï¿½ decayed the more bubbles it created. If this astounding theory is true, it would prove the existence of many universes, all of which would appear to have the same properties and abide by the same law of physics. Because this theory canÃ¢â¬â¢t fully be proven, there is speculation as to what these other universes hold.
               
              There are two main ideas as to what these different universes may contain. The first is that these universes are the same in matter and physical laws as our universe. The exception being that due the varying degree with which they were created, it allowed for these other worlds to have every possible combination of particles available. In other words, these worlds would operate by the same principles but would have every possible number of combinations there are. For example, the oceans would be where our continents are and vice versa, on and on. The second idea is that the other worlds would potentially be different in that they may not operate in the same way as ours does. A three dimensional world may not be what the norm is.
               
              While both of these ideas are plausible, the first allows for the belief in parallel universes, the idea that any given person can exist at the same time in more than one place. If, as humans, we were able to tap into the power of traveling to these other universes, we would be able to Ã¢â¬ËmeetÃ¢â¬â¢ our other selves. While this is a truly powerful thing to think about, one can imagine the possibilities it holds. If your own individual beings could meet and each one had different experiences, think of the intelligence and knowledge you could pass from one to another. Each one would have different experiences and different outcomes. In one world you could be a doctor, in another world a politician, in another world a drug addict. The options would be virtually limitless.

              Well done. Let me show what happened. There was a misconception when the first blueprint was putup for the Singapore Future that once we got the mrt lines up and operated, there would be no more traffic jams because the public would make their cars absolete and the receiving ends would be more revenues and probably profit for the Singapore Government. However, as time passed by, they decided that having more mrt lines within Singapore, it would actually boosted up the Singapore economy and the public will all be more wealthy. And we didn't see until it happened, the mrt lines caused more delays then buses and cars journey to the city area...that was the main objectives back then...to create the most efficient mrt lines in this region and in the world. Singapore is always Number 1. The way I see it now, mrt lines in the future will be always a problem to Singaporeans without any endings....it happened and it will continue to happen...endlessly. I think Singapore need to stop building mrt lines and tunnels. It should let more buses and less cars on the road...I see it and it would be one day when fuel is no longer a cost of living rather the energy from solar and batteries....when is that......maybe within 20 years from now.

              I won't be surprised. Like those developed countries in the west, most of them would rather retire in South East Asia countries like Philippines, Thailand and Indonesia where the cost of living is much much cheaper than in their own countries....see Cebu in the Philippines, there are many foreigners especially from the develop countries of the west are retiring there and The Philippines Government actually welcomes and approved that retiring programmes for foreigners to retire in the Philippines.

              They will vote for the present government because they see Singapore more successful that their own former countries and they will not see native Singaporeans as patriotic but rather a pack of losers....that is what most of them see Singaporeans now..secretly.

              Democracy has been seen within most people of the past as a way to make a difference....now it is more like a corporate decision for the future of the corporate organization....usually the new staffs will go all the way to win favours and take control of the company like their bread and butter...until they reach the top....no matter what it takes...these new staffs are very hungry and they want wealth and power which they had none in their own former countries....like a pauper will to become more successful and becomes more wealthy. So, they will come no matter what native Singaporeans say to the leaders..

              <p>You donât have to be a Fortune Teller or Psychic to predict Singaporeâs future here. Easy, just write your prediction and state your reason/s. Iâll go first.</p>
              <p>I see Singapore in the near future would have to upgrade their manpower shortages for National Service by enlisting the Singaporean women 18 years of age and above, to do mandatory National Service in the Health Industry and in <span>SCDF</span>. There will be no NS servicemen for The Singapore Police Force and <span>SCDF</span> too. They can only join the The Singapore Police Force and <span>SCDF</span> as regular before they are enlisted with or after they have completed their full-time NS of 2 years or 2.5 years with the Singapore Armed Forces, Royal Singapore Navy or Royal Singapore Air Force. Likewise for the Singaporean women who are 18 and above.</p>

              <p><strong>GOOD, PRACTICAL REASONS TO HAVE NURSING AS NATIONAL SERVICE</strong></p>
              <p>Published on Aug 4, 2012 LIKE Mr Peter Ong, I wonder how our public health-care institutions would cope with the nurse shortage if fewer foreign nurses were to work here ("The foreign nurse who made a difference"; July 27). So it may be an opportune time for the Government to study the viability of enlisting fresh N-level school leavers or those with higher qualifications to serve national service as nurses. The others could serve as nursing assistants. They could be deployed in our public or community hospitals, nursing homes and polyclinics after their training. Besides alleviating the nurse shortage, there are other benefits: We will become less dependent on foreigners to meet the increasing demand for nurses to look after our ageing population. We could steadily build up a pool of "operationally ready" local nurses who can be activated in a national emergency or health crisis. At other times, they could render medical first aid at home and within the community. Our elderly patients will face fewer language barriers when communicating with local nurses serving national service. These nurses will have the knowledge and capability to better look after their infirm parents or in-laws at home in the future, and thus lessen the families' financial burden substantially. Those with N or O levels may willingly choose to pursue a nursing career as a result, because it may offer them better prospects than other jobs. With early exposure to health care, some of these nurses may decide to become full-time nurses after their stints. In short, enlisting teenage Singaporean girls to serve national service as nurses will benefit not only our country, but also the enlistees and their families.</p>
