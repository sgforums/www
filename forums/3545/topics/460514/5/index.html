              <p>Why not sammyboyforum. Also, I don't think women should serve NS.

                 There are more than one way to manage.  
               Bottom line is whether these political parties are commited
              and love the country enough to rule and create policies basing on
              people first as the basis.<br></p>

Yes, we need more opposition members to do the counter check and balance in the parliament. WP is gaining popularity amongs the younger generation of Singaporean..it will be more and more...you'll see.

              UNLIKELY FOR S'PORE, MALAYSIA TO MERGE: LEE KUAN YEW 
              By Hoe Yeen Nie | Posted: 22 September 2011 2207 hrs 
              
              
              SINGAPORE: Singapore's former minister mentor Lee Kuan Yew said it is unlikely that Singapore and Malaysia will merge in the future.
              
              He was speaking at the Singapore Global Dialogue, held at the Shangri-La Hotel, on Thursday evening. The dialogue was attended by some 400 participants from all over world.
              
              Mr Lee was asked by a Malaysian citizen if he foresees both countries coming to a political or economic union in the future, given the growing strength of Indonesia.
              
              Mr Lee said having gone through a failed merger in the 1960s, such a move is not likely.
              
              But he also gave a positive outlook of bilateral relations, noting the efforts of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
              
              These include developing the Iskandar region in southern Johor, which will complement Singapore's own economic growth.
              
              "Najib has brought forth a positive view of bilateral relations and the desire to develop southern Johor, the Iskandar region, using Singapore as a kind of Shenzhen. (This) means a complementary set of forces will be let loose, which will make it unprofitable for either side to be unfriendly," said Mr Lee.
              
              He added: "You want our investments, we want to invest. Having invested, we don't want problems with Malaysia, and Malaysia which wants more investments will not give us problems. So that's a positive development."
              
              Mr Lee also said it is in the country's best interest to spread its wealth, to maintain "national solidarity".
              
              "If you have fast growth, and it's confined only to one section of society, particularly the Chinese, and the Malays are left behind, I think it's not sustainable," said Mr Lee.
              
              "It is in our interest to maintain national solidarity, to ensure there is a spread of the wealth that comes with growth, to the disadvantaged in the population." 
              
              The 40-minute dialogue saw wide-ranging questions from the audience.
              
              Among them, what Mr Lee Kuan Yew thought were the key qualities that will keep Singapore going.
              
              Mr Lee said factors such as meritocracy, pragmatism and a clean government have taken Singapore to where it is, and losing sight of any of them will cause the country to lose momentum.
              
              Asked about his thoughts on Singapore's recent general election in May, where the ruling People's Action Party saw its vote share dip, Mr Lee said the "result was bound to happen".
              
              "Our total dominance was not sustainable, a younger generation wants to see competition, they voted in an opposition party... (but) to have a two-party system is another matter. It depends on the performance of the opposition, the response of the government, and the mindset of succeeding younger generations that come with every general election."
              
              When asked on how he hoped to be remembered, Mr Lee said he has no desire to be remembered for any particular reason, but he has a job to do - that is to maintain a fair distribution of growth for the country, and to maintain good relations with neighbours.

              PROPHECIES OF NOSTRADAMUS ON WORLD WAR THREE 
              
              To summarize what I have analyzed in this site, based on various prophecies, the Third World War would start when Russia suddenly attacks Europe in coalition with certain Middle Eastern countries like Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Libya and probably China. Prior to the World War III, USA would be severely crippled by terrorist attacks, assassinations, a civil war and an economic collapse. Prior to that, there would be a civil war in Italy, during which the Vatican would be overrun by the mob. The Pope would escape but many of his cardinals would die. The palace and the chapels would be burnt down. While on the run, the Pope would be captured and killed. There would be a schism in the Vatican and three Popes would reign at the same time, propped up by competing powers. Supported by US and other catholic countries, the Papacy would be shifted elsewhere and a "true" Pope would be elected there. Europe would be almost overrun by the Russian and eastern forces and many of its cities and also those of USA would be destroyed by conventional weapons as well as weapons of mass destruction like nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. Russia would attack from the North as well as from the East of Europe. An Arab / Iranian army would attack from the south. The Pope, and later the British Prime Minister would be forced to flee to the US. Paris would be destroyed by "revolutionaries" within France. The attack on the US would stop the Civil War there. New types of weapons, like Chemical Weapons and particularly what appears to be portable Laser weapons, would be used in the war. At the same time an unprecedented disaster would take place. A comet would suddenly appear over the earth in the peak of the war, would break into several pieces and fall to the earth. Smaller pieces would rain fire on cities and forests all over the world, burning them down. A large piece would fall into the sea creating a Tsunami of Biblical proportions, flooding parts of Europe (including Britain), USA and Africa. One medium sized chunk would fall on land, creating a huge crater, resulting in earthquake and volcano activities all over the world. This event would loosen the grip of the invading army over Europe. A joint coalition of US and European forces under the leadership of a charismatic leader "Chiren" would organize a counter-attack against the invading forces in Europe and elsewhere. The Russian forces in Europe would be almost destroyed by the counter-attack and this would lead to a revolution in Russia and the Russian leader who started the war would be assassinated. Russia, under a new leader would then join the western coalition and fight against its former allies, who would eventually be defeated. The Pope would return to Europe and Chiren would be crowned the Monarch. Peace would return to the world after a loss of almost two-thirds of its population and the wealth of nations accumulated over millennia. But this would surely not be the end of the world.

              The new ones are still afraid to enter politics with WP, maybe it takes an individual with great character and nice looking candidates for the votes to go up lols. The old politicians need to makeup their ways of integrating with the new generation of Singaporeans...most of them would like to see actions and gutsy actions from the opposition...like a match of martial art masters looking for ways to oppress their rivals...
