              <p>By <span class="fn">Jeanette Tan</span> | <span class="provider org">Singapore Showbiz</span> – <abbr title="2011-09-05T01:31:42Z">4 hours ago</abbr></p>
              <p><img src="http://l.yimg.com/bt/api/res/1.2/RTyfx2fBicLRL9u4ZSOvKg--/YXBwaWQ9eW5ld3M7cT04NTt3PTMxMA--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-SG/blogs/singaporeshowbiz/peeing-guy-2.jpg" alt="" width="310" height="416"></p>
              <p>One of three pictures taken by Singapore actress Mindee Ong of the Caucasian man who turned defiantly toward her, …</p>
              <p>Local actress and entrepreneur Mindee Ong received a rude shock on Friday night when she saw a man urinating on her car parked outside her shop along Club Street.</p>
              <p>Recalling the incident to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>, the Fly Entertainment artiste said she caught him urinating at her car and stormed up to him, yelling at him to stop.</p>
              <p>"Instead of listening to me, he turned around and taunted me before 
              continuing his act, with his private parts completely exposed the entire
               time," said the actress.</p>
              <p>The star of the movie 881 had earlier driven to her home furniture and accessories shop, Trolleys to pick up an item and brought along her dog, Bullet.</p>
              <p>"I left Bullet in the car with the door unlocked, went in (to the 
              shop), took my stuff, looked out of the window to check on the car, and 
              saw two guys sneaking around near the car," a shell-shocked Ong said.</p>
              <p>Stepping out of her shop to take a closer look, the 31-year-old found
               one of the two Caucasian men relieving himself at the rear wheel of her
               car, which was parallel-parked outside her shop, while the other man 
              stood at a potted plant nearby.</p>
              <p>"He must have definitely had some drinks, if not he wouldn't have been so daring to do such a thing in public," said Ong.</p>
              <p>"Standing about a car length away, I yelled at him, "Hey! Zip up your pants and get off my car!'" she wrote on her blog, where she also detailed the incident.</p>
              <p>However, he ignored her even after his companion urged him to leave.</p>
              <p>The next shock came after she shouted at him again. He turned around 
              to face her with his private parts exposed, telling her to watch him as 
              he urinated.</p>
              <p>A lot was going through the actress' mind at the time, though -- she 
              had left her mobile phone in her car, her car doors were unlocked, her 
              dog was in the car, and in her hurry, she had also left the gates to her
               shop unlocked.</p>
              <p>"When (he flashed me), I didn't know what to do," she told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>. "All I remember telling myself was to keep calm and composed. I just wanted them to leave," she added.</p>
              <p>Realising her attempts to get the flasher to leave was futile, Ong 
              walked round to the driver's side of her car to retrieve her mobile 
              phone and locked her car doors. She took at least half a minute to do 
              this, and when she walked back to the other side of her car, she was 
              horrified to find the man still standing there.</p>
              <p>Using her mobile phone, she took three pictures of the culprit in 
              succession. As she snapped away, the man looked down while his friend 
              hid from her phone camera lens.</p>
              <p>She then walked back to lock up her shop before returning to find the two men waiting to hail a taxi.</p>
              <p>"I immediately entered my car and called the police. I literally asked them, what should I do now?" she said.</p>
              <p>Ong took note of the taxi's licence plate number that the two men 
              boarded before four officers arrived to record her statement. The police
               also sent a memo to the taxi company requesting the particulars of the 
              driver who picked up the two men so that he can assist with their 
              investigations.</p>
              <p>The incident has left Ong so upset that she is still in a state of shock.</p>
              <p>"It's not purely anger, it's not purely frustration -- it's 
              everything," she said. "I'm perturbed, petrified... I'm still in shock,"
               said Ong, who had her car washed immediately after  speaking to the 
              police in the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p>
              <p>"I went to bed only at 2am, and woke up at 6.30am for no reason," the star of two of Royston Tan's feature-length films <em>881</em> and <em>12 Lotus</em> said. "I simply couldn't put my mind to rest," she added.</p>
              <p>This isn't the first time Ong has fallen victim to such incidents. 
              Several years ago, she caught another man urinating at her car, in a 
              carpark in the Duxton Hill area.</p>
              <p>When promoting <em>881 </em>in 2007, the star was also at the 
              receiving end of a rotten-egg attack, sustaining red and swollen eyes 
              from the egg yolk that spilled from her forehead.</p>
              <p>When asked if she will press charges against the two men should they be caught, Ong said she was too exhausted to decide now.</p>
              <p>"The act is disgusting, although I would not have pursued the matter 
              if not for (his) further action (of exposing his private parts to her). 
              They weren't even apologetic," she said.</p>
              <p>"It doesn't give me relief to say this, but I do think he should be responsible for what he did."</p>
