              <p><strong>Ensuring a smooth change in political leadership a challenge: SM Goh</strong><br> <span class="update">By Channel NewsAsia's Glenda Chong | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 09 April 2010 2315 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: Ensuring a smooth change in political leadership is a 
              challenge both Singapore and China faces said Singapore Senior Minister 
              Goh Chok Tong.
              <br> <br> This is one of many topics which Mr Goh discussed with Chinese Vice 
              President Xi Jinping on Friday.
              <br> <br> Both leaders were meeting on the sidelines of the Boao Forum for Asia 
              Annual Conference. 
              <br> <br> Fresh from his induction as a board member of the prestigious Boao 
              Forum, Singapore Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong met Chinese Vice 
              President Xi Jinping.
              <br> <br> Both acknowledged the strong ties between their countries which 
              celebrate 20 years of diplomatic bilateral ties this year.
              <br> <br> Singapore and China also face similar challenges, a key one being 
              leadership renewal.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said: "I had discussed with him leadership identification and 
              development, something which is very close to the heart of Singapore 
              leaders which he is in-charge of. 
              <br> <br> “So he is very keen on further co-operation and how we can identify 
              leaders and nurture them. And this is a strength of both China and 
              Singapore. We go out of our way to identify potential leaders and get 
              them in young, train them, groom them and development them into national
               leaders."
              <br> <br> Mr Goh noted that China and Singapore have different ways of identifying
               future leaders and this was where they could learn from each other.
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said: "Theirs in a sense is more systematic. They have the cadre 
              system for many years and people join the communist party and they are 
              spotted and groomed. Their system in a sense is closed. You have to be a
               member first. But in their case, they have millions of members so they 
              have a choice. 
              <br> <br> “In our case, we can't identify leaders from the party. No matter how 
              many we have is still in terms of thousands. In our case it's national. 
              We go out of way to look for people in Singapore, whatever and wherever 
              they are.”
              <br> <br> The Boao Forum is being held in Hainan Province and the southern island 
              has recently attracted much attention especially after the Chinese 
              Central Government announced it will be transformed into an 
              international tourism destination by 2020. 
              <br> <br> Mr Goh said understanding what the strategy is for the development of 
              Hainan island is beneficial to Singapore." 
              <br> <br> SM Goh added: "I was interested in understanding what the strategy and 
              the masterplan is. They do have a master-plan for the whole Hainan 
              island not just tourism masterplan but the masterplan involving 
              industries, services, agricultural and so on. 
              <br> <br> “And we are interested because Hainan could be a potential source of 
              tropical produce for us. So if we can have another source of food for 
              us, it is better for our security."
              <br> <br> The Boao Forum that Mr Goh is attending brings together leaders, 
              businessmen and experts in Asia, to share visions on the most pressing 
              issues in the world today. - CNA/vm
