              <p>SINGAPORE - A Secondary 1 student was found dead yesterday in an alley in Geylang, and two 16-year-olds were arrested for voluntarily causing grievous hurt.<br><br>The 13-year-old boy, Zhang Zekai, is believed to have died after he was assaulted by two youths in the alley between Lorong 29 and 31. The victim was a Chinese national studying here. He had been listed as missing for 22 days. <br><br>The youths had confronted Zekai in an online gaming shop and accused him of stealing their money. They took him to the alley and allegedly beat him. One of the suspects was understood to have called for an ambulance while the shopowner called the police. <br><br>A police spokesman told TODAY that at about 3.17am, they had received a call about a fight that had occurred at a back lane between Lorong 29 and 31 Geylang. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene at 3.48am. Police are investigating.</p>

              anti-foreigners sentiment is just a passing phrase...once very Tolerant Singaporeans get used to all the foreigners living here, we will be globalised by then.  Just like how we don't feel that Malaysians are among us for over 45 years.  
              
              Soon true Blue Singaporeans will be able to live well with China nationals, india nationals, Mynmar, thai , Viet ...especially China Nationals since they are Chinese like us.
              
              China Nationals who studied in Singapore and worked here sound like one of us. Their Singlish is as good as us.
              
              but our Chinese usage is not as colourful as them.

              Mooku i think you should watch more China movies and serial, then you will realise China Nationals look down on their own people. Beijing residents will always look down on those who flock to their capital to work and get married. Even a Beijing wife will always look down on her other province born husband. I saw this in a movie.
              
              As for the India nationals, their caste system is even more obvious.  
              
              
              I don't think you should feel that we are anti-foreigners when they are the ones who come to Singapore and bring their superiority culture here to look down on us. That's why we are anti-foreigners.  Singaporeans are definitely more tolerant and less status conscious than China and India nationals.
