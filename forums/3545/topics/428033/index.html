              <p>by Melissa Lin</p>
              <p>A BODY stuffed in a trolley bag was found floating in the waters off a
               construction site at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) yesterday morning .</p>
              <p>Two foreign workers, a Myanmar national and an Indian, 
              spotted the bag and took it ashore. They then alerted their supervisor, 
              who called the police upon making the grisly discovery.</p>
              <p>The decomposed male body was clothed but carried no 
              identification, said the police, who received the call at about 8.40am. 
              The man was pronounced dead by paramedics at 9.15am.</p>
              <p>The construction site is situated behind Underwater World, near a coastal walkway facing HarbourFront Centre.</p>
              <p>RWS main contractor Sembawang Engineers and Constructors has
               been building two hotels, a spa and maritime museum there since 2009.</p>
              <p>In a separate incident at RWS yesterday, an American 
              stuntwoman in her 20s dislocated her right knee during a live 
              performance at Universal Studios Singapore. She was part of the cast of a
               show at WaterWorld and was sliding down a pole when she landed badly. 
              She was taken to the Singapore General Hospital for treatment.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Businessman charged with murdering gay dancer</h1>
              <p>by Khushwant Singh</p>
              <p>THE man, whose body was found stuffed in a trolley bag floating in the
               waters off Sentosa on Saturday morning, is believed to have been killed
               in an apartment in The Caribbean - an up-market condominium at Keppel 
              Bay Drive.</p>
              <p>However, many of the other details surrounding the killing 
              of Mr Wong Teck Siong, 28, are still shrouded in secrecy. The ex-dancer,
               also known as Mr Huang Dexiong, is said to have been murdered between 
              April 1 and 16 this year in a fifth-floor unit at the condominium.</p>
              <p>These were the details that surfaced when Teo Boon Leng, 44,
               was charged with his murder of the younger man in a district court on 
              Monday. District Judge Lim Tse Haw granted the prosecution's request for
               Teo to be remanded for a week at the Central Police Division and also 
              allowed officers to take the businessman out to assist in the 
              investigations.</p>
              <p>In the dock, Teo, who was manacled hand and foot, looked on without expression during the five-minute hearing.</p>
              <p>The stout, 1.7m-tall man with a broad craggy face, was 
              dressed in a black Polo T-shirt and dark blue dungarees and slippers. 
              Before he was led away by police officers, he smiled briefly at the two 
              women in the public gallery. They declined comment when approached by 
              reporters after the hearing.</p>
