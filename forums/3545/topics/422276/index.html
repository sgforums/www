              </div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WHILE more passengers may be choosing to book a taxi 
              instead of flagging one down, I think it is presumptuous to attribute it
               to a stronger economy ("More book taxis in stronger economy"; Jan 18).</p>
              <p>I was back in Singapore recently for a short visit and 
              without a shadow of doubt, it has become extremely difficult to flag 
              down a taxi in the streets.</p>
              <p>Every time, I had to wait for at least 20 minutes to 30 
              minutes before I could get one. Many empty taxis zoomed past with the 
              "on call" sign on, but none stopped at the taxi stand. Even those that 
              were dropping passengers at taxi stands did not pick up new fare.</p>
              <p>On several occasions, I have seen rows of taxis waiting with
               engines idling at side roads with their "on call" signs on. One of 
              those places is Queen Street.</p>
              <p>The taxi drivers are very smart. They know that if they ply 
              the streets hoping to pick up passengers, it would be a game of chance. 
              However, if they just parked at a street corner and waited for a 
              booking, their chances would be far better.</p>
              <p>When the bookings come in, they can select a preferred one -
               for example, those going to the casinos or airport - and ignore those 
              that they don't want - for example, those going to Tuas.</p>
              <p>And by waiting at corners like Queen Street, they know their
               chances of getting a fare go up exponentially. Orchard Road and Bras 
              Basah are busy areas and cabbies are confident they will receive a 
              booking within a couple of minutes.</p>
              <p>The reason cabbies prefer bookings over casual street fares 
              is the multitude of surcharges they earn from taking booked calls. After
               having been away for two years, I was shocked to note, on my return 
              home, how costly a taxi ride had become.</p>
              <p>For instance, one taxi ride cost $4.60, but the surcharges 
              bulked up the total fare to $11.40. Isn't it bizarre that the surcharges
               add up to more than the actual ride cost? If a Singaporean like me is 
              confused and annoyed, imagine what a tourist would be thinking? Most 
              likely, that he has been ripped off. I can't recall any other place with
               such a convoluted taxi fare system.</p>
              <p>If we cannot live with a free-market system, let's switch to
               a full booking system like in New Zealand. The Land Transport Authority
               should be under no illusion that all is well and there is no need to 
              fix the problem.</p>
