              <h1>Why it's not easy to understand survivors' feelings about the war</h1>
              <p>Feb 16, 2012 - ST Forum</p>
              <p>PROFESSOR Kevin Blackburn is right when he says that the ceremony 
              here to mark the fall of Singapore is less evocative compared to similar
               war remembrances overseas ('Story behind the story on the fall of 
              Singapore'; yesterday).</p>
              <p>How Singaporeans and Malayans 
              behaved before, during and after the Japanese Occupation had its origins
               in the 1930s, the decade before the outbreak of World War II.</p>
              <p>It may be difficult for Prof Blackburn's 
              generation or outsiders to understand the complex factors that shaped 
              the attitudes of Singaporeans and Malayans then, who are now in their 
              twilight years.</p>
              <p>Before the Occupation, we were a
               British colony and the local predominantly Chinese population were not 
              regarded as citizens, regardless of where they were born.</p>
              <p>The Chinese were not homogenous in attitudes 
              and orientation because they were shaped by the schools they attended. 
              Schools with English as the medium of instruction were vastly different 
              in orientation, purpose and curriculum from Chinese-medium schools.</p>
              <p>English-medium schools aimed at turning 
              students into pro-British Anglophiles, and political and social 
              awareness were muted or discouraged.</p>
              <p>Chinese-medium schools inspired allegiance to China and were hotbeds of anti-colonial, leftist ideology.</p>
              <p>Chinese-educated Singaporeans and Malayans 
              were intensely anti-Japanese because of Japanese atrocities in China, 
              and enthusiastically raised funds for the Chinese cause.</p>
              <p>By contrast, the English-educated were passive or politically indifferent.</p>
              <p>It was not an accident that the anti-Japanese 
              guerillas during the Occupation were predominantly recruits from 
              Chinese-medium schools.</p>
              <p>These stark differences created culturally 
              divergent groups within the Chinese, whose boundary collapsed only 
              relatively recently.</p>
              <p>So, today's survivors who remember the searing
               agony of the Japanese Occupation were most likely those who were 
              Chinese-educated, and off the radar of the social or political 
              mainstream.</p>
