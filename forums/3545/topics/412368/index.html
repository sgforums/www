              <p>by 
              																				Tay Suan Chiang</p>
              <p>FOOD lovers know it as the place to have a sumptuous bowl of prawn 
              noodles or yong tau fu. While architectural buffs know it as the 
              semi-circular Art Deco building near the start of Jalan Besar.</p>
              <p>The charm of the building at 290 Jalan Besar, which houses 
              the Earnest Restaurant, a coffeeshop where People's Prawn Noodles and 
              People's are, and the International Hotel, a backpackers' inn, is likely
               to stay for years to come.</p>
              <p>The three-storey building together with 50 other buildings 
              and two structures in the area will be conserved. They complement the 
              466 conserved buildings in the area.</p>
              <p>Minister for National Development Mah Bow Tan announced the 
              conservation on Monday at the Urban Redevelopment Authority's 
              Architectural Heritage Awards.</p>
              <p>The additional 51 buildings and two structures selected for 
              conservation have a rich variety of architectural styles and designs, 
              ranging from the Transitional, Late and Art Deco style of the early 
              1900s to the Modern style shophouses of the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
              <p>Some of the Late style shophouses have highly decorated and 
              ornamented facades with fine artisan workmanship, while the Modern style
               shophouses have clean geometric lines and well-proportioned facades. 
              Their unique architectural features and details showcase the diversity 
              and richness of Singapore's built heritage.</p>
              <p>100 Architectural Heritage Awards since launch</p>
              <p>Under conservation guidelines, the external facade, the 
              original structure and defining features must remain untouched. Owners 
              may modify the interior to suit their needs.</p>
              <p>Since 1995, well-restored monuments and conservation 
              buildings have been given Architectural Heritage Awards. This year's 
              award recipients are 36 Armenian Street, a row of shophouses at Murray 
              Terrace; St James Power Station; two Victorian-style bungalows at St 
              Patrick's Road; a single storey Art Deco style bungalow at Chapel Road 
              and three terrace houses at Spottiswoode Park Road, Blair Road and 
              Cairnhill Road.</p>
              <p>The awards are given to the buildings' owners, architects, 
              engineers and principal contractors. There is no prize money involved. A
               total of 100 projects have received the awards since its launch.</p>
              <p>The awards come under two categories. Category A is for 
              national monuments and fully conserved buildings. Projects are assessed 
              on how far they adhere to restoration principles.</p>
              <p>Category B is for integrated old and new conservation 
              developments. Projects are assessed on both the quality of restoration 
              and the innovation and architectural excellence of the new elements.</p>
              <p>An exhibition showcasing this year's eight winners is on at 
              The URA Centre at Maxwell Road from today until Nov 30.</p>
