              <blockquote style="margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 20px;">Tan Jing Quee and Michael Fernandez were the first ISA detainees to speak about their detention in 2006. Both men were detained in 1963 and again in 1977. It took them more than 40 years to talk about their imprisonment. <br><br>In 2009, Jing Quee composed a poem “ISA Detainee”. There he recorded the prison conditions in the 1960s as well as that of 1977. <br><br>1977 saw the arrest of at least 28 people, mostly professionals. They were labelled “Euro Communists” by the PAP government. I was a young lawyer then and personally knew some of the people who were arrested. When they were released, none of them spoke about their experiences. <br><br>Earlier this month, Dr Ang Swee Chai who now lives in London, wrote about what she went through as a ISA prisoner in 1977. ISD officers had visited the hospital where she worked to arrest her. The hospital staff were so terrified of those plain clothes men that they interrupted her while she was performing an operation in order to inform her of their presence. I felt really sad for her as well as for my country when I read her note. Why do we have to respect the ISD so much that the hospital staff had to announce their presence even when she was performing an operation? I am glad Dr Ang was able to remain calm and successfully completed the operation. <br><br>It is clear from Dr Ang’s account that her experience had remained fresh in her mind for the past 34 years. She remembers graphic details of how she was arrested and treated in the cold room. She even remember her prison number. <br><br><strong>From 1970 to 1979, 149 people were arrested under the ISA.</strong> Among them were prominent theatre practitioners Kuo Pao Kun and Goh Lay Kuan and writers like cultural medallion recipient, Yeng Pway Ngon. Yet none of them had until today, written about their experiences. <br><br>If ISA victims of the 1970s were silent until recently, those of the 1960s also suffer in silence. In 1963, Operation Cold Store saw the arrest of at least 145 people. Among them were prominent doctors, politicians, newspaper editors, journalists and trade unionists. How could the then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his cabinet ministers imprisoned fellow Singaporeans without trial for decades? <strong>Between 1960 and 1969, a total of at least 284 were detained. Among them were : </strong><br><br>Lim Chin Siong (Secretary of Barisan) 6 years <br><br>Dr Poh Soo Kai (Vice Secretary of Barisan) <br>17 years <br><br>Said Zahari (Editor of Utusan Melayu, Chairman Partai Rakyat) <br>17 years <br><br>Dr Lim Hock Siew (Central Committee of Barisan)<br>20 years <br><br>Ho Piao (Paid Secretary of SNSU) 18 years <br><br>Lee Tee Tong (Barisan Member of Parliament) <br>18 years <br><br>Loh Meow Gong (Barisan Member of Parliament) <br>7 years <br><br>Wee Toon Lip (Barisan candidate) 10 years <br><br>S T Bani (Barisan Member of Parliament) <br>3 years <br><br>Michael Fernandez (Paid Secretary, SCHFEU) <br>9 years <br><br>Chia Thye Poh (Barisan Member of Parliament) <br>26 years <br><br>Chia Thye Poh, a member of parliament was imprisoned for 26 years and subjected to restrictions for another 6 years. I met up with Chia sometime this year. I was told by his father who is now in his 90s that Chia his eldest born was a brilliant student. He was a bookworm and was always at the top of his class. He did not participate in student activities. It was only when he became a lecturer at the Nanyang University that he became interested in politics. He stood as a Barisan candidate in 1963 and won. When he was arrested in October 1966 his mother suffered a stroke and had not been in good health ever since. Today, she is bedridden. Both parents are being looked after by his younger sister. Chia who has a doctorate degree, works abroad and returns home irregularly. Life is tough. <br><br>The PAP have wrecked many lives and deprived many parents of their children. There must be thousands whose lives were damaged by the ISA. Said Zahari wrote an account of his prison days in Dark Clouds at Dawn published in 2001. Low Miao Gong wrote briefly about her experience in “The Two Faces of Men in White” (published in The May 13 Generation). No others who were detained in the 1960s have to date written about their experience. <br><br>When Nelson Mandela was released after 27 years on Robben Island, he went on to become the President of South Africa. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission was set up to investigate the atrocities committed by the past government. Can we in Singapore ever expect such a Commission to be set up to investigate all ISA cases? Will I be able to see the repeal of the ISA during my lifetime? <br><br><strong>On Saturday, 20 August 2011 at 2 p.m. at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, friends of Tan Jing Quee will pay tribute to him for his contributions in re-writing the history of Singapore. Let us hope that their voices will bring change to our nation one day. </strong><br></blockquote><a style="color: #e1771e;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WdXiLoK99Os/Tk3OCutThQI/AAAAAAAAA7k/l-GW4ebDct4/s1600/TJQ_Memorial_eInvite_Eng1.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5642392454458213634" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 282px; height: 400px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WdXiLoK99Os/Tk3OCutThQI/AAAAAAAAA7k/l-GW4ebDct4/s400/TJQ_Memorial_eInvite_Eng1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></div>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Mr Tan, 72, returned home ill on May 25, and was admitted to Singapore General Hospital a week later. He died just five days ago.</p>

But his spirits were very high, meeting friends and comrades whom he had not seen for a while.’</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Mr Tan’s wife, Rosemary, 65, said her husband of 40 years had wanted to go on the journey very much, to meet his many old friends in Malaysia, including former politician Lim Kean Chye, as well as to launch the book which took him two years to do.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">In an interview he gave to The Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao following the book’s earlier launch in Singapore, also last month, he said the idea for the collection came when he was translating the Chinese novel Ju Lang (Mighty Wave), by leftist writer Lim Kim Chuan, into English two years ago.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Helping him with the translation was Dr Hong and another former political detainee and Barisan MP, Madam Loh Miao Gong, 76, who was arrested after the 1963 polls for alleged pro-communist activities.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Ju Lang, set in Singapore in the 1950s, was first published in Chinese in 2004 to mark the 50th anniversary of the mass anti-colonial movement started after Chinese middle school students had clashed with riot policemen.</p>

So we started to invite scholars and those involved in the May 13 incident to write essays and their recollections,’ Mr Tan recalled during the interview last month before his death.</p>

The preface, introduction and first four chapters were written by Mr Tan, Dr Hong and researcher Khe Su Lin.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">In their essays, they gave the social and political background, examined the historical framework and explained the context of the period in which the Chinese middle school student movement was inspired and later grew.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">The students formed a united, open and legal movement, the Singapore Chinese Middle School Students’ Union (SCMSSU), a year after the May 13 incident but it was banned barely a year later by the colonial government for engaging in pro-communist activities.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Former prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, a young Cambridge-trained lawyer then, was SCMSSU’s legal counsel.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">It was through the students that Mr Lee got to know young Chinese-educated leftist trade unionists like Fong Swee Suan and rural dwellers’ association leaders such as Chan Chiaw Thor. Together with other like-minded people, including several of Mr Lee’s English-educated friends, they secured a mass base for a political party and formed the People’s Action Party (PAP) in November 1954.</p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It was student support that helped the PAP win the municipal and legislative elections in the 1950s</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">, leading to its landslide election victory in 1959 when it became the ruling party.</span></p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Many scholars have said that PAP and the Singapore story would have turned out quite differently if not for the May 13 incident.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Former leftists and alternative history writers often said the role and significance of the student movement were insufficiently told in the dominant, official narrative.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">‘This volume, The May 13 Generation, marks the breaking of that silence,’ said Prof Tan, who was SCMSSU’s English secretary when he was a Chung Cheng High student in the 1950s.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prof Tan, a graduate of the former Nanyang University in 1960 who later left for his postgraduate studies overseas, is among those who have broken their silence. He wrote about his involvement in the student movement for the first time after nearly 60 years in the chapter, My Story, in the book.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Also sharing her story for the first time is Madam Loh, who was among the arrested students when the colonial government cracked down on them on Oct 10, 1956. Her chapter is entitled The Two Faces Of Men In White.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-family: inherit; font-size: 12px; font-style: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6em; border: 0px initial initial;">Other contributors include retired lawyer Lim Chin Joo and former Barisan MP Lim Huan Boon.</p>

              <p><strong>The May 13 Generation: The Chinese Middle Schools Movement and Singapore Politics in the 1950s</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><br>Tan Jing Quee, Tan Kok Chiang, and Hong Lysa (eds.)<br>Petaling Jaya, Malaysia: Strategic Information and Research Development Centre, 2011<br>ISBN: 9789675832161<br><br><em>The May 13 generation</em> was the first belonging to the immigrant communities from China to grapple with the issues of being Malayan/Singaporean, breaking irrevocably with the received wisdoms of their elders, and in a political climate where their explorations were deemed to be subversive.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This book comprises the recollections penned by the participants of the era of the 1950s, where their generation was in the forefront of the anti-colonial movement, and the work of academic researchers who have examined the historical framework and context of the period, as well as how it has been made to fit into the country's mainstream history.</span></strong></p>
              <p>The researchers have also examined the students' cultural expressions, whether it is in art, drama, dance or literature and found them to be socially engaged, and grappling with the question of who they were as a people. The cultural explorations of that period have been forgotten or repudiated.  It is revealing just how this amnesia and silence has become so set.<br><br>It is also impossible to imagine the demands that the age had put on this generation of youths.</p>
