              was driving on Killiney road in the direction of Orchard road when I
              accidentally hit the side mirror of a car parked on the roadside double yellow
              line, next to Singtel Comcentre. I was trying to avoid on-coming traffic on
              this narrow single lane road and drove too close to his car. We exchanged our
              contact details with the driver of the car, who is the chauffeur of the owner
              of the car. The owner originally claimed $200plus for damage, which we agreed,
              but later he came back to us and said that there's an additional charge of
              $1000 plus cos he couldn't close his side mirror due to the accident which had
              messed up the whole wiring system. He claims that it's entirely my fault as the
              driver was in the car when the accident happened (though he was not physically
              there. He based his judgment on the testimonials of his driver and his maid).
              He claimed that his driver was actually dropping off his son at the speech and
              drama school on the opposite side of the road and it was totally legal to do
              so. But in reality, the driver was not there when it happened. If his driver wasn't in the car, then it's
              considered that he was illegally parking on double yellow line, right?
              Secondly, if the car was parked illegally and obstructing the traffic, should he not bear half of the responsibility of the accident? Lastly, how can
              I be sure that the side-view mirror was in working condition before the accident? Unfortunately, none of us had
              taken any photos to prove our stories as we had hoped to settle things without
              going through insurance companies.</span></p>

Settlement by insurance company is too cumbersome and I'll lost out on my discount premium, so my best option is to settle it privately. Anyone know how I should protect myself against further claims in future once the original settlement has been made? Should I still make a police report?</p></div>
