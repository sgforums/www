              <div class="kicker">INTERNATIONAL WATER WEEK</div>
              <div class="kicker"><br></div>
              <div class="kicker">
              <p>AMONG the points raised in the interesting series of articles about 
              Singapore Water Week thus far are that demand for water is expected to 
              double and Singapore aims to be self-sufficient by 2061, when the second
               of two water agreements with Malaysia lapses.</p>
              <p>One issue that has not had enough publicity is examining 
              ways to forge private and public partnerships to curtail future demand 
              of water, not only in Singapore but also globally.</p>
              <p>Singapore can indeed be the catalyst to lead the change in 
              saving water. Agencies such as the Economic Development Board and PUB, 
              the national water agency, are the likeliest key agents to lead the 
              change in curtailing water demand in Singapore; and to provide model 
              cases for other countries to copy.</p>
              <p>Naturally, meeting demand and ensuring quality water 
              delivery are important goals which Singapore will succeed in achieving. 
              However, if we fail to address the issue of saving water - through 
              taming insatiable consumer demand and cutting it - we will not be able 
              to have adequate supply in the future.</p>
              <p><strong>Harry Cheng <br>Tokyo</strong></p>
              <hr>
              <p>IT IS International Water Week in Singapore and there has 
              been much discussion on current and future supply of water, water 
              technology and water pricing.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, there is hardly any mention of water conservation.</p>
              <p>Of late, we have been experiencing not just thunderstorms in
               the afternoon but also tempestuous storms resulting in serious floods.</p>
              <p>There are no visible efforts to collect the 'buckets' of water from above.</p>
              <p>Those in landed properties can collect a lot of it, which 
              can be used for watering plants on other days, washing and even for 
              doing laundry.</p>
              <p>Those living in apartments can also do so easily from their 
              balconies. The Housing Board and town councils can use collected water 
              for watering and for cleaning void decks, drains and other amenities.</p>
              <p>It has been a long time since we had water rationing and the expectation is that there will be no need for it.</p>
              <p>But let us not allow rain water to go to waste. Our water bill will also go down if we use rain water and less piped water.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Conservation a key element of nation's water sustainability</h1>
              <p>PUB, the national water agency, thanks Mr Harry Cheng and Mr Tay Koon
               Tek for their letters last Friday ('Missing: Water conservation').</p>
              <p>Held annually, the Singapore International Water Week (SIWW)
               is the global platform for water solutions. While the key focus is on 
              business and technical solutions, it also covers a wide spectrum of 
              water issues, including water conservation. For instance, there were 
              sessions at the technical conference which touched on the strategies for
               public education and engagement as well as water conservation.</p>
              <p>There were also various 'water showcases' - events or 
              activities organised by the community to showcase best practices and 
              contributions towards greater water stewardship. An example is a 
              constructed treatment wetland at Commonwealth Secondary School, which 
              recycles used water for watering plants in its urban agriculture 
              project.</p>
              <p>Water Week participants could also take part in the 
              technical tours to visit some of our canals, parks and reservoirs under 
              PUB's Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme to learn 
              how we engage the public and community by bringing them closer to water 
              so that they can better appreciate and cherish this precious resource.</p>
              <p>During the week, PUB launched the second edition of the ABC 
              Waters design guidelines, which provides designers with technical 
              details on how rainwater harvesting and storm water management systems 
              can be incorporated into development projects so that rainwater can be 
              used for non-potable uses, such as irrigation and general washing.</p>
              <p>Water conservation is an important element of Singapore's 
              water sustainability and will continue to be an important topic at all 
              SIWW events. Through PUB's ongoing water conservation programme, 
              Singapore's per capita domestic water consumption has dropped from 165 
              litres a day in 2003 to the current 154 litres. We aim to lower this to 
              147 litres by 2020 and 140 litres by 2030.</p>
              <p>Members of the public can request free water-saving kits 
              through PUB's 24-hour call centre on 1800-2846- 600. Simply by 
              installing thimbles in taps and shower heads at home, each person can 
              save 5,400 litres a year.</p>
              <p>Students can also learn on our website (www.pub.gov.sg) how 
              to conduct water audits at home and start water conservation habits from
               a young age.</p>
