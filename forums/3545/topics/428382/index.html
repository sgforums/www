              <p>WHILE the asset-appreciation policy benefits the current generation 
              who own homes by providing them with a valuable asset which can be 
              monetised should a financial need arise and give them a stake in the 
              country and its future, it has its drawbacks ('Perils of asset 
              enhancement for younger Singaporeans' by Mr Tan Jiaqi; Monday)</p>
              <p>As Mr Tan noted, such a policy sharpens the divide between 
              those who own a home and those who do not. Future generations of 
              Singaporeans may find it increasingly difficult to afford a home if 
              housing prices continue to escalate as experienced in recent years. This
               is especially so for those not fortunate enough to inherit a dwelling.</p>
              <p>An unintended implication of the Government's explicit 
              commitment to grow the value of homes over time is to push property 
              prices beyond what they should be in the absence of such a commitment.</p>
              <p>Indeed, potential home buyers would expect higher property 
              prices in the future and be willing to pay more for their home purchases
               today.</p>
              <p>Also, some who might otherwise delay their purchases to a 
              later, more suitable time, are now induced to make a hurried purchase, 
              in anticipation of higher home prices in the future.</p>
              <p>The Government must therefore weigh the benefits of 
              providing current home owners with an asset that is almost guaranteed to
               rise in value against the cost of diminished affordability for future 
              home buyers.</p>
              <p>Finding the right balance is crucial for a healthy and sustainable housing market.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Better an affordable home, than asset enhancement</h1>
              <p>THE Government argues that by enhancing the value of HDB homes (read: 
              increasing the prices of homes), it gives a valuable asset to 
              Singaporeans and a stake in the country ('WP's housing proposal 
              irresponsible, says Mah'; April 15).</p>
              <p>I find this problematic on several counts. First, for the 
              majority, the home is an indispensable basic necessity, not a disposable
               asset. When prices of homes increase, the average home owner is not 
              able to gain from it - while he is able to sell at a higher price, it 
              also means he has to buy the new home at a higher price. Only the rich 
              who can afford more than one home stand to gain.</p>
              <p>Second, it deepens the divide between the haves and 
              have-nots, for those financially less well off either find homes 
              slipping beyond their reach, or face the heavy burden of financing a 
              huge loan.</p>
              <p>Third, the objective of asset enhancement through rising 
              home prices naturally conflicts with the objective of providing 
              affordable housing. It is tough to balance the two and implement 
              effective policies.</p>
              <p>Fourth, the argument that asset enhancement ties 
              Singaporeans to the country holds little water. Anecdotal evidence 
              suggests that people who emigrate cite 'unaffordable housing' as a 
              reason among others. Ironically, the rising property prices here means 
              emigrants can use the gains from the property to buy a 'more affordable'
               home in a foreign country. In fact, a majority of Singaporeans are 
              displeased with rising home prices.</p>
              <p>Instead of thinking of increasing prices to enhance the 
              'asset value' of the home, we should start to recognise that an 
              affordable home is an asset in itself. Keeping home prices low and 
              affordable means Singaporeans, especially young people planning to start
               families and buy their first home, can rest assured that they will 
              always be able to own a place to call their home.</p>
              <p>I think this would provide a more rooted sense of belonging 
              than that of an expensive house. We need to recognise that we are 
              deriving much utility from that house even if its resale price remains 
              stagnant. We need to appreciate that while stagnant prices may mean 
              little capital gain when selling the current house, it also means not 
              having to pay through the nose for the new one.</p>
              <p>Let us go back to the primary objective of public housing - 
              to provide affordable housing to the majority of the people. Let us 
              recognise that affordable housing is an asset in itself, both to the 
              individual and the nation.</p>
