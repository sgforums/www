              <p><strong>Debate over drug mule Yong's death penalty</strong><br> <span class="update">By Ong Dai Lin | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 15 March 2010 2156 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE : Should drug traffickers be presented the automatic 
              punishment - which is the death penalty? That question arose during the 
              appeal of convicted Malaysian drug mule Yong Vui Kong.
              <br> <br> The 22-year-old was to be hanged last December for smuggling 47 grammes 
              of heroine. But Yong's lawyer, M Ravi, successfully sought a stay of 
              execution from the High Court.
              <br> <br> He told the Court of Appeal that a mandatory death penalty is a 
              violation of customary international law, calling it "cruel and 
              inhumane".
              <br> <br> He said the court should have the discretion to look at different 
              circumstances concerning individual drug traffickers before deciding to 
              mete out the death penalty.
              <br> <br> The prosecution - led by outgoing Attorney-General Walter Woon who made a
               rare appearance - thought otherwise, saying the discretionary power 
              lies with Parliament.
              <br> <br> The court will give its decision at a later date.

              <p>I oppose the mandatory death penatly against drug trafficking at many levels:</p>
              <p>1) There is no need for the prosecution for proof of intention ie. the burden lies with the defence why is the defendent not guilty and not vice versa as in most other laws. This is particularly unjust when the mule in question is practically uneducated or ignorant. Recall that African teenager who was executed and the illiterate Combodian man whom the President pardoned? Ordinarily, we would say that ignorance of the law is no defence. However, the death penalty is an ultimate and irreversible punishment and it warrants extra consideration when it comes to its application.</p>
              <p>2) As a deterrent, I have yet to see the death penalty playing a huge part in the destruction of drug cartels. I would suppose that the mules know abit about the in and outs of the cartels but if you are hanging them I doubt they will want to help you very much. Do we have a law for the death penalty for the conspiracy to traffic drugs? I don't think so, correct me if I am wrong. This raises quite a few eyebrows doesn't it? Who recalls a drug lord being hanged or convicted for a long time. Why are they being protected so well.</p>
              <p>3) An eye for an eye. Most people can easily take the view that the death penalty is a just punishment for murder. Some can accept it as the punishment for drug trafficking as drugs 'destroys lives'. Let us examine this twisted logic. We justify the death penalty for drug trafficking because it causes death somewhere. To preserve generality, any activity that causes the same effect ought to deserve the same punishment, doesn't it? That will lump in the cigarette peddlers, booze sellers etc.</p>
              <p>4) The gah-men maintains that the death penalty is an effective deterrent. Well, for it to be more effective, shouldn't it be more open to discussion about the death penalty? Why do the authorities clamp up when asked with satistics about executions? Wouldn't publishing them raise awareness of the consequences of drug trafficking. Even better, why not have a hugeass poster at Changi airport that says, "Bringing drugs? We will hang you!".</p>
              <p>5) I also belive that the reluctance to repeal this law is due to neighbouring peer pressure even if the gah-men doesn't admit it. Think, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesion etc all has similar laws, if Singapore has repeals the death penalty for drug trafficking, we would become the drug hub for SE Asia. Well that just adds another hub to our desire to become the hubs of hubs doesn't it?</p>
