              <p>All these baking, asian food, western food, korean food etc etc classes are available in the whole Singapore. Who is enrolling in these classes ? foreign brides ?</p>
              <p>If the rich wants a wife who can cook, set it as a top priority.  Even China national will gurantee their virginity remained intact to hook a rich man, what made you think cooking requirement is so difficult ?</p>

              <p>Like I say, it is the famous PAP poison, " You die, Your business."</p>
              <p>There are also other local women that wants to get married to local men, but the situation is just not happening with the country going downhill.</p>
              <p>They will also remain single.</p>
              <p>With women unwilling to level the rules, this country locals will become extinct.</p>
              <p>In fact, FTs women will also exploit these rules, so the smart ones will just be single for the rest of their lives, the implication is already felt, our population are dying off, replaced with scarely efficient FTs which will usher in an era of corruption and failing public services.</p>
              <p>People will have to be more richer than the rest to be able to afford anything, so who will be the ones that will be wiped off the surface of theis country? With jobs and companies becoming highly mobile, personal fortunes will change also. Today rich men come be tomorrow's pauper, no one can eventually survive in such an environment.</p>
              <p>The golden era of Sinkapore have ended, killed off by PAP and loclas who take the PAP " You die, Your business." poison. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
