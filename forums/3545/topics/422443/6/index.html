              <p>Although gender equality is being promoted for all these decades but due to our asian culture, I believe that most of our girl would be more appreciated to be respected in terms of their gender rather to be equal in gender. Women would like to be recognised to be as capable as men and they should have the rights and opportunity to release their potential. Whether to be capable in their life would be depend on their decision to become a career women or to be the women behind the capable man. </p>
              <p>Why women would like to be respected?</p>
              <p>There have alway the memes of that women is responsible for the domestic work and the rearing of children (be it is the mother of the child or the organization that provide child rearing services) many of such responsibilities is being shoved to women. Domestic work and child-rearing is underlook and undermined not only by men, by also now by many women, thinking is is a undergraded job without direct reward. Thus many women want to divert their capability towards the working industry. </p>

There are many unnecessary things being promoted as essentials (like manicure-pedicure, branded goods, expensive entertainment) it is everybody's right to enjoy, but it is just little extras, little enjoyment of life to make yourself happy. yet, many industries has sent a wrong meme(message) that it is now a necessary, you could not live without all these extras. it had make a lot of our girls to rise their expectation, thinking that their future husband should have the money to proivde them with manicures(if not their naked fingernails will be so shy to look at the world), no branded bags to put into their branded items(because only branded bag is considered as a bag), or without KTV, movies, good food, they will be deprive of entertainment and enjoyment.</p></div>

              <p>manicure/pedicure, branded goods apply to all countries' women. Not just Singapore.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore Women are not pampered. We are protected. This is a sign of a civilised and wholesome legal system in the society.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also by the way, most Singapore Women used their own salary to pay for their once in a while luxury pampering.  We are entitled to such lifestyle when we worked hard for it.</p>

              <p>why should it be a choice? men can decide whether to respect the women, while women can only waiting at the spot to be recognised? Women surpass men in working industry, men grumble and claim that women should be a good wife and rear a child and if a wife is not working, men will say to the wife that they don't understand how difficult their life working and don't appreciate that the wife's hard work keep the family is as tough. </p>
              <p>Women is alway at the disadvantage, what we want is not alot, is to be respect by men that we are also a part in shaping the world, the economic. gender equality is to refer the rights to be respect is equal. Why should women be look down simply because the difference in biology.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>SG women have low self esteem. That is why they always like to compare themselves with others to get recognition. Like the LVs on the street etc. Something other people have it, they also want to have. They either spend or keep their money and depended on man to pay for everything which is ok since we are all men and should do the honour. They are defensive and can only be suitable to enjoy good life. You guys should have low expectations from them to make your life better. They are born to enjoy life and be pampered. Not to suffer. Once you understand these facts, you guys will have a much better life with them. :)</p></div>
