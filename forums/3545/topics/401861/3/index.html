              <p>I MOVED into Potong Pasir estate two years ago. Contrary to Mr Tan Kam Weng's perception ('Things have changed in Potong Pasir - for the worse'; yesterday) of the decreasing standards of maintenance since its MP Chiam See Tong suffered a mild stroke, I find little evidence of any significant decline in the area that I am living in.</p>
              <p>In my block, the lifts and surrounding areas are cleaned daily and the corridors are washed and fumigated every month with diligence. Recently, I sought help from the town council to remove a chained and abandoned bicycle, and it was promptly addressed. <strong>Compared with the other estates I have visited and resided in, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Potong Pasir is relatively well-maintained though it lacks generous funding from the Government.</span></strong> <em>The issues Mr Tan raised, like the one on playgrounds, are noticed in other housing estates too.</em></p>
              <p>Potong Pasir estate may look old as much of its infrastructure needs to be overhauled. But this should not be associated with the estate's management by Mr Chiam and his town council. This is because of the refusal of the ruling party to include the estate in upgrading projects as many of its constituents have been voting for the opposition.</p>
              <p>Given the limitations, Mr Chiam and his team are doing a remarkable job.</p>

              <p><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/chiam.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-24093" title="chiam" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/chiam.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>The
              first Town Council Management Report (TCMR) has been released by the
              Ministry of National Development (MND). The report covers six
              indicators under four key areas – estate cleanliness, estate
              maintenance, lift performance and management of arrears in service
              &amp; conservancy charges (S&amp;CC). It is for the period  Oct 2009 to
              Mar 2010.</p>
              <p>In this first assessment of town councils’ performance, Potong Pasir
              Town Council is judged to have performed worse than the other councils.
              It scored four “Level 5” in six categories. Level 5 is for the lowest
              score while Level 1 is for the highest.</p>
              <p>Potong Pasir is run by Mr Chiam See Tong, secretary general of the opposition Singapore People’s Party.</p>
              <p>Over at the other opposition-held ward of Hougang, helmed by Mr Low
              Thia Khiang, the results were slightly better. The town council scored
              two “Level 5” and one “Level 4”.</p>
              <p>As for the People’s Action Party town councils, the lowest score
              attained was “Level 3” by several town councils in various categories.</p>
              <p>The best performing town councils, according to the results, seem to
              be Tanjong Pagar Town Council, helmed by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew
              and Ang Mo Kio-Yio Chu Kang Town Council, headed by Prime Minister Lee
              Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>The MND says the “TCMR results should not be simplistically compared
              across towns. The more appropriate use of the results is for monitoring
              of the performance of Towns over time.”</p>
              <p>It also “encouraged [residents] to enter into discussions with their
              Town Councils on their desired level of upkeep and how to jointly
              achieve their objective while taking the cost of service delivery into
              consideration.”</p>

              <p>It's really amazing....the report. Level 1 being the best and 5, the worst. Hougang and PP have only attained Level 4 or 5. All PAP wards received at least the lowest of level 3.</p>
              <p>Guess who has the best wards? The father and son. Holy Goh I dunno lol. Bollocks report. In this modern day, we westernised bunch of singaporeans are still subjected to such propaganda that even Joseph van Goebbels would have been proud of.</p>

              <p>It's really rigidly political in civil service. You cannot outshine your boss. MM has the "best ward", is that true or just because he's the MM? PM comes next. Hahaha, who dares outshine the PM? This is really stupid.</p>
              <p>I dun believe this nonsense of that report from that ministry. Who helms that ministry? Grace Fu. And who does she take her salary from? MM and PM. Haha full circle completed.</p>

              <p>It is wake up call for the people who tried to lick their boss with a wayang report.</p>
              <p>Now, we cannot relied on wayang report performed on the certain place or organisation.</p>
              <p>Questions should seriously be asked on the accurancies of the report from the feedback on the residents themselves.</p>
              <p>Ask on how the report was perfomed, whether it was impartial and whether the person doing the report is swayed cos they are constrainted by certain forces.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We have learned to distrust the "happiness" survey published on the press as the truth is far away from what is being presented in the statistics.</p>
              <p>The truth is LOUDER than any published statistics or figure.</p>
              <p>Please provide us the real deal instead of the lip services every time.</p>
