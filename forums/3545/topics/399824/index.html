              <h1 class="storyheadline">Obstacles to breastfeeding in public</h1>
              <p>I AM an Australian living in Singapore. I have two boys, a 
              four-year-old and a nine-month-old.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a child-friendly country and I never thought 
              breastfeeding in public would be an issue.</p>
              <p>On the afternoon of May 8, my husband and I took both our 
              boys to a children's indoor playground, Royce Gym, when halfway through,
               my younger one demanded milk. As usual, I found a quiet corner and 
              started feeding him. Less than a minute later, an employee came over and
               told me I was not allowed to breastfeed there and insisted I go 
              outside.</p>
              <p>She directed me to a bench but I spotted a couch and walked 
              towards it. Again I was told by the staff that I wasn't allowed to 
              breastfeed my baby there, and again I was asked to leave.</p>
              <p>I asked an employee if it was the company policy that 
              breastfeeding was not allowed in the children's gym. Her answer was no, 
              but that some fathers did not like it.</p>
              <p>It's a shame to have this happen here in Singapore.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Do more to encourage breastfeeding</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Monday's letter, "Penalised for trying to be a good mum and 
              teacher", by Mr Lim Kim Siang.</p>
              <p>I empathise with the work situation of the writer's 
              daughter. I believe it is not unique as we have heard from many mothers 
              through our counselling helpline about the lack of facilities for them 
              to express their milk in order to continue to offer the best nutrition 
              for their infants.</p>
              <p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that an 
              infant be breastfed exclusively for a minimum of six months and 
              thereafter, to be offered complementary foods for two years and beyond. 
              The benefits of breast milk for an infant are unparalleled and obviously
               many mothers want the best start for their children.</p>
              <p>However, what Mr Lim's daughter went through is not an 
              uncommon tale at the Breastfeeding Mothers' Support Group. Many mothers 
              share about having to express their milk in the toilet, server room or 
              storeroom. Some employees feel the ire of their employers because of the
               time taken to do so. Yet, with the right support, a nursing mum needs 
              only 20 minutes to pump her milk at work once or twice a day. Often the 
              amount of overtime compensates for this time taken.</p>
              <p>As Ms Ho Ching exhorted during her World Breastfeeding Week 
              2009 address, employers can do more to encourage a breastfeeding mother 
              to remain productive. Breastfed infants have been shown to be less prone
               to diseases and infections, or recover more quickly, and mothers are 
              less likely to take days off to take care of a sick child. The very 
              provision of a small and equipped nursing room allows mums to express 
              their milk quickly and get back to work. When a breastfeeding mother is 
              content at work, she is able to contribute more positively and 
              productively, and with less stress. Mothers should not be made to feel 
              penalised because they want to offer the best for their infants for at 
              least the first six months of their lives.</p>
              <p>A few employers have set the right direction by providing 
              "pink rooms", or nursing rooms, for their employees (for example, 
              Temasek Group and the Health Promotion Board) and we believe these 
              employers have seen the benefits and rewards of doing so. We hope that 
              more employers will realise that breastfeeding mothers are equally 
              capable of producing milk and good work.</p>
