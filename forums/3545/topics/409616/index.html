              <h1 class="storyheadline">Motorists can't wait for pedestrians to cross</h1>
              <p>STAND at any traffic junction with a pedestrian crossing these days 
              and one will notice that impatient motorists can't wait for pedestrians 
              to finish crossing the road even when the green man is lit up.</p>
              <p>Often they squeeze their way through after the first wave of
               pedestrians have barely passed.</p>
              <p>Others wait but rev their engines as if to intimidate 
              pedestrians to move faster so they can speed off.</p>
              <p>I strongly urge all motorists to give way instead of 
              squeezing through. The law stipulates that once a pedestrian has stepped
               onto the crossing, all motorists have to stop.</p>
              <p>I strongly urge the Land Transport Authority and Traffic 
              Police to step up vigilance, especially at busy junctions.</p>

              <p>Introduce a law whereby motorists need to wait for the red man to on then they can make a turn. This means even if there's no pedestrians crossing the road while the green man signal is on, motorists are not allowed to make the turn.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Punish drivers who ignore crossing pedestrians</h1>
              <p>I AGREE with Mr Tay Chin Chye ("Motorists can't wait for pedestrians to
               cross"; Aug 31) that motorists in Singapore are getting more impatient 
              with other road users.</p>
              <p>Recently, at a T-junction in Toa Payoh, a vehicle refused to
               stop at the right turn just as a string of pedestrians were crossing 
              when the green man was lit. The people who were crossing dashed for 
              cover except me, and the car came to a stop just inches away from my 
              knees.</p>
              <p>Despite being in the wrong, an angry young driver stuck out
               his head and shouted at me for "obstructing the traffic".</p>
              <p>Such dangerous driving has become a common feature here. I 
              believe that attempting to educate our drivers about respecting 
              pedestrians on the road cannot produce positive results in the near 
              future.</p>
              <p>This kind of driving attitude calls for an immediate 
              tightening of enforcement action by the authorities.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Pedestrians take their own sweet time to cross</h1>
              <p>I REFER to Mr Tay Chin Chye's letter yesterday ("Motorists can't wait 
              for pedestrians to cross").</p>
              <p>The writer raised a valid point, and I concur with his view.
               However, from my observation both as a driver and pedestrian, I 
              sympathise with the motorists.</p>
              <p>Often, you see pedestrians strolling across the road, 
              sometimes talking on their mobile phone. The traffic light may be in 
              their favour, but pedestrians should spare a thought for motorists and 
              cross quickly.</p>
              <p>I strongly urge pedestrians to play their part as well, and 
              contribute to the safety of both parties.</p>
