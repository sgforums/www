              <p>PHONE scams involving the kidnap ruse and impersonation of government 
              officials are resurging, police warned on Monday.</p>
              <p>In the 'kidnap scam', the scammers would trick their victims
               into transferring money into a bank account by claiming that their 
              next-of-kin had been kidnapped and would be harmed if money was not 
              transferred to the caller's bank account.</p>
              <p>In the 'impersonation scam', the scammers impersonate police
               officers or staff of the Supreme Court and ask the victims to transfer 
              money into bank accounts to exonerate themselves from criminal cases or 
              court hearings</p>
              <p>Police have noted a new method used by these scammers, who 
              were able to display the genuine telephone numbers of a police 
              department or that of the Supreme Court on the caller ID of the victim's
               phones, although no such calls were made. Examples of official numbers 
              used by the scammers include: 63381034 (Supreme Court Enquiry Hotline), 
              64350000 (CID Hotline) and 999 (Police).</p>
              <p>Police said while it is normal during the course of their 
              work for investigators to inform members of the public over the phone on
               court dates and appointments at the police station, they will never ask
               for money to be deposited into a bank account.</p>
              <p>'The public is advised to be wary when receiving such phone 
              calls,' said a police statement. 'Cheating scams may take different 
              forms but these scams are all designed to cheat victims into parting 
              with their money.'</p>

              <p>my experiance with 2 con calls last year</p>
              <p>1st was a lady call 1 day in advance and tell me to watch SCV channel 107 or wat (i forget the channel she tell me) that i was selected in a lucky draw and was given a lucky 5 digit number</p>
              <p>the followday she call again and ask me if i have watched the show and i reply "NO" then she claimed that i have won the 3rd price of $200.000 then she continue to explained to me on the detail and end of the end she ask me to tranfer a sum of $4000.00 admin charge to her.</p>
              <p>i tell her i wan to money but i dont have $4000.00 with me . this drag on for 2 days where she keep on calling me to discuess the detail on the tranfer of the $4000.00</p>
              <p>i keep delaying her and chat about her personal life and that where i can feel that she getting impatiention and start to show angry in the talking. end of the <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>3 days</strong></span> ordeal for her i ask her to come out for sex and she hung up the telephone. that where she stopped calling me</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2nd , i receive a call from another china gal again, this time telling me that her supervisor ask her to call me this number to settle a court case. i was fine $5000.00 and was require to paid this fine immediately or i will be imprison.</p>
              <p>i gave her my name as Sgt Liu Chen Qian a traffic police officer in traffic division 3 and ask her for her supervisior info as i am a police officer. then she started to lose her cool when she hear im a police officer and start to lose her speech when i start to question her about the detail of my offences. end of the day she say she dont know anything and only call me because her supervisor ask her to.last but not least i ask her to come out for sex again and she hung up the phone same as the 1st 1.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have fun torturing the 2 con gals trying to con me</p>
              <p>next time try to have fun with this type of gals if you ever receive call on this type of scam.</p>

              <p>My tyoe is thru email. coz i got advert my photography service. then i receive one email from a makeup artiste says she can do all orts of creative makeup lah bull and crap lah for a flat fee blah blah. then a few days latter a model wannabe email me says she want me to photographer her but she don't want to look like herself wants a makeup artiste. what i neverreceive such emails before suddenly i so hot arh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>that moller now frequent those site got a lot of organisers and guys with cams 1. i bet if i paid the MUA they split the cost is more than the teeny weeny share they will get from organisers that hire 4 mollers and 6:1 shoot at sgd$35/GWC.</p>
              <p>4mollers x 24max x sgd$35 = $210 per moller. i wonder how much the organisers will cut from each of the moller's earnings?</p>
              <p>one day this kedn of site sure got lots of complaints and police and law will catch up on them. how may mollers underaged - their earnings got declare all in the tax or not hahaha</p>
