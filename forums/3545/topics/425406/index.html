              <p>A  YEAR after he was caught drink-driving, Stephen Davis was back at it
               again. On Thursday, the marketing manager of entertainment group St 
              James Holdings was jailed five weeks and fined $4,600. He had been 
              convicted on his second drink-drive offence and for driving while under 
              disqualification and without insurance.</p>
              <p>The 27-year-old had been convicted for drink-driving in 
              August 2009 and fined $500 and barred from driving for two years. On Sep
               16 last year, he was stopped at a police checkpoint along Kampong Bahru
               Road driving towards Telok Blangah Road at about 1am. An officer 
              noticed Davis smelt of alcohol and subjected him to a breath test. He 
              failed and was placed under arrest.</p>
              <p>A subsequent test at the Traffic Police department in Ubi 
              Avenue 3 revealed 46mcg of alcohol in every 100 mL of his breath. The 
              prescribed limit is only 35mcg. Also, as he was driving without a 
              licence, the third-party insurance coverage for his mother's car would 
              not apply in any collision.</p>
              <p>His lawyer V. Ramakrishnan told the court that Davis was 
              then a senior executive at Resorts World Sentosa (RWS). As he did not 
              tell his parents of his driving disqualification, his mother suggested 
              on Sep 16 that he take her car so as not to get wet as as it was raining
               heavily. Davis took up the offer and drove to his workplace on Sentosa 
              island and then to the dinner he was hosting for seven guests of RWS at 
              the 1-Altitude restaurant in Raffles Place. Davis drank two glasses of 
              Guinness draught beer. He was checked by police while driving back to 
              work.</p>
              <p>Davis, who was in court with his parents, was granted 
              permission to start his sentence on April 1 this year as his lawyer said
               he was needed to complete a work-related project.</p>

              <p>The sentencing is not heavy, that is why many pple still dare to dink drive...knowing that they only get to pay fine, that's all. Still can drive.</p>
              <p>Sadly to say, after so many suggestions for the traffic authorities, still they close all ears waiting for someone to get kill then they start to review it.</p>
