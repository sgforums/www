              <h1 class="storyheadline">Polar bears and zoo's green contradiction</h1>
              <p>I REFER to the article ('Helping errant zoos do better'; Aug 23), which
               stated that 'the zoo, though, stopped short of granting the 
              non-governmental organisation's request for the polar exhibit to be 
              phased out'.</p>
              <p>Ms Fanny Lai, chief executive officer of Wildlife Reserves 
              Singapore (WRS), explained that 'one reason we keep polar bears is as an
               insurance in case something happens in the wild. We can't foresee the 
              future, but it doesn't look positive for polar bears'.</p>
              <p>In 2007, Singapore Zoo confirmed in a number of media 
              articles that it will not bring any more polar bears into the country. 
              Is the zoo reversing its decision again?</p>
              <p>Disappointingly, WRS had already reversed a September 2006 
              decision to relocate Inuka the polar bear to a more temperate and 
              appropriate climate.</p>
              <p>Studies have shown that polar bears are poor candidates for 
              captivity and Singapore's tropical climate is totally unsuitable for 
              polar bears.</p>
              <p>The Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) 
              congratulates the zoo for building a larger and climate-controlled 
              enclosure for the polar bears. Is this, however, contradictory to the 
              zoo's message with regard to fighting global warming?</p>
              <p>On the one hand, the zoo is creating awareness about the 
              need to cut our carbon emissions to save the polar bear's habitat. But 
              on the other, a large climate-controlled enclosure for the polar bears, 
              24 hours a day and 365 days a year, will undoubtedly contribute to 
              global warming and to the demise of wild polar bears.</p>
              <p>Acres hopes that WRS will indeed phase out the keeping of 
              polar bears and focus on being a tropical zoo.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Sheba and Inuka thriving well in S'pore</h1>
              <p>I APPRECIATE the views expressed in the letter ('Polar bears and zoo's 
              green contradiction'; Sept 1) by Animal Concerns Research and Education 
              Society (Acres) executive director Louis Ng.</p>
              <p>In 2006, the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee (Awec) 
              undertook an extensive review of whether we should keep the polar bears,
               Sheba and Inuka, in Singapore. After careful consideration, the 
              committee decided it was against the best interests of the bears to be 
              released into the wild or moved out of Singapore Zoo.</p>
              <p>First, the natural habitat of polar bears is extremely 
              resource-sparse, and cubs are trained from a young age to swim and 
              travel vast distances to hunt for prey. Having been raised in captivity,
               both Sheba and Inuka do not have the necessary skills or knowledge to 
              hunt for their own food. In addition, climate change has caused the 
              melting of the ice caps, resulting in more wild polar bears dying of 
              starvation. Both bears will not be able to survive the introduction into
               such a harsh environment.</p>
              <p>Other options were also considered, namely to relocate Inuka
               to a different zoological institution after the passing of Sheba. We 
              recommended that Inuka should remain here and not be sent to a temperate
               country because it would cause him more stress, with the move having 
              its own share of risks.</p>
              <p>On the one hand, logic prevails that Arctic animals should 
              reside in temperate climates. On the other hand, Sheba, who is 33, has 
              lived eight years past her average lifespan, and Inuka, who was born 
              here, will be 20 years old by end 2010. This shows that they are 
              thriving well in this environment.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, Awec will continue to keep an open view. With 
              new discoveries in veterinary science, as well as improvements in 
              captive animal breeding and management around the world, there will be a
               need to assess the situation again.</p>
              <p>Captive habitats provided by wildlife institutions have 
              enabled polar bears to successfully reproduce and raise their young as 
              in the case of Sheba and Inuka.</p>
              <p>We are glad that Wildlife Reserves Singapore has decided to 
              move the bears to their new enclosure at the River Safari, which will 
              serve as a better living environment. We believe both of them will 
              continue to be provided with the best care and facilities here.</p>

              <p>I REFER to the letter ('Polar bears and zoo's green contradiction'; 
              Sept1) by Animal Concerns Research and Education Society (Acres) 
              executive director Louis Ng, which argued that polar bears Sheba and 
              Inuka should be moved out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>First, both mother and son polar bears were born in 
              captivity, with Inuka being the first polar bear to be born in the 
              tropics at Singapore Zoo close to 20 years ago.</p>
              <p>Both bears have neither the necessary skills nor training to
               be released into the wild.</p>
              <p>Sheba is now 33 years old, which is eight years above the 
              average lifespan of a polar bear in captivity and almost double the 
              longevity of a polar bear in the wild (15 to 18 years).</p>
              <p>Second, we would like to reiterate that Wildlife Reserves 
              Singapore (WRS) has been consulting the Animal Welfare and Ethics 
              Committee (Awec) and adhering to its recommendations.</p>
              <p>It was Awec's strong recommendation in 2006 - under the 
              chairmanship of Professor Tommy Koh - that the polar bears should remain
               here, considering their age, familiarity with their keepers and 
              environment, and the uncertainty of whether other facilities would be 
              able to provide the same high level of care.</p>
              <p>It was also at this time that WRS started the 
              conceptualisation of the Frozen Tundra exhibit at River Safari, as an 
              upgrade to the polar bears' habitat.</p>
              <p>All through this process, WRS had continued to upgrade their
               existing habitat, with new air-conditioners, misting fans and net 
              shades.</p>
              <p>On Mr Ng's point about the carbon footprint of the polar 
              bear enclosure, we would like to highlight that WRS will be using 
              currently available green building technology to ensure that energy use 
              and carbon emissions are kept at minimal levels.</p>
              <p>Environmentally friendly and energy-efficient cooling towers
               will be used to cool the new habitat, and independent experts will be 
              assessing the construction of River Safari when it is built.</p>
              <p>In fact, it is worth noting that all our parks are the first
               zoological institutions in South-east Asia to achieve both ISO 14001 
              and OHSAS 18001 certifications, which indicate compliance with the 
              highest standards in environment, health and safety.</p>
              <p>Established and well-run zoos play an important part in 
              ensuring the survival of endangered animals such as the polar bears. WRS
               remains deeply committed to running world-class wildlife institutions 
              and ensuring the long-term survival of earth's biodiversity.</p>
