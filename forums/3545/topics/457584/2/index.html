              <p>The brain up there needs to be functioning to face the reality.    If your first world ministers are getting the highest pay in the world, what we get here should also be first world.    We are aware there are worse off countries but it is inappropriate and unfair to compare these countries to the first world country having first world ministers governing the tiny dot called Singapore./  These worse off countries do not pay their ministers the highest pay in the world.    OPen your eyes and mind, don't just point fingers conveniently!   How much you know the suffering of those in Singapore who are struggling to make ends meet to cope with the rising costs of living?   </p>

              <p>I never once said that SGreans have no reason to not worry about
                  many things.</p>
              <p>All I said was that you should take other problems of others
                  into perspective also.</p>
              <p>Ah.</p>
              <p>But of course I see that the perspective is too narrow to see
                  what I just said anyway.</p>
              <p>I invite you to go with NGOs to view the world.</p>
              <p>Would you do it?</p>
              <p>Of course not.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>So, you still evade from answering my question.   hahahahaha .......   It is all there in your post to tell us you are not even concern about the immediate problems in our country.   I don't need you to invite .....    I have no interest to satisfy your ego for someone who isn't concern at all about basic problems in his own homeland.  Give you back your own statement <span style="color: #333333; font-size: 15px; line-height: 18px;">All I said was that you should take other problems of others into perspective also</span></p>
