              <p><strong>COMMENT</strong><br><br>China-born Feng Tian Wei’s Olympic table tennis bronze medal has sparked an outcry in this country about what it means to be a true Singaporean.<br><br>Yet
               the problem is not so much that Ms Feng has failed to integrate into 
              Singapore. It is that the people who grew up in Singapore, myself 
              included, have failed to integrate into Ms Feng’s Singapore—the 
              Singapore of the future.<br><br>For better or worse, the era of Singaporean national identity, the one that our founding fathers tried to establish, is fading.<br><br>In
               many countries, national identity develops from a common tribal base, 
              whether stemming from ethnicity, as in Japan, or religion, as in 
              Pakistan. In some other countries, national identity is nurtured 
              initially through a shared values system—for example, freedom and 
              opportunity in the United States.<br><br>On August 9th 1965, Singapore had neither.<br><br>“Some
               countries are born independent. Some achieve independence. Singapore 
              had independence thrust upon it, “says Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first 
              prime minister, in his memoirs.<br><br><strong>UNIQUE TRIBAL BASE</strong><br><br>Singapore
               hence tried to establish both a unique tribal base as well as a shared 
              values system. The unique Singapore tribe comprises Chinese, Indians and
               Malays, who speak English, Mandarin, Malay and Tamil and worship at 
              temples, mosques and churches.<br><br>Almost every other person from 
              outside this polyglot tribe was welcomed into the new Singapore of 1965,
               but was stuck with the rather uncharitable, amorphous label of 
              “Others”.<br><br>Singapore also ingrained a common set of values in 
              people—hard work, tolerance, the importance of meritocracy, and the 
              belief in pragmatism both in day-to-day behaviours and national 
              policies.<br><br>While the economy grew rapidly, Singaporean identity 
              always remained in flux. Meanwhile, from the mid 1990s till today, a 
              dramatic experiment in mass immigration as a means to counter low birth 
              rates has made identity formation all the harder.<br><br>In 1990, more 
              than 86% of Singapore’s population was made up of citizens. By 2011, 
              this had dropped to below 63%. More telling, given the high number of 
              new citizens from abroad, is the fact that perhaps less than 50% of 
              Singapore’s total population was actually born here. <br><br>Put another
               way, Singapore is possibly the only country in the world where there 
              are more migrants—including temporary workers, permanent residents and 
              naturalised citizens—than native-born people. Some like to call the US a
               country of migrants. Singapore is much more—it is a country for 
              migrants.<br><br><strong>'ASIAN JACK-OF-ALL TRADES</strong>'<br><br>Proponents
               of high immigration in Singapore point to the demographic make-up of 
              global cities such as London and New York as exemplars. This argument is
               somewhat defensible from an economic point of view, but it also reveals
               the fundamental problem with Singaporean identity.<br><br>London and 
              New York are global cities that are connected to much larger heartlands.
               Singapore, largely because of history and politics, is untethered from 
              our most obvious heartland, the Malay Peninsular. We have tried to 
              position ourselves as the Asian jack-of-all trades, a developed world 
              hodge-podge that is both all of Asia and yet not Asia at all. Again, 
              while this may work economically, from an identity standpoint, 
              contradictions abound.<br><br>This combination of globalisation, low 
              birth rates and high immigration has essentially overturned the very 
              essence of Singaporean identity that our forefathers tried to build. The
               traditional notion of “tribe”—Chinese, Malay and Indian—has been 
              disrupted.<br><br>So have our values. Singapore’s meritocracy has long 
              promised that as long as individuals work hard, they will enjoy the 
              fruits of their labour, with the best workers rising to the top of the 
              ladder. Here, again, mass immigration has undermined this contract.<br><br>At
               the top end, the perception is that the global elite has moved here 
              with containers of cash in hunt of lower tax rates, and is creaming off 
              the spoils of Singapore’s growth. At the bottom end, a seemingly endless
               stream of low-cost migrants from neighbouring countries has allowed 
              businesses to keep wages low, squeezing out hardworking Singaporeans who
               face spiralling living costs.<br><br>Finally, mass migration has dented
               Singapore’s attempts at inter-ethnic integration. Ethnic enclaves have 
              now formed, including a rather posh Indian one in the East Coast and a 
              more humble Vietnamese one in Joo Chiat.<br><br>With birth rates 
              unlikely to rise rapidly, and immigration likely to continue, albeit at a
               more moderate clip, it will be interesting to see what happens to this 
              fragile, embryonic, 47-year old Singaporean identity.<br><br>Perhaps the
               reality is that Singapore cannot build both a national identity and a 
              global city identity. We are actually in the midst of a transition from 
              the former to the latter. A global city identity is much more fluid, 
              less rooted, than a national identity. The migrants of today will 
              probably never integrate like the migrants of yesterday. For them, 
              Singapore is just one of a patchwork of identities they hope to stitch 
              together as they journey through life.</p>
              <p><strong>MODEL OF THE FUTURE</strong><br><br>And that, strangely, 
              represents the optimism in this identity story. There are few countries 
              in the world where race, religion and language are depoliticised to this
               extent, where it is so easy to set up a business, where people from all
               over the world can visit so seamlessly.<br><br>By unwittingly 
              de-emphasising national identity, and ultimately nationalism, Singapore 
              is creating a model for a future where nationhood, ethnicity and 
              religion should not matter.<br><br>This transition from a solid albeit 
              nascent national identity to the more fluid global city identity will 
              have implications for mindsets, personal interactions and national 
              policy.<br><br>For instance, if we embrace this global city identity, 
              Singaporeans should not care if Ms Feng never learns any English. She 
              does not have to sound like us to be one of us.<br><br>There are also 
              many policy implications. In a global city, it makes little sense, for 
              example, to maintain ethnic quotas in HDB housing estates, when all over
               the country little ethnic enclaves have formed.<br> <br>But there 
              remains one major problem with this transition from a national identity 
              to a global city identity. Many have been left behind. Social inequality
               has risen rapidly over the past two decades.<br><br>The only way for 
              all Singaporeans to accept the pros and cons of living in a global city 
              is if we can actually participate in it. Addressing inequality—including
               in education, employment and income—remains this global city’s greatest
               priority.<br><br>So, the end of (national) identity, but the start of something new?<br><br>This is an excerpt of an essay published on IPS Commons.</p>

              <p>suppose if the water is engineered to taste like meat and feel like meat with all the high quality and science attached to it.would the soup still be the watery diluted soup ?no,currently spore seems to be like getting the avearage ingredients and not the watery ingrediants with no substance.they are also not getting real meaty stuff because the spore cant afford it all the time.</p>
              <p>all these is meant to propel industries and whatever in spore  to be the first in the world.</p>

              <p>It's just a money making place/base for alot of people - and there is seriously nothing for citizens to be proud of. High GDP per capita is non of our business anyway, not like it affects our bonus. Yes, we are a first world country - but it's all glitz and glam without any soul.</p>

              <p>The national identity is to be proud of your country and stand forward when your country need you.</p>
              <p>It is to feel proud and emotional when you see the Singapore flag flying oversea and be proud to be Singaporean.</p>
              <p>That is National Identity for me.</p>
              <p>As the foreigners are born in their homeland, it is very hard for them to dump their homeland and adopt the new identity.</p>
              <p>They will eventually go home to spend their price money as they are only here to obtain false glory and honour for their adopted wayang country.</p>
              <p>So, I am not expecting any integration from them as they are only here for the money and not here to stay.</p>
