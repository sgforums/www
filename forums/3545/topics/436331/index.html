              <p><strong>Aug 17, 2011 - Straits Times</strong></p>
              <p>ANOTHER step in setting up the Indian Heritage Centre was taken on 
              Tuesday with President S R Nathan unveiling a foundation plaque at its 
              site in Little India.</p>
              <p>But even before construction begins next 
              year, the centre has been actively seeking feedback from the community 
              through focus-group sessions and the launch of a Facebook page.</p>
              <p>The $12 million centre is expected to be completed by December 2013.</p>
              <p>In his opening speech at the dedication 
              ceremony yesterday, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office S. Iswaran, 
              chairman of the centre's steering committee, said 56 community 
              associations and organisations have taken part in six sessions - held to
               raise awareness of the centre and seek views on its programmes.</p>

              <h1>Gold treasure at India temple could be the largest in the world</h1>
              <p><strong>NEW DELHI (Commodity Online) :</strong> The value of treasure consisting of thousands of kilos of gold, diamonds, gems and  <a title="Click to view Silver futures prices" href="http://www.commodityonline.com/commodity-market/commodity-prices/silver">Silver</a> ornaments, found concealed in different cellars at Sree Padmanabha 
              swamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram, capital of South Indian state of 
              Kerala, is estimated to cross over a mind-blowing Rs 1,00,000 crore ($22
               billion).<br><br><strong>ALSO READ: <a href="http://www.commodityonline.com/news/Temple-Treasure-Do-gods-need-gold-40506-3-1.html">Temple Treasure: Do gods need gold?</a></strong><br><br>As per expert accounts, this could be the largest treasure of  <a title="Click to view Gold futures prices" href="http://www.commodityonline.com/commodity-market/commodity-prices/gold">Gold</a> found anywhere in India and possibly in the world. Two more cellars are
               to be opened on Monday which could add more value to the already 
              whopping amount.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Analysts said the estimated amount is nearly three times the annual 
              budget size of Kerala. Experts are yet to find out the antique value of 
              the rare articles found from the secret cellars.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, some experts have questioned the quick estimates, saying it would take several weeks to make an assessment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The priceless articles includes a gold sheaf weighing 500 kilos, an 
              18-foot gold chain weighing 10.5 kilos, a 36-kilo golden veil, quintals 
              of gold granules and nuggets, crowns, numerous jewels and diamonds 
              including those from Antwerp and rare coins from many countries 
              including France.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The vaults were opened after India’s apex court, the Supreme Court 
              ordered the state government to take over the temple's assets from a 
              trust controlled by the royal family of Travancore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The temple has six underground chambers. The two chambers that were opened were last looked at about 130 years ago.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With this stunning discovery, the Sri Padmanabha Swamy Temple has 
              become the richest Hindu temple in India, bypassing the Balaji temple at
               Tirupati. The Tirupati temple is known to have gold worth Rs 42,000 
              crore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple was built in the 16th century by the 
              kings of Travancore. The descendents of the royal family had appealed to
               the Supreme Court against the petition for the takeover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The shrine, located right in the heart of the Kerala's capital, is 
              run by a trust floated by the Travancore royal house, to which Lord 
              Padmanabha is the family deity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Princely states in India merged with the Indian republic after the 
              country gained Independence from British rule in 1947. Initially, the 
              princes were allowed to retain their titles and some property, and were 
              given funds in lieu of the revenue they earlier earned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the funds and their titles were abolished in 1971. The 
              descendants of the Travancore royal family, however, continued to 
              control the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple through the trust.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Meanwhile, the findings have raised serious questions about the 
              treasure’s ownership rights and its future security. It has become a big
               headache for both Kerala and India governments because of security 
              reasons.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Security experts say that the Kerala Police do not have the means and
               expertise to provide security to such huge wealth. “You need 
              laser-protected safes, digital surveillance and other such modern 
              systems and programmes for providing security to things like this," a 
              police official said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>With the revelation that the temple cellars are holding unimaginably 
              huge treasures, controversies have sparked off over who the real owners 
              of this wealth are. Believers argue that the wealth belongs to the 
              temple and should continue to be kept in the temple itself under 
              foolproof security.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, some historians say that the treasure was actually public 
              property hidden away by the erstwhile kings. Atheists and rationalists 
              argue that the treasure could have been black wealth amassed by the 
              kings and hidden in the temple for reasons of the peculiar security 
              situation of those times.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, Uthradam Thirunnal Marthanda Varma, the present heir of the 
              royalty, said he did not want to say anything about the treasure, 
              describing it as the wealth of Lord Padmanabha. “I must not say anything
               about it. I am just seeing what is happening,” he said.</p>
