              <p>I picked him up twice from the airport. The man has no airs, and was very down to earth. He even carried his own luggae to the waiting area at the carpark.</p>
              <p>I knew who he was before picking him, and was worried that at his age, then 81, lugging heavy luggage. But he made no fuss and was insistent on doing it by himself.</p>
              <p>On the 2nd occasion, he had a friend with him, but insisted on sending the friend home first even though his home was nearer.</p>
              <p>He left the police force to a career in business, because he said it wasn't a great idea if he became Commissioner while his brother was PM. He left at the rank of Superintendant, at that time (early 70s) just 3 ranks away from Commisioner.</p>
              <p>I have also ferried some his sublings and relatives. At no time did they do anything to imply or suggest they were connected to LKY or LHL. They were polite to everyone who had to interact with them.</p>
              <p>And yes, Mr Freddy Lee (and the others) all gave tips.</p>
              <p>RIP Mr Lee.</p>
