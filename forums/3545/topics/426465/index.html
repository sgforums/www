              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A 
              recalcitrant offender who brought her then-10-year-old daughter along to
               commit burglary was sentenced on Tuesday to 26 months' jail.<br><br>Thirty-one-year-old
               Ng Bee Hong also had a habit of stealing from her employers, one of 
              whom became her victim on her first day of work.<br><br>Ng had been fined S$4,000 in January 2008 for theft.<br><br>She
               was later sentenced to 28 months' jail in October, that year, for 
              offences including housebreaking and criminal breach of trust.<br><br>In
               this latest case, Ng had her daughter by her side when she broke into 
              her former workplace, the Nessea Club at Upper Thomson Road, on October 
              30, last year.<br><br>Ng, who used to be one of its cashiers, arrived there at around 12.30am, after it closed for the day.<br><br>The
               court heard that she used a hammer to break open a wooden door to the 
              club's main office before asking her daughter to slip on a pair of 
              gloves that she had brought along with them.<br><br>The girl did as she was told and the pair entered the office.<br><br>Ng asked her daughter to take a key from a cupboard and used it to unlock a drawer containing another set of keys.<br><br>Ng took these keys and used them to enter the club's jackpot room.<br><br>Once
               inside, she helped herself to several bowls of coins from a jackpot 
              machine and also used the keys to unlock a safe in the room.<br><br>Ng managed to steal cash totalling more that S$11,000 from the club before fleeing the scene with her daughter.<br><br>In
               addition to this, the divorcee, who is currently expecting another 
              child, had also misappropriated some S$6,000 dollars of the club's money
               for her own use, on her first day of work.<br><br>Ng, who is also suffering from third-stage kidney cancer, committed this offence on October 1, last year.<br><br>The
               petite, fair complexioned woman had also stolen more than S$600 in cash
               just days earlier on September 23 while working as a cashier at 
              Greenbegger Supermarket at Geylang Road.<br><br>Ng, who is unrepresented, pleaded guilty to three of five charges earlier on March 9, this year.<br><br>Before
               handing out the sentence, Senior District Judge See Kee Oon said that 
              she had committed serious offences and she did so shortly after her 
              release from jail.<br><br>Ng and her daughter were arrested on November 1, 2010 but no further action will be taken against the girl.<br><br>The youngster is currently staying with her father.<br><br>- CNA/fa</span></span></p>
