            <div class='col-md body'>"A" is for the Architect; "N" is for Neo. Enjoy.<br><br>&amp;rt; ====================<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Hello, Neo.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: Who are you?<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: I am the Architect. I created the Matrix. I've been<br>&amp;rt; waiting for you. You<br>&amp;rt; have many questions, and though the process has<br>&amp;rt; altered your consciousness, you<br>&amp;rt; remain irrevocably human. Ergo, some of my answers you<br>&amp;rt; will understand and<br>&amp;rt; some of them you will not. Concordantly, while your<br>&amp;rt; first question may be the<br>&amp;rt; most pertinent, you may or may not realize it is also<br>&amp;rt; the most irrelevant.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: Why am I here?<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Your life is the sum of a remainder of an<br>&amp;rt; unbalanced equation inherent to<br>&amp;rt; the programming of the Matrix. You are the eventuality<br>&amp;rt; of an anamoly which,<br>&amp;rt; despite my sincerest efforts, I've been unable to<br>&amp;rt; eliminate from what is<br>&amp;rt; otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision. While<br>&amp;rt; it remains a burden<br>&amp;rt; assiduously avoided, it is not unexpected and thus not<br>&amp;rt; beyond a measure of<br>&amp;rt; control -- which has led you inexorably here.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: You haven't answered my question.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Quite right. Interesting. That was quicker than the<br>&amp;rt; others.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [The Neos on the wall monitors immediately respond:<br>&amp;rt; "Others?" "What others?"<br>&amp;rt; "How many?" "Answer my fuckin' question."]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: The Matrix is older than you know. I prefer<br>&amp;rt; counting from the emergence of<br>&amp;rt; one integral anomaly to the emergence of the next, in<br>&amp;rt; which case this is the<br>&amp;rt; sixth version.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [The Neos on the wall monitors immediately respond:<br>&amp;rt; "Five others?" "Bullshit!"<br>&amp;rt; "You're lying!" Laughter. "There were five Ones before<br>&amp;rt; me?"]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: There are only two possible explanations: Either no<br>&amp;rt; one told me ... or no<br>&amp;rt; one knows.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Precisely. As you are undoubtedly gathering the<br>&amp;rt; anomaly is systemic,<br>&amp;rt; creating fluctuations in even the most simplistic<br>&amp;rt; equations.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [The Neos on the wall monitors immediately respond:<br>&amp;rt; "You cannot control me!"<br>&amp;rt; Shouting. Flipping the bird. Scorning laughter.]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: Choice ... the problem is choice.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [Cut to Trinity meeting the agent at the elevator.]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: The first Matrix I designed was quite naturally<br>&amp;rt; perfect. It was a work of<br>&amp;rt; art. Flawless. Sublime. A triumph equalled only by its<br>&amp;rt; monumental failure.<br>&amp;rt; The inevitability of its doom is apparent to me now as<br>&amp;rt; a consequence of the<br>&amp;rt; imperfection inherent in every human being. Thus I<br>&amp;rt; redesigned it, based on<br>&amp;rt; your history, to more accurately reflect the varying<br>&amp;rt; grotesqueries of your<br>&amp;rt; nature. However I was, again, frustrated by failure. I<br>&amp;rt; have since come to<br>&amp;rt; understand that the answer eluded me because it<br>&amp;rt; required a lesser mind or<br>&amp;rt; perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of<br>&amp;rt; perfection. Thus the answer was<br>&amp;rt; stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program<br>&amp;rt; initially created to investigate<br>&amp;rt; certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the<br>&amp;rt; father of the Matrix, she<br>&amp;rt; would undoubtedly be its mother.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: The Oracle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&amp;rt; A: Please. As I was saying, she stumbled upon a<br>&amp;rt; solution whereby nearly<br>&amp;rt; ninety-nine percent of all test subjects accepted the<br>&amp;rt; program as long as they<br>&amp;rt; were given a choice -- even if they were only aware of<br>&amp;rt; the choice at a yet<br>&amp;rt; unconscious level. While this answer functioned it was<br>&amp;rt; obviously fundamentally<br>&amp;rt; flawed, thus creating the otherwise contradictory<br>&amp;rt; systemic anamoly that if left<br>&amp;rt; unchecked might threaten the system itself. Ergo,<br>&amp;rt; those that refused the<br>&amp;rt; program, while a minority, if unchecked, would<br>&amp;rt; constitute an escalating<br>&amp;rt; probability of disaster.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: This is about Zion.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: You are here because Zion is about to be destroyed,<br>&amp;rt; its every living<br>&amp;rt; inhabitant terminated, its entire existence<br>&amp;rt; eradicated.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: Bullshit.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [The Neos on the wall monitors all echo with<br>&amp;rt; "bullshit!"]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Denial is the most predictable of all human<br>&amp;rt; responses, but rest assured:<br>&amp;rt; This will be the sixth time we have destroyed it, and<br>&amp;rt; we have become<br>&amp;rt; exceedingly efficient at it.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [Cut to Trinity fighting against the agent.]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: The function of The One is now to return to the<br>&amp;rt; Source allowing a temporary<br>&amp;rt; dissemination of the code you carry, re-inserting the<br>&amp;rt; prime program. After<br>&amp;rt; which you will be required to select from the Matrix<br>&amp;rt; twenty-three individuals,<br>&amp;rt; sixteen females, seven male, to rebuild Zion. Failure<br>&amp;rt; to comply with this<br>&amp;rt; process will result in a cataclysmic system crash<br>&amp;rt; killing everyone connected to<br>&amp;rt; the Matrix, which coupled with the extermination of<br>&amp;rt; Zion will ultimately result<br>&amp;rt; in the extinction of the entire human race.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: You won't let it happen. You can't. You need human<br>&amp;rt; beings to survive.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: There are levels of survival we are prepared to<br>&amp;rt; accept. However, the<br>&amp;rt; relevant issue is whether or not you are ready to<br>&amp;rt; accept responsibility for the<br>&amp;rt; death of every human being in this world. [pauses] It<br>&amp;rt; is interesting reading<br>&amp;rt; your reactions. Your five predecessors were, by<br>&amp;rt; design, based on a similar<br>&amp;rt; predication, a contingent affirmation that was meant<br>&amp;rt; to create a profound<br>&amp;rt; attachment to the rest of your species, facilitating<br>&amp;rt; the function of The One.<br>&amp;rt; While the others experienced this in a very general<br>&amp;rt; way, your experience is far<br>&amp;rt; more specific, vis-a-vis love.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: Trinity!<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Apropos. She entered the Matrix to save your life<br>&amp;rt; at the cost of her own.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: No.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: Which brings us at last to the moment of truth<br>&amp;rt; wherein the fundamental flaw<br>&amp;rt; is ultimately expressed and the anomaly revealed as<br>&amp;rt; both beginning and end.<br>&amp;rt; There are two doors. The door to your right leads to<br>&amp;rt; the Source and the<br>&amp;rt; salvation of Zion. The door to your left leads back to<br>&amp;rt; the Matrix, to her, and<br>&amp;rt; to the end of your species. As you adequately put, the<br>&amp;rt; problem is choice. But<br>&amp;rt; we already know what you are going to do, don't we?<br>&amp;rt; Already I can see the<br>&amp;rt; chain reaction, the chemical precursors that signal<br>&amp;rt; the onset of an emotion<br>&amp;rt; designed specifically to overwhelm logic and reason,<br>&amp;rt; an emotion that is already<br>&amp;rt; blinding you from the simple and obvious truth: She is<br>&amp;rt; going to die and there<br>&amp;rt; is nothing you can do to stop it.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; [Neo looks down at the floor, turns, and then walks<br>&amp;rt; towards the door on his<br>&amp;rt; left.]<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: [hmmpf] Hope. It is the quintessential human<br>&amp;rt; delusion, simultaneously the<br>&amp;rt; source of your greatest strength and your greatest<br>&amp;rt; weakness.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; N: If I were you, I would hope that we don't meet<br>&amp;rt; again.<br>&amp;rt;<br>&amp;rt; A: We won't.</div>
