            <div class='col-md body'>I have always keep a open mind n hope my father's extra-marital affair is not real. HOWEVER, juz confirm it today when a third party spill it out. Not sure my "old man" will do anything to her(third party) Guess if he have the guts to do tat openly in the office, he shdn't mind ppl talking behind his back.<br><br>Yeah... tat shameless woman work for my "old man". A lot of time, I purposely avoid in contact wif her. And times when I saw her, I juz smile(false one) like wat I do to the rest of the worker I dunno.Maybe I can't hide very well. some1 did ask mi whether I m avoiding her. my reply: No(what else shd i say? a 'yes')<br><br>For the past mth, i have been "banished" to somewhere where i dun get to see what happen. "hao ting de shuo hua", I m helping wif my "old man" manage tat area. But actually, I m purposely put there so I wun mess wif his "good business".<br><br>I may be blurred but I m not stupid. Do he really think i m tat ignorant to noe what happen upstairs. It's juz tt I dun want to dampen my day, noeing things tat my "old man" hide from mi(like now).<br><br>Actually all tis yrs tis "old man" is like a ATM to mi. Always come home after 2am when every1 is asleep. Onli time I saw him is Sunday morning where after lunch, will leave the hse n come hm late. It is very hard to believe tat a man can be tat bz for 365 days.</div>

PC n a TV is all i need n have. I still call him when i saw him at hm. But he never noe what i already doing in the internet. Every1 tot i m playing some games as i used to do tat almost whole day. Yah, he doesn't noe i m gg out wif net friends on sat. bluff him say i meeting camp friends. afraid he sometimes "siao siao" will ask ppl to check on u ppl...<br><br>U r correct... i shd "kan kai" liao. After all, nothing can be done liao. instead of giving him black face, juz treat like dunno loh. $$ wise... still occasioally need his kind 'conttribution". Like what my mother always say, " Y let that woman spend ur dad's $$. U shd spend when u have the chance"<br></div>
