I kana scolding from her.<br><br>J always complain I treat xian too well. N my answer is that J has some1 to care her - a bf. I even noe xian address n phone no b4 asking J. She is rather jealous wif xian. As a matter of fact, up to now, I believe it is juz infatuation. Being the only son in my family, I have no brother to care for nor talk to.

And the most important is tt she was the first girl that made mi sleepless for 1 weekend juz because I worry tt she got wanked by her mother for being home late.(sound silly ritz). tt monday seems a drag n I purposely wait till her recess 1530 to check on her.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear xian89,<br><br>I'd say what u described is puppy love. I guess puppy love is when you "fall in love" with someone but you really don't know them that well. You fall in love with them because you are either attracted to them physically, mentality or whatever fascinates you. This type of love usually lasts only a couple of weeks. I can't say a time span is accurate, but this love isn't really love at all. I'm sure you have seen in your school on how some of your peers date other girls. They like a girl one second, date them for a good 2-3 weeks (can be a month or more) and then they break up because either they were tired of one another or they broke up over something stupid.<br><br>I guess true love is when you would sacrifice anything for your girlfriend. In this state you would not only sacrifice yourself, but you would also except the person in her entire entirety..in other words  pimples, bony and all. The concept of cheating isn't there and absolute loyalty is the number one factor. You can never get enough of each other and at times you can even read each other minds. Why don't you observe a bunch of old people and see how they interact. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I bet if you asked them "what would happen if you partner died" there is a good chance they say..I'd die a couple of months later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
