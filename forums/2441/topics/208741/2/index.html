            <div class='col-md body'>Your IQ score is 140<br><br>This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.<br><br>Your Intellectual Type is Visionary Philosopher. This means you are highly intelligent and have a powerful mix of skills and insight that can be applied in a variety of different ways. Like Plato, your exceptional math and verbal skills make you very adept at explaining things to others Â— and at anticipating and predicting patterns. And that's just some of what we know about you from your IQ results.<br><br>tok cok sia...my patience level was like 200 plus to finish this test <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your IQ score is 141<br>The way you think about things makes you a Complex Intellectual. This means you are highly intelligent and have extraordinarily strong verbal and math skills. Compared to others you are a highly conceptual and complex thinker and are able to understand information in an abstract form. You also show great attention to detail. In fact, it's hard to find something you're not good at.<br><br>How did we determine that your thinking style is that of a Complex Intellectual? When we examined your test results further, we analyzed how you scored on 8 dimensions of intelligence: spatial, organizational, abstract reasoning, logical, mechanical, verbal, visual and numerical. The 3 dimensions you scored highest on combine to make you a Complex Intellectual. Only 6 out of 1,000 people have this rare combination of abilities.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your IQ score is 120. This means that you are smarter than 91.0% of all other Super IQ test takers.<br><br>This number is the result of a scientifically-tested formula based on how many questions you answered correctly on the Tickle Super IQ Test.<br><br>But there's more to intelligence than a single number, a single score, or a single label. Tickle uses 8 distinguishable dimensions of intelligence in the Super IQ Test. By analyzing your individual scores on those 8 scales, we are able to look beyond the raw IQ score into how you process information, and which intellectual strengths you're best at.<br><br>Your test results indicate that the way you process information makes you a Concrete Thinker.<br><br>You have unusually strong verbal and numerical skills. This dynamic combination gives you an exceptional aptitude for solving equations and then communicating those solutions to others in lay terms. Your intelligence is grounded and based on a very clear interpretation of what is happening around you. Because you are so realistic, most things are crystal clear to you, while others may get confused by this or that.<br><br>Your objective is to make things real and clear. People count on you to find and give the sober, cold-hard facts. You learn most easily when things are explained in numbers and words and so you enjoy the education you get through books and lectures. Unlike others, you do not have to experience something first-hand to understand it, nor do you have a lot of interest in how things work mechanically. On the other hand, if you find the information in your books or lectures too abstract, you might tend toward first-hand experience as you'll get nothing but the facts that way.<br><br>Here's an example of your Concrete Thinker thinking skills at work in a real-life situation:<br><br>You are at a travel agency with a friend contemplating the several different types of vacations you two could take together. The agent gives you the pros and cons of each vacation (including the prices), along with the options you have within each package. All the details, facts, and figures confuse your friend, who asks the agent to just recommend the best one so you two can be done with it and get out of there. But you are able to take out a pen and a piece of paper and write down all of the relevant information. The comparison sheet you create helps you both figure out which is the best choice, and you prevents your friend from feeling overly confused. Thank goodness you think the way you do!<br><br>Visual Ability<br>Your score is 97 out of 100. Visual ability allows you to accurately visualize all aspects of an object for the purposes of recreating it, the way painters do. It's also what you use to imagine a scene from a novel or a story someone tells you Â— the ability to accurately reproduce reality in the mind's eye.<br><br>Spatial Ability<br>You scored 93 out of 100. You use spatial ability to judge the relationship between objects and physical space, like a parked car and the width of the road. It is also what helps you visualize a room when you are decorating or rearranging furniture.<br><br>Mechanical Ability<br>You scored 93 out of 100. Mechanical ability is what helps you understand how machines and tools work. Someone with a good amount of mechanical ability probably has an innate understanding of physics. High mechanical skill is also associated with a high degree of precision and practical thinking.<br><br>Abstract Reasoning Ability<br>Your score is 93 out of 100. With abstract reasoning you can think on multiple levels and see relationships between ideas that are not easily apparent. When you're using your abstract reasoning skills, you draw on both external logical and creative sources of information to come up with your solution.<br><br>Numerical Ability<br>You scored 92 out of 100. You use numerical ability when you spot a numerical pattern or solve a numerical equation. Here's a question that assessed your numerical ability:<br><br>Logical Ability<br>Your scored 82 out of 100. Logical ability is what you use when determining whether or not something makes sense. You rely on logic when analyzing an argument, step-by-step. This ability also contributes to your aptitude for recognizing underlying patterns.<br><br>Verbal Ability<br>Your verbal ability score is 73 out of 100. Verbal ability means having an expansive range of vocabulary, being able to use it, and feeling a desire to add to it. It is also what allows you to comprehend the relationships and subtle difference between words.<br><br>Organizational Ability<br>Your organizational ability score is 58 out of 100. Organizational ability is what allows you to organize and arrange information effectively, be precise, and proofread carefully.<br><br></div>
