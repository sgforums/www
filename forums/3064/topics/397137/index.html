To be successful, however, you need more than tough negotiation skills. As in any other part of the world, you will be more likely to seal a deal when you are informed about cultural differences and expectations. <br><br>Below are eight handy tips to follow when conducting business in Germany. <br><br><strong>1. Work is work</strong><br>Germans generally draw a strict line between their professional and private lives. Outside office hours they’re unlikely to want to receive work calls. But then, who does? Business meetings are usually well structured, have clear set agenda items, and all discussion points are noted down in minutes. <br><br><strong>2. First be formal</strong><br>Germans prefer to keep business meetings formal. They quickly get to the point, without a lot of “small talk”. It’s normal to refer to colleagues as Herr (Mr) or Frau (Ms), followed by their surname. Germans will do so even if they have worked with you for many years. However, those with overseas experience are likely to be comfortable with the Anglo-Saxon preference for first names. <br><br><strong>3. Outright is best</strong><br>Don’t be offended if Germans give very blunt “yes” or “no” answers. It’s part of their culture to be straightforward. This can differ from Japan where people tend to avoid making contacts lose face by saying “no”. Germans are usually not very keen on a lot of “hype” or false promises; it’s best to be open, forthcoming and direct. <br><br><strong>4. Firm handshakes</strong><br>It’s polite to start and end meetings with a firm handshake, and most Germans consider it correct to do so at subsequent meetings. So when you meet people, don’t be afraid to take the initiative to shake hands. <br><br><strong>5. Punctual perfection</strong><br>Punctuality is important. Don’t be late for meetings or phone calls. If you cannot attend, make sure you don’t cancel at the last minute. Like all business people, Germans expect deadlines to be met, and it’s normal for them to question why projects are not running on time.<br><br><strong>6. Preparation pays</strong><br>When conducting business in Germany, it pays to back your arguments with hard facts, statistics or market research data. So don’t enter meetings unprepared or hand in proposals that are not well thought through. Clients will go over them thoroughly before making any decision, and will follow up with you if something does not seem to be quite right. <br><br><strong>7. Process is process</strong><br>Germans pride themselves on being process driven. Don’t expect clients to return your proposals quickly – they will be thoroughly analysed first. If dealing with bureaucracies, expect to wait. Paperwork abounds, different offices will need a visit, and systems must be followed. <br><br><strong>8. Education is highly regarded</strong><br>Germans place a high value on solid qualification and technical understanding. So if you have academic qualifications, list them on your business card. Doctorates not normally found in other countries carry weight in Germany – for example, Doctors of Marketing or Engineering. <br><br>We hope you’ve enjoyed our first part of “doing business around the world”. Next, month, we’ll provide you with some valuable tips and tricks when doing business in China – so stay tuned. <br><br>In the meantime, check out some of the links before you visit Germany and learn some of the hard facts about the country.<br><br><strong>Hard facts about Germany:</strong>Population: 82.2 million<br>Currency: 1 euro = 100 cents<br>GNP per head: US$ 40.415 <br>Human Development Index: 22 (Japan 8) </p>
