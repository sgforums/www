            <div class='col-md body'>This will be a very long post I guess, its just a lesson learnt by yours truly at this point in time in my life which I hope to pen it down to constantly remind myself to count my blessings..<br><br>I just had a normal gathering with my old friends today, and as usual, we crap and laugh, but also, they were there to share my emotional hurt (caused I just broke off with my bf). After which, I turned to my friend and asked how is she (her aunt just passed away recently). I came to know that her aunt died of heart attack in her sleep, doctors said it was heart seizure. Apparently that fatefully day started off in a joyous mood, her aunt called the relatives wishing them and told my friendÂ’s mum that suddenly she feels very tired and that she wanted to get some rest. That sleep was one which puts her to rest forever...<br><br>She left behind a husband and a 15 year old son whom both dependent on her heavily both in the area of business and homeÂ…<br><br>My heart ached when my friend finished the storyÂ… I can really empathized with what her uncle is going through right nowÂ… the feeling of bitterness, loneliness and the lost of a love one, in such a sudden way..<br><br>I started to feel that what I am going through is really insignificant as compared to what my friendÂ’s uncle is going throughÂ… never to hear, talk, see the person whom you loved so deeply againÂ… and to know that all these while he has been taking the person for granted, till he really lose that something that he holds on to so dearly..<br><br>How many of us are also in this situation? To be caught in a rat race world, chasing after material gain in the hope to provide for our love ones only to raise our voice at our love ones after a bad day at work or simply take each other for granted? So many of us are caught up in this merry-go-round without even realizing itÂ…<br><br>Right now, all I really want and hope is not for my bf to come back to me, all I hope and wished is that he will be safe and sound, so that I am still able to see him, talk to him, although not as a lover, but as a friend..<br><br>As the saying goes, life each day like thereÂ’s no tomorrow, treasure your love ones before they are really goneÂ…<br><br>Sometimes itÂ’s the quality of life that counts, hope not for monetary or material gains, but the growth of self to really appreciate and cherish what you have around youÂ… before its too lateÂ…<br><br></div>
