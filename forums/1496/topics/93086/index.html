            <div class='col-md body'>When I was a puppy, I entertained you with my antics and made you<br>laugh. You called me your child, and despite a number of chewed shoes<br>and a couple of murdered throw pillows, I became your best friend.<br><br>Whenever I was "bad," you'd shake your finger at me and ask "How<br>could you?" -- but then you'd relent and roll me over for a bellyrub.<br>My housebreaking took a little longer than expected, because you<br>were terribly busy, but we worked on that together.<br><br>I remember those nights of nuzzling you in bed and listening to<br>your confidences and secret dreams, and I believed that life could not<br>be any more perfect. We went for long walks and runs in the park, car<br>rides,stops for ice cream (I only got the cone because "ice cream is bad for<br>dogs"you said), and I took long naps in the sun waiting for you to come home at the end of the day.<br><br>Gradually, you began spending more time at work and on your<br>career,  and more time searching for a human mate. I waited for you patiently,<br>comforted you through heartbreaks and disappointments, never chided you<br>about bad decisions, and romped with glee at your homecomings, and when you fell in love.<br><br>She, now your wife, is not a "dog person" -- still I welcomed her into our<br>home, tried to show her? affection, and obeyed her. I was happy<br>because you were happy.<br><br>Then the human babies came along and I shared your excitement. I<br>was fascinated by their pinkness, how they smelled, and I wanted to<br>mother them, too. Only she and you worried that I might hurt them, and I<br>spent most of my time banished to another room, or to a dog crate. Oh,<br>how I wanted to love them, but I became a "prisoner of love."<br><br>As they began to grow, I became their friend. They clung to my<br>fur and pulled themselves up on wobbly legs, poked fingers in my eyes,<br>investigated my ears, and gave me kisses on my nose.loved everything about<br>them and their touch -- because your touch was now so infrequent -- and I<br>would've defended them with my life if need be. I would sneak into their<br>beds and listen to their worries and secret dreams, and together we waited<br>for the sound of your car in the driveway.<br><br>There had been a time, when others asked you if you had a dog,<br>that you produced a photo of me from your wallet and told them stories<br>about me. These past few years, you just answered "yes" and changed the<br>subject.  I had gone from being "your dog" to "just a dog," and you resented<br>every expenditure on my behalf.<br><br>Now, you have a new career opportunity in another city, and you<br>and they will be moving to an apartment that does not allow pets. You've<br>made the right decision for your "family," but there was a time when I was<br>your only family.<br><br>I was excited about the car ride until we arrived at the animal<br>shelter. It smelled of dogs and cats, of fear, of hopelessness. You filled<br>out the paperwork and said "I know you will find a good home for her."<br>They shrugged and gave you a pained look. They understand the<br>realities facing a middle-aged dog, even one with "papers." You had to pry your son's fingers loose from my collar as he screamed "No, Daddy! Please don't let them take my dog!" And I worried for him, and what lessons you had just taught him about friendship and loyalty, about love and responsibility, and about respect for all life.<br><br>You gave me a good-bye pat on the head, avoided my eyes, and<br>politely refused to take my collar and leash with you.You had a deadline<br>to meet and now I have one, too.After you left, the two nice ladies said you<br>probably knew about your upcoming move months ago and made no attempt to find me another good home. They shook their heads and asked "How could you?"<br><br>They are as attentive to us here in the shelter as their busy<br>schedules allow. They feed us,of course, but I lost my appetite days ago.At<br>first, whenever anyone passed my pen, I rushed to the front, hoping it<br>was you that you had changed your mind -- that this was all a bad<br>dream... or I hoped it would at least be someone who cared, anyone who might save me.<br><br>When I realized I could not compete with the frolicking for attention<br>of happy puppies, oblivious to their own fate, I retreated to a far<br>corner and waited. I heard her footsteps as she came for me at the end of<br>the day, and I padded along the aisle after her to a separate room.<br><br>A blissfully quiet room. She placed me on the table and rubbed my<br>ears, and told me not to worry. My heart pounded in anticipation of what<br>was to come, but there was also a sense of relief. The prisoner of love had run out of days. As is my nature, I was more concerned about her. The burden<br>which she bears weighs heavily on her, and I know that, the same way I knew your every mood.<br><br>She gently placed a tourniquet around my foreleg as a tear ran<br>down her cheek. I licked her hand in the same way I used to comfort you so<br>many years ago. She expertly slid the hypodermic needle into my vein.<br>As I felt the sting and the cool liquid coursing through my body, I lay<br>down sleepily, looked into her kind eyes and murmured "How could you?"<br><br>Perhaps because she understood my dogspeak, she said "I'm so<br>sorry." She hugged me, and hurriedly explained it was her job to make sure I<br>went to a better place, where I wouldn't be ignored or abused or abandoned,<br>or have to fend for myself -- a place of love and light so very different<br>from this earthly place.<br><br>And with my last bit of energy, I tried to convey to her with a thump<br>of my tail that my "How could you?" was not directed at her. It was<br>directed at you, My Beloved Master, I was thinking of you. I will think of<br>you and wait for you forever. May everyone in your life continue to show you<br>so much loyalty.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
