              <p>Thank you for your support. I have shifted this post from Club 30 to Drama Haven as I have been made a moderator here so as to keep the Thread lively, I hope. All the past dramas/movies will stay at <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1769/topics/364376">http://www.sgforums.com/forums/1769/topics/364376</a> for refrence.</p>
              <p>One of my favourite past-time is to watch movies and drama, so I intent to write a reviews and recommendation of the movies and drama I have watched. These are usually Hong Kong, Japanese and Korean drama and movies.</p>
              <p>I will rate them with stars and my personal feeling after watching</p>
              <p>5 stars - highly recommended</p>
              <p>4 stars - recommended</p>
              <p>3 stars - can watch</p>
              <p>2 stars - don't waste your time but I finished them because I'm bored</p>
              <p>1 star - probably won't happened because I would have abandon that show already</p>

              <p><strong>My Review</strong>: More often, we asked ourselves that death means to us, But how often would you asked what life meant to you?</p>
              <p>A lovely romantic story indeed.</p>

              <p>The drama is a twist to the well known classic story of The Legend of Chun Hyang. The big question revolving around this plot is what if the one that Lee Mong Ryong loves is not Chun Hyang but Hyang Dan? The drama will deliver a refreshing new comedy style.</p>

              <p><strong>My Review</strong> : This is a rewritten plot of the well known Korean manga The Legend of Chun Hyang. IThe main character falls for her maid Hyang Dan instead. One of the society problem is the class system which exist in history or even in todays modern society.</p>

Working as a reporter for a racy tabloid called the Monday Seoul, Jin Do Hyuk uses any means necessary to get a scoop. One day, he goes to interview Jo Yong Deok, the boss of the Axe gang, who suggests that they start their own newspaper. Do Hyuk lies about the credentials of his former co-workers when he introduces them to Jo Yong Deok as potential hires for the newspaper venture. With his former co-workers on board, he is able to launch the Yongdeok Daily together with Yong Deok. But the newly hired reporters soon find themselves sucked into a huge conspiracy that could utterly ruin their lives.</p>

              <p><strong>My Review</strong>: Somehow I like the acting of Lee Jun Ki (of the Iljimae fame). Korean drama is able to potray the competition  (often the dark side of it) for the sit to the Green Roof Stage (Presidency).</p>

              <p><strong>My Review</strong>: Recommended by the cult leader. Don't asked me why the title is the Man Called God.  I can't find any relation to that. Well, the opening was glamourous. Part charlie's angel, part 007 kind of drama but the ending is a little wee bit of disappointing.</p>

              <p><strong>Genre :</strong> Comedy / Romance</p>
              <p><strong>Category :</strong> Korean Movie</p>
              <p><strong>Synopsis :</strong></p>
              <p>At the start of the film, Kim Yoon-Seo, an Inspections officer (police inspector) is seen at his home where his brother has been beaten almost to death. His family wants to submit a false appeal to the king accusing the family of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Lim family. The Lim family had by the past submitted a false appeal against Yoon-Seo's family. However Yoon-Seo does not wish to submit such an appeal, much to the anger of his elders.</p>
              <p>He returns to the court where the King hands him an important assignment. The King's concubine, Jung-bin, had a painting she had drawn mounted, but it was replaced by an exct copy, she only realised because of the lack of a scribble she had drawn on the back. The King would like Yoon-Suh to find the culprits. Yoon-seo is impressed by the talent of the artist who made the fraudulent copy. Jung-bin is in turn impressed by Yoon-Seo's knowledge on the subject and invites him to talk to her some more about art some day.</p>
              <p>Yoon-Suh teams up with Lee Gwang-hun, an inspector who likes to torture people in his dungeons, to try and hunt down the culprit. They enter a shop in their search for the criminal. In the basement Yoon-Seo encounters an old man transcribing an erotic story book. Back upstairs a group of men from the village enter the shop and engages in a fight with Gwang-hun, who beats them away with his truncheon, however Yoon-Suh is knocked out so Gwang-hun takes him back to his house with him. When Yoon-Suh awakes he admires Gwang-huns painting artwork. Back at the shop the old man confesses to Yoon-Seo that he does not wish to protect the mounter either, but that one of his friends is involved and he does not wish to betray him. After Yoon-Seo has promised to protect his identity, the old man gives him an address he may go to. Out of curiosity before he leaves he reads few verses from the book the old man is reproducing. He is at first outraged by the content (pornography being illegal at the time), but when the old man says the whole city is waiting for the book he shows some interest and perhaps embarrassment about never having heard of the author. He reports later to the King that he found the culprits and had each flogged fifty times.</p>
              <p>Jung-bin invites him around for tea, to thank him. When a bee lands on her he violates all protocol risking his death, by going beyond the curtain and brushing it off her shoulder. Jung-bin however does not report his attitude, and thanks him instead. She also appears to be very fond of him.</p>
              <p>Yoon-Seo writes an indecent book himself and returns to the shop to present to the shop keeper, asking him to read it. The shopkeeper, Hwang is impressed and they decide to copy and sell his work. His book becomes a best seller.</p>
              <p>To get his books to sell better he asks Lee Gwang-hun to illustrate them for him. At first he is outraged but in the end accepts. Meanwhile Jung-bin sends him an embroidered kerchief, by means of her eunuch, who asks him to not accept the present, or else Jung-bin will be wanting to meet him. He does accept though, and later meets Jung-bin, in private. They start to cuddle, but Yoon-Seo leaves when she attempts to kiss him.</p>
              <p>The illustrator has trouble understanding some of the things he is supposed to draw, so next time Yoon-Seo meets Jung-bin, he has him hide behind a wall, and spy on them while they have sex. Yoon-Seo writes about his affair with Jung-bin in his next book. When she forces the one of her maids to tell her, she goes to the shop and confronts Yoon-Seo. She tells him to divulge the name of the illustrator Gwang-hun. However he refuses to betray him.</p>
              <p>Jung-bin has Yoon-Seo sent to the town prison, the prison for which Gwang-hun the illustrator is responsible. In the presence of Jung-bin, Yoon-seo is tied to the ceiling and severerly beaten with sticks.</p>
              <p>Gwang-hun wishes to stop but Jung-bin decides to call the matter to the King's attention. They tie Yoon-Seo to a contraption, and Gwang-hun turns the handle until the bones of his legs snap in half. The King is satisfied with the torture but Jung-bin wants to continue, after their meal. During meal time Gwang-hun removes him from jail, so he can escape with the help of the book publisher, the shopkeeper. However Jung-bin's eunuch follows them and a fight ensues in between the people from the shop and a group of warriors the eunuch brought along. The shopkeepers are no match for the warriors, however Gwang-hun does put up a good fight. In the end he is beaten but is forced to leave with the people from the shop while the eunuch takes Yoon-seo back to his jail. Gwang-hun is left alive because Yoon-seo threatens to claim the eunuch is the illustrator, which would be possible because he did come with Jung-bin to all their meetings. On the way back the eunuch becomes more worried about what Yoon-seo may say and attempts to kill him. One of his warriors however chops off his hand to avoid him stabbing Yoon-seo. The eunuch is shocked and the warrior asks him why he disobeyed an order. The eunuch tells him he had an order from his heart also (he is secretly in love with Jung-bin, and became a eunuch to stay with her); at which point the warriors shoves his dagger through the top of his shoulder and down through his heart.</p>
              <p>Yoon-seo is brought back to the palace and to Jung-bin and the King. Jung-bin decides he has had enough. The King asks her about her sudden change of mind. And tells her how he knows that what she had wanted Yoon-seo to say all along was not the name of the illustrator, bu that he loved her. The King can not understand why he did not lie and say he loved her.</p>
              <p>The King tells the servant to castrate him and make him a eunuch so he may be with Jung-bin for the rest of his life, even though the operation may kill him due to his age. Jung-bin intervenes and takes all the blame saying she used her influence to seduce him. Yoon-seo then confesses his love to her. Jung-bin says she will wait till they meet again in the next life. The King is overcome by anger and grief, as he was most in love with her, and at first wants to personally kill both Jung-bin and Yoon-seo. He decides against this though, as he realizes that it would be useless as they would just be reunited in the afterlife, and leaves them both alive.</p>
              <p>At the end Yoon-seo is sent to live in exile on an island, where he continues to write. Jung-bin remains at the palace "to rot". Later it is revealed that the words "indecent" were branded on Yoon-seo's forehead as part of his punishment.</p>
              <p>The film ends with Yoon-seo, Gwang-hun and the shopkeeper walking along the shore, talking about future works, which include their first homosexual male erotic story, and even the discovery by Yoon-seo of the basic principles of animation or "moving pictures" .</p>

              <p><strong>My Review</strong>: With  a viewership of 2,200,000 upon its release in 2006 in South Korea, this ought to be a movie not to be missed. Don't worry, with its censorship, not much is left for expectation.</p>

Then, a lady named Jang-eun (Kim Jeong-Eun) and her step-brother Sung-Chan (Jin Ku) compete in the Kimchi dish contest, with both siblings using their mother's kimchi recipe. Jang-eun is a famed chef in Japan who returns to Korea to compete in the contest. Jang-eun also wants to close down "Chunyang-gak" - the traditional Korean restaurant that her mother has been running. Jang-eun has felt that her mother loved the restaurant more than herself and her own daughter. Meanwhile, Sung-Chan wants to keep the restaurant and proposes to his step-sister that the winner of the Kimchi contest should have the rights to their mother's restaurant.</p>

              <p><strong>My Review:</strong> Not easy to follow as the story jumps here and there but the answer lies in the end of the story. Pretty gruesome scene and is indeed realistic. Korean horror movies are really not bad.</p>

              <p><strong>My Review:</strong> This is the remake of the 1960 movie of the same title. Compare to the amount of antisipaction and review of this movie, I cannot agree to their views. I must say that the cinematography is excellent but too much time is spent on this that it took away the lead actress opportunity to display her acting skill making the movie plot a little hasty. So.......the moral of the movie to me is think twice before you think of having an affair with the housemaid. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><strong>My Review: </strong>This drama is currently being screened on channel U. Although the title of this drama is not impressive, the drama is. It is often to the mother's eye that the woman the son choose will alway fall short of her expectation. As such, family conflicts happened. From petty conflicts like housework to favourism, from children to money. It is indeed happenning. Outstanding performance by the mother-in-law and the second daughter-in-law Wu-Mi.</p>

Gumiho or Nine Tails Fox has the ability to transform themselves into human form and has the desire to become a human, often looking for love. Other horror tales depicit them to be consuming human liver in order to maintain its form.</p>
              <p>This drama is about a mother Gumiho seeking revenge on the human who killed her daughter for her liver in order to save the human daughter.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Poor nutrition and unsanitary conditions take their toll; many die of </span><a title="Dysentery" href="/wiki/Dysentery"><span style="color: #000000;">dysentery</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">, including Kashiwara. The troops begin using the caves. Kashiwara's replacement, </span><a title="Army ranks of the Japanese Empire during World War II" href="/wiki/Army_ranks_of_the_Japanese_Empire_during_World_War_II"><span style="color: #000000;">Superior Private</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> Shimizu, arrives for duty. Saigo suspects that Shimizu is a spy from </span><a title="Kempeitai" href="/wiki/Kempeitai"><span style="color: #000000;">Kempeitai</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to report on disloyal soldiers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The first American bombings occur, causing significant casualties. A few days later, </span><a title="United States Marine Corps" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps"><span style="color: #000000;">U.S. Marines</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> land. The American troops suffer heavy casualties, but the beach defenses are quickly overcome, and the attack turns to the positions on </span><a class="mw-redirect" title="Mount Suribachi" href="/wiki/Mount_Suribachi"><span style="color: #000000;">Mount Suribachi</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. While delivering a request for more machine guns from his commander to the Suribachi garrison, Saigo overhears Kuribayashi radioing orders to retreat. The commander, however, ignores the general and instead orders his company to commit suicide. Saigo runs away with Shimizu, convincing him to continue the fight rather than die. They find two other soldiers, but one gets incinerated by an American flamethrower, and they witness a captured Marine being </span><a title="Japanese war crimes" href="/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes"><span style="color: #000000;">bayoneted to death</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Saigo and the soldiers in Mount Suribachi try to flee with Lieutenant Oiso at night, but they run into Marines, who wipe out all except Saigo and Shimizu. They flee to friendly lines, but are accused by Lieutenant Ito of betraying </span><a title="Bushido" href="/wiki/Bushido"><span style="color: #000000;">bushido</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> by surviving a defeat. Ito raises his </span><a title="Katana" href="/wiki/Katana"><span style="color: #000000;">katana</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> to execute them for cowardice, but Kuribayashi arrives and saves Saigo again by confirming his order to retreat.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The Japanese soldiers attempt a futile attack against US positions, but take heavy losses. The survivors are told to regroup with Colonel Nishi. Ito heads to the US lines with three mines, intending to throw himself under a tank. The next morning, Okubo, Nishi's executive officer, shoots a Marine, who is subsequently captured. Despite Colonel Nishi's attempts to treat his wounds, the American dies within hours. Nishi finds a letter from the American's mother and reads it to his men. As a bomb hits the cave later on, Nishi is blinded. He orders his men to another position and orders Lieutenant Okubo to leave him a rifle. Upon leaving, the soldiers hear a gunshot from Nishi's cave.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Saigo suggests surrender, and Shimizu reveals that he was dishonorably discharged from the </span><a title="Kempeitai" href="/wiki/Kempeitai"><span style="color: #000000;">Kempeitai</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> because he refused to kill a dog for his superior, who was simply annoyed by its barking. Shimizu and another soldier attempt to flee, but Lieutenant Okubo shoots the other soldier, while Shimizu escapes. Shimizu surrenders to a patrol and finds himself with another POW. The patrol moves on, leaving them with two Marines, but one of the guards cold-bloodedly shoots them. The dead soldiers are found by Okubo who uses it as a lesson against surrender. Weeping, Saigo wraps Shimizu's </span><a title="Senninbari" href="/wiki/Senninbari"><span style="color: #000000;">senninbari</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> over his corpse.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Meanwhile, Ito, desperate and malnourished, breaks down and, when found, surrenders. Saigo and the survivors find the cave is under attack, and a fierce battle rages. While running across a crossfire point, they lose several men, including Okubo. They rendezvous with General Kuribayashi, and one last attack is planned. Kuribayashi orders Saigo stay behind and burn all documents and letters, including his own letters, saving Saigo's life a final time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Attired as a common infantryman, Kuribayashi launches a final charge at the head of his surviving soldiers. Almost all are killed, and Kuribayashi is mortally wounded. The general's loyal </span><a title="Adjutant" href="/wiki/Adjutant"><span style="color: #000000;">adjutant</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> Fujita drags him away. The next morning, Kuribayashi asks for himself to be beheaded. As a weeping Fujita raises his katana to behead Kurabayashi, he is shot dead by an American </span><a title="Sniper" href="/wiki/Sniper"><span style="color: #000000;">sniper</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">. Saigo arrives, having buried some of the documents and letters instead of burning them all. The dying general orders Saigo to bury him where the Americans will never find his body. The General draws his </span><a title="M1911 pistol" href="/wiki/M1911_pistol"><span style="color: #000000;">M1911</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> – a gift from an American officer (</span><a title="Mark Moses" href="/wiki/Mark_Moses"><span style="color: #000000;">Mark Moses</span></a><span style="color: #000000;">) before the war – and commits suicide. In tears, Saigo drags Kurabayashi's body away for burial.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Later, a US patrol find Fujita's body. A Marine Lieutenant finds Kuribayashi's pistol and tucks it under his belt. They search the area and find Saigo with his shovel. Seeing the General's pistol in an enemy's possession, an enraged Saigo attacks the Americans with his shovel. Too weak to fight properly, he is knocked unconscious and taken to the </span><a title="Prisoner of war" href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war"><span style="color: #000000;">POW</span></a><span style="color: #000000;"> beach. Awakening, he glimpses the setting sun and smiles grimly.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The film ends with modern archaeologists uncovering the letters and documents that Private Saigo buried in 1945.</span></p>

              <p><strong>My Review:</strong> The story of the battle of Iwo Jima between the United States and Imperial Japan during World War II, as told from the perspective of the Japanese who fought it. I probably need to watch it a second time to comprehend the movie better</p>
