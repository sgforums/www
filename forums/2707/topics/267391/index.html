            <div class='col-md body'>Myth #1<br><br>Falun Gong practitioners burn themselves to go to Â“HeavenÂ”.<br><br>This is Chinese communist propaganda. Firstly, Falun Gong strongly condemns the taking of lives, whatÂ’s more suicide. A full sub-chapter is devoted in explaining why the taking of lives is prohibited.<br><br>Moreover, many neutral human rights NGOs had voiced their suspicions to this issue and even called it a hoax. The following are some independent extracts.<br><br>Several human rights NGOs have condemned the incident as a government staged hoax to escalate the persecution of Falun Gong. For example, Karen Parker of the International Educational Development states at the 53rd session Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights, United Nations:<br><br>"State terrorism in the form of Government terror against its own people produced far more gross violations of human rights than any other form of terrorism; an example was China's treatment of the Falun Gong. The Government had sought to justify its terrorism against Falun Gong by calling it an evil cult that had caused deaths and the break-up of families, but the organization's investigation showed that the only deaths and resulting family breakups had been at the hands of Chinese authorities, who had resorted to extreme torture and unacceptable detention of thousands of people. International Educational Development had discovered that a self-immolation cited by the Chinese Government as proof that the Falun Gong was an "evil cult" in fact had been staged. The international community and the Subcommission should urgently address this situation."[2]<br><br>Furthermore, the NGO International Education Development (IED) at the UN Human Rights Commission in August 2001, stated:<br>"This government took out this so-called self-immolation incident that happened on January 23, 2001, in Tiananmen Square and used this as evidence against Falun Gong. We have reached the conclusion after watching a videotape on this incident, that this incident has however been completely orchestrated by the government.<br><br>Despite calls from the international community to allow independent investigation teams to enter China to conduct a thorough check, the Chinese government (CCP) refused. If the communists are so confident of their side of the story, why will they refuse a investigation team while the accused Falun Gong practitioners were the ones who strongly requested for more investigations and exposure? IsnÂ’t it another hoax by the CCP again like the lies they tried to concoct during the SARS crisis?<br></div>

It is more of a spiritual faith. It has aspects of Qigong or Yoga. I don't think you will call practicing Taichi a religion, will you? However the world community does consider us a religion although we ourselves don't.<br><br>I am a Falun Gong practitioner and I had never experienced any form of brainwashing. We live within society and anyone is free to join and leave as they wish. Not even a name register is maintained. Honestly, I don't even know the majority of my fellow practictioners....<br><br>What makes you think there is brainwashing? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
