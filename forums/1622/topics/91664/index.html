            <div class='col-md body'>i believe ppl change perspective after coming out to work, they begin to see many things that they wouldnt even think about while schooling, when this happen, their needs change too. That is why i feel that Guys or gals should only settle down after they have started working a few years. Financially stable and probably wiser to their needs.</div>
