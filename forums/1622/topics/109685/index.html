Generous coats of mascara for lashes, comb well.<br><br>close-set eyes<br><br>Close-set eyes are often due to a slender nose. To create the illusion of width, apply color wide. Start shadow well away from eye's inner corner blending up and out with the more intense shade at outer limits. Line the outer half of the eye and then apply light shadow to inner corner. Blend. Apply Mascara on outer lashes only.<br><br>deep-set eyes<br><br>Use light shade from lash to brow, slightly darker above the crease on brow bone. Use eye pencil or liner on both top and bottom of the eye, smudge to soften. Generous coats of mascara for all lashes, comb well.<br><br>round eyes<br><br>To make them appear more almond-shaped, use light-toned shadow all over top lid, darker in entire crease. Line top and bottom lid, extend liner out and up at end. Mascara for top lashes only, more on outer half.<br><br>wide-set eyes<br><br>Apply a light to medium shade from lash to brow. Place darker shadow shade near eye's inner corners, continuing across lid and feathering out lightly towards temples. Focus liner, mascara on inner corners.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Eye Shadow Application</strong><br><br><strong>Step 1</strong> Apply highlight color to brow bone area from inner to outer eyebrow. Use your brow bone as a guide. Here's a tip, if you would like to make your eyes appear to be more wider, apply highlight from the inner corner of you lower lid to the middle of the lower lid.<br>Typically, you should use three colors for contouring and highlighting your eyes. The lightest color will open and brighten your eyes.The medium color will give slight depth to eyes and the darker, and the contrasting color will give depth and shape to the eyes. You should ALWAYS use brushes to apply eyeshadow. Throw away those nasty foam applicators they give you<br><br><strong>Step 2 </strong>Apply medium contrast to your lid crease. (Open your eye and where your lids crease in the middle, this is the crease area.) Blend slightly into your highlight areas to avoid a demarcation line.<br>Highlight color<br>Highlight color<br><br><strong>Step 3</strong>  Apply the darkest contrasting color to the outer, lower lid along the eyelashes. Blend into the medium contrast color. You can choose to skip this step if your eyes are wide set<br></div>

To make eyes look bigger or wide-set: Start mid-lid, extend liner just past the end of eye, blend upward. When using liquid liner, hold outer corner of lid taut and apply using quick short strokes.<br><br>Top - You may choose to use a pencil or liquid liner. Pencils come an assortment of sizes. The fatter the pencil, the more smudged look you'll get. Liquid liners are a little tricky, but once you get the hang of them, you may love the look as much as I do. Liquid liners will give a more dramatic, defined look.

You need to give a base coat of foundation and powder for the eye make-up to "stick" to. Even if you don't want to wear foundation, just apply it to your eyes.<br><br>Pencil liners tend to smudge and wear off easier<br><br>When using liquid liner, (this is my specialty <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">, The first thingyou should do is make sure the brush is extremely thin! If it isn't, your line will be too thick and hard to manage while putting on. It's best to buy cosmetics from stores that will take them back. CVS does this .<br><br>Liquid liner- Wipe the excess off when you pull the brush out of the tube. I find that if you wipe it on a clean piece of plastic, then when you need to re-load the bush, use the extra that was left on the plastic. It not only saves on the liner but you can control how much is on your brush.<br><br>Extend the liner slightly past the corners of your eye for that cat look that's in<br><br>I've heard that if you apply white liner to the inside bottom lid it makes your eyes look brighter.
