I told that to him online cos I cudnt say it face to face, I know I would break down and I did, but luckily he din have to see my tears. I dun wan him to feel guilty or anything, cos nobody is to blame in this matter, it is just that we are both not ready and we have different ideas and expectations in a relationship...<br><br>yes I am disappointed and I think this decision is the best for both of us, cos no point dragging it on and on and it will only hurt more later on. So I told him that it will be better if we don't see each other for now so that it is easier for us to move on and forget about the whole thing.

And he said it won't be something of long term commitment cos we will graduate in 1 year and 1/2 time. So he wants us to be together for this time and after we graduate, we will go our separate ways. So I asked him if he loves me at all, and he said it is not possible for him to love anyone now cos it is just not practical. I was already very disappointed by his answers...but still I told him yes, I would try it...<br><br>but after he went back, I thought things thru and decided that it is best for us to just break up and not see each other anymore because the longer this drags on, the more I will get involved emotionally, as opposed to him. I am afraid if I don't break up now, it might just cause me more pain later on. So i told him that I can't see him anymore because I wanted to forget him and move on with my life. I told him to take care and wish him all the best, maybe he will find someone better than me for him in the future, someone he will enjoy being with and also someone he feels he can commit to for a longer term. He remained emotionless thru out the whole thing, asked me to take care and call him when I am ready to see him again, but I told him mebbe I won't be able to do dat for a long time le. So said my last goodbye to him and haven't spoken to him since 2 days ago  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>My frens saw him yesterday and said he looked miserable, like it is my fault he is now feeling that way. But I like to believe that this is nobody's fault and we will soon be able to move on and be happier even if it is without each other. Right now, I guess I am feeling a bit empty, so I tried to swamp myself with work to get him out of my mind lor...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
