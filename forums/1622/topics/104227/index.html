            <div class='col-md body'>Ever know what's a moon sign is? A moon sign is different from your Sun sign, well it can be the same at times, but it depends on your birthdate and birthtime. A moon sign will be able to tell you about your personality...as well as how you would fare in the relationship area.<br><br>I have a book on Moon Signs..and I would like to know if it is accurate or not. So far I have had this book for 3 years and I have done readings on Moon Sign for various people and they told me that it has been accurate so far...so I would like to get more opinions <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>So if you are interested in finding out and helping me to find out how accurate a Moon Sign is in describing your personality, drop me a reply here. Please include your birth time, birth date, as well as birth place (Singapore, Malaysia, etc..if you are born in US, pls do let me know wich region as US is big, so it has several different time regions) If you dun wan ppl to know, give me a PM...but I will post the reply in this thread, I just wun reveal your exact birth time and date and place, but I will let you know what Moon Sign you are.<br><br>Looking forward to this <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i.c.y</div>

And they are perfectionists, or at least strive very hard to achieve perfection in their life. You are also a very hardworking person, someone who is idealistic, sometimes too much so. And another thing is you are always very concerned about your health lor, so you tend to get into diets and such things. All of these make you to be a workaholic sometimes and someone who can be over critical to yourself.<br><br>So when you fall in love, you tend to analyze every aspects of it...you ask yourself whether this is real or not, whether it will last or not, all these kinda questions. But the good thing is you are not likely to be a sloppy person, because you are very concerned about your outer appearance as well. You can be very witty when you want to, so often there is a sparkling and bright side of humour lurking below the surface. And you are a great sparring partner when it comes to intellectual debates <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You can also be amazingly sentimental, once you feel close and comfortable with someone. You would have to find someone whom you can trust, and similarly trust you.<br><br>I hope this is true. I am paraphasing most of the stuff in the book.<br><br>i.c.y<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Elindra's husband:<br><br>You are a Leo. You have an incredibly regal bearing deep inside, a definite nobility of demeanour which inevitably seems to come across. You are determined to be a star in one way or another. With you, it is unlikely that you will keep your deepest feelings completely hidden, it is just not in your make-up to hide too much away. The Moon in Leo is bound to create a flamboyant and dramatic sort of personality, perhaps overly so sometimes. You are also a great charmer and you reacts quickly to people and situations. You are warm, witty, lovable and generous. However, you can also be domineering and hates to take the second place...<br><br>You like to be the authority and are not agraid to shoulder responsibility. You also have a great depth of understanding for other people's moods and feelings, even if that bossy side of your personality does rear up from time to time. You have a lot of love to give, and being in love is the most wonderful thing in the whole world. When you have found the right soulmate, it is like caviar and champagne time, you would want to give bucketful of love to her because you will place her on the pedestal, and treat her like a goddess.<br><br>However, the only snag is that you would also want to be treated like a god, you also enjoy the idea of being powerful. You would like to be worshipped and to worship at the same time.<br><br>Life with the lovable lion of the Zodiac can be full of sunshine and happiness, and you will have plenty to give to the person you are convinced to be your destiny and she will have plenty to give in return as well.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

You have an incredibly regal bearing deep inside, a definite nobility of demeanour which inevitably seems to come across. You are determined to be a star in one way or another. With you, it is unlikely that you will keep your deepest feelings completely hidden, it is just not in your make-up to hide too much away. The Moon in Leo is bound to create a flamboyant and dramatic sort of personality, perhaps overly so sometimes. You are also a great charmer and you reacts quickly to people and situations. You are warm, witty, lovable and generous. However, you can also be domineering and hates to take the second place...<br><br>You like to be the authority and are not agraid to shoulder responsibility. You also have a great depth of understanding for other people's moods and feelings, even if that bossy side of your personality does rear up from time to time. You have a lot of love to give, and being in love is the most wonderful thing in the whole world. When you have found the right soulmate, it is like caviar and champagne time, you would want to give bucketful of love to her because you will place her on the pedestal, and treat her like a goddess.<br><br>However, the only snag is that you would also want to be treated like a god, you also enjoy the idea of being powerful. You would like to be worshipped and to worship at the same time.<br><br>Life with the lovable lion of the Zodiac can be full of sunshine and happiness, and you will have plenty to give to the person you are convinced to be your destiny and she will have plenty to give in return as well.<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Thanks Icy, his is very accurate.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, I am getting to my PMs now. So life, it is your turn <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Sorry to have taken a while, but I really did have a lot of requests in my mailbox now. So be patient peeps, I will get to yours soon <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Alright life, you are a Saggitarius in your Moon sign. It is very hard for you to keep anything hidden. You can be unbelievably tactless when you let your emotions get the better of you. But Sagittarius is also the sign of the Sage and Counsellor, the Higher Mind, and Long Distance Traveller of the Zodiac, so it shouldn't be too difficult for you to devise a philosophical approach to hel you understand the workings of your mind. This sign also instil in you a deep need for independence as well as the freedom to lead your life as and where you choose it. You cannot be tied down, mentally or physically. You are often the happy go lucky and optimistic character, you have the ability to pick yourself up and start all over again even when you have come face to face with difficult situations. You have a good sense of humor, and is someone who doesn't mind making mistakes as long as you are going to learn from them. However you can also be careless and over indulgent, and if you are into gambling, then you can get too obsessed with it.<br><br>More often than not, you are the life and soul of any party. You are definitely a people person. You are also restless however, so although you are a passionate Fire sign, you are also definitely going to look before you leap to avoid getting trapped in a relationship.<br><br>You tend to enjoy an outdoor life and often a very sporty one. You have an irresistible boyish charm (if you are a guy) and you will have an infectious sense of humour and a friendly, open smile to everyone you meet. You can easily be recognized from the warmth and generosity, because you truly do want to make people happy and make sure that they have fun around you, and when the days seem awfully dull, you are the perfect person to look for to make life brighter again.<br><br>You will want a sort of open, esay-going relationship and you will have no qualms about spoiling your soulmate with an abudance of love and affection. Your sense of humor will most of the time, be sufficient to see you thru any quarrels you might have with your other half, because you are someone who can always see the funny side of everything and make a joke about it to lighten things up.<br><br>Life with you will be happy and full of love, and in you your partner can be assured that they have found their loyal, life-long best friend.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To akira-sg...I got your PM <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Thanks for writing in. The moon sign is different from Sun sign, which is the kinda zodiac reading that most people know. Moon sign is mre about your emotions, your personality and how you would be in your love life.<br><br>So I checked yours and I found out that you are a Leo. I have already done a reading for a Moon Leo above (refer to Elindra's Husband's reading) so you can refer to that reply. Anyway you are also a Aries in your sun sign, so you are someone who seeks the limelight but isan enthusiastic and enterprising personality, if at times a little too bossy. However, there is also a sensitive soul inside you, it is just that you dun really show that side too often.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, now it is SwtHippy's turn. I checked your Moon Sign from my book and found out that you are a Moon Geminian. I am thrilled actually to do your reading, cos I think I know quite a bit about this particular sign, since my ex-crush is also of Moon Gemini, and I have discussed this with him before.<br><br>Alright, here goes. You are bound to be a very good communicator. You have to admit that you are not the quietest of people, even at the quietest of times. You are destined to be a wonderfully bright and quick-witted personality, brimming over with mental energy, full of imaginative ideas and curious about everyone and everything around you. You are drawn to the written and spoken word like a fish to water. You will be able to sense and feel things very quickly...it is not going to take you long to know if you liek a person or not, or whether you feel comfortable in ac ertain spot. You are in the fortunate position of being right with your first impressions. Your Gemini Moon can also make you an intellectual dynamo, a very quick reader and someone who is naturally gifted at handling the latest high-tech gadget. However, you are also restless and impatient, and often you lack concentration. It is hard to focus on one thing when you are interested in so many others that are going on around you. You are also sometimes very fickle-minded and flirtatious. You are very inquisitive about everyone else in your life but you enjoy being somewhat evasive yourself when you feel like it. You are an interesting and mentally stimulating companion, but sometimes you can be too changeable in your feelings and emotions.<br><br>You tend to have a logical side to your nature that refuses to let you trust your intuition. And if you get a reputation for being a flirt, you have only yourself to blame. Because you think you are missing out on soemtihing, you are always dashing from one to another. You will need someone who is patient, someone who can provide you with the mental stimulation that you crave in any emotional relationship.<br><br>You can be humorous, spontaneous and is able to conduct a conversation about more or less everything and anything under the sun. You have the gift of knowing to say just what the others like to hear, and maybe this is one of the traits that endear people to you. You often flit through life with an irrepressible yet certainly amusing refusal to grow up (think Peter Pan).<br><br>You really do appreciate the values of friends, with whom there need be no holds barred. You like someone who is intellectual, witty, flirtatious, quick-witted and mercurial, just like the way you are all above. One thing you need not to be worried about is that you will be boring. You can be flirtatious, this will not disappear overnight, but with the right soulmate, he/she can rest assured that your flirtation is anything more than party chat.<br><br>Life with you will never be of one with boredom. And since you are the communicator of the Zodiac, your partner does not need to worry about communication when you are away from them, because with you, the phone will always ring.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

You will need a lot of mental stimulation and loyalty from your partner.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

And they are perfectionists, or at least strive very hard to achieve perfection in their life. You are also a very hardworking person, someone who is idealistic, sometimes too much so. And another thing is you are always very concerned about your health lor, so you tend to get into diets and such things. All of these make you to be a workaholic sometimes and someone who can be over critical to yourself.<br><br>So when you fall in love, you tend to analyze every aspects of it...you ask yourself whether this is real or not, whether it will last or not, all these kinda questions. But the good thing is you are not likely to be a sloppy person, because you are very concerned about your outer appearance as well. You can be very witty when you want to, so often there is a sparkling and bright side of humour lurking below the surface. And you are a great sparring partner when it comes to intellectual debates <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You can also be amazingly sentimental, once you feel close and comfortable with someone.
