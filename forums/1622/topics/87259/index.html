In marriage, for man, woman is a need, and for woman, man is security.<br><br>2.                  A man is attracted to a woman when the woman makes him to feel masculine; similarly a woman is attracted to a man when the manÂ’s presence makes her feel feminine.<br><br>3.                  Attraction for utilisation is the motto of womanhood, and impress to achieve is the goal of manhood.<br><br>4.                  Man expects physiological and psychological care with personal attention from his woman, whereas woman expects emotional and psychological care from her man to possess him for protection and security.<br><br>5.                  Men are motivated and empowered when they feel needed, and women are motivated and empowered when they feel cherished.<br><br>6.                  For man, first physiological needs are to be satisfied in sex, then only he turns to emotional needs; whereas for women, first her emotional needs are to be satisfied, then only she can turn to her physiological needs: that means man feels his own feminine after his maleÂ’s is satiated, similarly woman feels her own masculine after her femaleÂ’s is satiated.<br><br>7.                  In any inter-personal interaction, other than verbal, in marriage, he is active but she is receptive; she being fulfilled, he is fulfilling.<br><br>8.                  Even in the interpersonal relationship in marriage, manÂ’s priority is to achieve his goal, whereas womanÂ’s priority is the importance of their relationship.<br><br>9.                  The six different kinds of emotional support for love in marriage are: -<br><br>(i)                She needs caring, he needs trust.<br><br>(ii)             She needs understanding, he needs acceptance.<br><br>(iii)           She needs respect, he needs appreciation.<br><br>(iv)           She needs devotion, he needs admiration.<br><br>(v)             She needs validation, he needs approval.<br><br>(vi)           She needs reassurance, he needs encouragement.<br><br>10.            In any inter-verbal interaction between couple, if wife is overwhelmed husband tries to advice with solutions, or mistakenly tries to defend himself; so also in the pensive mood of husband the wife tries to improve him.<br><br>11.            WomanÂ’s communication is for sharing, but manÂ’s is for solving.<br><br>12.            WomanÂ’s thinking is expanding but manÂ’s is purpose-oriented, similarly their talking also prevails.<br><br>13.            A womanÂ’s attitude is empathetic, whereas a manÂ’s is self-oriented.<br><br>14.            (a) In a relationship, woman expands to serve the needs of others, whereas man contracts to build focusing and self-absorption.  Man has focused awareness and feminine has open-awareness.<br><br>(b) In an irk-some position, because of open-awareness, women tend to blame themselves first and due to focused awareness men to blame others first.<br><br>15.            In stress and tension: -<br><br>(a)          Man needs solutions for which man goes to his cave and woman likes to share in a non-focused way.<br><br>(b)         Men increasingly focused and withdrawn while women become increasingly overwhelmed and emotionally involved. He feels better by solving the problems and she feels better by talking about the problems.<br><br>(c)          A man needs time and space to find objective solutions, so he becomes increasingly focused and withdrawn; whereas a woman needs time and attention to find her subjective solution, hence she becomes increasingly overwhelmed and emotionally involved.<br><br>16.            When a man is upset, he wants to be alone; whereas, if a woman is upset, she needs companionship and love.<br><br>17.            In a serious situation, man thinks and processes lonely, tests his outcomes outside, reassesses them on account of reactions and arrives at the solution; whereas woman thinks and processes loudly to tap her intuition.<br><br>18.            In marriage, man wants the right to be free and expects to be allowed for his own privacy; whereas woman wants the right to be upset and expects to be understood.<br><br>19.            Woman involves others for her decision-making, but man only consults in his decision-making.<br><br>20.            Men like rubber-bands suddenly pulls away, distances himself and comes back on his own; whereas, a womanÂ’s self-esteem, like waves, rises and falls, and it hits bottom for emotional house-cleaning.<br><br></div>
