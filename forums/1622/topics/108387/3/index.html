If tired then go home and rest la.<br>(Hai, ask her to wait for me for three hours almost everyday i also very gek sim. Ask her to go home means that i won't get to see my dear girl. How? But if she's tired i'll let her go home and rest rather then stay up and wait.<br>I want her to take care of herself and have a proper rest also. Can't bear to see my dear girl so tired.)<br><br>Girl: Huh. Ok lor. Bye...<br>(Why why why??? He don't understand? I feel like a fool calling him and hoping that he'll want to meet me. Upset.......)<br><br>Guy: Ok Bye, i'll call you when i'm free *Put down phone*<br>(I hope i've made the right decision by letting her go rest. Maybe i'll drop by her house and surprise her with something she always like after i've finished my work...*GRINz...**very tired*<br>Hope to see her looking fresh!)<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote>quite true....happen to most people <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
