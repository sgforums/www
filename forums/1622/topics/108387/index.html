            <div class='col-md body'><strong><br>discuss leh!!!<br><br>I believe that there are some differences in how men and women communicate or act. Otherwise there wouldn't exist so many books and jokes on this topic. :-P<br><br>I'm not a great psychologist, so let me just name a few examples. The man's views are mine (and those I observe on my friends), the woman's views are (C) Orchid.<br><br>Solving a problem:<br>When a man cooks and the sauce gets all burnt, he uses the f-word repeatedly and cooks a new sauce. He appreciates it when the woman helps him make a new sauce.<br>When the same thing happens to a woman, she just wants to be hugged and comforted. Making a new sauce is secondary.<br><br>Subtle hints:<br>There is a list (ofcourse written by a man) instructing women how to behave in presence of a man. One rule is, "say what you want! Subtle hints don't work." Altho that list probably isn't supposed to be taken very seriously, this statement sure has some relation to real life. :-)<br><br>"I love you":<br>Man: assumes the statement to be valid until revocation. No repetition needed, or very seldom.<br>Woman: the statement expires after 24 hours and has to be repeated within this time span.<br>...Yeah, okay, it's a little bit exaggerated.<br>But really not much. :-)<br><br>On a side note, there's a description of the perfect day for both men and women. :-) I hope the translation from German to English didn't mess it up too terribly.<br><br>I think learning to understand each other, and handle these differences, is an essential part of the relationship. This might - depending on the partner - require more or less time and tolerance, but isn't this what love is all about? I wouldn't want to miss these differences, as I feel they can contribute so much to a relationship.<br><br></strong><br><br>example:<br><br>ger: do u love me? (used cos she wanna hear him say yes.)<br><br>guy: why must u keep asking the same question. not sian har.<br>( y u so fan ren)</div>
