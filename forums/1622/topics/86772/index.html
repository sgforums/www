            <div class='col-md body'>More and more couples are ordering wines for their weddings and the trend seems to be going towards their buying the wines directly from wine merchants instead of from the hotels where certain hotels/restaurants still charge a very high price for what is most often their cheapest wine in the house.<br><br>To offset this couples should always have that little "reserve" up their sleeve by keeping their options open to entitle them to bring their own wine. If the outlet refuses to budge tell them you'll take your wedding elsewhere and they will soon change their minds. The fact is that most of the better hotels and restaurants do not practice this archaic method of bleeding every last ounce of revenue out of couples and actually now encourage couples to bring in their own wines.<br><br>So what wine do you want to use ? Well it is obvious that in this part of the world, red wine is the most favoured for weddings. Apart from their lucky colour, it is the wine most preferred to do a toast with.<br><br>The best wine for weddings is NOT the cheapest and certainly not the most expensive. A wine that is "drinkable" for everyone including wine lovers and novices is probably the best choice. These can be obtained from quite a few wine shops and you should be able to go along to taste the wines before committing. Don't be afraid to say you don't like the wine, after all YOU are paying for it and it is YOUR guests who should enjoy what you think is right.<br><br>From our own stable we have found 3 wines that are extremely popular and they are the Pipers Creek Classic Red , the Olivia Newton John's Koala Blue Shiraz, and the Vino 88 mild Shiraz as prime examples of very drinkable and acceptable wines for weddings. At the moment they are available for an exceptionally low price of $210/ case of 12 which works out at $17-50/bottle which is an amazing price for such drinkable wines.<br><br>Make sure the wine merchant also ensures delivery to the outlet and the good wine shops will usually allow you a few extra cases on consignment in case you think you may run out.<br><br>Another feature which is (at the moment) exclusive to Wine BOS is that we will make one of the bottles a souvenir bottle with the couples picture on it and done in a nice gift box. This wine can be kept for a year and then opened on the first anniversary. Again the bottle need not be thrown away as it can be used as a flower holder (a rose during Valentine's Day) for many romantic moments.<br><br>For more information on Wine BOS wedding wines please visit our web site www.winebos.com, under the link "Wines for Weddings".<br><br>This article is contributed by Charles Stephan, Director, Wine Bos Pte Ltd<br></div>
