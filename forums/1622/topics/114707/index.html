Perhaps sit in front of the class, record down whatever he is going through ... anything you dont understand , go back home refer to it ..... what you can do is when u get home to study ... those parts u cant understand , highlight them  then ask your friends or tutor. ... since you said you have no time in sch, get your tutor's hp number, ask him whethere u can ask him on the phone , this is one of the ways lor ..<br><br>Yeah, no point letting the relationship drag on since he can't commit.... well its understandable that both of you cant talk to each other because of what happened. Well, move on with your life .... he is not the only guy around, there are plenty of guys around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I share with you my experience. I broke up was not because we didnt love each other, it was because her family doesn't want her to be with me because we are far apart. She was in China and I was in Singapore. Got to know her while working in Wuhan. The last day we saw each other was one of my worst days of my life. I was being forced to give up with someone that I really put my heart into .... took me quite a while to get over here. Even now and then I think of her but I told myself If i really like her , I should think of her first, as long she found someone to love, I should be happy for her.  So , same goes to you ... dont think too much ok ?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Perhaps sit in front of the class, record down whatever he is going through ... anything you dont understand , go back home refer to it ..... what you can do is when u get home to study ... those parts u cant understand , highlight them  then ask your friends or tutor. ... since you said you have no time in sch, get your tutor's hp number, ask him whethere u can ask him on the phone , this is one of the ways lor ..<br><br>Yeah, no point letting the relationship drag on since he can't commit.... well its understandable that both of you cant talk to each other because of what happened. Well, move on with your life .... he is not the only guy around, there are plenty of guys around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I share with you my experience. I broke up was not because we didnt love each other, it was because her family doesn't want her to be with me because we are far apart. She was in China and I was in Singapore. Got to know her while working in Wuhan. The last day we saw each other was one of my worst days of my life. I was being forced to give up with someone that I really put my heart into .... took me quite a while to get over here. Even now and then I think of her but I told myself If i really like her , I should think of her first, as long she found someone to love, I should be happy for her.  So , same goes to you ... dont think too much ok ?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>woot~ first part of problem done!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> After I have been to two Office Hours, bugged both the professor and the teaching assistant, finally managed to complete part 1 of the assignment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> So now on to part 2, hopefully will at least get dat part done before I got to work at 11pm tonight...<br><br>Anyway, yea it is hard for me to talk to him now cos I might just break down the moment I see him. I want him to at least remember me smiling...I have always promised myself that my loved one will never see my tears. So yea, I hope one day he will find someone who he will truly love and will love him back...funny why I still feel this way even tho he hurts me the most?<br><br>i.c.y</div>
