            <div class='col-md body'>TRUST is a very important factor for all relationships.<br>When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust<br>leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and<br>enmity may result in separation.<br><br>A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call.<br>She answered, "Public Utilities Board." There was silence. She<br>repeated, "PUB."<br><br>There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she<br>Heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my<br>Husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is."<br>Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the<br>telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of "PUB".<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NO POINTING FINGERS<br><br>A man asked his father-in-law, "Many people praised you for a successful<br>marriage. Could you please share with me your secret?" The<br>father-in-law answered in a smile, "Never criticise your wife for her<br>shortcomings or when she does something wrong. Always bear in mind that<br>because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better<br>husband than you."<br><br>We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are<br>afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake,<br>he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at.<br><br>This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we<br>point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing<br>at ourselves.<br><br>If we forgive others, others will ignore our mistake too.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS?<br><br>A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and<br>requested "I am looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable<br>one."<br><br>The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking,<br>polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing.<br>Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I<br>don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for<br>conversation and be silent when I want to rest."<br><br>The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand you need<br>television."<br><br>There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a<br>blind wife and a deaf husband, because the blind wife cannot see the<br>faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of<br>the wife.<br><br>Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of<br>perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of<br>love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of<br>roses.<br><br>The nightmare begins.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>NO OVERPOWERING<br><br>Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another,<br>or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer<br>all and their spouses will change the bad habits after<br>marriage.<br><br>Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries<br>the meaning that "It is easier to reshape a mountain or a<br>river than a person's character."<br><br>It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the<br>spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness.<br><br>It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our<br>expectations..<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>RIGHT SPEECH<br><br>There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that "A speech will<br>either prosper or ruin a nation." Many relationships break<br>off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other,<br>we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without<br>considering if it would hurt the other party.<br><br>A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A<br>worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily!<br>Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home,<br>her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you<br>will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered, "You should<br>appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and<br>not you."<br><br>Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad<br>relationship.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>PERSONAL PERCEPTION<br><br>Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be<br>another man's poison. A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the<br>way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them ride on the<br>donkey?"<br><br>Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey.<br><br>He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The<br>husband is the head of family.<br><br>How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?"<br>Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the<br>donkey.<br><br>Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can<br>the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman."<br><br>The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey.<br>Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can<br>you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you."<br><br>Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the<br>donkey and carried it on their shoulders. It seems to be the only choice<br>left.<br><br>Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled.<br>They lost their balance and fell into the river.<br><br>You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you.<br><br>Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future.<br><br>Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is<br>clear..<br><br>_________________________________________________________________<br><br>BE PATIENT<br><br>This is a true story which happened in the States.<br><br>A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement,<br>his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint of<br>the truck.<br><br>The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's<br>hands into pulp as punishment.<br><br>When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital.<br>Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he<br>finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands.<br><br>When the boy woke up from the surgery &amp; saw his bandaged stubs, he<br>innocently said, " Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked,<br>"but when are my fingers going to grow back?"<br><br>The father went home &amp; committed suicide. Think about this story the<br>next time someone steps on your feet or u wish to take revenge. Think<br>first before u lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be<br>repaired.. Broken bones &amp; hurt feelings often can't.<br><br>Too often we fail to recognise the difference between the person and<br>the performance. We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge.<br><br>People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions<br>we take while in a rage will haunt us forever.<br><br>Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient. Forgive &amp; forget.<br><br>Love one and all.<br><br>If you judge people, you have no time to love them.<br></div>
