Panic and happy.. 6 mths we din contact each other and we ended in a big hooha situation. how come hes back?? as the message goes sent and receive.. we found our passion back again.. he tol me : remember i said.. i will take care of you when nobody wants you?? i got melted and confuse. is he tryin to tell me he lied or is he trying to proof something.. well.. i was in cloud nine that time that i chose to believe that he wanted to fufil it.. ha..<br><br>well. things went well.. we are back in love again.. parents of both side. tot it was unbelievable... and so do frenz.. they predict we will live happily 4ever.. and we did .. maybe should amend happily into ....for a while.....<br><br>the next one year was pretty okiee.. we shared a bit more activites than more we used to.. the love was more matured than the first one we had.. but not that matured though.. we still face the same problem we used to have and etc.. including getting pregnant again. hahahaha we are pretty active huh? and no protection.. thats wat my best friend said.<br>i did the same thing.. knowing that it will hurt me.. but maybe i was numb.. din reali feel that hurted anymore.. although it hurts physically..<br><br>and the same thing happened about two mths later.. he wanted to break up.. i was extremely sad and felt it more painful than losing my own flesh.. and we dragged and he changed into a diff person.. finally i surrender and agreed to the break up...<br><br>i duno why.. but i think i can feel this strong spirit around me trying to be my child.. coz i got pregnant again.. i reali duno how to deal.. i tol him well.. same attitude as usual.. avoiding and keep telling me that he do not love me anymore.. wats new.. i ask myself.. but somehow or rather god wants me to go through a more painful lesson.. he changed his mind after a few days.. and tol me that he wants to marry me and he realised he love me deeply.. wat can i do at that time?? i agreed and we proceed.. it was a shotgun marriage which every gal never wanna face it..<br><br>we got married in a very worrying situation.. i was still under age at that time.. and we even needed a witness to approve the consent.. a marriage which is not so beautifully paint in my actual tots of ' marriage'<br><br>things went okiee.. for the first few months during the preparation.. probably we were still in shock that we are gettin married and going to be husband and wife.. we were happy and glad.. he even said : i will be the happiest man in the world when the baby is born.. i was glad.. tot god gave me a different perception of love and life..... we are happy that having a new member in our life.. but then i got a miscarriage..i think i have ruin my woman's ability to carry a child from the previous harms..... on that day itself .. i was crying like nobody's business... i tol him.. if he wants to call it off.. its okiee with me since i have lost the baby... but he tol me he married me coz he love me not bcoz of the baby.. wah.. again i was in cloud nine... we proceed to the 'true love' and we are prepared to get married..the preparation was so busy that i think it keeps us in love for many months..<br><br>the first few months after the big day.. okiee... things was as per normal.. maybe we are tryin to get use to US seeing each other and US being forever together.. and staying 2gether with my inlaws and sis inlaws.. i wasnt quite comfi abt it.. probably i came from a broken family.. and his parents was so loving that they are always out with each other.. and my poor mum.. home alone.. i start to go home once a week.. to acc my mum.. but bcoz hes working on shift.. i cant get to see him much on alt weeks.. i start to go home more and more. as it was a shorter route for me to get to work too.. as times goes by.. our feelings fade.. i wasnt very impress by his lifestyle and the way he borrow $$ from me, our account and his parents.. and his perception of life.. maybe due to his govt working enviroment too.. he is so slack and he can never understand the word 'out for living' and the word 'jobless'.<br>and i was thinking.. wat a husband i have!<br><br>well.. as people said... you lose something you gain something.. i gotten a beta offer from a competitor.. and the package was good.. much more beta than the previous one.. i start to go out clubbin oso and entertain some of my fren to make sure the connection was there.. to prepare for a new challenge.. i was very busy and stress in the first few months of my new job.. can tel that i was more concern abt my dressing code.. image and also character.. which he dont understand why that sudden change in me.. i begin to get sick of the things he make me do and the way he treat me like a sex slave sometimes.. no foreplay usuali.. its was so routine and quick.. and his family lifestyle..sometimes just piss me off...<br><br>god played a trick on me again.. i was carrying his child again.. i knew it came at the wrong time.. and i was fearful to have it again and with my new job prospects.. and with the situations we are going through.. i abort it again.. maybe you wil think i am heartless and sefish.. but i think it will be more cruel to make him stay in this world and doesn't get the love.... he needed and as for myself... i cant go through any dissapointments again. he agreed too..<br><br>after this.. we have numerous fights about small and big matters which all couples wil face..<br><br>he never tried to understand me.. and never done his part as a husband. he tol me he regretted marriage.. he was being stressed by me and family.. which was totally the opposite. his words stabs like a knife direct into my heart... it was painful.........<br><br>he intial a separation finally.. i should have knew this day would come.. but i was just trying to avoid it and took things for granted.. i moved back home. avoided him and draggin the time and issue of signing the letter. but after dragging for several months.. i gave up.. i know this time was real for us to reali go on our separate ways..<br><br>i signed the letter.. our marriage last less than a year.. i avoid all family function and dinners to prevent myself feeling like a idiot and impulsive.. its was a painful process.. but i think i have gone through it..<br><br>few months later ...i met a guy about 14 years older than me.. two kids..had a good career and quite good looking.. kind hearted and warm.. totally diff from my ex.. tot god is trying to reward me.....<br>i accepted the facts that it was 'set meal' bot burger and came with fries and coke.. but i never tot, it could be so miserable.. my love and attention was shared with them.. and we can never be intimate with each other infront of them.. it was weird.. but maybe its my retribution.. smile.. from my previous sins... things are not working smoothly with the current bf i have.. maybe its just a fling again..<br><br>we are stil together. but as i have tel my best friend.. i cant never be in love with someone anymore. the thing i am looking for is security.. i still cry for my current boyfren for the things he upset me. but the love was shallow and surface onyly.. i can never again love someone deeply..... i still love my ex.. i still go into deep thought often for the things we enjoyed and spent together... still take out the pictures of us smiling and hugging ..... tears will rolled down from my cheeks.. how i wish i can turn back time.. and have a perfect marriage.. i think i was impulsive and i feel regretted about everything but i do not have the courage and pride is getting on my way.. to go back or try it out.................................but i know in actual fact... nothing will get us back together anymore. never again.. i just heard that he gotten a gf.. i wish him the best..<br><br>i wrote this story.. becoz i wanted to let it out from my chest.. everyone in this world.. things that i am a strong gal......... and thinks that i am able to take and accept all this.. but nobody knows how painful and miserable i am.. sometimes i just wish i could just vanish from this world.. but i cant.. and also for some educational purpose.. think before you act... follow ur mind not ur heart.. .<br><br>last of all.. i just wanna say something i wanted to long time ago but dont have the courage.. :<br><br>hedear i still love you a lot.. i am sorry.<br>babies.. i do have a reason everytime i lose you... i am sorry.. may you find heaven a better place than with me..<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;"><strong>rape case</strong></span><br><br>This is really a sad story......<br><br>My name is Vivian, and I am 18 years old. I have a<br>little sister and<br>brother. As a family we live in what is supposed to be<br>a secure<br>apartment. At 9.15 am, May 14th, 1999 a huge crowd had<br>gathered<br>around our apartment. They screamed, "Butcher the<br>Chinese! Let's eat<br>pigs! Lets have a party!" We live of the 7th floor and<br>we got a call<br>from a family on the 3rd floor saying that the crowd<br>had reached the<br>2nd<br>floor. They even chased some occupants upstairs. We<br>were all very<br>frightened.<br><br>In our fright we prayed and left everything in God's<br>hands.<br>Afterward we left our room and went upstairs to the<br>top floor, as it<br>was<br>impossible to go downstairs and escape. We got to the<br>15th floor and<br>stayed with some friends. Not long afterwards we were<br>surprised because<br>some of the crowd coming out of the elevators right<br>before we entered<br>the<br>room. We hurried into the room and locked the tightly.<br>At that time we<br>heard<br>them knock at the other rooms loudly and there were<br>some screams from<br>women<br>and girls. Our room was filled with fear.<br><br>We realized they could come to us. So we spread<br>throughout the room<br>hiding in the corners. We could hear girls of 10 to 12<br>years screaming,<br>"Mommy,mommy...mom...mom...it hurts." That time I<br>didn't know that<br>these<br>little girls were being raped. After about half an<br>hour the noise<br>diminished<br>and we had some guts to go out and check. It was<br>indescribable. A lot,<br>some<br>of them young girls, were lying on the floor. Oh my<br>God, what has<br>happened?<br>Seeing all of this we screemed and little sister<br>Fenny, screamed<br>histerically and hugged her father.<br><br>Tears started coming down from my eyes. With our<br>friends, a newly-wed<br>couple, we started going downstairs. Reaching the 10th<br>floor, we heard<br>a<br>scream for help. The scream was very clear and we<br>decided to go down<br>and<br>see. But as we turned we saw a lot of people. I saw a<br>woman in her 20s<br>being<br>raped by 4 men. She tried fight back but she was held<br>down tightly.<br>Realizing the danger we ran as hard as we could. But<br>unfortunately the<br>mob<br>caught Fenny. We tried to rescue her, but could not do<br>anything.<br><br>There were about 60 of them. They tied us up with<br>ripped sheets,<br>myself,<br>my father, my mother, Fenny, Donny, Uncle Dodi and my<br>Aunt Vera. They<br>led us to a room. Uncle Dodi asked what they wanted,<br>but they did not<br>reply. They looked evil and savage. One of them<br>grabbed Fenny roughly<br>and<br>dragged her to a sofa. At that time I knew she was in<br>great danger. I<br>screamed loudly but one of the mob slapped me in my<br>face. My father who<br>also screamed was hit with a piece of wood and<br>hefainted.<br><br>My mother has fainted when Fenny was dragged to the<br>sofa. I could only<br>pray and pray that disaster would not befall us. Uncle<br>Dodi kept<br>trying to stop them by offering money. His efforts<br>were fruitless. And<br>in<br>the end 5 people raped Fenny. Before beginning with<br>the raping they<br>always<br>said Allahu Akbar!(an islamic phrase in arabic meaning<br>God is<br>great!)They<br>were ferocius and brutal. Not long afterward, around 9<br>men came to the<br>room<br>and dragged me. I also saw them forcing and dragging<br>my Aunt Vera.<br><br>But at that time I passed out and everything blank. I<br>became<br>conscious at around 5 or 6pm. My head was hurting and<br>I realized I had<br>no clothing on my body. I cried and realized my family<br>was still there.<br>My<br>father was hugging my mother and little brother Doni.<br>I also saw uncle<br>Dodi lying on the floor and Aunt Vera was crying over<br>his body. I felt<br>so<br>weak and fainted again. The next day I was in the<br>Pluit hospital.<br>My father and mother were beside me.<br><br>With all the pains on my body I asked, "Mom, where is<br>Fenny? Mom?" I<br>felt a<br>stinging pain as I said these words. My cheeks were<br>swollen. My mother<br>cried<br>again and couldn't speak any words, while my father,<br>holding back his<br>tears,managed to smile at me. After 4 days in<br>treatment, my condition<br>has<br>improved. With a sad look, my father told me then what<br>had happened.<br>After I<br>fainted 7 people raped me. At that time my father<br>still couldn't see<br>well<br>after being hit with a piece of wood.<br>They raped me repeatedly.<br><br>Then my father said "Vivian, Fenny is gone..." I was<br>confused and cried<br>out,<br>"Why Dad?" My father couldn't answer. He told me to<br>rest and went out<br>of the<br>room. I cried over and over again,feeling that my life<br>had no meaning<br>any<br>more. A week ago, after I was released from the<br>hospital I was told<br>everything that had happend. When Fenny was raped she<br>kept on fighting<br>and<br>so he was repeatedly slapped by her rapists. The last<br>time she fought<br>Fenny<br>spitted on one of them. Offended, the man grabbed a<br>knife and stabbed<br>Fenny's stomach over and over again. Finally she died<br>with blood over<br>her<br>whole body. My father told me that uncle Dodi had the<br>same fate watched<br>by<br>Aunt Vera who was also raped. My aunt Vera now stays<br>with her parents.<br>She<br>is in shock. Her face is blank and refuses to eat.<br><br>Almost every hour my mother and I cry over all these<br>happenings. I can<br>never. These mobs of people are uncivilized<br>monsters.The scariest part<br>about all these is that most of the girls and women<br>were raped by<br>soldiers, whose jobs were to control the chaos. Some<br>were raped by<br>commoners, the rest by demonstraters (most of whom are<br>university<br>students).<br><br>Most of the victims were raped by a minimum of 3<br>men.The victims ages<br>ranged from 10 to 55. Most of the victims were raped<br>in front of<br>friends or family.Some were thrown into burning<br>buildings after being<br>raped (these were often witnessed by family and<br>friends). Most them<br>committed suicide. The rest of the surviving victims<br>are divided into<br>these sections, admitted into mental institutions,fear<br>of public<br>places,<br>fear of anyone male, did not report to authorities.<br>The list goes on<br>and<br>on.<br><br>Please forward this Yellow Ribbon to all friends<br>around the world to<br>show our soladirity and sympathy for the victims of<br>the riots and chaos<br>in Indonesia last May 13-15. Let us all remember them<br>in our prayers.<br>Because of their race, many Chinese Indonesian were<br>abused, tortured<br>and<br>killed. Their houses and stores were looted and<br>burnt.Hundreds of<br>Chinese Indonesian girls/women(aged 10-55)were<br>sexually harassed and<br>gang raped brutally.Some victims were even raped in<br>front of their<br>family<br>members or in front of inhuman cheering crowd. Some of<br>them were even<br>thrown<br>into the fire and burnt to death after being raped.<br>Yet, not many<br>actions<br>seem to have been taken to investigate all this or to<br>help the victims.<br>And<br>not every many people seem to know or care about what<br>happened. Please<br>pass<br>this ribbon around as the symbol of campaign.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong> Till death do us part<br>Date: July 10 2004 - 11:01:14 AM Author: love_hina84 </strong><br><br>Kelvin, being the only son in the family, was pampered by his parents. He was not only smart, yet hardworking and at the age of 20, he grew up to a handsome young lad and a promising future doctor waiting to receive education in university. He was often the topic among relatives as he was considered a clever lad and filial to his elders.<br>Little did one know about his dark secret, known only to him and his parents themselves. From young, Kelvin had a hole in his heart. Standing at 1.85m and weighing 72kg, an ideal body for guys, it was hard to imagine he was ill.<br>Being a doctor was his ambition from young, standing at the gate of his new school, he was elated to absorb more knowledge and a step closer to being a doctor.<br>School was easy for him as usual, even though he was in a foreign country, life was normal to him. He attended lessons attentively and was able to answer all questions given and amuse his lecturers with his wit.<br>On the first day of lesson,It was a lovely day when he met her--Lorraine. Lorraine was an attractive girl, with big round eyes, thin and red lips and her body curves were too good to be true. Guys look at her when she walk pass, woman with envy. Kelvin had noticed her in his lecture classes and was attracted to her at first sight. She was also intelligent and brilliant in answering questions raised by lecturers. Unknown to Kelvin, Lorraine was attracted to him too.<br>Despite many lessons together, they never had the chance to talk to each other. Then, one day, they were paired up to do project by their lecturer. They were both elated and excited but none shown their feelings. They met up often during lunch or after lessons to discuss their project and did research in the library together. They were drawn closer to each other. After the project, they were an item, an envy to both girls and guys but they had to admit, they were a match made in heaven.<br>They found it amusing that they were from the same country and it was not long that they rent an apartment and stayed together. Lorraine was very gentle and sweet and Kelvin was caring and loving towards her. They were blissfully in love and seldom quarrelled. Lorraine was always busy in the kitchen making meals for Kelvin while he did the housework in order not to tire her out.<br>They always find time to accompany each other at night and found activities to surprise each other. One night, they went to the beach, looking at the stars shinning and Lorraine lying on his lap. Looking down at his loved one, Kelvin found his heart ache.<br>'Dear, I love you! would you promise to stay by my side and never to leave me?' Lorraine asked.<br>'I love you too and i would never want to leave you. I will stay by your side to continue to make you laugh, hold your hands when you feel lonely, hug you when you feel cold and love you till i am no longer alive.'<br>'I never knew you could say such romantic and touching words. I wouldn't want you to die, even if i died, i would still love you. Even death cannot seperate our love.' Lorraine hugged Kelivin tightly as she said these.<br>It was their 1 year anniversary that day, Kelvin had went to consult a doctor. The way home was dreadful and long...In his mind, images were flowing.. Lorraine and his happy moments and what the doctor had just told him. He didn't have much time left. He was getting weaker. He closed his heavy eyelids as his vision got blurred. Tears flow from his eyes.<br>At their love nest, Lorraine was busy making dinner. She prepared his favourite--Steak. She was humming while cooking and waiting for Kelvin to come home. She could not wait to hand over her present. She bought a pair of rings and decided to propose to Kelvin that they get married. She heard the sound of keys and ran to answer the door. Hugging Kelvin and placing a kiss on his cheeks, she asked:'What took you so long? I missed you so much!'<br>She noticed the look on his face and asked what's wrong. Kelvin took her hand and lead her to the sofa. He clasped her hand and decided to tell her the painful truth. Words flow and Lorraine was devastated. Tears flow from her eyes, she could not believe what she had hear.<br>'Lorraine, i'm sorry. I don't think i can live any much longer. I think you should find another guy who can take care of you. I'm sorry.'<br>'What do you think i am? A gift? you kept me in the dark all along and now you told me just to get rid of me? All that you said were lies, you said never to leave me.. Lies..they were all lies..' She reached for the box that contained the rings and threw them at Kelvin. Hands wiping her tears, she ran out of the house, once which was their love nest.<br>Kelvin stood stone and clenched the rings that were left behind. He could not accept this fate. He ran after her. He ran past many streets, many people yet he could not find the one his was familiar. 'Lorraine, where are you?' He blacked out before he knew it.<br>Standing at the seaside, on the spot where they exchanged their vows. 'Oh God, why must this happen to us? we loved each other deeply, why must we be seperated?' She made her way back to their apartment after sorting out her thoughts. They could go seek a cure, go to all hospital and look for a suitable donor. There ought to be one somewhere.<br>What welcomed her was only am empty and dark house. Where was Kelvin? She thought to herself. Noticing the red blinking light at the answering machine, she reached for it.<br>'You have 13 unheard message'<br>'Lorraine, where are you? '<br>'Lorraine, i can't find you, where are you?'<br>'Lorraine, i'm sorry, i shouldn't hurt you! please come back to me.'<br>'Lorraine, Lorraine, Lorraine'<br>It was all Kelvin's voice, tears filled her eyes once more. 'I'm here Kelvin, where are you?' sobbed Lorraine. It was the last messange that drew her attention.<br>'This is calling from 'Evangelion Hospital, a patient by the name of Kelvin Tan was admitted. Would his kin come down to the hospital as soon as possible?'<br>Lorraine made her way to the hospital. Kelvin, Please make sure nothing will happen to you. Please... Everything happened too fast. Before she knew it, a car hit her and she lay there in a pool of blood.<br>'Call for ambulance!' she heard someone saying before she went into darkness.<br>When she awoke, she was in an ambulance. 'Bring me to Evnagelion Hospital! i wish to go there.' She kept screaming and screaming and the peramadics were unable to do anything. She was wheeled in to the hospital and undergo operation.<br>Lying in another operation room, doctors were trying hard to save Kelvin. His heart was pumping slower and getting weaker.<br>Over at Lorraine's side, things were getting worse, she was losing a lot of blood. 'i dun think we can save her, get in touch with her parents.'<br>'Where am i?' Lorraine asked weakly.<br>'You are in Evangelion Hospital, i'm sorry, you lost too much blood and ur lower ribs are broken.'<br>'I won't be able to live right? please give my heart to Kelvin Tan, he's in this hospital...please...' with these last words, Lorraine fell into a deep sleep.<br>Puzzled by her words and ability to talk so much as no patients he had seen could survive to talk. He checked the records and to his surprise, found a 'Kelvin Tan' just admitted and undergoing operation. He did tests and found out that Lorraine was a suitable donor.<br>Days later, Kelvin awoke to find his parents beside him. They were relieved he finally woke up.<br>'Are you alright son?' asked his mum.<br>'Yes...where's Lorraine?? Where's she?'<br>'Kelvin, Lorraine's dead..she met with an accident on the way to hospital to find you. She lost too much blood and... and...'<br>'No..i don't believe you, it can't be true..why am i not the one dead? why must she be the one? I don't wish to live anymore. She's no longer around, why should i live? it's all my fault.'<br>'Kelvin, you can't die, Lorraine donated her heart to you, you have a perfect heart now and doctors said that your body did not reject the heart, it fits perfectly..do you hear me??'<br><br>Kelvin was discharged from hospital after a week. He became a changed person. He moved back to the house he and Lorraine stayed. He stopped going to school and rejected visitors. It was weeks later that his father could no longer take it. He hired someone and forced open the door.<br>Kelvin was inside, wearing Lorraine's clothes, her mum almost fainted seeing this.<br>'Why are you in these??' roared his father, he was very angry to see his son wearing womans clothing.<br>'Uncle, Auntie you are here..i'll go get Kelvin' Replied Kelvin.<br>He went into his room and came out minutes later wearing his normal clothes. He looked fresh, no overgrown beard or untidy hair.<br>'Hi Mum and Dad, glad to see you here.'<br>'Why were you in Lorraine's clothes? why were you wearing woman's clothings? you shamed me throughly...'<br>'No dad..that wasn't me..that was Lorraine, don't you see? Lorraine is here with me..she isn't dead...she's in me.. i have her heart...We will be together forever..nothing will seperate us...not even death....Till death do us part is wrong, we are still together even death....'<br><br></div>
