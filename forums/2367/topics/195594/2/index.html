            <div class='col-md body'>Anabolic steroids, both oil and water based need to be injected intramuscularly (deep into muscle tissue). The most common place for intramuscular injections are in the buttocks, outer side of the thigh, and in the deltoid region of the arm. These muscles are preferred by many because of their thickness. These sites have a large number of muscle fibers and extensive fascia. Fascia is a type of connective tissue that surrounds and separates muscles. Because of this, the steroid or liquid being injected has a large surface area and a vast blood supply, which is better for absorption. When injecting, the goal is to go deep into the muscle tissue WITHOUT hitting major nerves and blood vessels. The best site for injecting is in the gluteus medius located in the upper outer area of the buttocks (see picture). The upper outer area is elected because the muscle in this area is very thick and has only a few nerves. In this area it is not likely that you will hit a blood vessel and the chances of injury to the sciatic nerve. This nerve runs through the lower and middle area of the buttock. If this nerve is hit, you may be temporarily paralyzed and it is very painful. You will want to stay as far away from the sciatic nerve as possible.<br><br>www.steroids.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you pay $1000 for a 6 week cycles then you are getting ripped off big time. The most common cycle includes a base of testosterone stack with one or more compounds. One of the best steroids is Trenbolone Â– works for both bulking and cutting cycles, however not the best choice for endurance athletes.<br><br>Cycles vary in length from 2 weeks to "life cycles" where the user stays on all year round just changing the drugs from cycle to cycle. Following a 2 on 2 off cycle is becoming more common these days, I personally know one professional bodybuilder following this protocol. This type of cycle uses short acting steroids such as test prop, trenbolone, stanozolol and most orals.<br><br>Can steroids make your tests shrink... yes but can return to normal size by following the correct PCT protocols this can be reversed after the cycle. This does not decrease sexual desire or performance Â– in fact this actually may be increased. Some steroids can reduce sexual performance but this is for an entirely different reasonÂ… deca is well known for this.<br><br>They come in several different forms; the more common are intramuscular injectable and oral. Other forms are sub-lingual and creams. Creams are mostly used in HRT.<br><br>The injectable form can be injected into any muscle; these include the calves, quads, gluteus (buttocks), shoulders, pecs, biceps, and triceps. BTW the gluteus are much larger than the quads, chest or shoulder. This is the first site of choice in the medical profession when administrating intramuscular injections.<br><br>Just a few more points..<br><br>No one has ever died from steroid useÂ….
