            <div class='col-md body'>Hi m back from 2 mths BMT, P.O.P liao..<br><br>I realised over the past 2 mths i lost ALOT OF weight. Before BMT my weight was 64kg now its around 56-57. Wads wrong? Even ppl in gym that i go to commented i became thinner.<br><br>For past 2 mths when i m undergoing bmt, i only go gym during Saturday (the only time i m free. I do dips, flat bench, incline bench, flyes, rows, lat pull down, skull crushers... thats more or less about it..I avoid squats n deadlifts as these are too exhausting for me especially when i myself is already tired before i step into gym. I take protein powder to camp also.<br><br>ANy here got any suggestions for a good 1 day workout in weekend that isnt too taxing n at same time able to regain my muscle mass back or at least maintain my weight  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You are way overtraining.......<br><br>Army training is already pretty taxing esp during bmt which focus alot on PT.Plus that with your weekend training hardly give your muscle any rest and for them to grow properly again after they are worn down from the stimulation of taxing training,so after this 2 months,more and more of your muscle mass is eaten away.This is especially so that during the BMT phase,the rest period is also very little,average would be 6 hours i think,so overtraining with too little rest time,it is no wonder you lose so much mass.</div>
