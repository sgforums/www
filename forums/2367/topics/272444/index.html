            <div class='col-md body'>If you don't wanna hire a coach(and that's the best option provided he's a GOOD coach), I'd advise you to buy a book. Starting Strength comes highly recommended by many people but I've yet to read it. I'm currently reading the new rules of lifting and I think it's pretty good, though not perfect. Some of the things are a bit outdated already despite being a fairly recent book. That's how fast the fitness industry moves...<br><br>Anyway, NROL can be found at libraries if you want to have a taste...and I strongly suggest you do, plenty of good information there, and all in 1 book...better than you trying to scour the web for bits and pieces not knowing if they're even right or how they fit into the big picture.</div>
