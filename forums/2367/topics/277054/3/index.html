Or maybe practice makes perfect(and Ben has had quite a bit of practice). I don't think many people managed to flip it the first time they tried. The tire has been weighed and it is 247kg...Chaar has also mentioned that it's heavier than the 235kg tire used in this year's competition...besides 247kg isn't really <span style="font-style: italic;">that</span> heavy. If you search youtube, there are people flipping tires that are more than twice as heavy as this...</div>

Threading played an important role but like i said before, if we 500lb deadlifters have difficulties in the 260kg flip, i find it amazing that people that deadlift 200lb+ can flip 250kg tire.  im very puzzled.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>another possibility;<br>Opt's tire weight is 247kg whereas the one used at the 2006 prelim is more than 600lb. what i know is that the 2006's prelim was alot heavier. maybe the ACTUAL contestants can comment on that. that tire that we EXPERIENCED then was shitly heavy. the contest's one was light.<br><br>i dont know what kind of tires they used for the 2007 prelim, could be just the 200-210kg that was used in the contest.<br><br>anyway, in the past liao.<br>this cant put food on the table nor pay the bill. u guys go and enjoy yourself.</div>
