They're good for the forearms.)<br><br>Skullcrushers<br>Close-Grip bench press<br>*Dips (If I can do them with any decent form haha)<br><br>I do four sets of each excercise. The first set is a warm-up, second set a heavier warm up and two working sets next.<br><br>For isolation excercises like raises and curls I give myself a minutes rest and for compound excercises like benches two minutes - I'm still very weak so I need more time to recover.<br><br>Problems encountered is form and range of motion for deadlifts! Major problem here.. everytime I do them I feel my shoulders tearing and not my back? I'm quite concerned.<br><br>Comments?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have 1 day out of the week for your legs, which are some of your largest muscles. Then you have 1 day out of the week to train your biceps and triceps, which are relatively small muscle groups. It seems very imbalanced to me, even as far as bodypart splits go. You also have no vertical pull movements such as chinups.<br><br>How many reps are you doing for each lift? Are you going full ROM? What's the load like? To failure or not?<br><br>As for deadlift form, unless you post a video of yourself it'll be hard for us to tell you if your form's good or not. Meanwhile, check T-Nation for articles on how to perform the deadlift. There are at least 2 by Eric Cressey.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have only been a regular gym-goes since April. Maybe a month maybe?<br><br>Tempo? 3 seconds.<br><br>4 straight sets of 8 reps each.<br><br>For me, form goes first before load so I'm what you people will see as a light weight lifter. But it doesn't matter to me ; I'm happy knowing that I bench 30kg for 8 reps knowing that I will get stronger over time. For excercises like the bench press or squats I only do till failure only if I have a spotter on hand (which I don't usually as I haven't roped in any gym partners yet). Last time I pushed myself to failure I was pinned down by a barbell and it was only the help of two kind malay uncles who saw me that I was saved from being crushed under.<br><br>Full range of motion is something I cling to neurotically. I wouldn't call a push-up a push-up until I feel my chest hitting the floor.<br><br>My programme is more of an orientation into getting the feel of things - as you can see I'm still very new and I don't apologize.<br><br>As for pull-ups, I do them at home daily.<br><br>17 by the way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By tempo, we don't just mean the entire duration of your rep, but how the set is split up. If you have a 3 second rep, how much are you spending in the 4 stages of the lift, at the top, eccentric, at the bottom, concentric?<br><br>Tempo is usually written as a 4 digit number, the 1st digit being eccentric, the 2nd being pause at the bottom, the 3rd being concentric and the 4th being pause at the top. The 4th number may be ommited in many cases because many people tend to take a breather after every rep where the load is transfered to your joints, so it's not technically part of TUT.<br><br>So for example, a 301 tempo would indicate a 3s eccentric, no pause at the bottom, and a 1s concentric. An X on the concentric would indicate an explosive concentric movement where you try to move it up as fast as you can regardless of the load.<br><br>Anyway, as long as your loads are reasonably heavy for your strength, you should be fine. It's ok to stop 1-2 reps before failure, but obviously if you still have room for 10more reps when you stop, then you're not gonna progress. 8 reps is fine for a beginner. You can even bump it up to 10-12, but as you progress, you're gonna be bringing the number of reps down.<br><br>Anyway, my advice would be to switch to a full body compound workout, stick with the basics, and cut out the unnecessary/redundant lifts.</div>
