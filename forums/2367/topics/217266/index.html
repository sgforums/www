            <div class='col-md body'>Broadly speaking, there's two kinds of muscle in the world.<br>Real muscle and fake muscle.<br><br>There's only one kind of real muscle. There's two kinds of fake<br>muscles. We'll talk about both of them. One today, and one<br>tomorrow.<br><br>Virtually all of the guys and gals in the muscle comics have<br>fake muscles. In fact, the entire muscle business is built on fake<br>muscles. It's a great big pile of lies piled as high as the sky.<br>And it gets higher and higher every day.<br><br>Real muscles are muscles that can do things. Push, pull, lift.<br>They're the type of muscles you see in athletes. Boxers have<br>real muscles. Wrestlers have 'em. Martial artists have them.<br>Football players have them. Guys in the military and in law<br>enforcement have them.<br><br>Fake muscles are the kind that look good, but have little or<br>nothing to back them up.<br><br>There's an old line that football coaches used to use. Maybe<br>they still do. I first heard it from legendary Hall of Fame coach<br>Paul Brown.<br><br>"Looks like Tarzan, plays like Jane."<br><br>That's the difference between real muscles and fake muscles.<br><br>The difference between Jane (and face it, she looked great) and<br>Tarzan.<br><br>Fake muscles are the result of muscle pumping. Bodybuilding.<br>Or as I call it, and as it deserves to be called, boobybuilding.<br>Also known as bunny pumping.<br><br>Isolation exercises build fake muscles. Exercises like lateral<br>raises, triceps kickbacks, triceps extensions, concentration<br>curls, bent over lateral raises, pec dec squeezes, pulley<br>exercises, leg extensions, leg curls, and on and on. Machine<br>exercises. Virtually all of the stuff they teach you in the muscle<br>comics.<br><br>I was lucky. When I was a kid, I trained to be a better wrestler.<br>Not to look pretty, but to be strong, powerful, explosive and<br>athletic. And somewhere along the way I hooked up with some<br>good training advice (something that is amazingly rare), and I<br>built muscles that could actually do things. Things like<br>grabbing my opponent on a wrestling mat, taking him down<br>with a hard throw and pinning him before he knew what was<br>happening. In some cases, knocking him flat unconscious.<br><br>I did that to two different wrestlers in one day. Both of them<br>were older than me, very tough, very experienced, with good<br>records and good skills. Guys who were supposed to whip me<br>pretty easily. In fact, each of them was beating me on points<br>before I caught him with my best throw. When I did, I knocked<br>each of them out cold. Which you don't se very often in high<br>school wrestling matches. And I ended up winning the state<br>championship in Greco Roman wrestling.<br><br>I did it because I had built real muscles. If I'd spent my time<br>doing the boobybuilding stuff you read about in the muscle<br>magazines, I might have looked pretty, but those guys would<br>have eaten me alive on the wrestling mat.<br><br>It's become sort of a crusade for me. I want to help you build<br>real muscles. And I want to stomp on the guys who continue to<br>teach the pseudo stuff. They don't deserve to be hailed as<br>experts. And you don't deserve their goon babble. Not for a<br>minute.</div>
