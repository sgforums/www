            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm...just wondering what are the main reasons as to why guys like going to gym.<br><br>To start the ball rolling:<br><br>I used to be very skinny and was always teased upon during sec sch days. Also, alot of people used to look down on me because of my scrawny feature. Therefore, I decided to eat more and gain more weight and go to gym to build up muscles so the next time when there is a sec sch reunion or something, can make them eat back their words.</div>
