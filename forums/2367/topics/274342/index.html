If we do a full body workout, does that mean I cannot really go as heavy as I want to?

            <div class='col-md body'>The workout is meant to be done as a whole, not split up. If you want a split up program you'll have to redesign it rather than take a full body workout and chop it up into pieces...<br><br>You are not gonna be spending 30min on your chest. You're gonna be spending like 5min on it since there are only 3 sets of bench press. The only reason you get DOMS is because you train it too infrequently.

Most sports don't have much resistance to them, and may even promote muscular imbalance - that's where strength/resistance training comes in. For example, a tennis player or a baseball pitcher is gonna have imbalances between his arms/shoulders.<br><br><blockquote>How would you define a split up program? Is my above method ok?

Muscles cannot be separated like that. They cannot be isolated, and they shouldn't be trained that way in most cases. You're also grouping the stronger half of your body(legs) into one quarter of your workout. Can't you see that's also as you said, "out of proportion"? Why is it that all the muscles in your legs gets only 25% of your time, when shoulders, a MUCH smaller muscle group, gets the same limelight? Why not group it into: glutes, hamstrings, quads, calves, torso? I'm not saying that's right either, but you do see the problem in splitting things up this way...</div>

The idea is to blast 1-2 bodyparts as hard as you can, and let it recover for one week and it'll come back stronger and bigger. Guess what? Your muscles and CNS don't work that way. It can take more than a month for full recovery, so just because you don't feel sore anymore doesn't mean it has fully "recovered". In any case we're not aiming for full recovery. Training it with a higher frequency, lower volume but higher intensity will lead to higher strength and mass gains.<br><br>2) Your body doesn't work in isolation. It works as a whole. You can't do a bench press with only your pecs - your delts, triceps, and lats will come into play. No activity in real life isolates your muscles either, so why train in this way? It doesn't make sense.</div>
