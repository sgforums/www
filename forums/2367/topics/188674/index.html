Not to mention some of his other nifty little habits like thrusting his fingers through full cans of Coca-Cola and sending 300 pound heavy bags slapping against the ceiling with a simple side kick.<br><br>Strength training -- qua strength training -- was Lee's primary objective with resistance exercise. Later, as we shall soon see, his training evolved into more specialized applications that were beneficial to his specific goals as a martial artist.<br><br>http://www.mikementzer.com/blee.html<br><br><img src="http://www.completemartialarts.com/whoswho/actionstars/images/bruceflex.jpg"><br><br>Remember that Bruce Lee trains more for fuctional strength rather than for aesthenic purposes and btw he got his abs not by doing crunches but by doing good mornings and other compound exercises.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Navy seals training regime(Suitable for those who crave for endurance and army personnel/dragon boaters etc etc OR those who do not want to "pack on too much mass")<br><br>There are two workouts availiable here(Beginners and advanced)<br><br>Workout for Category I(Beginners)<br><br>The goal of category I is to work up to 16 miles per week of running. Then, and only then, should you continue on to the category II exercise. Category I is a nine week buildup program.<br><br>Running Schedule - Level I<br><br>WEEKS #1, 2: 2 miles/day, 8:30 pace, M/W/F (6 miles/ week)<br>WEEK #3: No running. High risk of stress fractures<br>WEEK #4: 3 miles/day, M/W/F (9 miles/wk)<br>WEEKS #5, 6: 2/3/4/2 miles, M/Tu/Th/F (11 miles/wk)<br>WEEKS #7,8: 4/4/5/3 miles, M/Tu/Th/F (16 miles/ wk)<br>WEEK #9: same as #7,8 (16 miles/ wk)<br><br>Physical Training(PT) Schedule - Level I (Mon/Wed/Fri)<br>Sets and Repetitions<br>WEEK #1: 4X15 PUSHUPS<br>4X20 SITUPS<br>3X3 PULL UPS<br>WEEK #2: 5X20 PUSHUPS<br>5X20 SITUPS<br>3X3 PULL UPS<br>WEEK #3,4: 5X25 PUSHUPS<br>5X25 SITUPS<br>3X4 PULL UPS<br>WEEK #5,6: 6X25 PUSHUPS<br>6X25 SITUPS<br>2X8 PULL UPS<br>WEEK #7,8: 6X30 PUSHUPS<br>6X30 SITUPS<br>2X10 PULL UPS<br>WEEK #9: 6X30 PUSHUPS<br>6X30 SITUPS<br>3X10 PULL UPS<br><br>* Note: For best results, alternate exercises. Do a set of pushups, then a set of situps, followed by a set of pull ups, immediately with no rest.<br><br>Swimming schedule - Level I<br>(sidestroke with no fins 4-5 days a week)<br><br>WEEKS #1, 2: Swim continuously for 15 min.<br>WEEKS #3, 4: Swim continuously for 20 min.<br>WEEKS #5, 6: Swim continuously for 25 min.<br>WEEKS #7, 8: Swim continuously for 30 min.<br>WEEK #9: Swim continuously for 35 min.<br><br>* Note: If you have no access to a pool, ride a bicycle for twice as long as you would swim. If you do have access to a pool, swim every day available. Four to five days a week and 200 meters in one session is your initial workup goal. Also, you want to develop your sidestroke on both the left and the right side. Try to swim 50 meters in one minute or less.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br><br>Workout for Category II (Advanced Level)<br><br>Category II is a more intense workout designed for those who have been involved with a routine PT schedule or those who have completed the requirements of category I. Do not attempt this workout unless you can complete the week 9 level of category I workout.<br><br>Running Schedule - Level II<br>(M/Tu/Th/F/Sa)<br><br>WEEKS #1,2: (3/5/4/5/2)miles 19 miles/week<br>WEEKS #3, 4: (4/5/6/4/3) miles 22 miles/week<br>WEEK #5: (5/5/6/4/4) miles 24 miles/week<br>WEEK #6: (5/6/6/6/4) miles 27 miles/week<br>WEEK #7: (6/6/6/6/6) miles 30 miles/week<br><br>* Note: For weeks #8-9 and beyond, it is not necessary to increase the distance of the runs; work on the speed of your 6 mile runs and try to get them down to 7:30 per mile or lower.<br><br>If you wish to increase the distance of your runs, do it gradually: no more than one mile per day increase for every week beyond week #9.<br><br>Physical Training Schedule - Level II<br>(Mon/Wed/Fri)<br><br>Sets and Repetitions<br>WEEK #1, 2: 6X30 PUSHUPS<br>6X35 SITUPS<br>3X10 PULL UPS<br>3X20 DIPS<br>WEEK #3, 4: lOX20 PUSHUPS<br>10X25 SITUPS<br>4X10 PULL UPS<br>10X15 DIPS<br>WEEK #5: 15X20 PUSHUPS<br>15X25 SITUPS<br>4X12 PULLUPS<br>15X15 DIPS<br>WEEK #6: 20X20 PUSHUPS<br>20X25 SITUPS<br>5X12 PULL UPS<br>20X15 DIPS<br><br>These workouts are designed for long-distance muscle endurance. Muscle fatigue will gradually take a longer and longer time to develop doing high repetition workouts. For best results, alternate exercises each set, in order to rest that muscle group for a short time. The below listed workouts are provided for varying your workouts once you have met the Category I and II standards.<br><br>Pyramid Workouts<br><br>You can do this with any exercise. The object is to slowly build up to a goal, then build back down to the beginning of the workout. For instance, pull ups, situps, pushups, and dips can be alternated as in the above workouts, but this time choose a number to be your goal and build up to that number. Each number counts as a set. Work your way up and down the pyramid. For example, say your goal is "5."<br><br>Number of Repetitions<br>PULL UPS: 1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1<br>PUSHUPS: 2,4,6,8,10,8,6,4,2 (2X # pull ups)<br>SITUPS: 3,6,9,12,15,12,9,6,3 (3X #pull ups)<br>DIPS: same as pushups<br><br>Swimming Workouts - Level II<br>(4-5 days/week)<br><br>WEEKS #1, 2: Swim continuously for 35 min.<br>WEEKS #3, 4: Swim continuously for 45 min.with fins.<br>WEEK #5: Swim continuously for 60 min. with fins.<br>WEEK #6: Swim continuously for 75 min. with fins.<br><br>* Note: At first, to reduce initial stress on your foot muscles when starting with fins, alternate swimming 1000 meters with fins and 1000 meters without them. Your goal should be to swim 50 meters in 45 seconds or less.<br><br>Stretching and Physical Training<br><br>Since Mon/Wed/Fri are devoted to PT, it is wise to devote at least 20 minutes on Tue/Thu/Sat to stretching. You should always stretch for at least 15 minutes before any workout; however, just stretching the previously worked muscles will make you more flexible and less likely to get injured. A good way to start stretching is to start at the top and go to the bottom. Stretch to tightness, not to pain; hold for 10-15 seconds. DO NOT BOUNCE. Stretch every muscle in your body from the neck to the calves, concentrating on your thighs, hamstrings, chest, back, and shoulders.<br><br>For more details about the Navy SEALs workouts and other guidelines, visit their web site at Navyseals.com<br><br>Moderator's note:Those who are in the armed forces as a regular or are atheletes may want to try this.<br><br>Source:http://sportsmedicine.about.com/cs/conditioning/a/012204_2.htm<br><br><img src="http://www.coreyrich.com/website/photo_essays/navy_seals/images/navy_03.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How does Randy get his amazing physique? Here is his work out and diet that he uses to remain healthy.<br><br>QUICK RUNDOWN: I try to do Cardio on the treadmill at a slight incline for 30 minutes, 3 times a week. I train abdominals 3-5 times a week. Chest, Shoulders, Back, Legs, once a week. I do Biceps and Triceps on the same day once a week. I try to work my neck 3 times a week, and my forearms the same. Stretching is very important to me. I stretch before and after I train.<br><br>TIME BETWEEN SETS FOR ALL MOVEMENTS IS 30-45 SECONDS<br><br>DAY 1: Legs<br>superset Thigh Extensions w/ Leg Curls : 4 sets - 12-20 reps.<br>Box Squats : 5 sets - 12 reps.<br>Straight Leg DLs : 4 sets-10 reps.<br>Calve Raises : 10 sets - 8 - 15 reps<br><br>DAY 2: Chest<br>Incline BB Bench : 3 sets - 20 reps.<br>Incline DB Bench : 5 sets - 6 reps.<br>Flat Bench : 4 sets 8 - 12 reps<br>Cable Crossovers : 3 sets - 15 reps<br>*every other week I do 10 sets of 10 pushups, with hands on a bench<br><br>DAY 3: Back<br>Pull downs : 3 sets - 20 reps<br>Seated Cable Rows : 3 sets - 12 reps.<br>T-Bar Rows : 3 sets - 10 reps<br>Bent Over Rows : 3 sets - 20 reps<br>Lower Back Ext. : 3 sets - 15 reps.<br>*one set of pull-ups to failure*<br><br>DAY 4 : Shoulders<br>Side Laterals : 3 sets - 15 reps<br>Front Laterals : 3 sets - 15 reps<br>Rear Laterals : 3 sets - 15 reps<br>Arnold Presses : 4 sets - 8 - 12 reps<br>Upright Rows : 3 sets - 8 - 12 reps<br><br>DAY 5 : Triceps + Biceps<br>Pushdowns : 3 sets - 20 reps<br>French Curls : 3 sets - 8-12 reps<br>Overhead Tri Ext : 3 sets - 8-12 reps<br>Close grip Pushdowns : 3 sets - 15 reps<br>Alt.

I stay away from carbs after 8pm or so. And as far as carbs go, I eat a limited amount, usually from mostly potatoes, oatmeal, and pancakes. I try to eat 250 grams of protein a day. About 60% of my protein intake comes from supplements. I like Isopure Meal Replacements, and Protein Powder. Nitro Tech is good as well. I also eat protein bars from Lean Body. Most of the protein I eat from food I get out of egg whites, steak, fish, chicken, milk, and cottage cheese. Sushi I eat around 3 times a week. If I have a sugar tooth, I like ice cream. It is hard to eat good on the road, but you can do it. There is no excuse to eat junk!<br><br>http://www.orton-source.com/randy/workout.html<br><br><img src="http://www.hotfair.com/images/upload/RandyOrton.jpg"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Now for a real training regimen.<br><br>All of the programs above have no science behind them what so ever.<br><br>I donÂ’t like to randomly post training programs as there are so many variable depending upon the individual, however after seeing the above programs I feel that many will be led down the wrong way thinking that this is the way to train. You have to also remember that almost all of the people performing the above programs are not exactly natural.<br><br>I will just list the strength training program and does not include movement prep or core training. I have also included basic exercises that most will know Â– but are not particularly what I would normally prescribe.<br><br>The goal of this program is general Â– focusing on both hypertrophy and strength utilizing undulating periodization. This is not a beginners training program but more for someone will a little training experience.<br><br>Training Session 1<br><br>Reps: 10-12 Sets: 4: Tempo 2-1-2-0 Rest: 45 sec between supersets<br><br>A1.

Standing Military Press<br><br>Reverse Leg Curls Description:<br><br>Kneeling on a lat pulldown machine with feet hooked under the knee pads facing away from the machine. Have a bench in front about 2-3 feet. Lower the body under control keeping the shoulders, hip and knees in line so that the hamstrings are loaded. You may find you can not lower all the way, just catch yourself in a pushup position the push yourself back to that starting position catching with the hamstrings on the way up.<br><br>First thing I guess people will say is where is the arm training? Well there is none at this point. Focus on the basics Â– the arms will take care of themselves. In saying that, what ever you do, do not use wrist straps Â– or a beltÂ… oh and no glovesÂ… use chalk for gripÂ… you can pick up from any rock climbing shop for a few bucks.<br><br>Depending on your recovery you can perform 2 days on 1 day off, or if you need more recovery then 1 day on 1 day off.<br><br>I know everybody says this but remember technique form should dictate the loadÂ… I still see everyone performing such poor form.<br><br></div>

(He wasn't too popular with animal rights activists in Tokyo.)<br><br>Oyama's Strength Training<br><br>According to Oyama's 1958 book, strength and speed are more important than skill for Karate, and speed more important than strength.
