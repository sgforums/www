Pls feel free to comment.<br></blockquote>First off, amino acids are the building blocks of protein. Simplistically, there are non-essential amino acids, which are those that your body can make on its own, and there are essential amino acids, which are those that your body cannot make on its own and must be supplemented by diet. Whole proteins are those that contain all the various amino acids, and these in food these can be obtained by all kinds of meat, and dairy products. Protein can also be obtained from beans, legumes and some vegetables, but these do not contain all the amino acids and are hence not whole proteins. Simply put, it's best to eat more whole proteins and supplementing with amino acids.<br><br>As for your question, there is absolutely no study that proves that a diet high in protein causes liver/kidney problems in healthy individuals. The only studies that show problems are those performed on subjects that ALREADY have these problems. People then took these studies and used them as evidence against a high protein diet...very untrue and very idiotic. So, unless you already have underlying problems, eat more protein.</div>

Like I've said there has been NO studies linking a high protein diet with kidney failure in healthy individuals. Zero. Nada. Zilch. Believing that it does based on plain conjecture and then avoiding a high protein diet is like believing there were WMDs in Iraq based on zero evidence and then invading them. You're just looking for an excuse to do it...</div>
