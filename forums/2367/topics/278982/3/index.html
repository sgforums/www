So instead of protecting your heart, you actually become more vulnerable to a heart attack."<br><br>'Intensity: Build Your Heart Capacity<br>How hard you exercise refers to intensity. It goes hand-in-hand with acceleration because it involves challenging your body to go a little faster and work a little hard each time you exercise. This is how you build your heart capacity. Most people believe that exercising longer increases the cardiovascular challenge. But the key is to exercise harder, not longer."<br><br>This research shows only that <strong>pure slow jogging</strong> that does not give enough intensity on the heart is not good. Jog faster! Open up your stride for a higher cardio challenge!<br><br>Even in the article,<br><br>"To reverse heart aging and disease and build cardiovascular vigor, you need entirely different strategies."<br><br>"You can restore youthful heart and lung capacity with the right exercise challenge. But it doesn't mean pounding out the miles on a treadmill or spinning your wheels for an hour on an exercise bike. Instead, you need short bursts of challenges with rests in between to restore and preserve heart capacity. "<br><br>Yes, you need to challenge your heart, because the heart is like a muscle. However, that does not mean jogging is not good! It is just that "your body responds by making the exertion more efficient." But how about jogging along with interval training and gym?<br><br>The main thing about your article is challenging the heart. It all depends on the person jogging, how much intensity he puts on his pace. I certainly do not advocate slow jogging because it is a waste of time and trains nothing much.

One must run at a higher intensity so as to challenge the body in a different manner.

I apologize for that.<br><br>Well, the difference you mentioned is in terms of amount. It is not as if aerobics do not provide such benefits, but rather, a lower amount.<br><br>Just a question of yes and no. Do you agree that jogging trains the body in a different manner as compared to interval? If yes, there's no need for us to continue because that is what I want to mean.</div>

However, the same goes for bad form while lifting weights right?<br><br>This was why I said about chi running in an earlier post. It is a form of running which you utilise your body mass to run more efficiently, and to put less stress on your joints by not landing as hard on your feet.<br><br></div>
