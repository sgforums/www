Whether it is burying my face in the sand, you can test it out long term. I have told you my views, and I stick to my view that you need the occasional jogging to help you maintain your slightly-longer-distance speed. The way you breathe, the way you control your steps (read up on chi-running), the way you pace yourself, all matters.<br><br>However, I do agree whole-heartedly with the benefits of interval training for jogging, which is why I'm planning to include this in my exercising schedule.<br><br>All I can say is, doing both will greatly increase your speed in the shortest time possible.</div>

You are just plain lazy to go for a 20 min jog, and thus find articles to prove otherwise. There are easily many real-life examples (Note: Not research, is real life walking examples) that gym is bad for joints too. Yet why do we still do it? Cause we know that things do to a certain extent will not cause harm, but good.<br><br>Research shows jogging is bad? Research also shows humans are built for jogging. So if you are built for jogging/running, why would you believe a few articles that it is bad when even more articles out there claim it's benefits?<br><br>If you are just plain lazy to go for a short jog, admit it. There's no need to mislead others. There are easily many more articles out there listing the health benefits of jogging. Since you like research, this is a BBC news article about scientists research <strong>from statistics</strong><br><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/914829.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/914829.stm</a><br><br>For the people who actually claims jogging are bad, how many do jog actually?  Have a little understanding of <a href="http://www.chirunning.com/shop/home.php" rel="nofollow">Chi Running</a>. Once you can control how hard you land, control your running posture, you wouldn't say that occasional jogging is bad.<br><br></div>
