            <div class='col-md body'>I think there are different type of training?<br><br>A slightly lower weight like around 75-80% of 1RM weight for 8-12 reps give better muscle development while 85-90% of 1RM weight for 5-6 reps give better strength development.<br><br>Also some people may opt to do a drop set on a lighter weight for max reps until failure for maximum training effect.</div>
