Lastly, i sort of bulked up abit from when i started but it wasn't the plan. While i kinda get tired less now from my daily activities, sort of feel "healthier" but my weight has gone up and it's really busting my knee. How do i make progress without jeopardizing my knee? </div></blockquote>1) Not sure<br><br>2) No ratio. Just do the max you can do, and attempt to raise the max once in a while<br><br>3) lightweight benching. If you go Hougang gym, there's this particular trainer that is extremely helpful. He's there from Mon to Sat I think, and he tells me he wear long sleeve because he want to help but dun wan to get sweat on his arms. He's the only trainer I see so far who actually help without pple asking.<br><br>4) Do squats. Before I started squatting last time, my knee ache occasionally when I climb the stairs. Now it doesn't anymore. So I know well how deep squatting can improve the knees.</div>

And also I haven't tried what succeeded in deadlifts and squats. What I did was just keep going heavier. When you find your increase slowed down or stopped for a few sessions... you go lesser weight, and do more reps for a few sessions. Then slowly go up again...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For most of us, caliper measurements would be the only one worth getting(unless you have access to DEXA or hydrostatic weighing). Those scales and gadgets that claim to measure your bf% are extremely inaccurate. Trust me I've tried them before. Just within a 10min interval I can make it think I gained or lost 3-4% body fat.<br><br>However, caliper measurements need to be taken by someone who knows how to do it, and the more sites the better. 12 site is recommended.<br><br>For most of us however, just take pictures of yourself in your skivvies.</div>
