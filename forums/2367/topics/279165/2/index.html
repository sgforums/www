Interval training and training of movements are also important and helps you burn more efficiently.<br><br>The difference between our views is whether we should even jog at all.

What you can do is to consciously try to land on the whole foot. Try not to "bounce" too high, for it is inefficient, and put lots of strain on your joints. Try instead to "stride". Lean slightly forward so that you utilise gravity to help you jog.<br><br>Start slow to get a feel of the technique. Not that I'm very good at it, but I do consciously try to do these when I jog.</div>
