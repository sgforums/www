            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. Abit paiseh to be posting in this forum lah - I'm a total newbie when it comes to pumping iron. I only started going gym this month! 17 years old this year.<br><br>Anyway, my question is what are the bench press standards for the average gym-goer? I glanced through Men's Health and I read in an article how a truly fit individual should be able to bench one and a half times his weight.<br><br>I'm 60kg and I can bench maybe 4-5 reps of 40kg? That's only two-thirds of my own weight sia. One and a half times my own weight is 90kg. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>I'm interested in training up my upper body strength. I hope through strength comes shape.<br><br>My personal target right now is to eventually bench 1 set of 8 reps of 60kg.<br><br>When it comes to bench-pressing, what I'm doing right now is :<br><br>1 Set<br>12 reps x 20kg<br>12 reps x 30kg<br><br>I don't really bench 40kg - not much point right now because I can only knock out a few reps only? Usually do them just to gauge my strength once a while cuz when I do it I feel like there's a sixth sense warning my body what I'm doing is dangerous.<br><br>I know the pros here will laugh at me lah but spare a newbie some face.

Respect.<br><br>I'm also tempted to do something like that.. maybe just 2 or 3 sets? But I admit that's just my ego speaking; showing off in front of my friends (who are even skinnier and weaker than me haha).

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks<br><br>actually when i first started out i do the empty bar oni, but i find too light<br><br>so i go on 5 kg at either side which is 30kg, den slowly move on to 40 kg<br><br>actually i tink i can do more till 45 but my wrist just took too much pressure when i trying to lift back to the rack ( me do incline bench press)<br><br>and got a couple of time when i was doing till no 7 or 8 i got no more strength to lift back and have to rely on some one who saw me struggling to save me hurhur<br><br>so start with light weights first and see how much u can go<br>it also helps if u can have a training partner to minimise injury<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys. Just a little update. Looking for further advice.<br><br>My standard is now 40kg! Haha. But I'm not entirely sure how intense my bench-presses should be?<br><br>Hit the gym yesterday and I did 3 sets of 40kg with 8 reps per set.<br><br>I can do a set of 45kg x 4 reps? Tried to bench 50kg for 1 rep but arms just couldn't it, so I'll just take it that my current max is 45.<br><br>45 is 3/4 of 60kg! Still a long way to go but progressing I guess.<br><br>I do however, feel alot of strain around my chest and shoulders after the work-out. I feel that it's firstly because of my lack of proper stretching (I did 10 reps of 20kg on the bench press as warm-ups only) and also probably because I'm biting off more then I can chew. I was doing bicep curls and chest presses along bench presses, overall alot of emphasis on the upper body.<br><br>What is a proper warm-up for an upper bod workout?<br><br>What should my regime be to hit my target of 60kg?</div>
