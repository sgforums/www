            <div class='col-md body'>well, as I really wanna lose all those fats which I've gained over e last 1 yr, I signed up for a membership at CF near my office with a fren. Had also signed up some PT sessions also. However, I dunno if it was my expectations or is my PT really not up to standard. 10 days after I signed up, I was expecting him to call as he say tt he'll get back to me and my fren 10days later after working out a plan for us. However, 10days later, I was the one to call him and arrange a session with him. My fren already gave up and changed the PT liao. I thought tt I should give him a chance and proceeded with e first session. Well, I did learn how to use the machine. However, I was expecting for a food and nutrition plan or a exercise plan that he had in mind for mi written in pen and paper so I can see his "PLAN for me". However, there was nothing of that and he didn't even have the body analysis sheet tt I had done b4 I started the exercise. He only printed one after and asked  me if I have e one b4 then tell me I can juz refer to it. I asked him how many times should I train per wk and all? He didn't ask mi for my fitness goal, didn't plan anything. The most interesting part was my fren had heard from another PT tt e reason y my PT needed 10days to get back to us was coz he was out of town, not coz he was busy planning for other clients. it was rather disappointing. I'm comtemplating whether to give him another chance or to change him. Will b having a session with another PT tomolo as tt PT whom I signed up wif said tt he's gonna b away for a wk due to some matters which is so coincidental. coz when he's back, I'm gonna b away for my holidays. haizz.. need some guidance. thanks</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you should definately change him<br><br>The basic stuff a PT should at least offer is a nutrition and workout plan customised to your individual need.A better one will be one who can bring you to a higher level in having the necessary interaction skills to encourage you on sticking to the workout/nutrition plan.zzzzz what your current PT offer... teach you how to use the machine,you do not need a PT for that.You are paying good $$ for something any regular gym goer can teach you....Dump him.But well truth to be told,i doubt there are any good PT in Cali anyway......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well that i cannot be sure,but well you should still dump your current PT.B4 accepting the next one,make sure to ask first what plan can he come up with to assist you in your goals.If he cannot offer you customised nutrition/workout plan,request to speak to another PT,choose until you think you have the best availabe.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>well dun have to ask him to give you a whole nutrition/workout plan for now as i double he/she will want to or able to produce off hand.Just ask the person if he/she is able to come up with such a plan if you choose him/her,then ask some stuff on generally what the plan will consist so you know he/she is not bluffing the way thru.(You may like to do some minimal research on the internet first to get some basic infor)Thru talking with the person,you may also be able to feel something on whether he/she can motivate you.So try your best based on these criteria to get someone you deem is best value for the $$ you paid.<br><br>Anyway the best in the industry offer $$ back guarantee if you follow what they plan for you and there is no result,but well dun expect this from Cali....If you are interested,i can provide you their contact,but guess not since you have already paid for cali trainers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, many of the information can be found on the net, asked on the forum, in magazines, or even in fitness books found in libraries.<br><br>You can even go to any Clubfitt gym and ask the instructors or anyone using the machines to teach u how to use them<br><br>There's absolutely no need for a PT. They are a waste of money. That is, if you use only machines<br><br>However, machines only workout are not as effective as dumbbells/free weights.</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Most, if not all PTs that belong to commercial clubs are worthless. To determine if a PT is good or not, there are several criteria to consider<br><br>1) His background - was he a previous athlete? If so what? How many years of training experience? How many years of coaching experience? What's his specialty/niche? Fat loss? Hypertrophy? Sports performance? Training women?<br>2) His portfolio - previous client testimonials and results(before/after pictures, etc)<br>3) His training style - does he just go through the machines and count reps for you and/or stand by your side while he watches you run on the treadmill? If so, fire him. A good PT will teach you free weight compound exercises with barbells and dumbbells. Any PT that doesn't do this, and says that they are somehow dangerous or will make you "bulky" deserve to be fired.<br>4) Physical assessment - this should take up 1-2 sessions by itself, and will access your current physical level, including strength, flexibility, mobility, muscular balance, postural distortions, address existing pains, etc. With these information a PT will then be able to formulate an initial workout plan for you. After this, physical assessments should be taken at fixed intervals(e.g. every 6 weeks) to measure progress.<br>5) Nutrition - Obviously a big factor especially if you're training for physique. He will probably require you to keep a food log for a while, and educate you on healthy nutritional choices.<br>6) Goal setting - without a goal you're going nowhere, so a good PT will assess your goals, and together with the physical assessment, put together a training program that works for you. Specific goals may be to go from 20% body fat to 10% body fat in 6 months, or to increase all major lifts by 20% in 3 months, stuff like this. There needs to be a timeline for accountability.<br>7) Coaching skills - how good of a teacher is he/she? Since the bulk of your interaction will be him/her teaching you how to perform the lifts, he/she needs to be good at it. This means having intimate knowledge of the various lifts, as well as a good eye in spotting form problems and how to correct them. This only comes with experience.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Motivation - how motivational is he? There are some clients who just simply can't be motivated, but most people who are willing to spend the money for a good PT(good PTs usually price themselves beyond the price range of lazy, unmotivated people) will probably want it bad enough such that some motivation will work.<br>9) Money back guarantee - this one's a big one, because it shows the PT's confidence in his/her skills and knowledge. Not a lot of people do this, but the ones that do are usually great.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I noticed that some PTs go thru trainings with their clients with a notebook in their hand.. When I questioned my PT why I dun have that, he said he has all tt is required to b written down in his head. Is this possible? Or is he juz being plain lazy? He keep trying to sweettalk me into signing up a 30-sessions programme with him, yet on the other hand he says tt he might not have e time to coach me anymore and might switch me to someone else. Does it make a difference I sign the package under which person? Do they get a comm e moment I signed e package and a seperate comm when they do e training?</div>
