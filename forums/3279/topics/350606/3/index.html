              <p>I was about 4 or 5, I think. When visiting my granny at the old folk's home. She had bad diabetes and had her leg amputated. So every week, my mum will bring me to go visit her.</p>
              <p>The home was at some ulu place very far from the main road, so most of the time we had to walk like super long to get to the home and out to the main road.</p>
              <p>That eventful day, while we were walking out to the main road, this "nice" lady in a car stopped and wanted to get us a lift out. So my mum placed me in the back seat and when she was about to get into the front passenger seat, the women driver droved off with me at the back seat.</p>
              <p>I yelled, screamed and cried until the woman stopped the car at the main road. My mum was chasing the car all the way and crying. That woman came out of the car and explained that she thought my mum was already in the car and all the bullshit.</p>
              <p>I guess I was nearly kidnapped.</p>
