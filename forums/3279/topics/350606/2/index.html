              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I had a childhood sweetheart...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Wasn't that much of a sweetheart actually... </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Except I was in K2 and we already knew each other, we met at a place where we learned art together and we hit it off really well. I practically looked forward to every Friday evening, just to see her and to talk to her. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">In the 3 hours lesson, we spent more time chattering than coloring. From the local drama to lame jokes like Takashimaya's Chinese translation (</span><span style='color: black; font-family: "MS Gothic"; '>å¤§å®¶åŽ»</span><span style="color: black; font-family: MingLiU; ">ä¹°é¸­</span><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">), the art teacher practically told us off more than a hundred times, because we were always the last to finish! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">By a stroke of luck or kismet, we ended up in the same primary school. Though we neither spend many recesses nor play a lot of hopscotch together, we were certainly very excited about our little Friday evening rendezvous.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">From crayons to sticks of charcoal, the friendship progressed through the years. People even teased us for being like a couple - and there were rumours of her being fond of me when we were in primary six. While I can't say things like I had something for her romantically, I know there was something special.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">The last Christmas we spent together was a party at our art teacher's place in 1998 - food, gifts, lucky draw, games and some 'dancing'. Despite the fact that I can no longer remember what I won at the shitty lucky draw, the memory of two amateurs moving shyly alongside each other to Savage Garden's Truly Deeply Madly is still as clear as crystal  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="icon_redface.gif"></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Nearing 2000, I left that art place to learn art from a local artist, but we were still in touch constantly - be it a meet up or just a phone call. However, we lost contact abruptly when I quitted art lessons and decided to grow up too fast. She called me quite a few times and even tried to reach me through a mutual friend we knew at the art place, but I was too 'cool' and occupied with silly things to give a care.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">It was until some 2 years later, I met her by chance at the train station. There she was alone, in her uniform, hugging on some books and still the same girl I knew - but I was no longer. To cut a already long story short, I went over anyway with the intention of saying hi. But somehow words came out wrong, and I said something along the line of "Wah what happened to you?" just because she became a li'l pimply.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">She immediately looked disappointed and responded with the same question. I jived with her a little before we went our own way, little did I know that the chance meeting was to be our last. I had an inflated sense of self-importance and was being too superficial. In retrospect, I was the 'fish-gone-bad' that shouldn't had judge.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">Though I would like to think that this isn't big enough to be a regret in my life, I still lament that someone whom was close to me had to go away with a such unpleasant last memory of me. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">I wish I wasn't such a jerk... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></span></p>
