              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I was probably four years old then and I still didn't know when's my birthday (I know... how disgraceful), but I'm certain I was a bright kid... I probably couldn't be bothered with birthdays and shit... Comparing to other kids... When I was growing up...</span></p>
              <p>So there was once, I screwed up big time in school (kindergarten). I've got no recollections of what happened, though I suspect I hit another classmate... Mom came home from work and was furious.. Took out the rattan cane and started to whip me like I was some beast.. I cried (Hey, I was only 4 and it hurt <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif">)</p>
              <p>When the beating finally stopped, mom took my favorite yellow tee with dinosaur print and a pair of jeans from my cupboard and asked me to change. She told me in an angry tone that she's going to sell me to some indian man.. Being prideful, I didn't say a word.. Though in my heart, I was thinking "wah jialek liao this time.. confirm die"..</p>
              <p>Fast forward...</p>
              <p>Guess what? She took me to my birthday party at Mcdonald's!!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>

              <p>It was in kindergarten as well, I was probably 5 or 6 years old.</p>
              <p>I remember my classmate pretending to be Jackie Chan in front of me for some reason I forgot (probably saying something that pissed my female classmate), he thrust his fists forwards without actually hitting me, while making a "haiya, haiya" sound effect.</p>
              <p>So I stared at him for a while as his fists flew back and forth, suddenly, and for reasons which escape me to this day, I threw a real punch at his right eye. He stopped, slowly put his hand over the injured eye and started to cry.</p>
              <p>I got hell from his dad later that day, but I deserved it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              <p>When I was very little, I think in kindergarten, there was a rather large bicycle at home with a pillion seat behind. One day, my brother took me out for a ride around the neighborhood. At first it was very fun, until he started pedaling faster and faster. I got scared and asked him to slow down, but he didn't!</p>
              <p>Then suddenly, we crashed. I kinda got flung off the bicycle and landed splat with scraped knees and elbows in the middle of the road, and just at that moment, a car braked about 3 meters away.</p>
