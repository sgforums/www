            <div class='col-md body'>A mother was working in the kitchen, listening to her 5yrs old son playing<br>with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop &amp;<br>her son saying, "All of you b*astards who want off, get the hell off now,<br>cause this is the last stop! And all of you b*astards who are getting on,<br>get you're a*ss in the train cause we're going down the tracks."<br><br>The mother walked into the room where her son was playing and said "We don't<br>use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room &amp;<br>stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train,<br>but I want you to use nice language."<br><br>Two hour later, the son came out of the bedroom &amp; resumed playing with his<br>train. Soon the train stopped &amp; the mother heard her son say, "All<br>passengers who are disembarking the train, please remember to take all of<br>your belongings with you. We thank you for travelling with us today &amp; hope<br>your trip was a pleasant one."<br><br>She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask<br>you to store all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no<br>smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey<br>with us today."<br><br>As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are<br>p!ssed off about the TWO HOURS delay, please<br>direct your complaints to the fat b!tch in the kitchen."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sixth Grade Science Question.<br><br>Sixth grade science teacher, Mrs. Parks, asked her class, "Which human body<br>part increases to 10 times its size when stimulated?"<br><br>No one answered until little Molly stood up, angry, and said, "You should<br>not be asking sixth graders a question like that! I'm going to tell my<br>parents, and they will go and tell the principal, and you'll get fired!"<br><br>She then sat back down. Mrs. Parks ignored her, and asked the question<br>again, "Which body part increases to 10 times its size when stimulated?"<br><br>Molly's mouth fell open, and she said to those around her, "Boy, is she<br>gonna get in big trouble!"<br><br>The teacher continued to ignore her and said to the class, "Anybody?"<br><br>Finally, Jimmy stood up, looked around nervously, and said, "The body part<br>that increases to 10 times its size when stimulated is the pupil of the<br>eye."<br><br>Mrs. Parks said, "Very good, Jimmy." Then she turned to Molly and continued,<br>"As for you, young lady, I have three things to say: First, you have a dirty<br>mind. Second, you didn't read your homework. And third, one day you are<br>going to be VERY VERY disappointed!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Always Get a Second Opinion!<br><br>Joe had been suffering from very bad headaches. Finally, he went to his<br>doctor and explained that he had constant pain during the daytime.<br><br>After examining Joe thoroughly, the doctor said, "Joe, the good news is I<br>can cure your headaches. The bad news is that it will require castration.<br>You have a very rare condition which causes your testicles to press on your<br>spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to<br>relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles."<br><br>Joe was shocked and depressed. He had no choice but to go under the knife.<br>When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in<br>20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself. As<br>he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person.<br><br>He saw a men's clothing store and thought, "That's what I need... a new<br>suit!" He entered the shop and told the salesman, "I'd like a new suit."<br><br>The elderly man eyed him briefly and said, "Let's see... size 44 long."<br><br>Joe laughed, "That's right! How did you know?"<br><br>Been in the business 40 years!" the man said.<br><br>Joe tried on the suit. It fit perfectly. As Joe admired himself in the<br>mirror, the salesman asked, "How about a new shirt?"<br><br>Joe thought for a moment and then said, "Sure."<br><br>The salesman eyed Joe and said, "Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.<br><br>Joe was surprised! That's right. How did you know?"<br><br>Â“Been in the business 40 years."<br><br>Joe tried on the shirt and it fit perfectly. Joe walked comfortably around<br>the shop. Then, the salesman asked "How about some new underwear?"<br><br>Joe thought for a moment and said, "Sure."<br><br>The salesman said, "Let's see... size 36."<br><br>Joe laughed, "Ah ha! I got you. I've worn a size 32 since I was 18 years<br>old.<br><br>The salesman shook his head, "You can't wear a size 32! A size 32 would<br>press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one hell<br>of a headache."<br></div>

They rub it and a genie comes out in a<br>puff of smoke.<br><br>The genie says, "I usually only grant three wishes, so I'll give each of you<br>just one. "<br><br>"Me first! Me first!" says the administrative clerk. "I want to be in the<br>Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world."<br><br>Poof! She's gone.<br><br>In astonishment, "Me next! Me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in<br>Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply<br>of pina coladas and the love of my life."<br><br>Poof! He's gone.<br><br>"OK, you're up," the genie says to the manager.<br><br>The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."<br><br>Moral of the story:<br>Always let your boss have the first say.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man walks into a bar with a paper bag. He sits down and places the bag on<br>the counter. The bartender walks up and asks, "So whadda ya got in the bag?"<br><br>The man responded by reaching into the bag and pulling out a little man,<br>about one foot high, and he sets him on the counter. He reaches back into<br>the bag and this time pulls out a small piano, setting it on the counter as<br>well. He reaches into the bag once again and pulls out a tiny piano bench,<br>which he placed in front of the piano. The little man sits down at the piano<br>and starts playing a gorgeous piece by Mozart. Now the bartender is<br>extremely curious about this odd sight, so he asks the man, "Where the<br>hell'd ya get that?"<br><br>The man responded by reaching into the paper bag, but this time he pulls out<br>a magic lamp. He hands it to the bartender and says, "Here, rub it."<br><br>So the bartender rubs the lamp, and suddenly there's a gust of smoke, then a<br>beautiful genie is standing before him.<br><br>"I will grant you one wish," she says.<br><br>The bartender gets excited by having a wish from a real genie. He had always<br>dreamed about it, but now it's actually happening. So without even<br>hesitating, he says, "I want a million bucks."<br><br>So the genie nods her head and disappears in another gust of smoke. A few<br>moments later, a duck walks into the bar. It is soon followed by another<br>duck, then another. Pretty soon, the entire bar is filled with ducks. The<br>bartender turns to the man and says, "Y'know, I think your genie's a little<br>deaf. I asked for a million BUCKS, not a million DUCKS."<br><br>To this, the man responded, "No kidding! Do you really think, for just one<br>moment, that I would ever have wished for a twelve inch pianist?!?"</div>
