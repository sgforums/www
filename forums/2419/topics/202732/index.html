            <div class='col-md body'>Pregnancy -3 Weeks<br><br>How your baby's growing: What's going on in your womb now? A lot. Your baby-in-the-making is just a tiny ball consisting of several hundred cells that are multiplying madly. Once the ball of cells (called a blastocyst) takes up residence in your uterus, the part of it that will develop into the placenta starts producing the pregnancy hormone hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin), which tells your ovaries to stop releasing eggs and triggers increased production of estrogen and progesterone (which keep your uterus from shedding its lining Â— and its tiny passenger Â— and stimulates placental growth). HCG is the hormone that turns a pregnancy test positive; by the end of this week, you may be able to take one and get a positive result! (If your test is negative and you still haven't gotten your period in two or three days, try again then.)<br><br>Meanwhile, amniotic fluid is beginning to collect around your ball of cells in the cavity that will become the amniotic sac. This fluid will cushion your baby in the weeks and months ahead. Right now, your little blastocyst is receiving oxygen and nutrients (and discarding waste products) through a primitive circulation system made up of microscopic tunnels that connect your developing baby to the blood vessels in your uterine wall. The placenta won't be developed enough to take over this task until the end of next week.<br><br>How your life's changing: A momentous meeting has taken place inside you Â— a single sperm has broken through the tough outer membrane of your egg and fertilized it. Several days after conception, the fertilized egg burrowed into the lining of your uterus and started to grow. A baby is in the making! You probably don't know you're pregnant yet, but you may notice a little spotting by the end of this week. This so-called "implantation spotting" may be caused by the egg burrowing into the blood-rich uterine lining (a process that began last week at 6 days after fertilization), but no one knows for sure. In any case, the spotting is very light and only a minority of pregnant women experience it at all.<br><br>Source: www.babycener.com</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pregnancy - Week 4<br><br>How your baby's growing: This week marks the beginning of the embryonic period. From now until ten weeks, all of your baby's organs will begin to develop and function. As a result, this is the time when she'll be the most vulnerable to anything that might interfere with her development.<br><br>Right now your baby is an embryo consisting of two layers: the epiblast and the hypoblast, from which all her organs and body parts will develop. The primitive placenta is also made up of two layers at this point. Its cells are tunneling into the lining of your uterus, creating spaces for your blood to flow into so that the developed placenta can provide nutrients and oxygen to your growing baby when it starts to function at the end of this week.<br><br>Also present now are the amniotic sac that will house your baby, the amniotic fluid that will cushion her as she grows, and the yolk sac that produces your baby's red blood cells and helps deliver nutrients to her until the placenta is ready to take over this duty.<br><br>How your life's changing: This week, you should be able to find out if you're pregnant. How will you know for sure? Take a home pregnancy test; they're no different from the tests used in most practitioner's offices.<br><br>If the test is positive, call your practitioner's office and schedule your first prenatal appointment. Many practitioners won't see you until you're at least 8 weeks along, but if you're taking any medications Â— prescription or over-the-counter Â— ask now whether it's safe to keep taking them, and alert your caregiver to any other issues of concern. You should already be taking a prenatal vitamin, but be sure to start now if you aren't. The next five weeks are critical to your baby's development. The rudimentary versions of the placenta and umbilical cord, which deliver nourishment and oxygen to your baby, are already functioning. Your baby is now exposed, via the placenta, to what you take into your body, so make sure it's healthy.<br><br>If your pregnancy test is negative, take another one in a few days. Some pregnant women haven't yet produced enough pregnancy hormones to register a positive result on the test. If you get your period, you can try again next month. But if you've been trying with no success for a year or more (or for six months if you're over 35), talk to your healthcare provider about a workup exam for you and your partner to spot possible fertility problems. While the results may be upsetting, finding out about a problem sooner rather than later will get you started on the road to treatment Â— and to your ultimate goal: having a baby.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pregnancy - Week 5<br><br>How your baby's growing: Deep in your uterus your embryo is growing at a furious pace. At this point he's about the size of a sesame seed, and he looks more like a tiny tadpole than a human. He's now made up of three layers Â— the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm Â— that will later form his organs and tissues. The cells are forming for his major organs, including his kidneys and liver, and his neural tube is beginning to develop. This neural tube Â— from which your baby's brain, spinal cord, nerves, and backbone will sprout Â— develops in the top layer, called the ectoderm. This layer will also give rise to his skin, hair, nails, mammary and sweat glands, and tooth enamel. His heart and circulatory system begin to form in the middle layer, or mesoderm. (This week, in fact, his tiny heart begins to divide into chambers and beat and pump blood.) The mesoderm will also form your baby's muscles, cartilage, bone, and subcutaneous (under skin) tissue. The third layer, or endoderm, will house his lungs, intestines, and rudimentary urinary system, as well as his thyroid, liver, and pancreas. In the meantime, the primitive placenta and umbilical cord, which deliver nourishment and oxygen to your baby, are already on the job.<br><br>* Note: Experts say every baby develops differently Â— even in the womb. This developmental information is designed to give you a general idea of how your baby is growing.<br><br>How your life's changing: Pregnancy symptoms may surface this week if they haven't already. If you're like most women, you'll notice nausea (and not just in the morning), sore breasts, fatigue, and frequent urination. All are normal, all are annoying, but the upside is that they're all a part of being pregnant and won't last forever. The outside world won't see any sign of the dramatic developments taking place inside you Â— except maybe that you're turning down that glass of wine with dinner. It's a good idea to avoid alcohol throughout your pregnancy since no one knows exactly how much Â— or how little Â— alcohol can harm a developing baby.<br><br>You'll also want to continue or start an exercise routine. Exercise helps you develop good muscle tone, strength, and endurance; plus, it helps you manage the extra weight you'll be carrying and get ready for the physical rigors of labor. You'll also find that bouncing back after you give birth will be easier if you've already established a workout routine. Choose a safe, moderately vigorous activity you like (walking and swimming are fine choices for pregnant women) and check in with other moms-to-be in our exercise and nutrition chat.<br><br>Dads, there are plenty of ways to participate in your partner's pregnancy Â— even this early in the game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pregnancy - Week 6<br><br>How your baby's growing: The cells that will make up all of your baby's body parts and systems are dividing furiously as her body begins to take shape. Right now she's about the size of a small lentil bean (4 to 5 millimeters across). If you could see through your uterine wall, you'd find an overlarge head and dark spots where her eyes and nostrils are beginning to take shape. Shallow pits on the sides of her head mark her developing ears, and her arms and legs appear as protruding buds. Her hands and feet look like paddles, with thick webbing between the developing digits, but her fingers and toes will soon become more distinct. Below the opening that will later be your baby's mouth, there are small folds where her neck and lower jaw will eventually develop. (Inside, her tongue and vocal cords are just beginning to form.)<br><br>Your baby's heart (which is starting to divide into the right and left chambers) is beating about 100 to 130 beats per minute Â— almost twice as fast as yours Â— and blood is beginning to circulate through her body. Her intestines are developing and tiny breathing passages are beginning to appear where her lungs will be. She's also starting to build muscle fibers and, halfway through this week, she'll likely start moving her tiny limbs. Unfortunately, you'll probably have to wait until you're several weeks into your second trimester before you get to enjoy feeling your baby's calisthenics.<br><br>* Note: Experts say every baby develops differently Â— even in the womb. This developmental information is designed to give you a general idea of how your baby is growing.<br><br>How your life's changing: If you haven't already, you may soon find yourself riding pregnancy's emotional roller coaster, feeling moody one day and joyful the next. Disturbing as this may be Â— especially if you pride yourself on being in control Â— what you're going through is completely normal and will probably continue throughout your pregnancy. Up-and-down emotions are partly caused by fluctuating and (in many cases) very high levels of hormones. But hormones aside, your entire life is about to change Â— and who wouldn't feel emotional about that?<br><br>Spotting (finding spots of blood on your underpants or toilet tissue after urinating) or bleeding is common in early pregnancy, but sometimes it can be the first sign of miscarriage. If you have any spotting or bleeding, call your doctor or midwife right away so she can determine whether your spotting indicates a potential problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pregnancy - Week 7<br><br><img src="http://www.babycenter.com/i/devel/diagram1.gif"><br>This illustration shows what your baby looks like at about seven weeks of pregnancy. Egg and sperm have developed into an embryo with a tiny beating heart. The embryo will be growing very fast over the next few weeks.<br><br>How your baby's growing: Your baby still appears to have a small tail (actually, it's an extension of his tailbone), which will disappear in the next few weeks. But that's the only thing getting smaller. Now almost half an inch long Â— roughly the size of a raspberry Â— he has elbow joints and distinct, slightly webbed fingers and toes. In his oversized head, both hemispheres of his brain are developing. His teeth and the inside of his mouth are forming, and his ears continue to develop. Eyelid folds partially cover his tiny peepers, which already have some color, and the tip of that nose you'll be tweaking someday is emerging. His skin is paper-thin and his veins are clearly visible.<br><br>Your little one also has an appendix and a pancreas, which will eventually produce the hormone insulin to aid in digestion. His liver is busy producing red blood cells, and a loop of your baby's growing intestines is bulging into his umbilical cord, which now has distinct blood vessels to carry oxygen and nutrients to and from his tiny body. You can't feel his gyrations yet, but your baby is like a little jumping bean, moving in fits and starts around his watery home.<br><br>* Note: Experts say every baby develops differently Â— even in the womb. This developmental information is designed to give you a general idea of how your baby is growing.<br><br>How your life's changing: You're in the throes of the first trimester, when many women suffer from common pregnancy woes. Keeping food down may be next to impossible, thanks to morning (noon, and night) sickness, caused in part by the pregnancy hormones coursing through your body. Stash a box of crackers next to your bed, and eat a few to curb the nausea before getting up. (Not all pregnant women have morning sickness, so don't worry if you've been spared Â— you're one of the lucky few!) You may also need to use the bathroom a lot more often than usual Â— your blood volume increases dramatically when you get pregnant, which leads to a lot of extra fluid getting processed through your kidneys and ending up in your bladder. The nausea should fade as your pregnancy continues, though you may continue to make frequent trips to the bathroom.<br><br>If you haven't already, now's the time to choose an ob-gyn or midwife. Most practitioners won't want to see you right away unless you have a serious medical condition or you're having problems like vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or severe nausea and vomiting. They'll probably schedule you to come in once you're between eight and 12 weeks pregnant. At your first visit, your doctor or midwife will go over your family health history, do some routine blood tests, and answer any questions you might have.<br><br></div>
