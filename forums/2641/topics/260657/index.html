Please do so first to gain the background story of this.<br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=260160" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=260160</a><br><br>30 July Monday<br>Dear Blog, Today was a normal day for me, I had make a booking for Andrea at a posh restuarant. I wanted to give her a surprise on thurs, but the restuarant manager gave me a surprise instead with the bill. Thurs is our 3 month-versary. And it is her birthday so that is why it is a very important day. I even ordered some flowers and a necklace. The necklace caused me like $300++ and is so expensive, I bargained for like 3 hours but can only reduced like $30.<br><br>1 July Tues<br>Today I give Andrea a call, we chatted alittle and ask her out on friday. She told me she was unable to make it on friday as her new friend from her dance academy bought some tickets to a concert. ANd it is a very good one. I ask if I could come along. She said no as it is full house and they have no extra tickets, furthermore the last time we went for a musical she said I dooze off in the midst and it was so embaressing. I apologies for 3 days already and now she had brought it up! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>The rest of the week she will be busy on her company's marketing campaign. I was so disappointed. Didn't she know that It was her birthday and our 3 month-versary? I really wanted to spend it with her.<br><br>2 Aug Wed<br>Today I called Andrea and I told Andrea I'll be sending her home tomorrow. I told Joe about this, he said I'm going to break up soon and Andrea realised her mistake!!! I was so angry. Later day I poured some of my overnight night water I left on my desk yesterday into his tea. Sadly I cancelled the reservation for tomorrow.<br><br>3 Aug Thurs<br>Dear Blog, today Joe didn't come to work today heard he has a diarrea!!! At last I have some peace at work. Later the night, I went to Esplanade like around 9.30 waited for Andrea until like 11pm then the show is over. She came out only with James her new friend. I send her home and asked her why only James and her? She said the rest of the people last min couldn't make it. I don't know what but I feel very awful. I gave her the necklace and thank me before she departed. She is tired. That goes with our 3 months-versary only got to see her for an hour.<br><br>To Be Continue</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>5 Aug Sunday<br>Dear Blog, today I went to church with Andrea, she said she got her new friend to join her for service. Little did I know it was James! Arrrgghh. We when to service together and he tease me saying I should go work out more on my muscle. He thought i'm a dancer like Andrea but I'm not. His name is James Kok. I called him James Co ck!!! When his not around of coz.<br>Later the day Andrea told me James is just her student she got to know in the Dance and tell me don't try any of my tricks on him. I agree, I'll try the real thing on him. Tricks are for kids. So there we are spend the day in church a movie and we departed. I wonder who exactly is this James, hehe we'll find out.<br><br>6 Aug Monday<br>Today I went to the dance academy to find out bout James. He is just a student therefore they couldn't reveal any information of him. I did and online search of him. Nothing! I saw him when I fetch Andrea home. He had a car and drove both of us back instead. I think I want to get a car too!!! I told Andrea, she sigh. Ask Andrea about james but she wouldn't say. What is wrong with woman I just don't get it sometime.<br><br>8 Aug Wednesday<br>Hmmm Blog I been thinking of two days.. Please tell me how can I found out about James... I ask Jesus He never reply. I can't let him have Andrea.<br><br>9 Aug Thurs<br>Today is national day, Andrea and I went to see the fireworks at esplanade. Surprisingly James was there with a big camera and a tripod like a photographer. Wah Kaoz his like everywhere we went. He say he likes to take photo and even took our photo with Andrea, me and HIM!!! I must do something. Bloggy, I must do something!!!<br><br>10 Aug Frid<br>Dear Blog, today as I came home I felt something strange. I felt someone is following me home. When I look around the stretch which I usually took to came home the person disappeared. I called and told Andrea about it, she thinks I am over reacting. I ask her to be careful of James as I found nothing of him yet. She flared and says I promised not to try any tricks on him. I have to apologies like 3 hours think she still haven slimmer down. Shouldn't have told her that. Its for her own good also.<br><br>To be Continue.</div>
