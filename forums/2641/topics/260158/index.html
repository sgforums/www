I give her my money.. she return with the change..<br><br>the suddenly as she give me the change to my hands... I felt a sensation where the tip of fingers move through the palms of our hands... the fiction sparking an enormous flare of flames that engulf my heart into deep deep love. The feeling was immerse that I had never felt before. I looked into her eyes as she did so to mine.<br><br>In a twinkling of an eye the sky darken, the world morphed into a scene of darkness. Here we are in the dark, icy, cold atlantic waters. From a far a gigantic vessal sunk gradually into it's watery grave. Eerie cries of help flood the quiet ghastly skies. Horrifying as each hold on, cherishing their last breathe. But what surprises me is I heard Celine Dion Singing behind... lalala ...lallalaal<br><br>There she is afloat a floating deberis as I hold onto her hands trying hard not to shiver in the icy waters.<br><br>"Jack, I'm scared... promise you will not leave me."<br><br>"...... I promise I'll be around... now you got to live on strong..."<br><br>Suddenly I felt very sleepy... tried. Just before I fell into an eternity slumber. I saw a pair of eyes. A wide pairs of eyes right beside her. I mustered my remaining strength to focus and to see what that is.<br><br>"AAHHH!! UNCLE HOKKIEN MEE HO JIA AI MAI!!!" He immediately grab his daugters hands and left for the stall. So Paiseh so many people looking....<br><br>Do you have similar experience before?</div>
