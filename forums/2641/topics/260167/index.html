            <div class='col-md body'>I was just chillin with my friends the other day at the park. It was around midnight-ish. We were walking along when we realised that there were no druggies around and we were like wtf where are all the druggies? So we kept walking when suddenly we were ambushed by one of them. The crackhead snuck up behind my best mate and stabbed him in the back of the neck with his syringe. My friend immediately fell to the floor in screams of "AIDS!!!" and died almost instantly. I was all like HOLY SH*T!! and leapt backwards just as the crackhead made a swipe at me with his deadly AIDS infected syringe. Time went all slow-mo as the syringe swept across my face, just micrometres away from ripping a deadly swath of AIDS across my visage. With my cat-like reflexes I performed a perfect backflip and whilst upside-down, plucked a single blade of grass from the ground and upon completing my somersault flung it with pinpoint precision back at the attacker. The chi energy channeled into that single blade of grass carried it right through the right eye of my attacker and out the back of his head, spilling his brains all over a park bench. I then calmly walked off into the sunset whilst heroic music played in the background. Which was odd considering it was midnight. But alas! The druggie wasn't dead, as his brain had long decayed from the extensive use of coke and dope getting his brains splayed across a park bench had almost no effect. And he picked up his deadly heroin cooking spoon and just as he was about to fling it at me whilst I was walking away, oblivious to what was conspiring behind me, my thought-to-be-dead friend leaped in front of me and yelled "NOOOO!!!!!" and took the full force of the spoon which caused his body to implode upon itself; the implosion rupturing space and time and the resulting vacuum sucked everything within a 20km radius into it. I was holding onto a tree for as I was lifted into the air, my body pulled up horizontally. Rocks, cars and entire buildings flew past me as it was pulled into the black hole as each passing second caused the tree I was holding on to to slow uproot. After what seemed like forever my only hope of survival pulled free from the earth and I was sucked into another dimension....falling endlessly into infinity............................wait...........a beam of light.....getting brighter.....WOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHh!!!! I jerked back into reality and was sitting back at the park. I looked down and saw that I had my bare foot on a whole strip of wet acid which I was absorbing through my sole. What an insane trip. Any of you had a similar experience?</div>
