            <div class='col-md body'>My uncle Dave is a great man.... he teaches me alot of things, like how to set up an organisation and teach me the ropes to business. Years ago my uncle and I started a simple textile business which seems to work pretty well over the years. Of course we expanded the company rapidly. My uncle had always taught me to work hard with our bare hands to achieve what we wanted. He was really an inspiration of my life. I aspire and admire him greatly and remember much he taught me thru the years. Until things turn different... He was a very sporty and healthy person until he was diagnosed with a strange illness shortly after his marriage.<br><br>Doctors were unable to determine the cause of this illness as my uncle consistently having cardio arrests. What is really pitiful is the newly wed wife Susan. They were married barely months. She was a young stunning lady bout 20 years younger than my uncle. While my uncle was hospitalised. Susan had almost everyday visited Dave bringing personally cooked porridges feeding him patiently to the very last moments of my uncle death. I would be lying if I had not a sense of envy or Jealousy. Everyone in the hospital said praises of this magnificent woman. How nice she is and how fortunate my uncle was. I saw it personally a couple of times and was really deeply touched by her love for my uncle. Guess love have no boundaries, but whatever to end will ends one day. My uncle dead eventually. We grieved over his death which is extremely painful for both of us. It was a year ago. Both Susan and I loved him so much.<br><br>Now I'm too infected with the same kind of unknown illness which my uncle had. The doctor said it could likely be genetic. I felt my moments are ending soon. Perhaps no more than a week or so. There Susan who is now my wife, brought her personally prepared porridge feeding me by my bedside day by day. How loved I felt.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My Childhood Anne<br>Everyone had abit of childhood always kept in their mind for a long long time. Some are pleasant, some aren't as nice.... me too.... guess what I remembered most about my childhood, is Anne. Cute, petite and quiet little girl which I got to know in my primary school. She only joined our class at the start of primary 6, with not much friends I seems to be her only friend at school. We got kinda close playing together despite my other boys friends reluctant to let her join. The only problem with her is her sickly body. She is always sick, often complaining of stomaches and vomiting.<br><br>I know little of her background, except that she had a very stern mother that refused to let her eat anything than what was cooked personally by her and refused her to know much people. Her father left her family after he got to know her mother was pregnant with her. Anyway our friendship was kinda close.<br><br>She did brought me to her house once. Where it was quite empty, what else could one expect from a single parent family. Only one that does find particularly of interest to me. Is the number of rats poison her mother had bought. She said it was for the rats in their house which is a 13 storey HDB. I had that wonder for years after the incident. Shortly after our visitation her mum got home and chased me out and a tough scolding to her petite daughter. After that she got 3 day MC for severe diarrhea. Little did I know why but she never brought me to her house again and months later, a week before the Final exam she no longer attended school.....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Online Chat....<br>I loved online chatting, I guess its a great way in looking for people to chat in the middle of the night, especially girls. Well I did... and I happened to got to know this girl, online of coz. We chatted for sometime, years in fact. Somehow we had a click towards each other. We talked about almost everything under the sun. She seems to be the person for me and me the person for her. We even vowed to marry each other. We expressed love and calling each other darlings. Things was of course going well for us until I met someone else I loved. Someone in person. My heart changed for her. Many a times I tried to avoid her. But upon much request and pleading we met... She's not particularly pretty or neither is she ugly. But I guess she is quite pleasant by any standards. But I guess my heart was with another person now. After that particular meeting, I tried hard to avoid her so as not to hurt her further.<br>One day, while leaving for my house as I opened the door she appeared. She waited for me, but I was kinda furious how she managed to got hold of my address. We chatted shortly before I made an excuse and left. For days she kept calling my handphone and smsing me. Soon she started to appeared at my work place, which I'm really starting to get kinda annoyed. Finally in order to spite her I told her I was attached and planning for marriage, she was so hurt that she left in tears. Although I felt kinda bad, but I guess its the best for both of us.<br>As usually the days goes by but only for one that I hadn't heard from her anymore. I attended a company function and got home kinda late, feeling alittle ditzy from the drink earlier. Traveling through the usual route home alone when suddenly I saw a light coming towards me.<br>The next thing I know is I'm in a hospital as the doctor beside me telling me to be prepared as I'm going to be paralyzed for life and to be on wheelchair. I had an car accident and it was her who sent me to hospital. Now she came into the room sat beside me as she whisper gentle, "Now I can take care of your forever.....";</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Years ago I lived in a rather spacious part of Singapore in the outskirts towards the shores in a particular private landed estates. This particular neighborhood has its taste of uniqueness. And the particular warmth and friendliness makes it special in my heart all through childhood. Of all the history that I had here, what really sets me reminded of the place long after I moved out is this neighbor of mine Nancy. She was a friendly middle aged lady in her 50s who loves to bake chicken pie. Her skill excels tremendously in this particular liking of her and often baked extras for everyone in the neighborhood. I loved her chicken pie with much fervency to the extend of occasionally craves upon the softly tender chicken and the aromatic flour linings covering. Thinking of it makes my tongue shivers.<br>One day she disappeared from the neighborhood. Little was known why. Time fades the remembrance of this kind lady, until recently during a family gathering had my mum reminded us of this lady whom we so kindly remembered for her pie. She was actually arrested for murdering and mutilating her four years younger husband. When the police arrived, they could only find the few remaining parts of the heads and limbs in the fridge. The other parts were never found....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Different people have different likings or particular of interest which they like doing at night or when its their free time. For me I had this liking of going to pubs and bars after work till late preyed upon girls who are willing to spend the night with me in waves of passion till morning as I left for work. I guess that is me. So one night I went to this bar which is one of my favorite liking to enjoy the night in musics and alittle drink before long did I noticed this girl sitting opposite me entices me. Pretty and stunning is what I would used to describe her. I know what she wants in her mind and what my desire is thinking. I approached her as we surprisingly chatted for a rather long period of time and it seems she had every interest which I liked and involved in. What really intrigued me is her uncanny familiarity to someone whom I had known before.<br>We thoroughly enjoyed the night while it last. As we left the pub, she wanted me to her house. As we reaches her house we instantly sticked upon one another in rows of foreplay, kissing and fondling. Before long, she wanted to play something unusual. Although I had never done so with anyone before, I was thrilled to my every hair submerging into my personal fantasy of exotic eroticism. She dimmed the lights and tied the naked me unto the bed post with her petite little strand of power and willfulness but with every utmost of tediousness to ensure I couldn't get out. Gosh I'm aroused.<br>Then she careful grinned at me, she lean forward and reaches for the drawer beside the bed groping for an item, it shines in the dimmed lights meant for romantism. Its a scissor. She whispered "Remember me, Rosy? The girl you dumped 6 months ago, how's my new plastic?" as she wail the scissor with a smirk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My girlfriends<br>Hi, My name is John and I'm 32. I'm just an average Joe in this small island metropolitan. I'm quite successful in my career and owned a small house inherited by my late father. I guess life was rather average for me until 2 years ago I met Jenny. She was quite a beauty, in fact the prettiest in my department. I got to know her and gradually both of us started dating. I'm not sure if its really love but I do somehow fancy her. She wasn't really a gentle dove as sometime her temper could flare more ferocious than anyone could derived from her outwardly apparent. Gradually somehow I got used to it and to let her have whatever she wanted. This was until one day we had an argument, which grow to a fight. Later that day on she had disappeared.<br>I tried to move on with my life got to know a couple of other girls from the pubs that I hang out and clubs. But it always happened that as both the new girl and I got to know each other further over the months, one by one they disappeared without a trace. No one knows where they are or what had happened to them.<br>Not before long lonesome sets in, I'm quite of age to get married and do somehow seek so, that's when I met May. She was enchanting. Beautiful and flawless to every sense. I guess she is the one for me, in fact the best one I know. I'm kinda deeply in loved with her as I wanted so hard to protect her from the fate of my ex girlfriends. I wanted her to share every part of my world perhaps except for part where my past girlfriends comes in, which of course she had not know yet. Somehow I wanted to love her so much and cherish her that I wanted to leave her so that she do not come to any harms like the rest, yet I couldn't resist myself to be without her.<br>We started dating and months of enjoyment seems to fickle like a spark from the firewood. I brought her to my house one day and I prepares dishes for her in my kitchen. She was alone in the living room simply because I made her promised to not help me in any of my cooking. Cooking and boiling when out of a brisk I heard a loud scream coming from the basement, it was her. Instantly I picked up the kitchen knife and headed without delay to where I had thought the sound comes from. It was from the basement. As I reaches the basement I saw her in utter fear, screaming insanely at what was before us. There are corpses of my ex girlfriends in plastination. Now she already knew it, I guess I have to keep her forever in my basement too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am Boon. Fifteen years ago I had retired from my previous job. Presently 80 years old with no family to spend my last days with. Through a care organisation, I'm being admitted to this particular old folks home in the northern part of Singapore. The place is fine, but just that the people there are extremely resiliant to new people and talking was like a taboo which everyone hates. It is quiet, perhaps too quiet. Death is something that all of use had once never thought of but now so near and the verge of us. Some of us wished for it, some don't but inevitably all will come to face this almost everyday of our remaining lives. People comes and goes in the old folks home. Many never returned. Its like a place where the highest number of dying age group gathers in an compound of not more than a 700 sqm area. But this particular home is rather unique from others.<br><br>One night I couldn't sleep and was fliping around in the bed thinking of my life through and the days to come before I shall leave this world back to the Lord. As the time struck 2, I heard a strange noise coming from the other room. I tossed it off as perhaps someone struggling to go to the toilet and went on to my sleep. The next day, we got to know that Nancy. From the neighbouring rooms had came the time to leave us to a better place. The noise that I heard must be the final struggle before the time is here.<br><br>The second night, again I was sleepless. Wondering and thinking about the incident that happened last night. Then the clock stucked 2. I heard the same soft but clear noise that comes from another part of the corridor. The next day, we got to know that our Lord Jesus had recalled another of our folks mate home. I wonder when would the time be for me that I may too return to our precious Lord.<br><br>For the couple of weeks that follows, whenever there is someone leaving this world to a better place. The night before I would hear this soft but distinctive noise emitted from the room. So one night while I was again, waiting for the clock to stuck 2, I lay awake. Just before I actually fell into a slumber the same distinct sound awaken me. My curiousity overtook me as I got up to find out what is exactly happening.<br><br>To be continued.</div>
