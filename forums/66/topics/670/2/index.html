            <div class='col-md body'>The wrongfulness of lust is reducible to this: that venereal satisfaction is sought for either outside wedlock or, at any rate, in a manner which is contrary to the laws that govern marital intercourse. Every such criminal indulgence is a mortal sin, provided of course, it be voluntary in itself and fully deliberate. This is the testimony of St. Paul in the Epistle to the Galations, v. 19:<br><br>"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury, . . . Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God."<br><br>Want to read more? Visit <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09438a.htm</a><br><br>However I do disagree with the Catholic churches view on this matter.. The church always seems to take the Bible out of context. That verse did not say that masterbation was a sin. However, it is a sin to lust, so just don't think about anyone when you do it. This may be difficult, and if you can't help yourself, then maybe you should quit. Secondly, the Catholic church although Christians, seem very wrong. I don't think their should a be pope due to the fact that well, even though I'm sure the pope believes fully in God, he does not know exactly what everything in the Bible means. Most believe that God empowers the pope so he only says accurate information, I don't think thats true. I believe the pope is just like you an I. Catholic's believe everything the pope says is absolute truth. Personally I listen to the Bible, not the pope. The Bible specifically says fornification, which means sexual intercourse between partners who are not married to each other. This is not masterbation unless you consider your hand a partner. I think that is the most accurate answer you can get. Unless their is another verse that contradicts this.<br><br>As for the people who don't believe in the Bible at all. This is what I have to say. Their are many, many reasons why this Earth could not have been created through evolution. Too much information contradicts that theory. Creation is definately the only sensible alternative, and well, as far as all the religions go, the Bible seems to be the only believable one, even though it is still very difficult because it seems soo unreal.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Masturbation is perfectly alright in my boooks.<br><br>Someone said to masturbate without lusting. How is that possible i ask you?<br><br>Some people quote the bible saying masturbation is a sin. Others say it isn't. Then there are those that say it's up to you. You must now be more confused than ever...<br><br>Let me share with you my view.<br><br>The bible is a book of teachings. Do not take everything in context. Absorb it's fundamentals but do not dwell in it's details.<br><br>Masturbation is alright, whether you're 10 years old or 100 years old, whether you're a boy or a girl. Most people start off without any self-control, and somewhere along the line, they start getting guilty about it because they feel they're giving in to their desires and lust.<br><br>If you do not want to fall into this category, then find yourself. Once you understand yourself and your place in this world, you will come to terms with what/who you are, and if you still think masturbation is wrong then, then good luck trying to stop!!!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well Im not sure if masterbation is a sin or not. I do masterbate, but it hasnt been as frequent as previously. I used to do it uncontrollably everyday and often with items. However i have found that just stimulation will cause me to have an orgasm. I dont think of anything or anyone. I just stare off into space and rub my clitoris and breasts until i have an orgasm. Unfortunately, It is a hard habit to break sin or not and anything that controls you more than you control it reflects a type of self gratification such as smoking and gossiping. I wish there was a straightforward answer for it but there isnt. But i truly believe that if you are honestly struggling with masterbation then God knows it is a struggle and recognizes your desire to quit. It is something we often have to be delivered from. Its like your body gets a high that you seem to cant live without and you become addicted.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sin? Definately.  Our bodies are a temple.. a place where Christ is to dwell.  Anything that we do to our bodies, we do to Christ.  Drugs maybe pleasurable and be a certain escape for some people (like masturbation) but drugs are sin, you know that as well as i do.  I have been struggling to detach myself from the very thing we're talking about.  If it was okay and right to do it, then why can it only be done behind closed doors? Isn't what we do behind closed doors our true judge of character?  We are supposed to follow christ's example.  He lived an unselfish, pure life.  He teaches us to deny ourselves and not give into the lusts of the flesh. forgive me for saying this, but try NOT to picture Jesus masturbating...and if you get an erie feeling from just the THOUGHT of him doing something like that, then maybe it's not so right afterall and your answer is that it is wrong <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i want u to read all this before u make up ur mind. i was looking for the answer for a while n i found it. I do masterbate n i am a new christian. Ok.. the answer is Masterbation is a sin. <strong>BUT</strong> the Bible said we all are sinners and when Jesus came he brought forgivness and salvation, and with his coming the laws were no more and with alot of grace . That does not mean you should accept sins and not strive for perfection, but it means that although no matter how hard you try you still sin, salvation is still your's, but through the grace of God given to all who have faith. u can say taht the bible say dont do it, {[="Matthew5:30<br>And if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and thow it away. It is betterfor you to lose one part of your body then for your whole body to go to hell."\\\I am sure the world would be a much more perfect place if no one sinned. The Bible guides us to live a perfect life, and since Jesus was able to, it guides us that it is possible. But the Bible also says all are sinners, and so it acknowledges that no one other than Jesus will actually attain such perfection.<br><br>Matt 5:28<br>28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.<br>(KJV)<br><br>Matt 15:19-20<br>19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:<br>20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.<br>(KJV)<br><br>Mark 7:21-23<br>21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,<br>22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:<br>23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.<br>(KJV)<br><br>There are other verses, but I believe it would be true to argue that occasional horrible thoughts do not equal such actual sins, and to say that there is a difference in degree and nature between having sinful/lustful thoughts and actually committing such acts. For me I would say the thought is evidence of temptation, which the Bible says we all encounter, and if and when you actually [act on] (do) that thought, you are giving in to temptation. If you only think it, but never do it, then it seems you have resisted temptation. That said, it is a very dangerous thing to dwell upon temptation.<br><br>God's commandment to be fruitful and to multiply is not inconsistent with the fact that sex is a sin in my view(unless ur merried). It was spoken as taking place within the context of marriage, and it is in that context that most, but not all, of the Biblical geneologies are laid out.<br><br>.....so it can be reasonably inferred, that Jesus's words on adultery has consequential implication, NOT A commandment.....Therefore, personally, all so called "thought-sin" in the bible, as far as the Christians are concerned, is not a commandment. It is a GUIDELINE, how to do away from the sins, which keep us from fulfiling the two greatest commandments and putting ourselves right with the Lord.<br><br>I think I essentially agree. As I mentioned above, when you engage in masterbation u have fantasys 99.9%, you are subjecting yourself to temptation, and the Bible guides (I can accept that) you away from that. We are all subject, so matter how perfect we are (and none of us is perfect before or after being saved), to temptation. And as the Bible showed, even Jesus was subject to temptation on several occasions. Jesus was able to resist, but we, myself included, frequently do not.<br><br>this is a summary of the truth of masterbation.<br><br>hope i helped<br>Mr.X Peace<br><br></div>

First thing, many of you are here because of a reason !<br>The main reason for you reading this , is most probably that you want to found out, if masterbating is a sin !?<br>Lets get straight to the point, masterbating ? is it a sin ? Be honest with your self , what is the feeling you experience when you just ejaculated ? its GUILT ! you feel BAD, wanna know why ? simply because its wrong !!! why do you think GOD created us in such way to distinguish the right from wrong !? The God , has given us the ability to understand what we are about to do is something , right or wrong ? If you are a "normal" person , you would get the same feeling like everone else , THIS IS WRONG !!!<br>Lets me tell you why this is wrong ... ?<br>Masterabting , will make you fantisies OUTRAGOUSE fantasy !<br>Masterbating , is something that will disturb your studies or work !<br>Masterbating , is going to make you lose your confidence ..<br>Masterbating , will make your partner unhappy , BECAUSE YOU HAVE MASTERBATED ALL YOUR LIFE AND YOU CANT GET YOUR DICK TO EXPAND!<br>Everyone around you knows if you masterbate or not , just by the way you act ...<br>If you still are reading this , keep this in your mind , whether you are a girl or a boy ,  MASTERBATING WILL MAKE YOU ROT ALONE !!!! Masterbating will make you HATE yourself... !<br>SOLUTION:<br>Do you really want to stop !?<br>The reason for masterbating , is probably , becuase of the same reason like evryone else , you feel alone ,and no ones want you ...<br>I am this kind of person , I am 20 years old , and I have been most likley ALONE all my life , I have had chances to get my self a partner several of time , but I didnt manage to speak with them , because ... I have some communication problems , you can say my IQ is low .. so, by feeling alone , I masterbated ..  to waste time ...<br>but when I toke the time to surf around and see if this is wrong and see other ppl opinion , I realized that masterbating is something wrong , so what I am tryig to say , if you have a brain , dont masterbate ,  just dont touch yourself , and avoid sexual scenes , even pictures from girl with bikins .. this will only awake the SATAN inside of you ..... The most known feature with satan is that he keeps whispering things into your brain ... when you feel this hapening JUST TELL HIM TO FUCK OFF !!! and THINK OF !!<br>I DONT WANT TO ROT ALONE !!<br>This is all about it ... I hope this makes you to think about what you are doing is wrong , if you keep doing it , you will regreat doing it in a time when it is to late .... that time is when you die ....<br>Dont listen to the devil ...... otherwise .. you are going to Hell !!!<br>Thank you for reading this ... the way I stopped was by reading stuff like this , thats why I felt to make this contribution .. when you fell you are about to do it , just read more of this , and remember DONT WANNA ROT ALONE ! ...<br>byebye !  We get older day by day .. times are just going to fast .. try to make some good things before you die ....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I myself will say that it is a sin...People say that the bible is a load of this and that, but studying it in depth shows that everything is true. When a person masterbates they lust tord themselves. When it is said that we must not lust it means us also. In the book of Deuteronomy 23:10 Talks about something similar and in 23:14 it basicaly says that the LORD moved around the camp and if he saw these things he would leave them. And all through out this book you see that a women had to be pure. And masterbation is just a type of fornication. Fornication with yourself. And do not listen to those that say "everyone does it so it is okay", because Hebrews 13:8 clearly states," Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today and forever". And just remember Colossians 2:8 " Dont Let anyone lead you astray with empty philosophy and high-sounding nonsence that come from human thinking and from the evil powers of this world, and not from CHRIST". One last thing before I go, I am a 17 year old male and i do not masterbate myself because its better to go against your own body, which the LORD tells us to, then to fall short of salvation and then regret what you have done. May the LORD bless everyone and to everyone the peace and love of CHRIST~ FOREVER~ AMEN~.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
