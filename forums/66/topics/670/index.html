            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, well...I think that masterbation was best described by Jim's dad in American Pie...think of it as preperation for the "big game"...  Look at the percentages (now, I'm not dead on, but it's close), 94% of men say they masterbate, and so I've heard, chances are the other 6% of the guys are afraid to admit it.  I do believe that the same goes for women...if they say they don't, chances are they do, but are trying to keep themselves from being embarrased.  Now, is masterbation a sin?  No.  Why?  Well, as sexual tension builds up in a person, they need to release it...it can cause some problems, most likely mentally.  People use masterbation as an alternative to sex.  Now, for all you "God says it's bad" people out there, I have something to say...To Damn Bad...  Okay, okay, nobody masterbate, and just go out and have lots of sex with lots of people.  I bet God would perfer that (sarcasticly saying).  I say, as from a Saturday Night Live skit..."Sex can wait, masterbate"...  The point is, there should be no shame and no sin.  Do it if you wanna, don't if you don't, lie if you want, we all know the truth.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Masturbation at a young age is serious. Not dangerous but it could lead a person to develop sexual or perverse thoughts and fantasies. This might seem trival to begin with but may develop into something like an addiction.<br><br>As they grow older, they may use physical means to satisfy their sexual desires...and that usually means with another person possibly of the opposite sex, this may lead to uncontrolled needs and lead to adverse situations, or even forced sexual acts.<br><br>Stop masturbation. It's a scourge among pple. It may seem harmless but will doubtless affect pple's lives, especially when they grow up. It will affect the pple around them. And the last thing a person who is suffering from this "addiction" needs is to look at him/herself in the mirror and ask "Why can't i be a normal person like everyone else?"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Masterbation itself is not sinful. However, what goes along with masterbation(LUST) is. Most of the time when you masterbate you think about other people or lusting after them. Lust is a wrong in God's eyes and therefore sin.<br><br>The only way masterbation would be ok to do in my eyes would be if you were married and you were thinking about your wife or husband because lusting after your spouse in not a sin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>By Age 11...I was certainly liberated as my own human being and though I did not know it then I was liberated as a woman in a way too. If you are worried about masterbation being a sin to you; then it probably is...I'm a minister and also have empathic abilities... I DO NOT believe that masterbation is a sin! However...I do think that at eleven years old if YOU are asking this question then YES, for you, it IS. Perhaps you know that there is no reason for you to "grow" up so quickly...hmmm maybe you should hit the books so that you won't need to be dependent on others as an adult...for we all know One thing leads to another. I would suggest when you get BORED to pick up a BOOK and if you cannot because of time or tide, then write one! Much easier on the body and much longer lasting effects. Use your time wisely young one is my only advice and being so old and young I'm sure that you can know exactly what this means.<br><br>YOUTH IS WASTED ON THE YOUNG!<br><br>hehe but I still love ya!<br><br>------------------<br>Tarot Terra<br>www.lovetarotlive.com<br></div>

Indulging too much in sensual pleasures will only bring about more sufferings later. Unless you can practise it as a natural task like clearing our small and big intestines(which is good for our health by disposing all the filthy matters) or without acting on the basis of attachment and lust or knowing how to make use of it as part of spiritual training, then it's better not to be too involve in it.<br><br>It is advisable to be involve in a healthy relationships and in healthy activities like sports.</div>
