            <div class='col-md body'>we are able to see the defence capability of Singapore during NDP2000 and there was also a carnival at marina bay, displaying the army's weapons. Its was like as if going to war, having the tanks, APCs and IFVs rolling throuhout the streets of Singapore. People think that the SAF spent billions of money on defence, preparing for something that will never or should not happen, war. Does the SAF purchase high-tech wepaons, just to let Singaporeans have free rides onboard the multi-million machines and show-off the defence capability to neighbouring countries? YOUR OPINIONS PLEASE.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I disagree that the only purpose of the Singapore Armed Forces is only to show off to our neighbours.  They are also not there to allow our citizens 'rides in multi-million dollar machines'.<br><br>I firmly believe in the capability of the Singapore Armed Forces.  The machines on display in 2000, such as the AMX-13SM1 and M113, were to show both investors and citizens that Singapore is indeed secure.  Also, war is definitely NOT something which will never happen.  Just take a look around us today.  Instability in Indonesia is right at our doorstep.  However, we remain confident that Singapore is safe.  It is the presence of the SAF that gives us this confidence.<br><br>I also refer to the second post.  I believe that technology can indeed compensate for manpower in certain ways.  Technology can be used as a force multiplier.  For example, if 2 armies of similar size and skill were to face off, but one having only handguns and assault rifles while the other has strike aircraft, helicopters, mines, HE grenades etc, i think that the technologically advanced force will score a major victory.<br><br>For an example closer to Singapore's case, just look at the E2C Hawkeyes of RSAF, they buy precious minutes for our interceptors in the event of an airborne enemy attack.  This will give the RSAF a higher chance of intercepting the enemy.  It will result in less losses on the part of SIngapore.  The Lansort-class minecountermeasure vessels of the navy are another big help.  They ensure Singapore's coastal regions and sea lines of communications are kept free of mines in times of war.  This will also minimise losses.  For an example from the army, let's imagine that an artillary piece with radar support and another without, obviously, the artillary piece with radar will locate and engage the enemy faster than the artillary piece without radar.<br><br>I hope I have presented my take on the matter clearly and I welcome replies...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wayang is an important part of defence as well, when other ppl see that you have such new and advance technology, they will think twice before attacking you.<br><br>But more work needs to be done on their management and planning skills....</div>
