            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to strongly recommend TACT Beauty Care products.  It actually consist of hair &amp; body care products only.<br><br>I happen to see an article on the MIND YOUR BODY newspaper on Wednesday (6th July 07)featuring the products hence I went to take a look at it. The shop layout was really nice and the packaging of the products was presentable and lovely.<br><br>I bought the body cleanser and moisturiser and it was really good. It is not sticky and the products are all made from natural ingredients. Its a very suitable product esp in our country whereby the weather is so hot. Btw, It is sold at shaw centre level 3.<br><br></div>

You should try a shampoo suitable for your hair condition. There are different types I think <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Last sun, i saw Tact being featured in the ZAOBAO under Fresh Picks. I think Tact products must be very solid to be featured on Mind Your Body and Zaobao.<br><br>I will buy the showergel and have massage at Shaw Centre. The shop has massage services in a nice setting. Will update u after i go there <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi snowygal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I bought this Olive Tree shower gel. Its fragrance appeal is 5 stars out of 5!!! Smells nice and not so overwhelming sort of way for me. And the shower gel, since it is free of toxic stuff like SLS, it is relatively soap free, means less foam produced and easy to wash off without leaving any soap residues behind. Like u know, if you use normal soaps, shampoo with SLS, they can be difficult to wash off fully off your hands when u use them. No such problem with tact beauty care.<br><br>I also went for a massage. YOU MUST TRY!!!!! Anyone who see this thread, I very strongly recommend!!! Why? you may ask <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> if you go for massage in other places, the massage oil normally used are not easily absorbed by the body, giving a oily, sticky, unpleasant feeling at the end of the session. This shop "TACT Natural Beauty Care by M&amp;G" at Shaw Centre uses a rare type of massage oil that is easily absorbed by our skin! WOWWW! I have never came across such a wonderful massage oil  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> There are several types available, olive tree, ginger, lavander... forgot the rest. Smells very nice... I tried the olive tree.<br><br>in the massage room, it is very beautiful. nice environment, like you are situated in nature <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> i love nature! very relaxing massage. the masseur also skilled with tui-na. Slight problems like stiff neck and shoulders, poor posture  from too much time in front of the computer and major problems like strains, aches from over-training, stress-related problems melted away during the massage...... after the massage, very nice feeling as the massage oil easily absorbed. Not unpleasant after effects unlike those using normal massage oil.<br><br>Snowygal, you have to make appointment in case u want massage. The masseur will ask abt what you want or need and then she recommend the appropriate massage oil for u. Have fun and relax <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Dnomaid,<br><br>Thanks for ur wonderful recommendation!!!<br><br>Ur right, a lot of ppl dun like massage cos of the oily feeling that u will get after the massage and it applies to me as well... Tat's also why i usually dun go for massage..<br><br>I guess i will give it a try for the massage since u strongly recommend it... It's sounds so good and unresistable!!! By the way, do you have the tel number for the salon cos I would like to make an appt 1st... Hee.. I didn't manage to get a name card from them when I went there to buy pdts the other day.<br><br>I will post my comments once I have tried it... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello peeps!<br><br>yea.. i was thinking the same too. I was wondering how impressive these products can be. So i actually went down to shaw centre to check out this shop. In fact, there is really this shop called Tact natural beauty care by M&amp;G. I like the way the shop is furnished. Pretty cosy.<br><br>I asked the salesgirl about the shampoo for oily hair and the olive tree moisturizer. Initially i was worried that the salesgirl might force me to buy as i was asking alot of qns about these products. But i was surprised that the salesgirl didnt push me to buy and she actually offered me samples for the products.<br><br>I tried it and i was really impressed with the shampoo and the moisturizer. As in both shampoo and the moisturizer give off two different yet soothing fragrance. Pretty addictive. I thought maybe some chemicals were added to enhance the fragrance but i was told that there werent any. Natural fragrance!<br><br>Effective wise, currently my oily hair seems to be under control and my skin itch lesser everytime i apply the moisturizer after bathe. i would recommend those who have enzema to try it.<br><br>Anyway i think i should share this with the public. I believe in making a trip down to the shop and try. Since samples are available! =D</div>
