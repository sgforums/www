            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, who is a fan of Rooney here? I admire him a lot. He shows a great deal of potential despite his young age but he has a temperament. He just kicked the locker in the changing room after the 'unfair' match at the Manchester derby. Now he might be hauled up for FA questioning. Pray for him ok? What do you fans think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know what I like about him. He reminds me back of the old Man Utd team, where everyone fights and work very hard on the pitch for one another, running their socks off. Loyal players like Keane, Beckham, Giggs, Scholes, etc... I've been a Man Utd fan since 1992, can't remember the exact date but that was the year when they lost to Everton in the FA Cup. They lost the cup but I am fascinated by their never dying spirit, it's an inspiration really for me to see them fight to the last minute. Win or lose, it doesn't matter, they gave their best and I'm proud of them.<br><br>Nowadays, the man utd team is more self centred, not many is willing to work their socks off for the team anymore, the team spirit is kinda gone. Rooney is one of the few players left that truly fights for the team, who cannot take losing well, I like this attitude very much.<br><br>My greatest critic has to go to Mr Ronaldo, he is too individualistic and don't like to pass very much. He's always wanting glory instead of doing what's best for the team. Sometimes, because of him, the team morale drop and falter, image you run up/down the pitch 10 times when attacking and see your winger keeps running with the ball and got tackled, then you gotta run back again to defend due to his idiotic selfishness.</div>

But there's a rumour that Beckham might return to Man U after his contract at Real expires? Do you think it's possible?</div>
