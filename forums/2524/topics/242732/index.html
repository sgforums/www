            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">HOLLYWOOD - Jennifer Lopez was unimpressed by a magazine interview with her ex-boyfriend Sean 'Diddy' Combs' current partner Kim Porter, declaring the former model's criticisms of her were "not necessary."<br><br>Former model Porter dated the hip-hop mogul from 1994 and they had a son, Christian, together in 1997. However, Combs left her to date his musical protÃ©gÃ© Lopez in 1999.<br><br>After his high-profile relationship with Lopez ended in February 2001, within two years he had reunited with his old flame Porter and they now have baby twin girls D'Lila and Jessie, who were born in December.<br><br>In an October interview in Essence magazine, Porter blasted Combs' relationship with Lopez, declaring, "He fell for a booty and a smile," and admitted she used to tell the rapper he would return to her when he left "his little Puerto Rican girlfriend."<br><br>Porter admitted she was in contact with Combs every day of his relationship with Lopez and forbade him from letting their son Christian associate with the Latina beauty.<br><br>Porter said, "Does she look like the type that would want to play house and family with two little black kids? No."<br><br>When asked by the New York Post what she thought about Porter's comments, Lopez says, "I am not going to go there.<br><br>"Look, she knows what went on, I know what went on. And that is where we have to leave it. I am not going to discuss any of the details of that intimate relationship that I had with the public. It's just not that necessary." </span></div>
