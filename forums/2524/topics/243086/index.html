            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>... hearing on baby girl</strong><br><br>NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) A former boyfriend of Anna Nicole Smith who claims to be the father of her daughter expressed optimism following a court hearing Friday. But both he and the late model's mother, who is also seeking custody of the girl, refused to discuss the case.<br><br>Larry Birkhead, a California-based photographer seeking custody of Smith's baby girl, Dannielynn, said he was ``in a happy mood'' after the hearing but others were not as pleased with developments inside the courtroom.<br><br>``There were different moods for different people. I'm in a happy mood but I can't speak for anyone else,'' Birkhead said.<br><br>Virgie Arthur, mother of the 39-year-old reality TV star and former Playboy Playmate, and her attorneys left the Superior Court building without speaking. She wants to take the girl from Smith's live-in companion, Howard K. Stern, arguing she could provide a more stable home.<br><br>Stern, who is listed as Dannielynn's father on the Bahamian birth certificate, did not attend the hearing.<br><br>The court clerk's office closed near the hearing's end and nobody was available to answer questions about the proceedings in the three-way custody dispute.<br><br>The fight for custody of the infant, who could potentially inherit millions of dollars from her late mother's estate, began after Smith, 39, died of unknown causes Feb. 8 in Florida.<br><br>Meanwhile, a hearing on an ownership dispute concerning the house where Smith lived in the Bahamas was adjourned until April, according to an attorney for South Carolina developer G. Ben Thompson.<br><br>Thompson, who briefly dated Smith, says he advanced her money for the $900,000 house but she did not honor an agreement to repay the debt. Smith, who lived there with Stern in the months before her death, claimed the house was a gift.<br><br>Stern, has remained at the gated house known as ``Horizons'' with Smith's daughter.<br></span></div>
