            <div class='col-md body'>Naomi Campbell sure knows how to make an exit.<br><br>The mellowed-out supermodel completed the fifth and final day of her court-ordered community service Friday, strutting away from New York's Department of Sanitation garage in a sparkly Dolce &amp; Gabbana gown and silver stilettos.<br><br>But the celebratory gown wasn't just a feel-good move, although Campbell was saying goodbye to garbage and hello to a silver Rolls Royce. (Yes, quite the upgrade from the chauffeured Cadillac Escalade that had ferried Campbell to and from the NYC facility all week.)<br><br>Campbell's rep said that the professional poser was on her way to Elton John's 60th birthday party, hence the designer duds.<br><br>The British beauty sauntered out of sanitation duty, surrounded by paparazzi, at about 4 p.m. ET after a week of sweeping and mopping floors, scrubbing toilets and other tasks the Manhattan agency deemed fit for her.<br><br>"From what I understand, she was pleasant the entire time," sanitation department Deputy Chief Albert Durrell told the Associated Press.<br><br>A state of mind that will hopefully be the start of a trend for the often catty Campbell.<br><br>She was sentenced to five days of community service and anger management counseling after pleading guilty in January to throwing a crystal-encrusted cell phone at her former maid, Ana Scolavino, who needed four stitches after being on the receiving end of Campbell's outburst. The 36-year-old cover girl was also ordered to pay $363.32 to her ex-employee.<br><br>But Campbell can't afford blinged-out cell phones just because she looks good in picturesÂ—she's also a savvy businesswoman.<br><br>And one who knows how to make the most of any situation, according to the New York Daily News, which reported that fashion photographer Steven Klein joined Campbell as she arrived for her first day of service on Monday so that he could snap her for an upcoming spread in W.<br><br>A studio shoot for the magazine is rumored to have featured her clad in glamorous slinky outfits while scrubbing a bathroom and engaging in other tasks inspired by her stint with the Sanitation Department.<br><br>"Our policy is not to comment on upcoming editorial content," a W spokeswoman told the Daily News, while Campbell said in a posting on her Website, "I don't want to give too much away about the shoot and will leave it as a surprise."<br><br>Similarly, in 2005 Campbell helped market a line of Chip &amp; Pepper T-shirts tagged with the phrase "Naomi Hit Me," donning one for eager celebrity shutterbugs.<br><br></div>
