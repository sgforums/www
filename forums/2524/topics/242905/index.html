Her son Maddox and daughters Zahara and Shiloh Nouvel accompanied her.<br><br>Jolie visited Vietnam in November and filed papers in early March through an unidentified U.S. adoption agency without Pitt because under the law in Vietnam an unmarried couple cannot adopt a child, while a single person can.</span></div>
