            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Michael Jackson, visiting Japan for a series of fan events including a $US3,400 dollar-a-plate VIP dinner, has taken time out to greet US troops in a brief appearance at an army camp.<br><br>The 48-year-old 'King of Pop' appeared for about 10 minutes before an estimated 1,300 troops and their families at a fitness centre at Camp Zama in Tokyo's western suburbs, an eyewitness said. But he did not perform.<br><br>The crowd erupted into screams and cheers as soon as Jackson came onto a roped-off stage at the gym and was introduced by base commander Colonel Robert Waltemeyer.<br><br>Jackson gave a message of thanks from a prepared statement, calling the troops "some of the most special people in the world" who have given their lives to protect freedoms.<br><br>"Then he walked around the area in a big loop, waving and blowing kisses at fans as he went along. Afterward, they ushered him away and the place emptied out," the eyewitness said.<br><br>The event was open to all US military personnel, their families and guests. But it was closed to general media.<br><br>"He just wants to let them know 'America supports you' and so does he," Major Martha Brooks, a US Army Japan spokeswoman, told the US military daily Stars and Stripes before the event.<br><br>The crowd gathered about two hours before Jackson's arrival.<br><br>Organisers played his music videos and held a trivia contest and dance imitation contest ahead of his appearance, the eyewitness said.<br><br>Jackson arrived in Japan last Sunday (local time) and dispensed hugs and handshakes to more than 300 well-heeled Japanese fans who spent 400,000 yen ($4,331) a ticket for an exclusive dinner and a snapshot with the music legend on Thursday (local time).<br><br>On Friday (local time), he also appeared at a less expensive party with more than 1,000 fans at a night club.<br><br>He is reported to be suffering serious financial problems as he struggles to rebuild his career following his sensational trial.<br><br>Jackson was acquitted in 2005 of child molestation charges and fled his Neverland ranch in California.<br><br>He has since spent much of his time in seclusion in Bahrain.<br><br>He last visited Tokyo in May 2006 to receive a "Legends Award" at MTV Japan's Video Music Awards and to visit orphanages.</span></div>
