            <div class='col-md body'>Melanie Brown has spiced up her life with the arrival of a baby girl.<br><br>A spokeswoman for the former Scary Spice confirmed that Brown welcomed a "completely healthy" daughter early Tuesday in Santa Monica. Brown drove herself to the hospital to give birth in a delivery described as "straightforward and without complication."<br><br>"Mother and baby are now resting. No name has been decided on as yet, and she is purely known as Baby Brown," the rep said in a statement.<br><br>"[Brown] is looking forward to catching up on some sleep. Both mother and baby are expected to leave the hospital in the next few days and are looking forward to going back home," the statement continued.<br><br>Brown's mother, Andrea, and eight-year-old daughter, Phoenix, from her prior marriage to Dutch dancer Jimmy Gulzar, were both present for the delivery of the girl, whose demeanor was characterized as Â“calm and cheerful."<br><br>The newborn weighed in at 5 pounds, 4 ounces and was said to have a "good head of hair."<br><br>What the infant does not have, on the other hand, is a willing father figure.<br><br>While Brown, 31, has said there is "absolutely no question" that ex-boyfriend Eddie Murphy is her baby's daddy, that hasn't stopped Murphy from questioning his paternal role.<br><br>When a Dutch TV reporter asked him about Brown and her pregnancy in December, Murphy told the interviewer not to "jump to conclusions."<br><br>"You're being presumptuous, because we're not together anymore, and we don't know whose child that is until it comes out and has a blood test," Murphy said.<br><br>Following the interview, Brown issued a statement saying she was "upset and distressed" by Murphy's comments.<br><br>"I was astonished what Eddie said. There is absolutely no question that Eddie is the father.<br><br>"I have no idea why anybody would want to conduct themselves in this kind of manner about such a personal matter in such a public way."<br><br>Brown and Murphy began appearing together in public last summer, after Murphy's divorce from his ex-wife Nicole Mitchell was finalized in April.<br><br>In August, they vacationed together in Hawaii, accompanied by five of Murphy's children and Phoenix.<br><br>Speculation that Brown was pregnant began in October, when a telltale baby bump became evident. Around the same time, Murphy apparently lost interest in the relationship and took up with his current girlfriend, Tracey Edmonds, who is Babyface's ex-wife.<br><br>In a recent interview with a Chicago radio station, Edmonds shrugged off any drama surrounding Murphy's pending paternity dispute with Brown.<br><br>"Without me getting too deep into it, they had a quick relationship before I even got into that, before I got into a relationship with Eddie," she said. "So that's, like, their business that's going on.<br><br>"There'll be a paternity test, and if it's his then he'll be responsible."<br><br>If the baby is revealed to be Murphy's daughter, she will be his seventh child overall and will also share his birthdayÂ—the Dreamgirls star turned 46 on Tuesday.</div>
