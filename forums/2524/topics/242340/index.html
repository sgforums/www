            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">The rapper Snoop Dogg, formerly Snoop Doggy Dogg and sometimes referred to as the Doggfather, has been arrested and held overnight in Sweden on drugs charges. According to reports, the rapper and a female companion were stopped in Stockholm after police became suspicious that the pair were using narcotics. Duty sergeant Mats Brannlund of Ostermalm police said, "He was arrested for use of narcotics. It's illegal in Sweden to use them, even to have it in your system." A small amount of an as-yet-unspecified drug was allegedly found in the rapper's car, and tests are being carried out to determine exactly which illegal substance it is. The police added, "In two to three weeks, we'll know if he was on something."<br><br>It's unclear what raised suspicions in the first place, although the fact that Snoop is currently facing several weapons charges in the US might have put the police on red alert. Oh, and in totally unrelated news, Snoop is currently on the European leg of a tour, which just happens to be called Pass the Puff. Fo' Shizzle.<br><br>It seems there's a theme developing. The 35-year-old rapper's recent brush with the law is just the latest in a series of arrests. There was his arrest for affray at Heathrow Airport last April, when he and his entourage went on the rampage after being refused entry to the VIP lounge. Then, in September, Snoop was arrested for attempting to take a collapsible baton onto a plane at John Wayne Airport. A month later, police found him in possession of cannabis and a gun in Burbank, California; that was followed by a high-profile arrest after appearing on the Jay Leno show last November, where he was found to be in possession - again - of cannabis and a gun.</span></div>
