            <div class='col-md body'><strong>'ItÂ’s going to be a lot of fun.  ESPYS have always been very good to me'</strong><br><br>CLEVELAND - LeBron James is going Hollywood this summer.<br><br>The CavaliersÂ’ All-Star will co-host this yearÂ’s 15th annual ESPY Awards in Los Angeles with late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, the Associated Press learned on Tuesday.<br><br>ItÂ’s another first for the 22-year-old James, who has previously appeared on the show as a winner and presenter.<br><br>Â“IÂ’m really looking forward to it,Â” James told the AP. Â“ItÂ’s going to be a lot of fun, and a chance to get out there and crack some jokes along with Jimmy. The ESPYS have always been very good to me.Â”<br><br>James is the second athlete to serve as a host for the event, which honors the yearÂ’s best sports moments and athletes. Last year, cyclist Lance Armstrong hosted and the seven-time Tour de France champion also beat out James to win his fourth consecutive male athlete of the year trophy.<br><br>This is the first time the show has ever had co-hosts. The ESPYs will be taped at the Kodak Theatre Â— site of the Academy Awards Â— on July 11 and air on July 15.<br><br>James is no stranger to ESPN and its fans.<br><br>HeÂ’s an almost nightly fixture on the cable networkÂ’s SportsCenter, where his slam dunks, 3-pointers and no-look passes regularly make the highlight packages. JamesÂ’ ties to ESPN date back to his junior year at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary High School when the network televised one of his games.<br><br>Kimmel has twice presented at the ESPYs. He joked that he was looking forward to working with James Â— again.<br><br>Â“I am delighted to have been asked to host the 2007 ESPYs, but as a father, it is especially exciting to be asked to host with my son LeBron,Â” Kimmel said.<br><br>Although this will be his first foray into hosting an awards show, James insists he isnÂ’t scared.<br><br>Â“HeÂ’d better get nervous,Â” Kimmel cracked in a phone interview, Â“because if heÂ’s not heÂ’s not going to do a good job.Â”<br><br>Kimmel has hosted the American Music Awards three times. He and James met a few years ago backstage at the ESPYs.<br><br>Â“We shook hands and I said, Â’Hello,Â’ and he just kind of looked at me quizzically,Â” Kimmel said. Â“HeÂ’s very, very tall. IÂ’m not sure everyone knows that about him.Â”</div>
