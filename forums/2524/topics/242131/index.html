            <div class='col-md body'><strong>In the new film I Think I Love My Wife, the comic who has won awards and accolades for his raunchy stand-up slips into a quieter humour and, he hopes, a new career arc</strong><br><br>In Chris Rock's new film, he plays a moustachioed, bespectacled banker. He is often funny, but just as often serious and self-examining. It's a realistic film adapted from the 1972 French classic Chloe in the Afternoon (Amour l'apres-midi).<br><br>In short, it's a long way from Pootie Tang.<br><br>I Think I Love My Wife, which opens in Montreal theatres on Friday, is Rock's second time directing a film. The first: 2003's Head of State, a farce in which an alderman suddenly becomes a presidential candidate.<br><br>"If I did Head of State tomorrow, it would be more like All the President's Men," says Rock. "It would be that tone, with jokes."<br><br>Finding the right tone in movies has been challenging for the 42-year-old Rock. Many of his films - from the underrated Pootie Tang to the Farrelly brothers' Osmosis Jones - have been absurdist.<br><br>"I'm in ANOTHER place as far as films are concerned," Rock, with his trademark emphasis, says of the current aesthetic shift. "I wish I had gotten here a while back."<br><br>Rock's brilliant stand-up act - for which he has won three Emmys - has always been grounded firmly in reality. I Think I Love My Wife draws from his stand-up material, which has often dealt with relationships and a reluctant acceptance of married life.<br><br>"Those are the choices in life: You can be married and bored or single and lonely," Rock said in his 2004 cable special Never Scared. "Ain't no happiness nowhere."<br><br>In I Think I Love My Wife, Rock plays a married man with children whose fidelity is tested when an attractive past acquaintance (Kerry Washington) begins dropping by his office. There are definite gags (including a heavily advertised one involving Viagra), but much of the basic plot is taken from the aforementioned Eric Rohmer movie, one of his six moral tales.<br><br>"I know it sounds silly. People are like, 'Chris Rock and Eric Rohmer?' But if you study his movies and then you study my stand-up, they kind of go together," says Rock. "We immediately said (Chloe in the Afternoon) was like a great house with no furniture - no funny furniture, only serious furniture."<br><br>Rock co-wrote the script with his friend and frequent collaborator, comedian Louis C.K., who has honed an act known for its ruthless honesty about married life. Louis C.K. believes this is a new direction for Rock.<br><br>"I do think there are people that will go, 'Why is Chris Rock doing that?' " he says. "But it's actually a lot closer to who he is as a person and as an artist than any other film he's made before. People who are always expecting big (Adam) Sandler-like comedies out of him - they're barking up the wrong tree. That's not true to his voice."<br><br>Rock has long spoken of his deep admiration for another New York stand-up turned filmmaker: Woody Allen. It's not hard to see parallels between a typical Allen movie and I Think I Love My Wife, a romantic comedy set in<br><br>New York. Rock used Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters as a reference, but acknowledges his film is "so not on his level." Of his identification with Allen, Rock says: "I'm a nerd. I'm a little guy ... the last guy you'd expect in a romantic movie."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Of course, Hollywood is often unreceptive to change. Rock says the film was "definitely hard to get made" and that while most of his movie ideas sell before a script has been finished, he says "nobody jumped" at this idea.<br><br>He manoeuvred the complications of international film rights to get approval for the adaptation, and wrote the script on spec without a deal in place. Once the screenplay was completed, studios were still unconvinced.<br><br>Rock summarizes their reaction: "You? Grown-up? Got anything where you're a kid?"<br><br>"Guys play characters that won't grow up and something catastrophic happens and they have to grow up to save the day - that's pretty much what today's comedy is about," says Rock. "Nobody wants to make movies about grown-ups."<br><br>In the end, Fox Searchlight picked up I Think I Love My Wife (made for about $11 million) for distribution. That Rock's film landed at a boutique division specializing in independent movies is a barometer of his new direction.<br><br>"It's just part of the business. Whatever you do, if it's successful, you can do THAT again," says the actor-comedian. "Hopefully people will say, 'Oh, this is what he should have been doing all along.' Hopefully."<br><br>Rock lives in Brooklyn - not far away from his childhood home of Bedford-Stuyvesant - with his two young children and wife (Malaak Compton) of 10 years.<br><br>How did she feel about a movie based on a bored husband?<br><br>"She was a little scared at first, but when she realized it was a remake, she was cool with it. It made it less personal," says Rock, who assures us he's "very happy" in his family life.<br><br>Rock, who hosted the Oscars two years ago, has also brought family life to the small screen with his acclaimed television series Everybody Hates Chris, which is based on his childhood.<br><br>The Saturday Night Live alumnus has played several dramatic supporting roles in the past (Nurse Betty, New Jack City), but it's clear Rock believes I Think I Love My Wife starts a new chapter for him.<br><br>"I don't see myself writing any other movies that aren't in this kind of tone, this real tone," he says.<br><br>"You live and you learn. You grow."<br><br>I Think I Love My Wife is scheduled to open in local theatres on Friday. Chris Rock's TV series, Everybody Hates Chris, airs Sundays at 6:30 p.m. on City TV and Mondays at 10 p.m. on Fox.</div>
