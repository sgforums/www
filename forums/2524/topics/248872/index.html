            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Madonna sweeps into Malawi today with her family and adopted son David Banda - apparently for an emotional reunion with the baby's natural father.<br><br>But it has emerged that not only did Yohane Banda have no warning of her arrival, he has heard nothing of David since he was taken to Britain by the singer six months ago.<br><br>The revelation will increase pressure on Madonna, who is rumoured to be arranging the adoption of a second Malawian orphan.<br><br>Farmer Yohane, 32, said: "Officially I have not heard anything. There has been no communication whatsoever but I have heard the rumours and I get the feeling that she might be coming.<br><br>"I am excited. I hope that there will be an opportunity for me to see my son."<br><br>Although Mr Banda insisted he had 'no regrets' about agreeing to the adoption, he expressed disappointment that Madonna had not kept in touch, saying he would ask for her address and phone number so that he could contact her.<br><br>He said: "I understand that she is a busy person but if there is an opportunity, I would appreciate it if she could tell me how my son is doing, which has not been the case so far."<br><br>Meanwhile, the controversy over the fast-track adoption has been fuelled by claims that the singer's charity gave thousands of pounds to the Home of Hope orphanage in Mchinji from where David, now 18 months, was taken - raising concerns that the chance of receiving money might have encouraged the home to co-operate.<br><br>Despite protestations that Madonna had not given funds to the orphanage, it has emerged that her charity Raising Malawi financed a refurbishment.<br><br>A source at the home, which looks after 420 children, said: "Staff salaries have gone up, everything has been repainted, there are new clothes for the orphans, new beds and mattresses, and they've started work on new, bigger dormitories. I suppose you'd call it a reward for helping with the adoption."<br><br>The home has also started running courses provided by Spirituality for Kids, a group linked to the Kabbalah religion practised by Madonna.<br><br>Officially, Madonna is visiting the impoverished African country to support the work of Raising Malawi, which provides food, clothing, education and medical care to some of the one million orphans there.<br><br>She is also finishing a documentary about adopting from Malawi, which she has produced using her company Maverick Films but will sell to raise money for the charity.<br><br>During her week-long visit, Madonna is also said to be looking for a second child to adopt. There are rumours that she has picked out a three-year-old called Grace, whom she spotted on a video about an orphan care project.<br><br>But Madonna's publicist said: "She's going to Africa to continue her work with the children's care centre. She is not adopting another baby."</span></div>
