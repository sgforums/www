Her ongoing press campaign is doing nothing but harm to the children, and for that I feel truly sorry. For their sake, I wish she would stop."<br><br>Kim Mathers said she saw the interview as her chance to turn the tables on the entertainer, who has killed her off in song and assailed her with his lyrics.<br><br>Over the past decade, the pair have become one of Detroit's most talked-about couples, thanks to the on-again, off-again nature of their relationship. They also have struggled with substance abuse and have had run-ins with the law.<br><br>The pair grew up in the suburbs along Eight Mile Road, Detroit's northern border. They had a daughter, Hailie, in 1996, married in 1999, divorced in 2001, remarried in January 2006 and separated three months later. Their second divorce was finalized in December.<br><br>In addition to Hailie, Kim Mathers has another daughter and is raising her sister's daughter. Eminem has been legal guardian of his half brother.<br><br>Mathers said Friday that she was "100 percent sure" they never would get back together.<br><br>Eminem rose to stardom via a number of best-selling CDs, personal lyrics and a starring role in the hit 2002 film "8 Mile."<br><br>He has won nine Grammys, including best rap album for "The Slim Shady LP," "The Marshall Mathers LP" and "The Eminem Show." He won an Oscar for the song "Lose Yourself" from "8 Mile."</div>
