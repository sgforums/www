            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">POLICE have quizzed a man in his 20s who stalked Harry Potter star Emma Watson.<br><br>The terrified 16-year-old was confronted by the fan when he gatecrashed her school.<br><br>Police were called after the man got into some of the open lectures she attends.<br><br>And in the meantime, Emma was given a private BODYGUARD until the stalker was warned off by officers.<br><br>The actress Â— who has played Hermione Granger in all five Potter movies so far Â— has continued her studies despite her acting fame.<br><br>She is in her first year of A-Levels after a string of GCSE successes.<br><br>A source said last night: Â“The man was an admirer who was over-zealous.<br><br>Â“He found out there were some open lectures at the school and attended them.<br><br>Â“He left Emma alarmed when he approached her and started talking to her about the Potter films.<br><br>Â“The school was informed and so were EmmaÂ’s parents. The decision was made to call in the police as the man was not known to her.<br><br>Â“A minder was also hired to be with her.<br><br>Â“The police spoke to the man and he was warned off in no uncertain terms. There have been further incidents since they spoke to him.Â”<br><br>A pal of EmmaÂ’s said: Â“Not only was this worrying for Emma but also very frustrating.<br><br>Â“She and all the other young actors on Harry Potter have made great efforts to lead normal lives.Â”<br><br>Â“They have schooled as normally as possible around the acting roles, have lots of school friends and hobbies and are just young people growing up.<br><br>Â“Considering how they could have let fame affect them they are all incredibly grounded, none so more than Emma.Â”<br><br>The friend added: Â“She will try not to let this change the way she has to live her day to day life, but obviously the priority is her safety.Â”<br><br>The Sun knows the name and location of the school, but is keeping the information secret to protect her.<br><br>Emma has said her celebrity has been responsible for her not having a boyfriend.<br><br>She has said: Â“Guys are either intimidated by me, or they have defences up, or they like to take the p**s out of me.Â”<br><br>Emma, who is reported to be worth Â£2million, makes her fifth appearance alongside Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which has just finished filming.<br><br>Sources at studio Warner Brothers say she has just signed a deal to star in the last two adaptations of the JK Rowling books.<br><br>But her movie role Â— which began when she was just 11 Â— has also brought her recognition OUTSIDE the film world.<br><br>Last year she became the youngest person to appear on the cover of Teen Vogue magazine, at the age of 15.<br><br>She also joined Pierce Brosnan and Kenneth Branagh on a jury to select the 2004 teenage filmmakersÂ’ prize for the Film Award ceremony in LondonÂ’s Leicester Square.<br><br>Emma has a legion of fans, with a number of websites set up in her honour. </span></div>
