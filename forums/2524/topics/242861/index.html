            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;"><strong>A</strong> revision of Eric RohmerÂ’s 1972 comedy Â“Chloe in the Afternoon,Â” Â“I Think I Love My WifeÂ” transports Â“ChloeÂ” to New York City.<br>Richard (Chris Rock, who also directed) is the only African-American partner at the firm Pupkin and Langford. He is happily married to Brenda (Gina Torres), a beautiful, sweet-natured schoolteacher. They have a lovely home and two adorable children.<br>TheyÂ’re the younger, hipper Cliff and Claire Huxtable.<br>But they have stopped having sex. They are in couples therapy with a woman who is neither married nor a parent, and in voice-overs, we learn Richard is gazing longfully at attractive women in the street and going out of his mind.<br>Enter Nikki Tru (gorgeous Kerry Washington in a role originated by French actress Zouzou). Nikki is the incredibly hot ex-girlfriend of one of RichardÂ’s friends. She likes Richard, and because her current relationship is on the rocks, she seeks his comforting, Â“safeÂ” male presence. RichardÂ’s masculine co-workers gaze with lust when Nikki sashays through the office. The females, knowing Richard is married, seethe.<br>The film is alternately funny, tedious and predictable, a TV sitcom with R-rated dialogue. As RichardÂ’s somewhat older adviser and friend, Steve Buscemi is an always welcome presence. Torres and Washington are also fine, if limited by the material.<br>But Rock, who co-wrote the script with Louis C.K. (Â“Pootie TangÂ”), misses as often as he hits. A tirade about panties is dolorously unfunny, while a misadventure involving Richard and Viagra is amusing, indeed. Some things just donÂ’t work at all and make you wonder why anyone would think they would.<br>These include a game Nikki plays involving dropping dollar bills from heights and watching people below scramble for them and a scene in which the film breaks into a musical.<br>That Nikki seems a bit nuts and obnoxious makes any sympathy we might have for Richard fly out the window with those dollar bills. Behavior we might accept in a besotted Frenchman makes a highly educated, African-American professional look like a weak-willed fool. Perhaps such a man might risk everything for a little pootie tang on the side, but why should we care?<br>(Â“I Think I Love My WifeÂ” contains sexual situations and profanity.) </span></div>
