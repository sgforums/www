            <div class='col-md body'>NEW YORK (AP) Â— Britney Spears was the subject of intense media scrutiny Friday: Had the 25-year-old pop star checked in Â— and quickly out of Â— rehab? Larry Rudolph, Spears' manager, couldn't be reached for comment late Friday.<br><br>Syndicated entertainment TV show "Extra" first reported that Spears, who has drawn criticism for her recent excessive partying and sloppy behavior, had entered a treatment facility. Celebrity Web site TMZ.com then said the singer had entered a treatment center but had checked out one day later. Neither revealed their sources.<br><br>People magazine's Web site, citing "a source," said Spears had gone in and out of rehab, and identified the facility as Eric Clapton's Crossroads center in Antigua, in the Caribbean.<br><br>"Access Hollywood" then said the reports weren't true, but didn't cite a source.<br><br>A woman who answered the phone at Crossroads told The Associated Press that she couldn't confirm or deny anyone's presence at the facility.<br><br>On Tuesday, a gossip blog on the Hollywood.com Web site posted an e-mail that it said was from a former assistant to Spears, describing how the pop star was spiraling toward rock bottom and how friends and family wanted her to seek treatment.<br><br>Ruben Garay, who runs ThatOtherBlog, said the e-mail had come from Felicia Culotta, who was identified as having worked for Spears for nearly 10 years.<br><br>"I assure you with 100 percent certainty that the ... e-mail that Felicia sent in is 100 percent accurate," Garay told the AP in a phone interview. He also said the e-mail was legitimate.<br><br>Garay said he ran the fan Web site worldofbritney.com, which he shut down last year, and has known Culotta since 2003.<br><br>He declined to put the AP in contact with Culotta.</div>
