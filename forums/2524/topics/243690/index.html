            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">NEW YORK (Reuters) - Heather Mills McCartney, vilified in the British press over her bitter divorce from former Beatle Paul, made her debut in a U.S. television dancing contest on Monday with the judges calling her an inspiration.<br><br>Mills, 39, the first contestant with an artificial leg to compete in ABC's "Dancing with the Stars," said she joined the contest to show you can overcome any disability.<br><br>The former model turned charity campaigner wore a pink and creme sequined dress as she danced the foxtrot with professional dance partner Jonathan Roberts, receiving a standing ovation from some of the audience as their routine ended with few wrong steps and with Mills high-kicking.<br><br>"There was far more right about that routine than wrong," said Len Goodman, one of the three judges. "I think you are an inspiration to people to get out and dance."<br><br>The two other judges also praised her performance and the fact she joined the contest. Mills had her left leg amputated below the knee after being hit by a motorcycle in 1993.<br><br>But they criticized her tense upper body and gave the pair 18 points, which was middle of the field.<br><br>Mills, however, was pleased with the outcome.<br><br>"I'm just glad I did not fall over," said Mills, who had previously joked about flying limbs. "I thought I would be lowest so I am pleased."<br><br>The couple was among 11 pairs taking part in the fourth season of the popular dancing show on the Walt Disney-owned network in which professional dancers team up with celebrities in a knock-out contest.<br><br>But it remained to be seen whether the U.S. public Â— whose phone-in votes count for 50 percent of scores Â— would be as enthusiastic as the judges, or react as adversely to Mills as the British press, with the votes to be unveiled next week.<br><br>Other celebrities in the new line-up include world female boxing champion Laila Ali, the daughter of Muhammad Ali, and former 'N Sync boy band member Joey Fatone.<br><br>Mills has been thrust into the media spotlight since her divorce battle with McCartney started in the middle of last year. As the divorce grew increasingly nasty, Britain's tabloid newspapers have portrayed her as a gold-digger seeking to cash in on British icon McCartney's fortune.</span></div>
