              <p>I do not think it is sustainable because if the root cause of the health problems, namely , air pollutants, toxins in the food and drinks are not tackled then it would be difficult to resove the health problems that plague each family generation after generation. The poisoned vital organs will fail its function. For instance, the poisoned heart will stop functioning causing cardiac arrest and the person may die while exercising. If the poisoned liver fail to process the insulin then Type 2 diabetes will develop. How expensive the premium will be depends on the number of claimants. If the entire family get the disease be cause they eat the same toxic food and drink or inhale the same carcinogenic incense then the number of claimants may be more than premiums collected. This may mean there is a great chance of the need to adjust the premiums upwards. The insurance premiums only get higher and higher to keep adjusting for the increased claimants and diseases claimed.</p>
              <p>Therefore, the way to permanently resolve the uncontrollable insurance premiums is to deal with the cause of all health problems, eliminate the air pollutants, toxins in the food and drinks.</p>

              <p>Everyone has to pay for Careshield but if it is similar to Eldershield then only the bedridden who can't perform the normal functions  can claim.  The people with chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases if they are able to feed themselves cannot claim even though they pay for the Careshield premium. </p>
              <p>As for the Medishield life insurance, if people continue to eat or drink stuff containing toxic substances like sugar, artificial colouring, processed oil/sugar/salt, etc. as well as inhale the carcinogenic incense/cigarette/haze particles then the chance of the population get chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases is very high.  Once the vital organs are poisoned,  each person can get multiple health problems like heart/liver/kidney/brain and other organ diseases.  This implies the amount of premium collected may not be enough to cover the cost of treatment.  The Domino's effect would be to keep increasing the premium.  Therefore, to permanently resolve the health care cost problem is to ensure people eat and drink food that do not poisoned the body and breathe quality air. </p>
              <p>Eat and drink what the body needs and not what we want to eat.  It is the processed salt, sugar and oil that poisoned the vital organs.  Therefore,  people who consumed them end up with health problems generation after generation.  The poor people all the more should eat and drink correctly if they don't want to have any health problem. </p>
              <p>I resolved all my health problems when I stop eating the processed bottled oil, packet salt and packet sugar.  I derived natural salt=sodium from banana.  Natural oil from vacuum packed salmon= omega 3 oil.  Steam the rice, salmon, ginger and garlic without adding any bottled oil. Alternatively,  cook soup with lady's fingers with vacuum packed red snapper, garlic, ginger. For vegetables soak in baking soda for 15 minutes before rrinsing thoroughly.  Then blanch it in water at low heat.  By eating correctly  and drinking  just water.  I now have zero health problems and pain.  I do not take any toxic medicine or exercise. (Exercise does not heal the poisoned body.)  By eating correctly you  do have excess  weight. I have a good health report. </p>
              <p>Many toxic drinks claimed to healthy and many people drink every day.  Always remember  man made food or drinks have chemicals to extent shelf life.  Therefore they can't be healthy.  </p>
              <p>If everyone in Singapore watch what they eat, drink and inhale quality air,  we will not need to worry about health problem.  I am one living proof. </p>
