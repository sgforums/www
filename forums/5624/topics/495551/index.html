                          the health problems and the exorbitant high medical costs, the permanent
                          solution is to find the root cause of all the health problems. We have to

                               chemicals. Scientists all over the world have discovered it is more toxic
                               than cigarette smoking. To allow people to burn within the HDB units is
                               equivalent to giving the license to kill the incense burners, the
                               surrounding neighbours and the rest of the population through 3<sup>rd</sup> hand smoking. Everybody knows the
                               burning of the forests can trigger many health problems. The burning takes
                               place thousands of miles away, yet the whole Singapore is affected. I hope
                               people can realise the effect of people burning the incense in close
                               proximity of the neighbours and with such high frequency. Basically, the
                               incense burners are harming themselves, their current, future generation,
                               the neighbours, the rest of the population because the wind will blow the
                               particles to the other parts of Singapore. The rest of the population are
                               inhaling the 3<sup>rd</sup> hand smoke. 3<sup>rd</sup> hand smoke is odourless.
                               This unseen enemy<span>  </span>can trigger
                               chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases such as <span> </span>inflammation of the throat (severe sore
                               throat), incessant flow of mucus, throbbing headache, nausea, rapid heartbeat
                               and the normal blood pressure can either plummet to dangerously low levels
                               or spike up to abnormally high levels. We have to choose between inhaling
                               toxin frequently and subsequently the poisoned organs fail to function or
                               educate the incense burners to use a more environmentally method to worship
                               their deity. When the poisoned heart can't  function, the victim can get
                               heart attack while sleeping or running. When the poisoned liver can't function properly, the victim can get cholesterol when the fats cannot be
                               processed or Type 2 diabetes if the liver can process the insulin. If the
                               environment is being poisoned, the ozone layer will be destroyed causing people
                               to die of heat stroke. If the atmosphere is poisoned, the rain water will
                               become toxic. The toxin from the rain will contaminate the ocean, the soil,
                               the vegetables, fruits, etc. We will be drinking toxic water. The biggest
                               victims are the unborn foetuses, the children and the healthy non smokers.
                               Government all over the world should consider banning the sale of toxic
                               products. Of what use is it to stop the neighbouring countries from
                               burning the forests and our population is inhaling carcinogenic incense every
                               day? The only difference between IS and the incense burners is one group
                               kill with intention , the other kill without intention but the victims end
                               up dead. Frankly, I rather choose to be killed by IS because the death is
                               swift. I won’t die immediately from the incense but I end up suffering
                               physically, mentally and financially. The incense sufferers have no
                               recourse. They can’t take legal action against the incense burners to
                               recoup the high medical bills. The health problems will increase over time
                               as more organs are affected. The poor incense victims have to keep paying
                               for the high medical bills that keep increasing exponentially because the
                               burning never stops. Please note smokeless incense is also toxic. Any form
                               of burning will release toxins. I met a lady who has severe skin rashes because she burns smokeless incense. <span> </span></span><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; '>Incense should not be a taboo subject if it can harm lives.
                               The incense sufferers have the right to live and inhale good air quality .</span></li>

                               multiple times a day. They are the 1<sup>st</sup> hand smokers, 2<sup>nd</sup> and third hand smokers due to other chain smokers. They not only harm
                               themselves but everybody else including their own family members and their
                               future generation. Many babies of chain smokers are born with birth
                               defects. It can be problems related to skin, heart, kidneys, liver, blood
                               or any organ. <span> </span>Smokers are the most
                               selfish people around. They will throw their cigarette butts, empty
                               cigarette boxes anywhere: lifts, walkways, car parks, bus stops, grass
                               tufts, sidewalks, etc. They have no regard for life, their own life and
                               other people’s life. They are also foolish because they are puffing away
                               their money and have to spend more money treating the health problems
                               related to the inhalation of the carcinogenic smoke. They have no idea how
                               many healthy people, unborn foetuses, children have to suffer health problems,
                               die because of them. Shouldn’t the cigarette smokers pay higher insurance
                               premium as they are the culprits who cause so many non smokers’ health problems
                               and death. For every pack bought, they have to clean up the estate for
                               minimum 1 month plus pay a 20% surcharge to contribute to the insurance
                               premium fund. <span> </span>Shouldn’t the sale of
                               such toxic product be banned? The more tax collected from the tobacco companies means the the more health problems the population will have.</span></li>

                               unknowingly embrace the toxins without knowing that the toxic chemicals
                               can destroy the cells in our body. Of course, it will not manifest itself

                               special attire. One can imagine its toxicity. The population has to inhale
                               such toxin frequently. A better way to ward away mosquitoes is to grow
                               lime trees. The mosquitoes are afraid of the lemony smell. I use lemon to
                               shower instead of the toxic shower products. It can kill germs and
                               bacteria and it won’t harm the body.</span></li>
