              Types of  toxic air pollutants triggering chronic, terminal and autoimmune diseases  :
                  1.  Smoking: a chain smoker himself is a first, second and third hand smoker because of other chain smokers.  To understand how much toxins we are Inhaling every day we have to multiply the number of smokers by number of cigarettes puffed by each smoker .  Example 1 million smokers multiply by average of 4 cigarettes.  It means we are Inhaling this much toxin.and this is only 1 type of toxin. 
                  
                  2 Incense Burning: this is a hardly known and considered a taboo subject due to its sensitive nature.  But nobody dares to speak up,  then even if you get rid of the other types of toxins,  this toxin will still end up harming lives and our environment causing our medical cost to sky rocket. I am not a racist,  neither am I against any religion.  I am against using carcinogenic chemicals that scientists have discovered to be more toxic than cigarette smoking to burn in religious worship. Toxin is toxin.  You have to choose between harming the vulnerable  foetuses, children or healthy people over religious worship.  I propose using non carcinogenic product which does not require burning. Every form of burning will release toxin.    More than 2 types of carcinogenic chemicals are found in the incense which can damage the normal DNA causing cancer cells to develop.  Below are real life examples of aggrieved incense sufferers :
                  
                  1. Myself: Though I was once a sickly child highly medicated on a daily basis,  I  was able to heal my obesity, pigmentation joint pain, arthritis, etc. that I developed in my twenties due to the side effects of medicine by eating the appropriate food that my body needs to boost the immunity system.  Like every one else,  initially I did try Western doctors, Chinese physicians, diligently exercising but to no avail.  In fact,  my pain got worse.  Walking up or down the stairs was a very painful experience.  I had to position myself for every step in order to minimise the pain.  I was determined to find a permanent solution one that will not harm any part of my body in the process of healing.  I was able to use cheap,  natural food to heal all my problems WITHOUT medicine or exercise .  Now, I have zero pain and zero health problem. 
                  
                  Unfortunately,  my neighbour burns the incense and I developed severe allergic reactions.  The symptoms are severe sore throat (on several occasions the ENT doctors  had to put a tube through my nostrils(Redness and swelling were discovered)  , itchy rashes/hives, severe running nose (got nasal drip), nausea, rapid heat beat, throbbing  headache,  my normal blood pressure 112 /73 either plummets to dangerously low levels 115/49 or spike up to 137/87(taken by PARAMEDICS,  got snap shot to prove) . Both conditions are life threatening due to stroke or heart attack. Because I did inform the authority,  there were people who spoke to the person.  The person out of spite burned 24 hours.  I was very sure he was either not in his premise or he got someone to replenish or he replenish himself.  I landed in the hospital  2 days.  Upon admission,  my temperature was 40 degree Celsius.  The doctor discovered there was elevated enzymes in my otherwise healthy liver.  I have medical reports to prove. The medical cost was a whooping $800 plus not counting ENT, polyclinic, skin allergy clinic costs! I am a healthy person with zero health problem end up with so many health problems simultaneously.  What more will people with poor immunity get? 
                  
                  2. Right neighbour was diagnosed with nose cancer.  
                  
                  3. Left neighbour died of cancer.  I did not know.  It was the right neighbour who told me. 
                  
                  4. An old lady I met near my block told me that grand daughter since birth suffered from very severe skin condition.  The skin practically bleeds all the time.  It was very painful because the garment would be attached to her skin.  Now at age 21, she was very lonely because she developed inferiority complex ,  there were ugly scars and the bleeding  was still on going.  According to the old grandma,  both of them ever cried together.  She said she had tried all types of doctors,  both Chinese and western doctors  and medicines but to no avail.  I asked her if her neighbour got burn the incense.  Her answer was affirmative. I have read that overloading of toxins in the body from incense can cause different types of autoimmune skin diseases including psoriasis, butterfly children, etc.
                  
                  5. An Indian lady I met downstairs my block told me she got leaky gut syndrome which doctors or Indian treatment could not heal.  She also said her husband and child got psoriasis.  I asked her if she had burnt the Indian incense pellet (my neighbour used those) .  Her answer was the Indian joss stick.  I told her it was due to the overloading toxins that disrupt the immunity system causing their normal cells to malfunction.  I told her about the scientists' discovery.  She said no wonder one of her non smoking uncles was dying of lung cancer. Please read about incense's effect to our health, the foetuses, children and environment.  Singapore can't keep treating conditions without tackling the real culprit. 
                  
                  6. When viewing the HDB show room , I met several groups of people:  4 people told me they were suffering from low blood pressure,  itchy skin, giddiness, nausea  headache  after their neighbour rented the flat to a few people from India.  I asked the people if the foreigners did burn the incense.  Their answer was yes.  I showed her snapshots of my itchy rashes and they said theirs were the same as mine.  They said the doctor told them the rashes were due to insect bite and it was common for old folks to have cough,  nausea,  low blood pressure. 
                  
                  7. At the lift landing I overheard 2 ladies' talking about one of the neighbour:'s child.  A pregnant lady was exposed to the incense gave birth to a child with Thrombocytopenia.  One of the causes is due to air pollutants.  That kid cannot injure himself otherwise he will bleed to death.  I can't imagine the high medical costs incurred and the mental suffering she had to endure.  We have to deal with this unseen enemy that very few people are aware of before it claims more lives and cause our medical bills to become astronomical! 
                  
                  Initially,  I too,  was misdiagnosed.  But because I read extensively I know it was the carcinogenic chemicals that will disrupt the normal functions of the cells.  I was able to support what I said with police reports,  hospital doctors' letters.  
                  
                  The terrible plight of the incense sufferers is many people are ignorant of how severe the health problems are associated with this type of allergen.  It is a taboo subject.  But the incense sufferers and their families have to suffer physically, mentally, financially on a frequent basis.  The money we spend on the medical bills is a bottomless pit as long as the burning is on going.  My neighbour ever used his mother tongue to scold me and even gave me the daggers' looks.  Shouldn't I be the one to scold him instead for making me suffer and pay so much for medical costs that should not have incurred? 
                  
                  If people want to reduce medical cost,  the root cause of the problems should be dealt with.  Heat stroke is just a secondary reason.  The true culprit could be the poisoned heart that work tirelessly simply could not take the additional cumulative toxin either from food,  drink or the toxic air quality! 
                  
                  If we want to truly heal then we should aim for a smoke free Singapore! How many non smokers end up dying of lung/nose/mouth/throat or other types of cancers?  The poisoned liver if unable to process insulin you will get type 2 diabetes which Singapore is now grappling with.  
                  
                  Even the healthiest human cannot  inhale carcinogenic chemicals on a daily basis and remain healthy.  I am afraid while waiting for the new flat I may die due to cancer like my left neighbour. Though my neighbour did reduce the quantity,  I  still developed skin rashes, cough, nausea, blood pressure disruption, even my eyes were not spared,   etc.  The eyes will become red,  dry and there was a memo from National Eye Centre stating it was due to incense. Once again toxin is toxin.
