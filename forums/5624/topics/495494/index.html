              <p>People can get heart attack, stroke, chronic, terminal, autoimmune disease plus end up in the mental hospital just by trying to call the call centre for help. (Using a lousy word predictor will have the same effect). First, you will  be asked to press 1 for English, 2 for Chinese 3 for Tamil 4 Malay. 
                                                      Then you will be asked to
                                                       press 1 if you are a bank customer  (at this time I can feel my blood gushing to my brain, luckily I do not have any plaque { plaque is formed in the mouth or arteries due to poor oral hygiene or eating too much of sugary or unhealthy food.  It can cause stroke or heart attack}  otherwise I will end up getting a stroke or heart attack) If you can’t speak any of the language mentioned, you just anyhow press 1 number.  After that you can’t communicate with that person because you don’t understand her and vice versa.
                                                      
                                                      Press 2 if you are not a bank customer (I always press this option because I know they won’t ask me to press identity card number. Previously, I ever press for my ic number. Unfortunately, I happened to press 1 number wrongly I have to call again and go through the hellish procedure. I almost had to call the 995 for the ambulance. I told myself I WILL SURVIVE {TINA TURNER’S SONG. SOMETIMES I THINK THEY COMPOSE THE SONG ESPECIALLY FOR ME BECAUSE THEY KNOW I NEED IT WHENEVER I CALL ANY CALL CENTRE.) The worse is some companies got even longer options for me to choose. Usually for those type of companies, I will want to be a professional Terminator like Arnold Schwarzenegger and wipe out the smart alex for trying the patience of people who are trying to get a simple help. (Remember I ever mention: Everything is simple, only foolish people makes things complicated). 
                                                      
                                                      Then you will be prompted to choose 
                                                      1.	Internet banking
                                                      2.	Credit card
                                                      3.	Loan
                                                      4.	Fund transfer
                                                      5.	Foreign exchange
                                                      6.	Gold bullion 
                                                      7.	Incense paper (if the customer died after trying to seek for help at the call centre. Most likely I will be the persistent deceased person  who would try  to call for  help like Peter Gabriel's song "DON'T GIVE  UP" Frankly  I do  not  know  this  song  exists  but  I suppose  this  guy  knows  me  even  though  I  have  not  the  slightest  inkling  who  he  is. Perhaps  he  read  my  childhood manuscripts)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>(Actually I make up some options because I always do not hear the rest. If the first 2 options are not what I want I just press 1 so I can talk to  a human being faster)The first thing I said was to trash the automatic voice recording because  it did not have any of the options I wanted and it is very frustrating to use.
                                                      
                                                      The funny thing is even though I press I am not a bank customer, the next message said press 1 if you lost your credit card. Do you see how ridiculous is? A non bank customer can lose that bank’s credit card. How? Un.....un.....unbelievable! After stroke I will become a vegetable (I think this is my version)....The worst night mare is sometimes the call centre staff can’t answer the question asked. She will tell me another person will call me within 3 working days. Imagine calling call centre for help and I can’t get any help. I do not know how many cells of mine actually die but I hope I can survive otherwise it will be a TRAGEDY like the Bee Gee’s song.
                                      If a staff answers the call, she will start to treat me like a criminal. She will ask for the name, identity card number and address. Lately some book smart person actually feels it is good to have this type of  question as an added security. She will try to check if I have dementia. The staff will ask what is the giro linked to this account. My reply is I could not remember what I ate 1 day ago. How could I remember a giro that was linked 3 years ago? At this time I will try to act like multi millionaire. I will tell the staff I have many bank accounts how do I remember which giro is linked to whichever account? The staff will say if I don’t answer she won’t be able to verify and she will not be able to proceed. I would say how could I answer a question that tests on my memory and not what I should know like my address or date of birth? Frankly, a person needs to have 18 lives in order to survive a call centre. I find that it is more like a quarelling centre than a call centre. 
                                                      
                                                      I week later, somebody from the bank call, by then I could not remember what I wanted to ask. This is the pathetic life of a bank customer. Now you know why I say the chronic, terminal and autoimmune disease are NOT due to FAMILY HISTORY.  "Staying Alive" is Bee Gees’ composition to spur me on. The other song they dedicated to me  is "Too Much Heaven". Originally it was called “Too Much Hell”! (I told Barry to be positive in giving a title as  people will be gravitated  to the good and shun the bad  ( my  quotable  quote). Because of me he changed the title and it became a big hit , the rest is history and geography). I mean it when I say I want to Heal The World emotionally, mentally, physically and monetarily.  Has my book become a series yet? Talk 3 is over talk 4 is coming up. "Th... th... thaaat's all folks!
