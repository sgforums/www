              <p>SINGAPORE: The Opposition parties are not letting up on the issue of 
              ministerial salaries, as they continued to shine the spotlight on what 
              Government ministers are earning, on a day which commemorated the 
              efforts of working men and women.</p>
              <p>As Singapore marked Labour Day 
              on Sunday, Opposition candidates called for a reduction in ministerial 
              pay and took aim at the People’s Action Party (PAP) Government’s 
              rationale of pegging the remuneration of Cabinet Ministers to the top 
              six professions.</p>
              <p>Suggesting that the ministerial salaries should 
              instead be benchmarked at 30 times the median salary of the Singaporean 
              worker — thus working out to almost S$1 million a year — the Singapore 
              Democratic Party’s Michelle Lee said: "That would ensure it is in their 
              interest to make sure your salary increases as well."</p>
              <p>Also calling
               for greater scrutiny of the performance of the ministers and their 
              ministries, Ms Lee, a candidate for Holland—Bukit Timah GRC, said: "CEOs
               are fired for their mistakes. Businessmen take risks and losses. So how
               can the private sector be a fair benchmark?"</p>
              <p>Ms Lee had last 
              Thursday criticised the "new PAP" for not matching up to its 
              predecessors. On Sunday, she said: "It’s time for some corporate 
              governance in our Parliament. The Government should answer to us. The 
              old PAP knew this but the new PAP seem to have forgotten who they work 
              for."</p>
              <p>Mr Steve Chia, the National Solidarity Party candidate for 
              Pioneer SMC, claimed the ministers "have lost their way". Said the 
              former Non—Constituency MP: "Their focus is on themselves and their 
              bonuses; their focus is not on (Singaporeans)." He proposed scrapping 
              the GDP growth—linked key performance indicator (KPI) for ministers, and
               including other factors such as per capita income.</p>
              <p>Workers’ Party
               chief Low Thia Khiang took a dig at the shortage of candidates willing 
              to jettison their corporate suits for the PAP’s white—on—white garb — a 
              point conceded by the PAP leaders themselves — despite the attractive 
              remuneration for key office holders. Only eight of the 24 new PAP 
              candidates hail from the private sector, the same fertile ground from 
              which the Opposition has unearthed a bumper crop for this General 
              Election, Mr Low noted.</p>
              <p>"So what happened to the high quality 
              people from the private sector that the high salaries were supposed to 
              attract? If high quality people from the private sector are turning to 
              the Workers’ Party and other Opposition parties, it is a sign that good 
              government does not necessarily require high salary," he said.</p>
              <p>Singapore
               Democratic Alliance candidate for Pasir Ris—Punggol GRC Sidney Soon 
              suggested that the number of ministers be cut and that the money saved 
              on their salaries be used to raise the wages of the rank—and—file in the
               Civil Service.</p>
              <p>Calling for ministerial salaries to be reduced, 
              Reform Party candidate for Ang Mo Kio GRC Arthero Lim alluded to Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s comments during his PAP rally speech on 
              Friday.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Lim: "(The ministers) say they should be paid so 
              much because they are the elite. But even the Prime Minister had 
              admitted that the Government has made mistakes so it shows they are not 
              that great." (additional reporting by Ansley Ng, Christopher Toh, Ng
