              <p><em>Goh Meng Seng, Secretary-general of NSP (Photo: Yahoo!).</em></p>
              <p>Secretary-general of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+solidarity+party&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">National Solidarity Party</a>, Goh Meng Seng, is going for broke in the next General Elections.</p>
              <p>Literally putting his money where his mouth is, the 40-year-old sold 
              his 4-room HDB flat in Serangoon North in September to fund his party’s 
              election campaign plans for the next GE, due to be held by Feb 2012.</p>
              <p>In an exclusive interview with Yahoo! Singapore, Mr Goh – who 
              currently manages a retail business — said the decision to sell his only
               home in Singapore is nothing to shout about.</p>
              <p>“Most of the time, leaders of the opposition parties will put up with
               some funds to support the whole party’s campaign. There is nothing new 
              to it,” said Goh, who currently lives with his 81-year-old mother in 
              Ang Mo Kio. Mr Goh, who currently manages a retail business also has a 
              wife, 39, and daughter, 7, residing in Hong Kong.  </p>
              <p>While Mr Goh declined to reveal how much he sold his flat for, checks
               on several property websites show that the average price of a 4-room 
              flat in Serangoon is around $400,000 to $450,000.</p>
              <p>Proceeds from the sale, he said, would not be used to fund his own 
              election campaigns and candidacy but will be directed to the coffers of 
              the NSP “to sponsor a team” for election as well as support the party’s 
              overall strategy.</p>
              <p>The cost of running for elections is not cheap. For example, 
              on Nomination Day for the last 2006 General Election (GE), 
              each candidate had to fork out an election deposit of $13,500. This 
              doesn’t include campaign costs incurred by the respective campaigns 
              which could easily cost thousands of dollars.</p>
              <p>Election rules also state that the deposit is to be forfeited if the 
              candidate fails to obtain at least one-eighth or 12.5 per cent of the 
              votes.</p>
              <p>Goh’s involvement in local politics has spanned over 10 years. In 
              2006, while still with the Workers’ Party (WP), he was part of the team 
              led by Ms Sylvia Lim which contested the Aljunied GRC.</p>
              <p>While results saw the WP securing 43.91 per cent of the vote and the 
              PAP claiming 56.09 per cent, that constituency’s election was marred by 
              the controversy involving James Gomez, who claimed to have submitted the
               minority-race candidate application form  required to stand as a 
              candidate in a GRC.</p>
              <p>CCTV footage later showed he had kept the form in his bag and Gomez was labelled a “liar” by MM Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh left the party shortly after elections, joined the NSP and was
               elected the party’s secretary-general in February this year.</p>
              <p>Touching on the GE, Mr Goh singled out three “hot-button” issues that
               would dominate campaigning after Nomination Day: health care, 
              population and foreign talent policy.</p>
              <p>In particular, he also highlighted public housing which “will no 
              doubt be a key issue because it affects 80 per cent of the people”.</p>
              <p>On the issue of healthcare, Mr Goh is calling for a more 
              comprehensive health insurance because he feels the present coverage is 
              insufficient.</p>
              <p>“In ensuring effective insurance coverage for its citizens, the 
              government should provide part of the premiums of health insurance which
               should also include non-working adults and children.”</p>
              <p>And what if Mr Goh loses in his bid to contest the Tampines GRC?</p>
              <p>After all, National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan has been the 
              anchor MP in Tampines since 1988. In the last GE, the 5-man PAP team led
               by the Minister won a clear 68.51% majority of votes while the 
              opposition team of Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) secured only 
              31.49% of votes.</p>
              <p>“If I lose, then it will depend on whether my party needs me to stay 
              on for the transitional period. There will inevitably be a transition 
              for leadership change,” said Goh.</p>
              <p>Goh also said he would decline to take up the Non-Constituency 
              Members of Parliament scheme offered to losing opposition candidates 
              with the highest votes.</p>
              <p>In April this year, Parliament amended the scheme to increase the 
              number of NCMP seats from six to nine. While NCMPs are allowed to 
              participate in parliamentary debates and even raise motions in the 
              House, they are unable to vote on constitutional changes. Based on the 
              constitution, such powers will remain as privileges of an elected MP.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh echoed the views of Hougang’s opposition Member of Parliament,
               Low Thia Khiang, who said he will not take up the NCMP seat if he loses
               in an election.</p>
              <p>“I want the full power as an MP, fair and square. If I don’t win, I will not take the NCMP seat,” he said.</p>
              <p>Signalling his intention that he’s ready to quit politics altogether 
              if he loses, Goh said the time will come when he has to tough 
              decisions. </p>
              <p>“Personally, I have set my target right from 2001 where I am willing 
              and prepared to spend 15 years of my life to try to contribute to the 
              Singapore political cause as much as possible. After which, I will have 
              to move on,” he said.<br><strong><br>Source:</strong><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/12/03/going-all-out-in-the-name-of-politics/"><br>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/12/03/going-all-out-in-the-name-of-politics/</a></p>
