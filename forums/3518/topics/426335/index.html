              <h3 class="date_story">Mar 27, 2011 - Sunday Times</h3>
              <p>By 
              																				Cheong Poh Kwan</p>
              <p>OPPOSITION stalwart Low Thia Khiang made little attempt to defend his 
              party chairman Sylvia Lim's statement that Workers' Party is not ready 
              to form a government yet.</p>
              <p>Ms Lim gave the frank assessment of her party at a recent 
              forum held by the National University of Singapore's Political Science 
              Alumni Association. She later told RazorTV that while the Workers' Party
               has made progress in terms of membership volume, it is not ready to 
              form a shadow cabinet as yet, especially one that is made up of 
              experienced professionals who can look after public policies in all 
              areas.</p>
              <p>Such seemingly self-defeating remarks may have dampened voter's 
              confidence in the Workers' Party (WP), but Mr Low said he agreed with Ms
               Lim that it is more important to be honest with voters than to 
              over-promise.</p>
              <p>'I am against all kinds of empty promises,' said Mr Low, 
              adding that he does not want to mislead the public into thinking that 
              his party can deliver what it actually cannot.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters during his walkabout at the Bendemeer 
              Market and Food Centre, Mr Low stressed that Workers' Party will 
              definitely contest in the new Moulmein-Kallang GRC, which includes 
              precincts in the former Jalan Besar GRC and Tanjong Pagar GRC.</p>
              <p>The National Solidarity Party is also eyeing the new GRC, 
              but will only make way to avoid a three-cornered fight if WP fields an 
              A-team comprising of either Mr Low or Ms Lim.</p>

              it, having too much opposition in parliament really slows things
              down. Its like when a policy is put up for action, half the time
              its always vetoed off and then reassessed, by the time its put in
              place, god knows when man.</p>

              <p>It is good that WP stated that they cannot form a government.</p>
              <p>If the opposition wins big and life continues to be shit (because all the PRs are already here or PAP refuses to build more flats) or PAP deliberately let the economy go to shit, PAP will gladly lay the blame at the opposition's door. Fortunately PAP will still be in charge. At most, LKY can say he was distracted trying to "fix the opposition" but nobody is going to believe him.</p>
