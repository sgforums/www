              <p><br>PAP candidate Lui Tuck Yew lodged police report against resident<br> May 4th, 2011 |  Author: Online Press <br>PAP candidate for Moulmein-Kallang GRC Lui Tuck Yew has lodged a police report against a resident for ‘confronting’ him during a walkabout.<br>In a wall post on his Facebook page yesterday, Mr Lui described the incident as the “most nasty moment of our campaign so far.” The news was first reported by TODAY.<br>Mr Lui wrote that a resident who had claimed to be an ardent opposition supporter was threatening him and his team and “calling the PAP government the worst (more vulgarities) government in the world.”<br>“He just wasn’t interested in any explanation. I certainly hope that even our most ardent PAP supporter would not resort to such behaviour when he encounters the opposition. Just so that this episode would be placed on record, we alerted the Police. Hopefully, this will be the first and last of such encounters,” he added.<br>It is not known if the poor resident has been arrested by the police who are super-efficient when dealing with police reports made by the PAP.<br>PAP leaders are infamous for making police reports over seemingly trivial matters which can be resolved amicably without alerting the police and wasting precious public resources.<br>In January 2009, PAP MP for Aljunied GRC Cynthia Phua lodged a police report against a mentally challenged teenager who slammed a chair against a glass door during a Meet-the-People session who was arrested by the police the next day.<br>Though the teenager and her mother apologized for the outburst later and beg the PAP MPs to let them off, they refuse to do so.<br>‘I made it very clear to (the mother) that this is unacceptable behaviour. It is not justifiable in any circumstance. There’s no excuse to be violent,’ said another Aljunied PAP MP Lim Hwee Hua. (read more here)<br>In March 2010, PAP MP for East Coast GRC Lee Yi-Shyan lodged a police report against an unhappy resident who reminded him of the Seng Han Thong torching incident during a Meet-the-People session. He was arrested by the police the next day and fined $2,000 for criminal intimidation.<br>Singaporeans who see PAP candidates on their walkabouts must treat them with extra ‘care’ lest they offend them and get hauled up by the police for questioning for no good reason.</p>

              <p>This is typical example of "elitist" government.</p>
              <p>PAP always think they are RIGHT, and whoever oppose them is WRONG!</p>
              <p>If you oppose PAP, u must "REPENT" (according to MM Lee). or I ask police to arrest you (according to LTY)</p>
              <p>Democracy? more like autocracy for me. and just a bit short of being communist.</p>
              <p>I think better change our singapore pledge. otherwise I feel pain whenever I pledge Singapore as a "DEMOCRATIC" country. sob sob..</p>
