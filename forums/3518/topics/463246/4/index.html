              <p>THE Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) became the fourth opposition party yesterday to throw its hat in the ring for Punggol East.</p>
              <p>   But party chief Chee Soon Juan will not be its candidate for the single-member constituency, should a by-election be held there.</p>
              <p>   Dr Chee told reporters this during a press conference held to announce SDP's plan to contest the constituency, which fell vacant after its MP and Speaker of Parliament Michael Palmer resigned following an extramarital affair.</p>
              <p>   Reporters had asked Dr Chee if he would be SDP's candidate as he was no longer a bankrupt.</p>
              <p>   He said he was not eligible to stand for election until 2015 because of fines that exceeded $2,000.</p>
              <p>   Under the Constitution, a person is disqualified from standing in an election for five years when he has been fined more than $2,000, jailed for more than a year, or given both penalties.</p>
              <p>   Dr Chee was fined $20,000 in 2010 for four offences committed in 2005 and 2006. They were for speaking in public without a permit.</p>
              <p>   The party said it would decide on its candidate "in due course". Asked if party treasurer Vincent Wijeysingha was in the running, Dr Chee said he would "not be ruled out".</p>
              <p>   Speculation has been rife online that the party may field Dr Wijeysingha. He was present at the press conference but declined to comment.</p>
              <p>   The SDP's entry into the fray looks set to turn a Punggol East by-election into a six-cornered fight.</p>
              <p>   Three other opposition parties - Workers' Party, Reform Party and Singapore Democratic Alliance - have signalled their intention to contest while Mr Benjamin Pwee has expressed interest in running as an independent.</p>
              <p>   He is a former member of Singapore People's Party.</p>
              <p>   When asked if SDP's move would dilute the opposition vote, Dr Chee said it was targeting citizens who normally vote for the People's Action Party (PAP) but have since "lost their trust" in it.</p>
              <p>   "Our target is to win the votes over from the people who are fed up, but at the same time haven't seen an opposition party that is able to offer alternatives they can really sink their teeth into," he said.</p>
              <p>   SDP said it had produced several comprehensive policies, ranging from housing to health care.</p>
              <p>   "We would like to offer a new type of opposition politics to the voters... We are keen to put our policies before the voters of Punggol East," it said.</p>
              <p>   Dr Chee also said the SDP would be contacting other opposition parties to "come to an agreement" on who should contest.</p>
              <p>   Former Nominated MP Siew Kum Hong believes a six-cornered fight "will only hand Punggol East to the PAP on a silver platter''.</p>
              <p>   He added: "If any opposition party other than WP contests, it would be taking a huge risk of being seen as a spoiler, which would inevitably affect its chances in the next general election."</p>

              <p>The most important national issue NOW is to find the replacement National Coach since Raddy have resigned from his post.</p>
