              <p><cite class="byline vcard">By <span class="fn">Alicia Wong</span> | <span class="provider org">SingaporeScene</span> - April, 2, 2011<abbr title="2011-04-02T04:49:49Z"></abbr></cite></p>
              <p>Two
               new candidates that could form the core of Singapore's 
              fourth-generation leadership were revealed to the People's Action Party 
              activists on Friday night, and another two are set to be introduced on 
              Saturday.</p>
              <p>According to <em><span id="lw_1301719862_8" class="yshortcuts">The Straits Times</span></em>,
               former army chief Chan Chuan Sing was introduced in Buona Vista on 
              Friday night, and former Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) head Heng
               Swee Keat was present at a closed-door meeting at Tampines.</p>
              <p>Major-General Chan joined the <span id="lw_1301719862_9" class="yshortcuts">Singapore Armed Forces</span> in 1987 and stepped down as army chief last Friday. He is expected to 
              contest in Tanjong Pagar GRC in the coming General Election.</p>
              <p>"I've started on this new path, but the work that I do will be no 
              different from what I had to do 20 years ago, when I had to go down to 
              each and every soldier to win their trust," he said to an audience of 
              PAP grassroots leaders.</p>
              <p>Switching effortlessly between English, Mandarian and even a 
              smattering of Bahasa Indonesia, he said he would work the ground at 
              Buona Vista "to get to know the residents... their concerns and 
              aspirations... then we can build a team together."</p>
              <p>Heng, 49, has not been officially announced as a PAP candidate but <span id="lw_1301719862_5" class="yshortcuts">Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong</span> welcomed him to politics in a Facebook post on Friday.</p>
              <p>SM Goh described Heng, who spent six years in MAS, as a "high-flier 
              and sound central banker" with the "potential to be a minister and core 
              member of the fourth generation team".</p>
              <p>On Thursday, Heng bade farewell to his MAS staff by going floor to floor to say goodbye.</p>
              <p>Likely to be fielded in Tampines GRC, now anchored by National Development Minister <span id="lw_1301719862_3" class="yshortcuts">Mah Bow Tan</span>,
               Heng could be set to follow in the footsteps of former civil service 
              high-fliers such as Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Health 
              Minister Khaw Boon Wan.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, SM Goh will introduce Brigadier-General Tan Chuan Jin to
               Kampong Ubi branch activists as their prospective Member of Parliament.</p>
              <p>Former Energy Market Authority chief executive Lawrence Wong will also be meeting Boon Lay residents at an evening event.</p>
              <p>The paper noted that all four candidates will be placed in GRCs where
               the current anchor minister is a senior politician but who does not 
              have second-in-command to take over the helm.</p>
              <p>As SM Goh, who asked the Prime Minister for a strong new candidate,
               wrote in his Facebook page last weekend,"In this general election, I am
               planning for someone to succeed me in leading the GRC one day."</p>

              <p>but one thing, i fully believe that if you were in his unit, he would def talk to you even if you private. from what i heard this guy is outstanding. down to earth, on the ground, brilliant. havent met many army ppl who've met him and not had a positive impression of him.</p>

              <p><strong>GE: SM Goh hints ministers may not serve for more than two terms</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 03 April 2011 1217 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : Senior 
              Minister Goh Chok Tong has said the People's Action Party (PAP) has not 
              been successful in getting people from the private sector, despite 
              trying very hard.<br><br>Still speaking on leadership renewal, he said 
              that in time to come, Cabinet Ministers - with the exception of former 
              prime ministers - may just serve two terms to make way for new blood.<br><br>That is because the government may want to bring in new people, who would have to be given ministerial responsibilities.<br><br>Mr Goh, who is also an MP for Marine Parade GRC, made this point at a dialogue in the Ubi division of the GRC on Sunday.<br><br>He
               also thanked retiring MP for the GRC, Dr Ong Seh Hong, and introduced 
              the new addition to his team, Brigadier-General (NS) Tan Chuan Jin.<br><br>It is understood that Brig-Gen (NS) Tan will understudy Dr Ong.<br><br>Mr
               Goh said: "BG Tan will be (in my view) a member of the people whom PM 
              (Lee Hsien Loong) will be testing out. If he makes it, he will be a 
              member of the core team. Hopefully he succeeds in being one".<br><br>He 
              added: "Unfortunately, we are not able to get people from the private 
              sector. We have been trying very hard and that is something we would 
              admit."<br><br>"But you find that people in the private sector in their 
              forties, they do not want to come in because you are number two, you can
               become number one. And there is much more freedom, there is no slamming
               or flaming by the Facebook or the netizens, life is comfortable for 
              them, very few want to come in."<br><br>Meanwhile, Brig-Gen (NS) Tan 
              said: "What I hope to do for a start is to listen and to learn from all 
              of them, including the grassroots leaders about what are the needs, 
              challenges here and what is exciting going forward, so that we can bring
               the community together, look after the people to best of our ability 
              and build a future we can all be proud of."<br><br>He also shared his 
              experience with the dialogue participants about Singapore's assistance 
              to Aceh after the tsunami six years ago. He said: "What I was most 
              amazed was not about how effective we were - and they were very 
              effective - or our generosity of Singaporeans. <br><br>"What was most 
              significant to me was to see the way people, regardless of race, 
              language or religion, came together as one and reached out with so much 
              of compassion and humanity to make a difference.<br><br>"Watching our 
              soldiers in the evening play football with the children at the refugee 
              camp - many of them were orphans, homeless - little acts of kindness 
              like these show the kind of spirit...no matter who we are, Singaporeans 
              are a special breed. It is the little red dot, and yet we reached out to
               make a difference, a small nation with a big heart." <br><br>The 
              six-member Marine Parade GRC has been re-constituted as a five-man GRC 
              for the coming election and with the single-member ward MacPherson 
              absorbed into the area. <br><br>Incumbent MP for MacPherson Matthias Yao is retiring. <br><br>The
               five-member Marine Parade GRC is likely to comprise anchor minister Mr 
              Goh, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Ms Tin Pei Ling and Brig-Gen 
              (NS) Tan.<br><br>Ms Tin is a new PAP candidate. She is currently understudying Mr Yao.<br><br>Dr Fatimah and Mr Seah are incumbent MPs in the constituency.<br><br>Besides Dr Ong, the other two current MPs in Marine Parade are Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Lim Biow Chuan.<br><br>Mr
               Faishal Ibrahim will move to Nee Soon GRC while Mr Lim will most likely
               be fielded in Mountbatten, which will be carved out of Marine Parade 
              GRC to become a single-member constituency following the re-drawing of 
              electoral boundaries.<br><br>A participant at the Ubi dialogue had asked
               about the rationale for retiring some MPs after two terms in 
              Parliament. Dr Ong is a two-term PAP MP.<br><br>Mr Goh said: "But if you
               do not retire because all MPs are generally good, then nobody will be 
              retiring. So the poor party has got a poor time, painful time trying to 
              decide who would have to make way for renewal.<br><br>"But you notice 
              that the Ministers serve longer than three terms. So if ministers serve 
              three terms, four terms, like myself, five, six terms, on a basis of 
              average, you must touch some of the MPs serving only two terms. 
              Otherwise how do you get the one quarter to be self-renewed." <br><br>Mr
               Goh added: "From the people's point of view, I can understand your 
              frustration. The people have got to know an MP....(who becomes) very 
              effective on the ground and then we have to say, 'please make way for 
              somebody new'. <br><br>"They've got to get to know the new person (MP) again; they don't mind but they may ask, 'how long will he be here?' <br><br>"(After)
               two terms, he goes away. This is a very painful process, because ties 
              are very emotional. They are bonded through face-to-face (interactions),
               (then the MP) goes off, and you start bonding again. <br><br>"But at 
              the end of the day, the (PAP) party is behind you. We make sure that 
              whatever happens, people come and go, but you do have good people to 
              serve you. That must be so. <br><br>"So if we can assure that the 
              successor to Ong Seh Hong at the minimum must be as good as him in terms
               of rapport with the people......otherwise, we have made a mistake. <br><br>"......Policy-wise,
               thinking-wise, (the new MP) could be better than Ong Seh Hong but in 
              terms of rapport with the people he must be as good. Every time there is
               a new man.....you set new standards."    <br><br>Senior Minister Goh explained that there is a need to create space in the Cabinet for new people coming in.<br><br>He
               said: "So a time will come when Ministers will not be serving more than
               two terms, generally speaking, on average, so that you can get new 
              blood coming into Cabinet. Otherwise, the Ministers will be growing old.
               Well, they do make exceptions for former Prime Ministers....This is in 
              the interest of Singapore, because you want to have a team with older 
              people with the experience and newer people with new ideas, new 
              perspectives. <br><br>"This is actually a very painful process. PM has a
               tough time looking ahead. If he has five new men who can make it as a 
              Minister, then he has to decide where to post them." <br><br>Political 
              watchers believe the five new men are likely to be Brig-Gen (NS) Tan, 
              unionist Ong Ye Kung, Lawrence Wong, Major-General (NS) Chan Chun Sing 
              and Heng Swee Keat. <br><br>Brig-Gen (NS) Tan, Maj-Gen (NS) Chan, Mr 
              Wong and Mr Heng are among several high flyers from the Singapore Armed 
              Forces (SAF) and the public service who have stepped down in recent days
               to enter politics and have been seen in the wards they are likely to be
               fielded in.<br><br>Maj-Gen (NS) Chan, former Chief of Army, has been introduced in the Buona Vista division of the Tanjong Pagar GRC. <br><br>Mr
               Heng, former Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director, was 
              seen walking the ground in Tampines GRC while Mr Wong, former CEO of the
               Energy Market Authority, was seen in West Coast GRC.<br><br>Mr Goh also spoke about the reactions of netizens to the introduction of 27-year-old Ms Tin as a candidate for the PAP.<br><br>Mr
               Goh said: "She is ok. Actually, I had lunch with her, Fatimah and Foo 
              Mee Har. It was a casual lunch. I was also observing her, how she was 
              reacting under this stress, she was perfectly ok. <br><br>"But when you 
              do a blog, my mistake was I knew the context but I forgot that netizens 
              outside may not know the context. And I tried...to squeeze it in a very 
              concise form and tried and play around with words, but the context of my
               lunch with her and Fatimah was not there, and so the first quote caused
               some alarm, but she is perfectly ok."<br><br>He also said: "My own 
              advice is, this election should not over-emphasise on just one person. 
              She has to learn. As to all the other candidates, once you are a public 
              face, people have to examine you and your past may come and visit you. 
              She would overcome this. <br><br>"But I would move on from here to focus
               on bigger issues, who will form the core team, who are the candidates, 
              what is their position and in the party, so that as you go into the 
              elections, people have the knowledge on who are the candidates. Then 
              they can make a better decision.<br><br>"She has got some time to prove 
              herself. I am not too worried about that, unless there are problems of 
              integrity, then it is a different matter. Other than that, we would 
              field her."  <br><br>Mr Goh noted that many had spoken about the criteria for including a young person.<br><br>He said it is to signal to the youths in their late 20s and early 30s that there is a place for them in Parliament.<br><br>So when the PAP found a suitable young person like Ms Tin, it decided to field her.<br><br>But
               Mr Goh stressed that Singaporeans cannot expect a 27-year-old person to
               have the experience and maturity of a 40-year-old and certainly not the
               wisdom of a 70-year-old person.<br><br>He cautioned that if Singapore 
              does not give younger people a chance, the country would end up with 
              candidates in their mid-30s and above.<br><br>This, he said, would send a wrong signal to the young.<br><br>He
               said: "If you do not do this, the next time I get a young person to 
              stand for election, no young person is going to stand for election. A 
              young person on Facebook, they will pose their baby photographs, 
              teenager photographs in all kinds of poses and they would not want to be
               exposed. <br><br>"The signal therefore is to look at the larger 
              picture. Do we or do we not signal to the younger people that they have 
              got a place in politics and Parliament, to me the answer is yes. <br><br>"We
               want to signal to the young people, we want to reach out to the young 
              people. So do not just look at the young person, no experience, and try 
              and squash the young person, that is negative."<br><br>Mr Goh said he 
              believes the young can play a very important part and if this is done 
              carefully, he is confident more of them would be interested in politics.
               <br><br>The Senior Minister also took the opportunity to give a glimpse of the Marine Parade GRC's manifesto for the coming election.<br><br>He said it will focus on 4Gs - a great home, graciousness, generosity and a green community.<br><br>And Mr Goh said his team for the election is almost ready.<br><br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>GE: SM Goh hints ministers may not serve for more than
              two terms</strong><br> <span>By S Ramesh |</span> <span>Posted: 03 April
              2011 1217 hrs</span></p>
              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE : Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong has said
              the People's Action Party (PAP) has not been successful in getting
              people from the private sector, despite trying very hard.<br> <br> Still speaking on leadership renewal, he said that in time to come,
              Cabinet Ministers - with the exception of former prime ministers -
              may just serve two terms to make way for new blood.<br> <br> That is because the government may want to bring in new people, who
              would have to be given ministerial responsibilities.<br> <br> Mr Goh, who is also an MP for Marine Parade GRC, made this point at
              a dialogue in the Ubi division of the GRC on Sunday.<br> <br> He also thanked retiring MP for the GRC, Dr Ong Seh Hong, and
              introduced the new addition to his team, Brigadier-General (NS) Tan
              Chuan Jin.<br> <br> It is understood that Brig-Gen (NS) Tan will understudy Dr
              Ong.<br> <br> Mr Goh said: "BG Tan will be (in my view) a member of the people
              whom PM (Lee Hsien Loong) will be testing out. If he makes it, he
              will be a member of the core team. Hopefully he succeeds in being
              one".<br> <br> He added: "Unfortunately, we are not able to get people from the
              private sector. We have been trying very hard and that is something
              we would admit."<br> <br> "But you find that people in the private sector in their forties,
              they do not want to come in because you are number two, you can
              become number one. And there is much more freedom, there is no
              slamming or flaming by the Facebook or the netizens, life is
              comfortable for them, very few want to come in."<br> <br> Meanwhile, Brig-Gen (NS) Tan said: "What I hope to do for a start
              is to listen and to learn from all of them, including the
              grassroots leaders about what are the needs, challenges here and
              what is exciting going forward, so that we can bring the community
              together, look after the people to best of our ability and build a
              future we can all be proud of."<br> <br> He also shared his experience with the dialogue participants about
              Singapore's assistance to Aceh after the tsunami six years ago. He
              said: "What I was most amazed was not about how effective we were -
              and they were very effective - or our generosity of
              Singaporeans.<br> <br> "What was most significant to me was to see the way people,
              regardless of race, language or religion, came together as one and
              reached out with so much of compassion and humanity to make a
              difference.<br> <br> "Watching our soldiers in the evening play football with the
              children at the refugee camp - many of them were orphans, homeless
              - little acts of kindness like these show the kind of spirit...no
              matter who we are, Singaporeans are a special breed. It is the
              little red dot, and yet we reached out to make a difference, a
              small nation with a big heart."<br> <br> The six-member Marine Parade GRC has been re-constituted as a
              five-man GRC for the coming election and with the single-member
              ward MacPherson absorbed into the area.<br> <br> Incumbent MP for MacPherson Matthias Yao is retiring.<br> <br> The five-member Marine Parade GRC is likely to comprise anchor
              minister Mr Goh, Dr Fatimah Lateef, Mr Seah Kian Peng, Ms Tin Pei
              Ling and Brig-Gen (NS) Tan.<br> <br> Ms Tin is a new PAP candidate. She is currently understudying Mr
              Yao.<br> <br> Dr Fatimah and Mr Seah are incumbent MPs in the constituency.<br> <br> Besides Dr Ong, the other two current MPs in Marine Parade are
              Muhammad Faishal Ibrahim and Lim Biow Chuan.<br> <br> Mr Faishal Ibrahim will move to Nee Soon GRC while Mr Lim will most
              likely be fielded in Mountbatten, which will be carved out of
              Marine Parade GRC to become a single-member constituency following
              the re-drawing of electoral boundaries.<br> <br> A participant at the Ubi dialogue had asked about the rationale for
              retiring some MPs after two terms in Parliament. Dr Ong is a
              two-term PAP MP.<br> <br> Mr Goh said: "But if you do not retire because all MPs are
              generally good, then nobody will be retiring. So the poor party has
              got a poor time, painful time trying to decide who would have to
              make way for renewal.<br> <br> "But you notice that the Ministers serve longer than three terms.
              So if ministers serve three terms, four terms, like myself, five,
              six terms, on a basis of average, you must touch some of the MPs
              serving only two terms. Otherwise how do you get the one quarter to
              be self-renewed."<br> <br> Mr Goh added: "From the people's point of view, I can understand
              your frustration. The people have got to know an MP....(who
              becomes) very effective on the ground and then we have to say,
              'please make way for somebody new'.<br> <br> "They've got to get to know the new person (MP) again; they don't
              mind but they may ask, 'how long will he be here?'<br> <br> "(After) two terms, he goes away. This is a very painful process,
              because ties are very emotional. They are bonded through
              face-to-face (interactions), (then the MP) goes off, and you start
              bonding again.<br> <br> "But at the end of the day, the (PAP) party is behind you. We make
              sure that whatever happens, people come and go, but you do have
              good people to serve you. That must be so.<br> <br> "So if we can assure that the successor to Ong Seh Hong at the
              minimum must be as good as him in terms of rapport with the
              people......otherwise, we have made a mistake.<br> <br> "......Policy-wise, thinking-wise, (the new MP) could be better
              than Ong Seh Hong but in terms of rapport with the people he must
              be as good. Every time there is a new man.....you set new
              standards."<br> <br> Senior Minister Goh explained that there is a need to create space
              in the Cabinet for new people coming in.<br> <br> He said: "So a time will come when Ministers will not be serving
              more than two terms, generally speaking, on average, so that you
              can get new blood coming into Cabinet. Otherwise, the Ministers
              will be growing old. Well, they do make exceptions for former Prime
              Ministers....This is in the interest of Singapore, because you want
              to have a team with older people with the experience and newer
              people with new ideas, new perspectives.<br> <br> "This is actually a very painful process. PM has a tough time
              looking ahead. If he has five new men who can make it as a
              Minister, then he has to decide where to post them."<br> <br> Political watchers believe the five new men are likely to be
              Brig-Gen (NS) Tan, unionist Ong Ye Kung, Lawrence Wong,
              Major-General (NS) Chan Chun Sing and Heng Swee Keat.<br> <br> Brig-Gen (NS) Tan, Maj-Gen (NS) Chan, Mr Wong and Mr Heng are among
              several high flyers from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and the
              public service who have stepped down in recent days to enter
              politics and have been seen in the wards they are likely to be
              fielded in.<br> <br> Maj-Gen (NS) Chan, former Chief of Army, has been introduced in the
              Buona Vista division of the Tanjong Pagar GRC.<br> <br> Mr Heng, former Monetary Authority of Singapore managing director,
              was seen walking the ground in Tampines GRC while Mr Wong, former
              CEO of the Energy Market Authority, was seen in West Coast
              GRC.<br> <br> Mr Goh also spoke about the reactions of netizens to the
              introduction of 27-year-old Ms Tin as a candidate for the
              PAP.<br> <br> Mr Goh said: "She is ok. Actually, I had lunch with her, Fatimah
              and Foo Mee Har. It was a casual lunch. I was also observing her,
              how she was reacting under this stress, she was perfectly ok.<br> <br> "But when you do a blog, my mistake was I knew the context but I
              forgot that netizens outside may not know the context. And I
              tried...to squeeze it in a very concise form and tried and play
              around with words, but the context of my lunch with her and Fatimah
              was not there, and so the first quote caused some alarm, but she is
              perfectly ok."<br> <br> He also said: "My own advice is, this election should not
              over-emphasise on just one person. She has to learn. As to all the
              other candidates, once you are a public face, people have to
              examine you and your past may come and visit you. She would
              overcome this.<br> <br> "But I would move on from here to focus on bigger issues, who will
              form the core team, who are the candidates, what is their position
              and in the party, so that as you go into the elections, people have
              the knowledge on who are the candidates. Then they can make a
              better decision.<br> <br> "She has got some time to prove herself. I am not too worried about
              that, unless there are problems of integrity, then it is a
              different matter. Other than that, we would field her."<br> <br> Mr Goh noted that many had spoken about the criteria for including
              a young person.<br> <br> He said it is to signal to the youths in their late 20s and early
              30s that there is a place for them in Parliament.<br> <br> So when the PAP found a suitable young person like Ms Tin, it
              decided to field her.<br> <br> But Mr Goh stressed that Singaporeans cannot expect a 27-year-old
              person to have the experience and maturity of a 40-year-old and
              certainly not the wisdom of a 70-year-old person.<br> <br> He cautioned that if Singapore does not give younger people a
              chance, the country would end up with candidates in their mid-30s
              and above.<br> <br> This, he said, would send a wrong signal to the young.<br> <br> He said: "If you do not do this, the next time I get a young person
              to stand for election, no young person is going to stand for
              election. A young person on Facebook, they will pose their baby
              photographs, teenager photographs in all kinds of poses and they
              would not want to be exposed.<br> <br> "The signal therefore is to look at the larger picture. Do we or do
              we not signal to the younger people that they have got a place in
              politics and Parliament, to me the answer is yes.<br> <br> "We want to signal to the young people, we want to reach out to the
              young people. So do not just look at the young person, no
              experience, and try and squash the young person, that is
              negative."<br> <br> Mr Goh said he believes the young can play a very important part
              and if this is done carefully, he is confident more of them would
              be interested in politics.<br> <br> The Senior Minister also took the opportunity to give a glimpse of
              the Marine Parade GRC's manifesto for the coming election.<br> <br> He said it will focus on 4Gs - a great home, graciousness,
              generosity and a green community.<br> <br> And Mr Goh said his team for the election is almost ready.<br> <br> <br> - CNA</span></span></p>

              <div>THE People's Action Party (PAP) on Monday unveiled
              what could be its second last batch of new candidates for the
              upcoming general election.
              <p>The latest three are: Mr Heng Swee Keat, 50, former managing
              director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore; Mr Ong Teng Koon,
              34, a commodities trader and Mr Alex Yam Ziming, 29, an NTUC
              activist.</p>
              <p>They bring the total of new PAP faces unveiled so far to 21.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the trio's introduction at the PAP's headquarters in
              Bedok, party chairman Lim Boon Heng said all three men had been
              'known to party leaders for some time'.</p>
              <p>He singled out Mr Heng as someone to watch in the election,
              despite his limited grassroots experience.</p>
              <p>'We believe he will learn quickly, and therefore be an important
              member of the 4th generation leadership,' Mr Lim said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim added that the PAP would release its party manifesto
              soon.</p>
