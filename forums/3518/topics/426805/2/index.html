              <p><strong>Apr 17, 2011 - Sunday Times</strong></p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee on the 24 new PAP candidates</strong></p>
              <p>IN HIS speech at the 25th anniversary celebrations of Young PAP on 
              Sunday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong gave his take on the 24 new 
              People's Action Party candidates.</p>
              <p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
              <p>Desmond Choo: 'He started out as a police scholar. He's no stranger to tough battles.'</p>
              <p>Ong Ye Kung: 'He's now the executive secretary of the NTWU (National 
              Transport Workers' Union) and also chairman of NTUC's e2i, and he will 
              work hard for workers.'</p>
              <p>Janil Puthucheary: 'Janil grew up in Malaysia but married a 
              Singaporean and made Singapore his home. He's a paediatric intensivist, 
              which means he takes care of the sickest babies and children in KK 
              Hospital.'</p>
              <p>Foo Mee Har: 'She's worked in China and Thailand other than in Singapore so, truly an international experience.'</p>
              <p>Desmond Lee Ti-Seng: 'He was doing very well in the legal service, we
               spotted him, we asked him, he agreed to stand as a candidate because he
               wanted to improve the system that he had benefitted from.'</p>
              <p>Steve Tan: '(His) father used to work for the PUB so he lived in a 
              one-room flat in PUB quarters at Woodleigh, which is in the Potong Pasir
               area. Later on his parents bought an HDB flat, also in Potong Pasir and
               they still live there. He still lives in Potong Pasir too.'</p>
              <p>Zainal Sapari: 'He knows about hard work because his father used to 
              hold three jobs. He was a cleaner, a security officer and also a 
              gardener, all at the same time, and he did this to feed the family.'</p>
              <p>Gan Thiam Poh: 'The father was an odd-job labourer. As a young boy, 
              he was going house to house selling home-made popiah. Now he wants to 
              give back to society.'</p>
              <p>Tin Pei Ling: 'She may be young but I think she has steel in her and 
              she knows how to connect with people and that makes all the difference 
              on the ground.'</p>
              <p>Vikram Nair: 'He speaks Tamil and Malayalam which is quite useful for connecting with older residents.'</p>
              <p>Ang Hin Kee: 'Hin Kee introduced himself as a repeat student because 
              he took the O levels twice but eventually he made it, he went to NUS. So
               he knows what failure and disappointment means but also how to pick 
              himself up and succeed the second time.'</p>
              <p>Ang Wei Neng: 'Wei Neng knows a lot about transportation because he 
              works in SBS Transit and manages 1,600 public buses but that's not so 
              hard. What is tougher is managing 3,000 staff, including 2,800 bus 
              drivers.'</p>
              <p>Edwin Tong: 'Very quiet and modest person but I am confident that as 
              an MP he will care for his residents and look after their interests.'</p>
              <p>Low Yen Ling: 'At first she started working in a bank, then she left 
              to join a start-up, the start-up didn't do well. Subsequently she worked
               for EDB.'</p>
              <p>Tan Chuan-Jin: 'He served as army attache in Jakarta for one year, 
              learnt Bahasa Indonesia, got in touch with the Indonesian senior 
              officers and later he commanded the SAF tsunami mission in Meulaboh in 
              Aceh, where this experience proved invaluable. When I visited Meulaboh 
              during the tsunami, he showed me around and he was on top of the 
              situation.'</p>
              <p>Patrick Tay: 'Patrick believes in volunteering. He's been involved in
               grassroots work for 25 years although he's only 40 years old and he 
              comes highly recommended by Prof Jayakumar.'</p>
              <p>Intan Azura Mokhtar: 'We interviewed Intan before and after her 
              latest baby. She was a lecturer at Abu Dhabi University so she's quite 
              adaptable and I'm very happy to have her in the Jalan Kayu branch in Ang
               Mo Kio GRC.'</p>
              <p>Lawrence Wong: 'Served in various ministries. In Finance, he 
              implemented schemes to help Singaporeans cope with restructuring. In the
               Ministry of Health, he helped Khaw Boon Wan to improve the Medishield 
              system with the Medishield reforms. Most recently he was CEO of the 
              Energy Markets Authority.'</p>
              <p>David Ong Kim Huat: 'He grew up in a two-room flat in Queenstown but 
              made himself a successful businessman, running his own publishing firm.'</p>
              <p>Alex Yam: 'Grew up in a well-to-do family but has believed in community service from young.'</p>
              <p>Heng Swee Keat: 'Grew up in a kampong but made it to Cambridge.'</p>
              <p>Ong Teng Koon: 'He introduced himself as a heartlander because he 
              grew up in Ang Mo Kio and still lives there with his extended family 
              nearby, so he's one of my reliable voters.'</p>
              <p>Sim Ann: 'Both parents Chinese educated and herself, as you have 
              heard, completely bilingual and represents a new generation of bilingual
               Singaporeans, like Gan Thiam Poh and Tin Pei Ling.'</p>
              <p>Chan Chun Sing: 'Another RI boy with humble beginnings. He preferred 
              to join the scouts for his CCA but he hesitated because the scouts had 
              to pay for their uniforms whereas NPCC uniforms were free. But finally 
              he did become a scout and he picked up navigating skills which proved 
              useful when he went to NS.'</p>

              <p>Scenario1:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i once saw people on a sinking ship fulla holes in the middles of a huge ocean...fulla holes.no one wanted to repair it even though it was sinking....then some people founded some material to repair the holes on sinking ship.then some found a dinghyand floated it in the middle of the huge ocean.</p>
              <p>so some started patching up the ship with material and found it was difficult because they didnt have the right engneer or people with knowledge to fix it.then some decided to climb into the dinghy b4 the ship sinks.</p>
              <p>so the situation ended where one group of people climbed into a small dinghy in the middle of the ocean.the other stayed back on sinking ship scratching heads trying to know how to fix the holes on sinking ship with water gushing out of the many holes.</p>
              <p>results:people in dinghy were found 1 month later dried up like ikan bilis.</p>
              <p>sinking ship sank a bit at a time until there was no way get materials to fix the holes underwater.everyone died on it...</p>
