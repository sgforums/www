              <p>If the officer shouted out your name and IC number, it might constitute a voting irregularity.</p>
              <p>Last election, a letter to ST Forum said this guy's polling officer <strong>wrote his IC number on his ballot slip in pencil!</strong> He asked her why and she did not give him an answer. He was not able to complain and get a clean ballot slip on the spot.</p>
              <p>The official reply to his letter was, this is an irregularity that should not be repeated. The polling officer was acting on her own. If this is true, there are alot of stupid and fanatical people out there. Maybe your officer was the same person.</p>

              <p>secret or no secret.sporeans already lost so much...what could be worse?</p>
              <p>if 4 million people voted againstb the PAP they have no way to punish all of the 4 million voters who voted against them.</p>
              <p>just make sure the opposition is up to the job..and when opposition is up to the job.....then PAP is finished and everyone will lead a normal life and have families kids etc etc.a quality life for evetyone.</p>

              <p>i suggest to place half of pap seats in dock n to be reserved to the oppositions with qualified and respectable positions.dun get consultants with no million dollar income!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the main idea to place half of PAP to be in parliament should be realised that they must be there in case transactions from past PAP overseas policies go wrong on finANCIAL LEVEL.</p>
              <p>the opposition will have 50% and pap have 50% seats.even if the opposition won all seats there is still no chance of progresss for spore as a whole like the soviet union.</p>
              <p>that way it will make a better future for singapreans in spore.</p>

              <p>Actually it's economies of scale lah, they really don't have the effort, time, and resources to go about fixing everybody that didn't vote for them. All this talk about intimidation is just coming from an atmosphere of paranoia that we as mature and responsible citizens should really aim to dispel.<br><br>Look at it this way as well, does "fixing" anybody who does not vote for PAP really benefitial to the ruling party in the long run? Instead of intimidating people, it will end up making them even more opposed to a party that screws them over simply for not agreeing with them. In the long run they are just eroding their own support base.</p>
              <p>This is not to mention that if our vote is not secret and can be used against us, then the entire elections commision is corrupt... wouldn't it be less trouble to just rig the entire elections instead of bothering to find out each and every single person that didn't vote PAP and then screw them over individually. Nobody is that boliao.</p>
              <p>So yes, lets all be less paranoid and vote responsibily, because your vote is secret. </p>
              <p>Now fixing entire SMCs who didn't vote for them... that's another thing...</p>

               Singaporeans harbour the misconception that their vote during elections
               is not secret. I’ve talked to many people, both educated and less 
              educated, and the overwhelming majority seem to think this way. This is 
              despite the fact that at every election, the Elections Department takes 
              pains to communicate to voters two main points: Voting is compulsory, 
              and voting is secret. I guess this is a point that Singaporeans just 
              refuse to believe our government about. <br><br>It is even more 
              unfortunate that some persist in perpetuating this urban myth, which 
              only serves to strike more fear into the hearts of Singaporeans who are 
              thinking of voting for the opposition. A letter in Temasek Review today 
              exhorted Singaporeans to spoil their votes because, the writer reasoned,
               then the PAP won’t “mark” you for voting against them and if there are 
              enough invalid votes, it will indirectly increase the opposition’s share
               of the valid vote. <br><br>This is wrong on many counts. I’ll highlight
               just two: Firstly, the PAP does not know which party you voted for, so 
              they won’t know who to “mark”, even if they wanted to. Secondly, invalid
               votes do not factor in the final count, which is based on valid votes. 
              This means that if there were 10 votes–six for the PAP, three for the 
              opposition and one spoiled–the final tally is 66.6 per cent to the PAP 
              (six divided by nine, with the spoiled vote excluded), not 60 per cent. <br><br>Let’s be very clear: YOUR VOTE IS SECRET. I will take you through the whole balloting process to see why: <br><br>1.
               On Polling Day, each voter at the polling station is issued a ballot 
              paper without his name on it. (I’ll talk about the serial numbers 
              later.) He/she marks the ballot paper in a booth out of sight of anyone 
              else. No cameras are permitted in the polling station so there is no way
               to observe how voters vote. The voter then folds up the paper and drops
               it in the ballot box. Throughout the day, counting agents from each 
              party are at the polling station to ensure the ballot boxes are not 
              opened. <br><br>2. At the close of polling, usually at 8pm on the same 
              day, the ballot boxes are sealed with tamper-proof seals (which are 
              signed over by the candidates) and transported to the Counting Centre. <br><br>3.
               At the Counting Centre, the ballot boxes from the polling stations are 
              unsealed in the presence of the candidates and their assistants and 
              emptied in a common heap. The election officials (who are civil 
              servants) then count the votes in full view of the candidates from all 
              contesting parties, who ensure that the votes are counted properly and 
              the election officials follow all the rules. <br><br>4. Immediately 
              after counting, the votes, together with all the relevant records, the 
              stubs of the ballot papers and any unused ballot papers are sealed in 
              the boxes (again with tamper-proof seals) and transported to the Supreme
               Court vault for storage. <br>5. Six months later, if there are no 
              disputes over the outcome of the election, the sealed boxes are 
              transported to the incineration plant, where, in the presence of all the
               candidates (including the losers), the votes and records are completely
               destroyed by fire. <br><br>As you can see from above, at no point are 
              the boxes opened without the candidates or representatives from all the 
              contesting parties being present. <br><br>Frequently asked questions <br><br>Q<strong><span style="color: red;">. What about the serial numbers on the ballot papers? <br><br>This
               is a safeguard against election fraud such as bringing counterfeit 
              ballot papers into the polling station, voter impersonation or casting 
              ballot papers which have been marked by others. Many other countries, 
              including the UK, have numbered ballot papers. As explained above, there
               is no opportunity for the election officials or candidates to peek at 
              the votes and match them against the electoral roll. Remember there are 
              no names on the voting slips, and if one wanted to match the serial 
              numbers, one would have to sift through a huge list of thousands of 
              voters in full view of the candidates. <br><br>It is possible, though, 
              that in the event of a disputed outcome, the courts could order that the
               boxes be taken out of storage and the votes recounted. However this 
              would again be done in full view of the candidates. In any case, there 
              has been no court order issued to retrieve votes since Singapore first 
              conducted elections in 1948. <br></span></strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: purple;">Q. Why does the election official call out my name and voter number at the polling station before giving me the ballot paper? <br><br>So
               as to enable the representatives of contesting political parties at the
               polling station to verify and cross out your name on their copies of 
              the electoral register. They will know you voted, but won’t know who you
               voted for.</span></strong> <br><br><br><strong><span style="color: darkgoldenrod;">Q.
               After elections, some politicians say certain blocks supported the 
              ruling party or opposition. Does it mean they know my vote? <br><br>Nobody
               knows how each individual voted. Each polling station serves about 10 
              to 20 blocks of flats or a few landed housing estates. They may know the
               aggregated number from each polling district, but not the individual 
              votes.</span></strong></span></p>
