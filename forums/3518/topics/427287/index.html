              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The Reform Party has announced new leadership for its Youth Wing, The Young Reformers.<br><br>They are undergraduate students 25-year-old Gerald Yong and 24-year-old Lim Zi Rui, who will serve as co-chairs.<br><br>They
               take over the seat vacated by Justin Ong, 25, who was part of the group
               that quit the Reform Party earlier this year and joined the National 
              Solidarity Party.<br><br>29-year-old Vigneswari Ramachandran will serve as deputy head.<br><br>Secretary-General
               Kenneth Jeyaretnam said in a statement that the Reform Party has a 
              strong youth appeal, noting that "a large percentage" of members are 
              under 35.<br><br>On the new leaders, he said: "Between them, they bring 
              an impressive background in student organisation, sports, community 
              work, the arts and life experience. They are well known within the 
              Party, where they have been the backbone of our outreach work and at the
               forefront of events and activities for some time now."<br><br>Mr Yong 
              is a final year undergraduate with The London School of Economics and 
              Political Science, studying for a Bachelor of Science in Banking &amp; 
              Finance.<br><br>He is also a full-time Financial Planning Executive, and is married with one child.<br><br>Mr
               Lim is a final year undergraduate at Nanyang Technological University, 
              and said the Youth Wing "will bring support, energy and potential new 
              candidates to election campaigns". <br><br>Ms Vigneswari is a teacher at a private kindergarten, and is working on a diploma in early childhood and care.<br><br>When
               contacted, Mr Jeyaretnam declined to confirm whether any of the three 
              would be fielded in the coming General Election, though he said it "is 
              possible".<br><br>In the media release, it was stated that Mr Yong 
              "knows the West Coast ground very well due to his schooling and part of 
              his working career was spent in the Clementi/West Coast area".<br><br>West Coast GRC is one of the constituencies that the Reform Party is eyeing.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
