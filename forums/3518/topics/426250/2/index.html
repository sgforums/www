              <h1 class="storyheadline">PAP set to unveil more candidates</h1>
              <p>by Mavis Toh</p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party (PAP) is likely to continue introducing two 
              batches of three new candidates a week, as it did last week.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah Bow Tan said that is 'about the right pace', when 
              asked yesterday if the momentum from last week's first introductions is 
              an indication of what is to come.</p>
              <p>At a separate event, PAP chairman Lim Boon Heng said the 
              pace at which candidates are introduced would depend on 'tactical 
              decisions'.</p>
              <p>As election fever heats up and MPs fan out across the island
               in various constituency events, PAP leaders yesterday weighed in on the
               party's preparations and progress for the upcoming battle.</p>
              <p>Mr Mah, an MP for Tampines GRC and Minister for National 
              Development, said: 'The introduction that has been going on is to give 
              our people a chance to know them better. So two a week so far, the 
              coverage has been good, the opportunities for our candidates to profile 
              themselves have been good. It's a very comfortable pace for everyone.'</p>
              <p>The need to strategise vis-a-vis other parties is another 
              factor, added Mr Lim, an MP for Jurong GRC. He said that while the PAP 
              and one other party have introduced some candidates, others have 'kept 
              very quiet'. The Singapore Democratic Alliance last week unveiled four 
              of its candidates.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">PAP unveils 3 more new faces</h1>
              <p>by Yen Feng</p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party on Monday unveiled its third batch of new faces to be fielded in the coming elections.</p>
              <p>They include the first Malay-Muslim candidate and the 
              youngest PAP candidate among the total of nine introduced so far. The 
              trio introduced on Monday afternoon are Mr Zainal Sapari, 46, an 
              educator; Ms Tin Pei Ling, 27, a business consultant; and Mr Gan Thiam 
              Poh, 48, a banker with DBS.</p>
              <p>PAP chairman Lim Boon Heng, who introduced the candidates at
               the PAP headquarters, said the most important quality the party looked 
              for in new candidates was their commitment to serve the public.</p>
              <p>He added that in the search for new candidates, the party 
              had adopted a 'broad-based' approach to encourage 'robustness of debate'
               within the party.</p>
              <p>Ms Tin, a senior associate with Ernst &amp; Young, and Mr 
              Gan, a senior vice-president with DBS' Institutional Banking Group, were
               selected in part for their many years of service to the public, Mr Lim 
              said. Their names were among the list of potential members which the 
              party considered from its various branches. Both began their grassroots 
              work as members of the party's Youth Wing.</p>
              <p>Mr Sapari, currently an NTUC Director (Special Duty, 
              Industrial Relations), was chosen for his record as an educator in 
              primary education for nearly 20 years. He was a superintendent and 
              currently also serves on the Joint Madrasah Education Panel.</p>
              <p>All three candidates are married and - except Ms Tin - have 
              young children. Both Mr Gan and Mr Sapari said they grew up in 
              low-income families and pointed to helping the needy as a major 
              component of their political agenda. Ms Tin said she would focus on 
              youth and elderly issues.</p>
              <p>At the news conference, Mr Lim also thanked outgoing party 
              members and said they would be thanked individually and collectively at 
              the right time.</p>
              <p><strong>Third batch of PAP candidates:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Youngest candidate, banker and an educator</strong></p>

              fielded by PAP in 1976, was former Speaker Tan Soon Khoon, also at age 
              27 years.</p>
              <p>* Married to covil servant Ng How Yue, she has been deeply

              <h1>PAP unveils 3 more new faces</h1>
              <p>by Yen Feng</p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party on Monday unveiled its third batch of
              new faces to be fielded in the coming elections.</p>
              <p>They include the first Malay-Muslim candidate and the youngest
              PAP candidate among the total of nine introduced so far. The trio
              introduced on Monday afternoon are Mr Zainal Sapari, 46, an
              educator; Ms Tin Pei Ling, 27, a business consultant; and Mr Gan
              Thiam Poh, 48, a banker with DBS.</p>
              <p>PAP chairman Lim Boon Heng, who introduced the candidates at the
              PAP headquarters, said the most important quality the party looked
              for in new candidates was their commitment to serve the public.</p>
              <p>He added that in the search for new candidates, the party had
              adopted a 'broad-based' approach to encourage 'robustness of
              debate' within the party.</p>
              <p>Ms Tin, a senior associate with Ernst &amp; Young, and Mr Gan, a
              senior vice-president with DBS' Institutional Banking Group, were
              selected in part for their many years of service to the public, Mr
              Lim said. Their names were among the list of potential members
              which the party considered from its various branches. Both began
              their grassroots work as members of the party's Youth Wing.</p>
              <p>Mr Sapari, currently an NTUC Director (Special Duty, Industrial
              Relations), was chosen for his record as an educator in primary
              education for nearly 20 years. He was a superintendent and
              currently also serves on the Joint Madrasah Education Panel.</p>
              <p>All three candidates are married and - except Ms Tin - have
              young children. Both Mr Gan and Mr Sapari said they grew up in
              low-income families and pointed to helping the needy as a major
              component of their political agenda. Ms Tin said she would focus on
              youth and elderly issues.</p>
              <p>At the news conference, Mr Lim also thanked outgoing party
              members and said they would be thanked individually and
              collectively at the right time.</p>
              <p><strong>Third batch of PAP candidates:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Youngest candidate, banker and an educator</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Ms Tin Pei Ling, 27</strong></p>
              <p>* A senior associate associate with Ernst &amp; Young Advisory,
              she will be one of the youngest People's Action Party (PAP)
              candidates to contest in the coming polls. Before her, the youngest
              fielded by PAP in 1976, was former Speaker Tan Soon Khoon, also at
              age 27 years.</p>
              <p>* Married to covil servant Ng How Yue, she has been deeply
              involved in grassroots and community work for seven years since she
              was 21.</p>
