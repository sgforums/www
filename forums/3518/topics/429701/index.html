              On the final day of the <span id="lw_1304607701_1" class="yshortcuts">hustings</span>, she just couldn't hold it in anymore.
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="lw_1304607701_5" class="yshortcuts">National Solidarity Party candidate</span> Nicole Seah broke down during a rally at the Chinese Gardens on Thursday night, after recalling a meeting she had with a poor family in MacPherson earlier in the day.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old, who is contesting the Marine Parade GRC, said the resident told her how she could not get help to fund her son's $80 tuition fees. Worse, when she sought help from a <span id="lw_1304607701_9" class="yshortcuts">Member of Parliament</span>, she was chided for the small amount.</p>
              <p>Pausing to compose herself, Seah told the estimated 10,000-strong crowd, "This is the kind of problem we have. We need a government who has a heart for Singaporeans."</p>
              <p>It was the second time in a day that the advertising executive broke down. While speaking to the same resident earlier, she had also cried after listening to the mother's desperate situation.</p>
              <p>An emotionally-charged Seah then told the audience at the rally that it was time for change.</p>
              <p>She said, "They (the <span id="lw_1304607701_0" class="yshortcuts">PAP</span>) do not have the mandate of the of heaven but with the consent of the people... We must move towards the next phase of nation building to build a future that comes in more colours than white."</p>
              <p>After the rally, which was the final chance for NSP candidates to address voters, members in the crowd told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that Seah had left a deep impression on them.</p>
              <p>Ting Lee Yiaw, 48, banker, a Jurong GRC resident, said, "What she said resonated with me. She's very down-to-earth and very real. I can see that she is truly compassionate and really stands for the NSP."</p>
              <p>Nelson Tong, 36, civil servant, also a Jurong resident,  said, "It is very encouraging to see someone like her. I can really see that she is feeling it like a true Singaporean. We feel it together with her and that's what being Singaporean is all about."</p>
              <p>Brandon Chen, 26, another student, said "We need an MP like her to give the alternative voice. It doesn't matter as long as people feel that she is real."</p>
              <p>A total of 12 other NSP candidates spoke during the rally.</p>
              <p>They will be contesting the Marine Parade, Jurong, Chua Chu Kang and Tampines GRCs as well as the Radin Mas, Pioneer and Mountbatten SMCs.</p>

              <p>It's true. Some of the poor are really very poor. Anyone knows of the hunchback auntie selling tissues late into the night at coffeeshops in hougang?</p>
              <p>She has so much white hair and the hunch must be terrible for her. I bought 2 packs of her tissues for $10 once. I felt so sad for her and there is only so much I could do. Thinking of how the $10 can give her maybe 2 days of meals......that assuaged some of my sadness.</p>

              <p>I wonder what have the Opposition done to help these poor old aged 1-room flat stayer.</p>
              <p>Have they offered volunteering services like providing mass meals once a month or perhaps delivering of bread to these homes? Or perhaps they appear only when elections are near (not even during festive seasons) to get close to the heartlanders?</p>
              <p>I have been volunteering and revamping the Henderson 1-room flats for 4 yrs and during the Boys Bridgade yearly donation drive, my family raised a total of SGD5K and purchased adult diapers as per their calling via the Internet instead of regular milos and maggie noodles. My family is not well-to-do, but we understand the hard lives of these less unfortunate. Doing a little charity and you guys have to SHOUT about it?  </p>
              <p>So much so for Opposition having a compassionate heart and they represent the voices of Singaporeans. I have seen Government attending festive functions for such charity drives but I have never seen Opposition doing it. They have no funds for it? That's right but they are lawyers and lived in Bukit Timah? </p>
              <p>If I am not mistaken, our Opposition parties this time round is very much competitive. They comprise of lawyers, doctors and all of which with decent family backgrounds, surely organising / self fund a small charity drive to truly demonstrate their love and concerns for the less fortunate is not too much?</p>
              <p>Where are they?</p>
              <p>Secondly, many disagreed and said that the government mould our future generation competitive, may I have a show of hands how many of our forum writers are graduates? Why bother taking a degree? Why ask for higher pay? Why drive a car? Why complain about double yellow lines and being fined when there's proper parking space? Why make our children go tuition? Why put on so much pressure onto the next generation?</p>
              <p>It's NOT PAP. It's YOURSELF.</p>
              <p>A person does not have enough to spend cos' they are afraid of losing, not having the competitive edge against others. They buy a car so that they are on par with peers, they took up credit cards and be in debts because they want to go on holidays along with huge LV / Chanel bags upon their return.</p>
              <p>Did PAP encourage that?</p>
              <p>In Universities and Polys around Singapore, I have seen thousands of students riding and driving to school, who got them the cars? Point to yourselves - PARENTS!</p>
              <p>Providing them with the luxuries and comfort resulted in your children being competitive.</p>
              <p>Honestly, if you sg-citizens have enough of Singapore, drop your citizenship and move across the continents. Stop whining! It's such a disgrace..</p>
