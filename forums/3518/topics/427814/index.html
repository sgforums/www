              <p>THE opposition National Solidarity Party (NSP) on Thursday unveiled 
              seven candidates who will stand in the Tampines GRC and the two single 
              seats in Whampoa and Pioneer for the coming polls.</p>
              <p>The five GRC candidates are: NSP secretary-general and businessman 
              Goh Meng Seng, 41, company director Reno Fong, 42, project manager 
              Syafarin Sarif, 35, management consultant Raymond Lim, 27, and career 
              counsellor Gilbert Goh, 49. All except Mr Goh and Mr Fong are rookies.</p>
              <p>The other two are former Non-Constituency MP Steve Chia, 41, an 
              equity and index futures trader who will stand in Pioneer, and company 
              director Ken Sun, 64, who will contest Whampoa.</p>
              <p>Both are contesting their fourth election.</p>
              <p>The seven were unveiled at a press conference held at the NSP office on Thursday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Mr Goh said the Tampines GRC team will focus on the affordability and
               availability of HDB flats as part of the NSP's strategy of challenging 
              ministers in charge of hot-button issues on their home turf.</p>
              <p>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan, 63, is the anchor minister
               in Tampines GRC. Other likely members on the PAP team are Minister of 
              State for Education and Home Affairs Masagos Zulkifli, Ms Irene Ng, 47, 
              and two new PAP faces, former Monetary Authority of Singapore managing 
              director Heng Swee Keat, 49, and executive secretary of Young NTUC Steve
               Tan, 38.</p>
              <p>The NSP has already rolled out 11 candidates for the Moulmein-Kallang
               and Jurong GRCs, and also for the Radin Mas and Mountbatten single-seat
               wards.</p>
              <p>The party said it will field a total of 20 to 30 candidates for the coming polls.</p>
