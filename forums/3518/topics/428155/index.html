              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Former 
              Reform Party vice-chairman and member of its Central Executive Committee
               (CEC), Mr Alec Tok said he will definitely take part in the upcoming 
              general election.<br><br>He said he is still in talks with various parties but has not ruled out standing as an independent candidate either.<br><br>In
               an email reply to Channel NewsAsia, Mr Tok said his preference is to 
              stand in the single ward of Radin Mas, where he was previously active 
              under the Reform Party banner.<br><br>The 46-year-old said: "My 
              preference would be to stand in Radin Mas, as I have been talking to 
              residents there the most. I don't think I will go to Pioneer.<br><br>"I 
              understand the conventional wisdom about how three or four-corner fights
               fritter away opposition votes but...I don't have an answer to that. 
              Well, I guess one possible answer is to join a party and contest in Ang 
              Mo Kio, Sembawang or even Tanjong Pagar."<br><br>He added: "What I am 
              clear about is that I am not contesting merely to prove a point or to 
              gain attention. I have made certain recommendations to the residents of 
              Radin Mas and my desire to be of service to them remains. I want to get 
              to know them more and for them to get to know me more. Contesting there 
              is the best way for this to happen."<br><br>The New York-based theatre 
              director had previously said he had resigned from the Reform Party as he
               disagreed with certain clauses in the party's protocol for CEC members 
              which he had to sign after he was co-opted in March.<br><br>He also remarked on his decision to enter politics.<br><br>"No
               one makes a decision to join Singapore politics frivolously. Especially
               joining the opposition. You do it only if you believe you want to do 
              this over the long haul. I want to be of service to fellow Singaporeans.
               It is as simple as that. I want to contribute to them.<br><br>"Why not 
              in arts, right? Well, I believe the political task to be more urgent. I 
              believe there are many things out of balance in Singapore. (The) Income 
              divide cannot be swept away that easily. High property prices should not
               be dismissed in the name of reserve accumulation. We have an obligation
               towards the most vulnerable Singaporeans among us. They should not be 
              left to the charitable organisations or individuals."<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
