              <p>"Yesterday we were campaigning.. Today .. you have voted."</p>
              <p><br>While walking down the street one day a MP is tragically hit by a truck and dies.</p>
              <p>The MP's soul arrives in heaven and is met by St. Peter at the entrance.</p>
              <p>"Welcome to heaven," says St. Peter. "Before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. <br>We seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so<br>we're not sure what to do with you."</p>
              <p>"No problem, just let me in," says the MP.</p>
              <p>St. Peter says, "Well, I'd like to, but I have orders from higher up. What <br>we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. Then you can<br>choose where to spend eternity."</p>
              <p>"Really, I've made up my mind. I want to be in heaven, I'm already dressed <br>in white." says the MP.</p>
              <p>"I'm sorry, but we have our rules", replies St.Peter.</p>
              <p>And with that, St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, <br>down to hell. The doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green<br>golf course. In the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are<br>all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.</p>
              <p>Everyone is very happy and in evening dress. They run to greet him, shake <br>his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at<br>the expense of the people. They play a friendly game of golf and then dine<br>on lobster, caviar and champagne.</p>
              <p>Also present is the Devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good <br>time dancing and telling jokes. They are having such a good time that before<br>he realizes it, it is time to go.</p>
              <p>Everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises...</p>
              <p>The elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where St.Peter <br>is waiting for him.</p>
              <p>"Now it's time to visit heaven," St Peter says.</p>
              <p>So, 24 hours pass with the MP joining a group of contented souls moving from <br>cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. They have a good time and the<br>24 hours in heaven passes by and St Peter returns.</p>
              <p>"Well, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. Now which will you <br>choose for your eternity?" St Peter asks.</p>
              <p>The MP reflects for a minute, then he answers, "Well, I never would have <br>thought it before, I mean heaven has been delightful, but I think I would be<br>happier and better off .. in hell."</p>
              <p>So St. Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to <br>hell.</p>
              <p>Now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land <br>covered with waste and garbage.</p>
              <p>He sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting <br>it in black bags as more trash falls from above.</p>
              <p>The Devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder.</p>
              <p>"I don't understand," stammers the MP. "Yesterday I was here and there was a <br>golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne,<br>and danced and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of<br>garbage and my friends look miserable. What happened?"</p>
              <p>The Devil looks at him, smiles and says, "Yesterday we were campaigning..</p>
              <p>Today .. you have voted."</p>

              <p>When we complain that GLCs are marginalising the small businesses for Government tenders, PAP say the GLCs can deliver best value and quality.</p>
              <p>When we say foreigners are taking away our jobs, they say foreigners are here to create jobs.</p>
              <p>When PMETs cannot find jobs, they say degree holders refused to be security guards.</p>
              <p>When we complain about the huge income divide, they say, it is a worldwide phenomenon.</p>
              <p>When we complain about long waiting time and high cost of health, they say other countries envy our system.</p>
              <p>When we say HDB flat is unaffordable, they say it is affordable if you pay over 30 years or more.</p>
              <p>When we say we have little left for retirement, they say, we will push back the retirement age.</p>
              <p>When we say Ministers are the highest paid in the world, they say, corporate CEOs earn much more.</p>
              <p>When we says COEs does not ease road congestions, they say they will build more ERP gantries.</p>
