              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: As the drumbeats of the General Election get louder 
              by the day, a survey of 618 voters commissioned by Today has found that 
              the rising cost of living here is more likely to influence how the 
              voters cast their ballot than supposedly hot-button issues such as the 
              influx of foreigners or housing.<br><br>For some political watchers the results came as a surprise.<br><br>The
               survey, conducted earlier this month via telephone by Media Research 
              Consultants, is statistically representative of HDB dwellers, the 
              findings weighted by the national profile for gender, age, race and HDB 
              housing type. The survey, however, does not cover voters living in 
              private properties.<br><br>The result, which political watchers found 
              the most interesting: Almost 7 in 10 voters (65.5 per cent) said that 
              the issue of foreigners - the influx and its side effects will not 
              affect their vote at the GE.<br><br>This finding was backed up by the 
              fact that slightly more than half the voters (55.3 per cent) felt that 
              the steps taken by the Government to slow down the influx of foreigners 
              and to sharpen the differentiation between citizens and non-citizens 
              have been "adequate" to address their concerns.<br><br>Trying to 
              reconcile the survey findings with the widely held perception, 
              especially in cyberspace, that foreigners are the hot-button issue of 
              this General Election, independent scholar Derek da Cunha noted that 
              there is "tendency among the majority of Singaporeans to avoid 
              controversy by making only politically correct statements". <br><br>Dr 
              da Cunha added: "I am quite sure that the issue of the influx of 
              foreigners into Singapore is more significant than many people would 
              care to admit openly."<br><br>But having said that, when it comes to 
              concerns on the influx of foreigners, the perception that it has led to 
              greater congestion on buses and MRT trains was the concern most often 
              cited by voters edging out other concerns such as the erosion of the 
              national identity, a difficulty in integration or a feeling of being a 
              second-class citizen.<br><br>On the housing front, framed broadly as a 
              question of availability and affordability of public housing, the survey
               found that only 4 in 10 voters (41.6 per cent) said that this issue 
              would influence how they plan to vote. Almost 6 in 10 (58.4 per cent) 
              said that the issue would not have any effect how they vote.<br><br>This
               was despite the fact that opinions were quite evenly split - 47.6 per 
              cent saying yes and 52.4 per cent saying no - when asked if the slew of 
              measures taken by the Government to cool the private property market and
               to help Singaporeans buy a HDB flat have been adequate to address 
              concerns.<br><br>The one issue that has lived up to its "hot-button" 
              billing was the rising cost of living. An overwhelming 8 in 10 voters 
              surveyed said they were worried about rising costs in their daily lives -
               be it when they were buying basic necessities at the supermarket, or a 
              meal at the food court, or going to a polyclinic or planning to buy a 
              new car or even going on a vacation.<br><br>Political analyst Eugene KB 
              Tan observed: "There is an inverse relationship between the perceived 
              effectiveness of the measures taken to address the hot-button issue and 
              the effect it will have on how the respondents vote at the GE."<br><br>As
               to why the cost of living was the hottest of issues, the assistant 
              professor at Singapore Management University noted that it was 
              "intimately connected with perceived standard of living, it affects 
              spending propensity and is regarded as also impacting the future."  <br><br>Institute
               of Policy Studies faculty associate Tan Ern Ser said the survey showed 
              that all three issues were "significant" to varying extents.<br><br>"However,
               I must add that cost of living is pretty salient at this point in time,
               affecting most people ... while housing affects a smaller proportion of
               people, probably those in their late 20s and 30s - some of whom have 
              never voted before," said the sociologist.<br><br>While offering some 
              insight into the psyche of heartland voters, the survey throws up a 
              relevant question: Could more grassroots concerns such as covered 
              walkways, the frequency of feeder buses, or housing estate facilities 
              turn out to have a greater impact on how voters decide to cast their 
              ballot?</span> </span></p>

              <p>Alot of ppl got flats so not all think this issue is important.</p>
              <p>But of course people like me who haven't buy flats tend to care more on housing issues.</p>
              <p>As for immigration and FT policy, I don't think this issue is enough to topple PAP unless they really bring in alot of foreigners until Singaporeans cannot take It.</p>
              <p>The only thing that can threaten PAP is high standard of living.</p>
