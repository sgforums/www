              <h2 class="PostHeaderIcon-wrapper" style="margin: 0pt; padding: 0pt;"><br></h2>
              <p>The Singapore Democrats conducted another walkabout this Sunday at 
              the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC at the Ghim Moh Road market centre. In the 
              past several months the SDP has been quietly doing its campaign rounds 
              in the 5-member constituency, assessing the ground situation there.</p>
              <p>Result?
               The feedback has been very positive with residents welcoming the SDP to
               contest in the warded and expressing unhappiness at the PAP.</p>
              <p>A 
              typical response that we have received came from a middle-aged man: “I 
              have been a PAP supporter until a few years ago. I don’t know what’s 
              happening to Singapore now. It doesn’t feel like our home anymore.”</p>
              <p>The
               GRC is helmed by Minister for Community, Youth and Sports Dr Vivian 
              Balakrishnan and NTUC Chief Mr Lim Swee Say. The other MPs include Ms Yu
               Foo Yee Shoon, Mr Christopher de Souza, and Mr Liang Eng Hwa. The GRC 
              was uncontested in the 2006 GE.</p>
              <p>The SDP intends to change this. We are putting together a formidable team to take on the PAP in the ward.</p>
              <p>Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, with his questionable ministerial perfomance, cannot go unchallenged.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/john-law.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-32631" style="border: 0px none;" title="john-law" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/john-law-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>Many
               still cannot get over the blunders that the minister made in his 
              handling of the Youth Olympic Games that was held in Singapore this 
              year. Dr Balakrishnan had blown the budget, spending a total of $387 
              million – three times the original amount allocated.</p>
              <p>In return, we
               received almost zero coverage of the event from the international 
              media. Along the way, the Internet painfully exposed the questionable 
              leadership qualities of the minister.</p>
              <p>Another minister, Mr Lim 
              Swee Say, with his tone-deaf ‘I-feel-so-rich’ quip, must also not be 
              allowed another walkover. Who can forget that during the depth of our 
              economic crisis, all Mr Lim could do was sing his NTUC jingle ‘Upturn 
              the downturn’, leaving Singaporeans quite speechless. </p>
              <p>Over the 
              past several months, the Democrats have been working at Bukit Panjang 
              SMC and in the course of our work there we have spread our campaign to 
              the adjoining Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/danny4.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-32632" style="border: 0px none;" title="danny4" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/danny4-300x199.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199"></a>The
               intention is to ensure that which ever way the PAP redraws the 
              boundaries, we will have ensured that our work will not be wasted.</p>
              <p>Residents
               at both the SMC and GRC have become familiar with the SDP red-shirt. 
              Danny also came along to help in the campaigning and continued to 
              attract attention among the residents.</p>
              <p>An interesting note: Many, 
              if not most, of the residents who approached us and bought our newspaper
               were women. The photographs give an indication of this observation. </p>
              <p>“Are
               you coming to contest here?” one 40-something lady asked. “I haven’t 
              had a chance to vote in my entire life.” Several people indicated the 
              same view.</p>
              <p>Another lady asked to take a photograph with Dr Chee 
              Soon Juan. She said: “We need a different voice in Parliament. I hope 
              you will come here to run. Thanks for doing what you’re doing.”</p>
              <p>We also met a former PAP MP who was having breakfast with some friends. He bought a copy of <em>The New Democrat</em>. (We won’t mention his name in case he’s still collecting his pension.) </p>
              <p>In the coming weeks we will step up our campaign in the GRC and continue to reach out to the residents there.<br> .</p>

              <p>Partially. They have been eyeing Holland - Bukit Panjang since 2001 GE, when they choose Hong Kah on the last moment instead. So it is not a big news. A big news will be SDP contest Sembawang + Holland - Bukit Timah + Bukit Panjang. Well, I think a party without $100 in their reserves that was mentioned during the 2006 GE polling day like 8pm or so on national TV, is definitely cannot rule a town council well.....</p>

              <p>agreed with you. <br>sadly bread and butter issues have almost been forgotten by the govt these days, in particular, the middle income group. <br><br>Cos they have this mentality middle income group are adaptable, dun need govt assistance in finding jobs etc. <br><br>and this sudden inflow of foreigners has somehow affected the middle income group the most. Housing up, cost of living up, groceries up, no govt assistance, no jobs for fresh graduates (poly, degree)<br><br>as for lower income group, they provide them with financial assistance and food, and even securing them a cleaning job etc. these people scrimp and save, and are least impacted.</p>

              <p>At least they really make an effort to come in groups of reds and a mascots. That is the good beginning and hopefully it will last and delivery what they promoised.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But one thing opposition need to learnt, which they never, is to note that spore is a very small country. And opposition supporters are limited. With few opposition parties eyeing for a single pie, it will indeed hard to fight with pap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They need to reconcile their interest in serving the public with other parties. To form one party vs pap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Only then, they will have the chances, if not, it will still be pap victory, less percentage of votes (I assume).</p>
