                                  Workers’ Party (WP) supporters in his scathing article covering the
                                  aftermath of the election where the WP lost substantial votes.
                                  Right on his first statement, John Lui complained that people who
                                  want to change the government are usually self-serving people.</p>

              <p>This guy is just a typical lackey of the PAP regime lah. His
              wages are paid by the state controlled media. Just let him be lah.
              What do you expect from him? He has to suck PAP cock to survive.
              Support WP? His career will end immediately and he will be jobless.
              Typical PAP stooge.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Our state controlled media is ranked 154 for press freedom. What
              can we expect?</p>
              <p>Why you read this type of stooge writer from 154 ranked media? I
              see also don't want to see, this type of garbage PAP stooge.</p>
              <p>154 media still want to act big. Fuck off lah. See his fuck face

              <p>WP overloaded already and could not handle despite focusing on 28 seats.  </p>
              <p>SDA has potential of housing different political parties under without forcing the party members to give up their parties.  In 2001 and 2006 election, NSP and SPP went under them but detached themselves from them after that.</p>
              <p>It is also about opposition unity for a real long-term short at First World Parliament.</p>
              <p>WP also persisted in contesting in Nee Soon and Jalan Besar despite being rejected there with less than 40% of votes.  Voters see such persistence as seriously interested in contesting there if they continue to be active there.</p>
              <p>However, if WP could win more than half of the seats it contested in, then it is a different story.</p>

              <p>Yes....it also means WP already cannot handle it as they know they could not win if they split their team into two teams unlike PAP which could handle with up to 6 teams per night.</p>
              <p>Imagine a WP rally at half strength with LTK, CSM and Pittam Singh at one rally and another with Slivia, Png Eng Huat and Mohd Faisal at another rally instead of full force.  Do you think they could win there?  They tried full-force at Marine Parade, East Coast, Nee Soon, Jalan Besar and Punggol East but failed and almost failed at Aljunied.   So staying focused is more important than expansion if you are already stretched to your limits.  NSP made that mistake in 2011 election contesting in 24 seats instead of assembling an A-team to attack Tampines which was then led by most unpopular Minister Mah Bow Tan.   They ended up with nothing when they could have had at least an NCMP.</p>
