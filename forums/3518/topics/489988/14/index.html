              <p>I am sorry that I have been flooding this thread with suggestions. Here's one more, with regards to education.</p>
                                                                  <p>Suggestion:</p>
                                                                  <p>Let p6 students who fail the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), be in the Normal Technical (NT) stream, while change the NT stream.</p>
                                                                  <p>Extend the NT stream by two years. In secondary one and two, (re-) learn the contents in primary five and six merged stream (EM1+2).</p>
                          <p>Let primary school teachers teach the secondary one and two Normal Technical students. Partly because they are learning p5 and p6 merged stream content. Secondly, to reduce discrimination, since the teachers themselves can only teach primary school education.</p>
                          <p>To progress on to secondary three, they must get at least 63% overall in BOTH secondary one and two. Why? Because 188 of 300 is 62.7%. 188 is the minimum PSLE score for express stream.</p>
                                                                  <p>Otherwise, get at least 57% overall in both sec one and sec two. Because 170 of 300 is 56.7%. 170 can go to Normal Academic stream.</p>
                                                                  <p>Else, if overall is less than 57%, repeat, until overall get 57%.</p>
                                                                  <p>If overall is more than or equal to 57%, progress on to secondary three, where they would learn the contents of what NA/EXP students learn at secondary two. At the end of secondary three, choose subject combination.</p>
                                                                  <p>At secondary four, start two-year N level (Normal Academic) course. At secondary five, take N level (Normal Academic).</p>
                                                                  <p>Here, I would like to make a suggestion: change the criteria for N level students to take O level. Instead of only top students can take O level, let any N level student take O level, as long as they can get a certain aggregate score for N level.</p>
                                                                  <p>If they can qualify, at secondary six, they learn what NA students learn at secondary five, and take the O level examinations.</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Some realities of the ground for the opposition:</p>

              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">1. They lack capital. This should be the most apparent, but the PAP is vastly wealthy and have a lot of formal and informal networks of power and leverage that they can employ.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">2. They lack volunteers. The PAP has two main systems that they employ. The first and less important one is their various PAP branches around Singapore. The second is the PA and their GROs. They are the ones who work the ground and keep the MP/grassroots advisors (PAP Members) responsive and able to respond to complaints.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">3. Partisan government agencies. Firstly, there was the transfer of 26 public sites by the HDB from Aljunied-Hougang TC to PA. This again impedes the ability for WP to organise community events and to be more visible on the ground. The transfer also thwarts any attempts at doing events outside the aegis of the PA. Of course, these public sites still belong to the PA to this day. Another example was when Hougang tried to organise a trade fair - documents were submitted, but they lacked a letter of approval from the CCC, which is the top managing grassroots body in a constituency under the PA. Refer to number 2 as to why this is problematic.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">4. Difficulty of operating outside of election time. Given the top 3 points, its hard for any opposition party to do something beyond walkabouts, ad hoc/short-term relief programs as they don't have the permission to operate.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Essentially, the opposition faces the obstacle of regulatory capture: when different government agencies and statutory boards circumscribe the ability of the opposition to, in short, walk the ground. At the same time, these agencies advance the interests of the PAP, to the extent of ignoring the mandate that was given electorally to the opposition parties.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">So for all those posts who complain that all the opposition does is talk, please allow me this PAP-ism and ask for constructive criticism: what can they do, given all the obstacles they face?</p>

              <p>Same here. MRT sometimes break down. Bus service sometimes not reliable.</p>
                          <p>Which is why, I keep saying that the reason is because the Opposition parties provided solutions that are weak, not good in the long-term.</p>

                          <p>Yesterday, I made around two suggestions on Education. First is to conduct CME (Civics and Moral Education) classes in the Mother Tongue languages, at both primary school and secondary school, to improve our Chinese standard. Second is to change the Normal Technical stream to take in students who fail PSLE, and let Normal Technical students re-learn primary five and primary six content at secondary one and secondary two. It's to give them a second chance. If they can get at least 60% at both secondary one and secondary two, we can let them take the GCE N Level (Normal Academic). If their N level results meet the grade, we can let them take the GCE O Level. For the detailed write-up, read my earlier replies (scroll up for suggestion on NT stream).</p>
                          <p>Today, I would like to suggest on housing.</p><p>I notice when we buy house, the lease is ninety nine years. If we reduce the lease, maybe we can set a lower price for flats.</p>
                      <p>After all, from newly-married husband and wife to ah gong ah ma with two university graduate children, it takes around thirty years. By around the fortieth year, the children would probably have set up their own family.</p>
                      <p>A family only needs a house for forty years. After the forty years, children buy their own house, while parents buy their own house for two people world.</p>
                      <p>If we cut the lease down to forty years, maybe we can lower the price by a fraction of fifty nine over ninety nine.</p>
                          <p>We can make this like the COE (Certificate Of Entitlement). Not that we must buy the entitlement before we can buy house. As in, after the forty years, if the husband and wife still wants to stay in the same house, they "buy the house again".</p>
                          <p>Actually, a better word is "lease".</p>
                          <p>Here, I have another suggestion:</p>
                          <p>Allow the people the option to pay rents, in the form of five or ten years. Of course, if one can afford the full sum, can one-shot pay the rents for the full forty years. But, at least have the option to "pay rents".</p>

              in the same house, they "buy the house again".</p>
              <p>Actually, a better word is "lease".</p>
              <p>Here, I have another suggestion:</p>
              <p>Allow the people the option to pay rents, in the form of five or
              ten years. Of course, if one can afford the full sum, can one-shot
              pay the rents for the full forty years. But, at least have the
              option to "pay rents".</p>

              <p>rubbish wall of texts. The margin of error in engineering is 1%

              I am sure is due to poor maintenance not the equipment.</p>
