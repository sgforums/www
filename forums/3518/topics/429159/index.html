              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size: 10.0pt;  font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";  '>It is interesting that in the post nomination
              speeches, the PAP tend to focus on constituency issues while the opposition
              tend to focus on national issues.<span>  </span>Which
              is correct?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">In the 1970s there were only national issues
              and no constituency issues. Our forefathers were very focused on the good of
              the whole Singapore. It was only till housing estate upgrading came along, then
              constituency issues stole the limelight during elections.<span>  </span>Are constituency issues really that
              important?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">In some big countries, a single constituency is
              already bigger than the whole of Singapore.<span>  </span>Then constituency issues are important.<span>  </span>In Singapore constituencies are very small and very interrelated with each
              other. One constituency's issues will most likely affect the other
              constituencies as well.<span>  </span>We live in one
              constituency, and we work in another constituency, while traveling through
              constituencies each day.<span>  </span>We have relatives
              who stay in other constituencies and have gatherings in yet other
              constituencies as well.<span>  </span>Thus the good
              and the bad of constituencies are shared rather than wholly enjoyed by only the
              locals.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Therefore what is the use of a $0.6 billion
              upgrading in your constituency?<span>  </span>They may
              promise you a new shopping center, a new hospital, new school, new stadium, new
              jogging path, and even a man-made lagoon.<span>  </span>But people from other constituencies will come to use your shopping
              center, hospital, school, stadium, jogging path and lagoon too.<span>  </span>You most probably would end up using other
              constituency's shopping center, hospital, school, stadium, jogging path and
              lagoon as well.<span>  </span>So what is the big deal?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">And the good news end there.<span>  </span>How is the billion dollar upgrading financed?
              GST. Who will build that upgrading? Foreign labor. How will the town's living
              cost become? Much higher living cost. Will your son/daughter be able to buy a
              HDB near your flat? No, because the HDB prices rise much higher because it becomes
              a more beautiful estate. Will you actually be able to enjoy the estate? No
              because you work long hours each day, and you would go overseas for vacation
              anyway.<span>  </span>What can go wrong? Well you have
              just sent back to parliament a group of politicians who do not listen to you
              regarding national issues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">The fact is that a covered walkway will not
              make you any happier if living costs and medical cost continues to go up
              uncontrolled. A lift upgrading will not make you any happier if foreigner labor
              continues to threaten your job. A new hospital is of no use if you cannot
              afford to use it. A new school is also of no use if your kids cannot get in due
              to more foreigners.<span>  </span>Shopping center will
              not help if it is jam-packed with people all the time, and so are the buses and
              MRT.<span>  </span>Therefore national issues affects
              our daily lives much more than constituency issues.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Why then did the PAP focus on constituency
              issues? Perhaps it is because they messed up the national issues and thus would
              not like people to think about it.<span>  </span>Why
              did the opposition focus on national issues? Because there are serious and
              urgent national issues that require the attention of everyone.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 16px;">Therefore in this election, I hope everyone can
              be selfless and focus more on the national issues.<span>  </span>Our forefathers did that for us to bring
              prosperity to us.<span>  </span>We need to do that for
              the next generation so that the future Singapore will be more citizen focused
              rather than money focused.<span>  </span>Don't sell
              away the bright future of Singapore for merely a covered walkway or a lift
              upgrading.</span></p>

              <p>Depends.</p>
              <p>The majority of votes that goes to the MIW are actually older generation who tend to have benefitted from the constituency upgrades. They tend to have less issues with the current day-to-day outcomes and more equipped to live with less.It is easier for them to associate with the constituency upgrades as seeing-is-believing.</p>
              <p>The most discomforting set of outcome from this is that they may not be able to comprehend the resultant impact made in the Parliament. On the contrary, only the educated and informed Singaporeans will tend to take national issues to heart as they can understand figures and statistics. It is rather difficult to bring to the attention of the older generation the statistical studies which show the downward curve we are heading.</p>
              <p>These older generation do not see the swing as these are figures and does not relate to them unless someone spend more time and more effort explaining the outcomes of these figures.</p>
              <p>Thus, based on neurological examination, material visual and audio information is always easier to digest that immaterial statistical information.</p>
              <p>You need very good speakers to translate these immaterial statistical information into something which they can easily associate with and there is always difficulties in justifying the source.</p>

              <p>Depends.</p>
              <p>The majority of votes that goes to the MIW are actually older
              generation who tend to have benefitted from the constituency
              upgrades. They tend to have less issues with the current day-to-day
              outcomes and more equipped to live with less.It is easier for them
              to associate with the constituency upgrades as
              seeing-is-believing.</p>
              <p>The most discomforting set of outcome from this is that they may
              not be able to comprehend the resultant impact made in the
              Parliament. On the contrary, only the educated and informed
              Singaporeans will tend to take national issues to heart as they can
              understand figures and statistics. It is rather difficult to bring
              to the attention of the older generation the statistical studies
              which show the downward curve we are heading.</p>
              <p>These older generation do not see the swing as these are figures
              and does not relate to them unless someone spend more time and more
              effort explaining the outcomes of these figures.</p>
              <p>Thus, based on neurological examination, material visual and
              audio information is always easier to digest that immaterial
              statistical information.</p>
              <p>You need very good speakers to translate these immaterial
              statistical information into something which they can easily
              associate with and there is always difficulties in justifying the
              source.</p>

              <p>Think partly true, yes, older folkes tend to support PAP, but still they are some old folks with children and grandchildren hurting from PAP policies and are clear-minded that PAP is the culprit.</p>

              <p>Capitaland keep raising the rents , why ah ? Shouldn't there be a cap how much they want to squeeze out of businesses?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.5 million voters and we have 5 million people in Singapore. Someone still want to increase to 7 million. I can't believe it.  They want 4.5 millions foreigners in Singapore and they say they are taking care of us ? How ah?</p>
              <p>2.5  against 4.5 millions.  We are swamped, overwhelmed, overtaken and drown to the bottom, will they care?  The 4.5 millions are the ones giving them $$$, bringing in businesses.  We are useless Singaporeans. Our transport should be overswarmed by the 4.5millions, our housing, our roads, our schools, the foreigners are more important than us , the Singaporeans. This is called taking care of us ?</p>
