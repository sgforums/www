              <p>LTK, SL and CSM should stay in Aljunied and make it a WP stronghold together with Hougang. Also, to serve the residents there who dared to be the change.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, they should start grooming talents and stay connected to the rest of Singapore via social media. WKS and MBT are 'easier' targets for GE2011 because of what they did in last 5 years to anger people. Next GE got to depend which minister make bigger mistake. But should expand outwards from Aljunied, but as much as possible try to retain the hearts of Aljunied pple first. Otherwise, one step forward, 2 steps back. Skarli reduce to Hougang alone again.</p>

              <p>The sole reason WP contested in aljunied this time round was simply because, they were just a whisker to winning aljunied in the 2006 polls. Sylvia has also been walking the grounds there even before 2006.</p>

              <p>WP has been eyeing ALJ for 10 years. It was in ALJ that they were disqualified from standing in back in 2001. The WP's attempt to capture a GRC began way back in 1988 when Lee Siew Cho and Francis Seow made the PAP members of Eunos crap in their pants.</p>
