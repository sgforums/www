              <p>CAMPAIGNING is important in a general election because politicians 
              would seek to reach out to their constituents and correspondingly 
              canvass for votes on polling day.</p>
              <p>Election campaigns serve a myriad of purposes.</p>
              <p>First, voters would want to know more about the candidates 
              contesting in their constituencies and their views. Even though new 
              faces would have been unveiled in advance, constituents would know of 
              the candidates in their areas only on Nomination Day. Campaigning also 
              allows voters to interact with candidates, thus testing the latter's 
              communication skills.</p>
              <p>Second, campaigning allows voters to weigh the varying 
              messages and manifestos put forward and make an informed decision. 
              Dialogues on national concerns or policy recommendations would be more 
              focused and increasingly substantive.</p>
              <p>Finally, as the electoral battle intensifies, the 
              candidate's and party's ability to deal with criticisms and rhetorical 
              salvos under pressure will reveal their crisis management abilities.</p>
              <p>Given these reasons, the 10-day minimum period for 
              campaigning (which includes the eve of Polling Day, in which no 
              campaigning is allowed), would be counter-intuitive.</p>
              <p>A mere nine days is insufficient to explain policies and 
              introduce new faces, and benefits the incumbents. Campaigning duties 
              would be especially demanding for candidates in group representation 
              constituencies, given the geographical spread and sheer number of 
              residents.</p>
              <p>A longer period for campaigning will also dismiss criticisms
               that parties are unwilling to have their policies or track records 
              scrutinised and deliberated upon. With the proliferation of social media
               and the Internet, increased campaigning time will grant segments of 
              grassroots Singaporeans who feel disenfranchised or hard done by a 
              valuable opportunity to voice their dissatisfaction and opinions and 
              have them heard.</p>
              <p>It is only during a general election that the population is 
              most sensitive, attuned and reactive to this multitude of sentiments.</p>
              <p>A more viable period for campaigning would be between two 
              and three weeks, which would grant candidates a minimum of two weekends 
              to walk the ground and connect with the constituents.</p>
              <p>It would also be a test for the parties and candidates to 
              manage their manpower and resources, and increase their outreach 
              productively and efficiently.</p>
