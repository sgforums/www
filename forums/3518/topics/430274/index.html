              <div class="byLineDateArticle"><br></div>
              <p>SINGAPORE - While Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew felt that his remarks
                      about Malays, Muslims and integration did not affect the Malay vote for
                      the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), Senior Minister of State for
                      Foreign Affairs Zainul Abidin Rasheed said yesterday: "You need only
                      ask the Malays and Muslims in Singapore - many were hurt by those
                      remarks and remain so".<br><br> Mr Zainul, who was a member of the PAP Aljunied GRC team which lost the
                      General Election (GE), made this point to "show how easily the knots of
                      racial harmony in our community can unravel". <br><br> "Integration
                      does not only mean living in harmony. There must be equally
                      opportunities for all ... No Singaporean must ever feel alienated, or
                      worse, marginialised," he told reporters yesterday.<br><br> Asked about
                      the timing of Mr Lee's remarks, which were published in the book Hard
                      Truths to Keep Singapore Going, Mr Zainul pointed out the remarks had
                      been made two years ago but as the book was only published earlier this
                      year, he acknowledged: "So in that sense, (the) timing was bad for the
                      GE."<br><br> Published by Singapore Press Holdings, the book is based
                      on 16 interviews with MM Lee done by journalists from The Straits
                      Times. It was launched about three months before the General Election.<br><br> However, Mr Zainul admitted that there "is no such thing as good timing
                      or bad timing" to discuss potentially sensitive issues "because it
                      sometimes touches on the raw nerves and this is where we have to manage
                      the way we discuss such potentially sensitive issues, and issues that
                      could also be divisive".<br><br> He also pointed out that some "very
                      sensitive issues" pertaining to the Malay-Muslim community - such as
                      National Service, tertiary fees and quotas in public housing - had been
                      previously discussed behind closed doors and in public.<br><br> "I
                      think it's the combination of the approaches we have taken that has
                      brought the community to a level of maturity and be able to face these
                      issues squarely, and then move forward," he added.<br><br> Unlike his
                      PAP team mates, Cabinet Ministers George Yeo and Lim Hwee Hua, who had
                      announced their retirement from politics earlier this week, Mr Zainul,
                      stopped short of saying as much.<br><br> "I will always be involved in
                      community work and I can never say, 'never', in life or in politics,"
                      the 63-year-old said. "But given my age ... I think it is unlikely for
                      me to stand in the next election."<br><br> <br><br> TRANSFORMATION AN ONGOING PROCESS<br><br> While various PAP leaders have spoken about the need for reform from
                      within the ruling party, Mr Zainul noted the transformation "is an
                      ongoing process".<br><br> He also recounted some of the changes which he had witnessed within the PAP.<br><br> As an editor with the Singapore Press Holdings between 1976 and 1996,
                      Mr Zainul remembered Mr Lee - then Prime Minister - would consult many
                      editors before important decisions and speeches. <br><br> "We found
                      that if we do our homework and we were sincere in giving our feedback,
                      in fact, Minister Mentor was even willing to change decisions which
                      they had already made," Mr Zainul said.<br><br> When Mr Goh Chok Tong
                      took over as Prime Minister, Mr Zainul pointed out the PAP Government
                      tried to make the political process "more consultative" and "open". <br><br> Similarly, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is "more engaging and prepared to listen", Mr Zainul felt.<br><br> But he pointed out: "We have leaders among ourselves, or even in the
                      civil service, people who have strong views themselves, who have their
                      own opinions, and it's a matter of how do we actually blend the
                      opinions, positions and feedback, and how do we bring them a policy
                      that is acceptable to all."<br><br> While the Government "cannot please
                      everyone", Mr Zainul felt it could do better in managing the
                      communicating policies, managing feedback of people that may disagree
                      with the Government and the communication process. "This is something
                      which I think the party has started doing it, and I think we can only
                      go deeper and do more," he added.<br><br> <br><br> SENTIMENTS MORE IMPORTANT THAN GOODIES<br><br> Recalling his political career, Mr Zainul noted that he was no stranger to tough electoral battles. <br><br> He entered politics in 1997, contesting the "hot seat" of Cheng San
                      GRC, where the PAP garnered 54.82 per cent of the votes against a
                      Workers' Party (WP) team led by the late J B Jeyaretnam. <br><br> Mr Zainul described that contest as his "political baptism of fire". <br><br> He contested Aljunied GRC in the 2006 election, when the WP team, which
                      included party chairman Sylvia Lim, secured 43.9 per cent of the votes.<br><br> But the 2011 election, he said "was a different story". <br><br> While people appeared happy with the PAP team during their walkabouts,
                      Mr Zainul said: "The national mood, the national issues just swept us
                      from under our feet". <br><br> "When we realised that, in fact, it
                      wasn't just local issues, but national issues that had taken a kind of
                      a different priority, I thought it was rather too late," he added. <br><br> "It was a rollercoaster ride we had in 2011 but an experience which I
                      think will make me a lot stronger and a lot more savvy in terms of
                      understanding people's sentiments and how in fact people's sentiments
                      are equally, if not more, important than all the programmes and all the
                      goodies."<br><br> While he would "forever feel a tinge of sadness"
                      about last Saturday's results, Mr Zainul remained dedicated to serving
                      Singapore.<br><br> "This election result will not change my resolve. I will do what I can, for so long as I am able," he added.</p>

              <p>I disagree, whatever they want to do is in their private spiritual and religious realm. If a small number of them want to stick to prayer times, wear scarves, avoid pork, let them be. I don't see them causing any great disruption.</p>

              <p>nfshp253, just like alize said.. i too really diagree with u to the max &gt;.&gt;. What do u mean they have too many restrictions? its their religion. what u want them to do? They were taught what and what not to do. Their restriction didnt really bother us. Actually doesnt even bother me at all and I'm sure people with logic are with me. I know my friends are. The majority people of this country are us.. chinese. So why do u want to act like their society might corrupted ours? They dont even bother us. They mind their own business, we mind our own business. WHATS THE DEAL?</p>
              <p>Dont start with these american black and white routine. Ok its really starting to piss me off. I starting not to like lee kuan yew now. geez.Â </p>
