              <p>Temasek Review -  30 January 2010</p>
              <p><strong>Alex Tan sells toothpicks and T-shirts online to raise funds for his election campaign</strong></p>
              <p><em>Written by Our Correspondent</em></p>
              <p>Vocal online critic of the PAP Mr Alex Tan, who embarrassed two PAP MPs with his sharp and pointed questions during a YPAP Forum last month, had started selling tooth-picks and T-shirts on his blog, according to a report by Lianhe Wanbao:</p>
              <p>Alex had just joined the Singapore People’s Party led by veteran opposition leader Mr Chiam See Tong. The 22 year old is currently working as a project engineer and he has indicated his interest to take part in the next general election.</p>
              <p>The proceeds from the sales will go to paying the $15,000 deposit each candidate has to put up to stand for election. He has raised $772 so far with one donor paying $400 for a toothpick.</p>
              <p>The toothpicks cost $1 each while the yet to be printed T-shirts cost $12 each.</p>
              <p>Alex first shot into fame last month over his protracted online “flame war” with YPAP members which subsequently led to his eviction from its Facebook.</p>
              <p>He has been making the headlines for his relentless criticisms of the PAP as well as a complaint he lodged against YPAP member Sear Hock Rong over possible conflict of interest between his business interests and grassroots work at Eunos.</p>
              <p>Despite the (usual) attempts by the mainstream media to portray him as a “radical”, Alex has won the support of many netizens. His “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/alextan8787?ref=mf#/group.php?gid=153492722129&amp;ref=mf"><span style="color: #a91b33;">Vote the PAP out” </span></a>has garnered more than 2,800 members in less than two months and already exceeded the membership of the YPAP Facebook.</p>
              <p>Most of the friends on his Facebook are young Singaporeans between the age of 18 to 30. This is unimaginable a year ago.</p>
              <p>Alex wrote on his Facebook that he would continue to fight for as long as it takes till he enters Parliament one day to speak up for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Though Alex may have limited financial resources right now, there are many Singaporeans out there, especially retirees who will have no qualms contributing to his election campaign.</p>
              <p>The Malaysian political tsunami in 2008 was triggered partly by fresh, young graduates like Alex Tan who toppled senior politicians in their maiden election like Tony Pua, Jeff Ooi and Jernice Tan.</p>
              <p>If the opposition has more Alex Tans joining them, they will stand a good chance of winning a few more seats in the next general election.</p>
              <p>Based on public sentiments at least in cyberspace alone, the tide is turning against the PAP. What is lacking now is a platform to link the IT-savvy young Singaporeans with the disgruntled Singaporeans who do not surf the internet which may snowball into a wider people’s movement on the ground.</p>
              <p>If you are keen to support Alex Tan’s efforts, please visit his blog <a href="http://www.utopia8787.blogspot.com/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>.</p>

              <p><br>Whatever website that is effective and attract more people to buy and so on is good.   What they need to do is give more publicity to it if not not many got to know about it.   Especially this has got to do with Chiam, many sgporeans would love to support it.  Chiam is many of our favourite opp, you know</p>

              <p>maybe they should sell emblems and statues of SDP etc stuff instead of stuff that some ganang guni man would sell!!</p>
              <p>thats probably whats wrong with political leaders...they have no class and resources.u dont need that much money for ther above.....some knowledge and ideas!for less than $50 he could at least have sold badges of SDP instead of toothpicks obtained from a pasar malam.in that aspect most political opposers of PAP have not made much sense and sadly credibility.</p>
              <p>to get the resources for SDP badges....they can go to toys r'us at tampines mall or orchard road and get one for $20.theres a lil plastic machine thats able to make at least 50 badges of any size.it comes with easy to understand pictoral diagrams too!</p>
              <p>maybe i should come and setup an opposition party too from the lack of diligence and effort on the opposition side.</p>
              <p>toothpicks??!!why not a slipper or someones ps2 game?</p>
