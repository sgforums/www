The full team had quit then, which was and remains the requirement for a by-election to be held in a GRC.<br><br>The timing of such an election lies in the hands of the PM.<br><br>Rumours have been rife online that 1992 may repeat itself this year.<br><br>Several local media reports have speculated that Ang Mo Kio GRC MP <a class="inline" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Seng+Han+Thong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">Seng Han Thong</span></span></a> is considering retiring from politics and PM Lee may take the chance to bring in NTUC Deputy Secretary-General <a class="inline" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Ong+Ye+Kung&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">Ong Ye Kung </span></span></a>into Parliament.<br><br>Law professors Thio Li-ann and Kevin Tan of the National University of Singapore told Yahoo! Singapore that by-elections at Ang Mo Kio GRC and Hougang SMC can be held at the same time.<br><br>Said Thio, “Should Mr Seng choose to leave politics, he could either (a) resign from the PAP or (b) resign his seat in Parliament by writing a note to the Speaker and retain his PAP membership.”<br><br>“Once a seat is vacated, the PM then has the power or liberty to call a by-election as regulated by the Parliamentary Elections Act,” she added.<br><br>Meanwhile, Kevin Tan said, "However, if (one is) suggesting that they will hold the election by enlarging AMK to incorporate Hougang, that is another matter.<br><br>“Technically, this will require a report from the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee which can, of course, recommend the merger of these two constituencies into a 6-man GRC for by-election.”<br><br>Tan, however, expressed doubt that this would happen as “the PM might risk a defeat after being best performer in the last GE.”<br><br>The law professor also dismissed another rumour about the merging of the two councils without a by-election, which he pointed out is not possible “due to section 3(1)(b) of the Town Councils Act which requires the elected MP to agree”.<br><br>But speculations may just remain that, it seems.<br><br>When contacted, PAP MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC <a class="inline" href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Inderjit+Singh&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span><span style="color: #006ec2;">Inderjit Singh</span></span></a> said that he has not heard Seng, whom he had spoken to just a few days ago, “say anything about retiring from politics”.<br><br>“At this stage there are no indications to us in Ang Mo Kio from the PM that he will be calling for a by-election,” he added. “We have not started any activities to prepare for a by-election.”<br><br></div>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> 2012-05-09 17:53</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px; text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;">Singapore, May 9, 2012 (AFP) - <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Singapore on Wednesday set a parliamentary by-election for May 26 amid growing discontent with the ruling party over rising living costs, immigration and public transport breakdowns.</span></span></strong></span></p>
              <div class="submitted" style="padding-right: 14px; font-size: 12px; display: inline; font-family: Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; line-height: normal;">
              <div class="content_wrapper" style="padding-right: 14px; margin-bottom: auto; text-align: justify; font-size: 13px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">The vote will be held in the district of Hougang, whose opposition member of parliament Yaw Shin Leong was expelled by the Workers' Party due to charges of personal misconduct, creating a vacancy in the 87-member legislature.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Analysts said the vote will be a fresh test for the ruling People's Action Party, one year after a landmark general election in which its share of the national vote fell to an all-time low of 60 percent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">It has been in power since 1959 but criticism of the government over rising living costs, a large influx of foreigners and frequent breakdowns in the metro train system has intensified on the Internet even after last year's election.</span></strong></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">In last year's vote, the Workers' Party won an unprecedented six seats despite an electoral system seen as stacked in favour of the ruling party.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Reuben Wong, an assistant professor of political science at the National University of Singapore, believed the opposition will retain Hougang but with a narrower margin because of the impact of allegations of extramarital affairs by Yaw, who has remained silent.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">"Hougang has been a Workers' Party stronghold for so many years, it's very difficult to wrest control from Workers' Party," Wong told AFP.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in a statement after the by-election was called, criticised the opposition party and Yaw for failing to give a full account of the allegations as well as his expulsion.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-right: 0pt; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 0pt; font-size: 13px; line-height: 17px;">"Both the WP and Mr Yaw have let down all those who voted for him," Lee said.</p>

              in the single-seat constituency of Hougang is a local contest about who

              by-election on May 26.<br><br>Mr Tharman said Mr Choo is not a new face, especially to the residents of Hougang.<br><br>The PAP fielded him in Hougang SMC in the 2011 General Election.<br><br>Mr

              through weekly coffee sessions and regular house visits.<br><br>He has also mobilised new resources and implement local schemes to help residents.<br><br>Mr

               Tharman, who's also Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance and
