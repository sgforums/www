              <p> </p>
              <p>NEWLY-ELECTED Hougang MP Png Eng Huat has refuted media reports saying that he set up and closed down eight companies over 12 years.<br><br>  In a statement posted on the Workers' Party website yesterday, he cited reports in My Paper and Lianhe Zaobao and took issue with their timing, saying they "did not get their fact right".<br><br>  Published in the run-up to Polling Day for the by-election, they said he was the director and shareholder of 11 firms, eight of which wound up between 1990 and 2002.<br><br>  The MP took particular issue with the headlines, which included "Png Eng Huat: Will do it when opportunity comes".<br><br>  He said: "This headlines not only give readers an impression that I am an incapable businessman but also an opportunistic person who would not hesitate to set up and wind down companies to maximise profits. I regret that these paper deem it necessary not only to dig up my business records in the run-up to Polling Day, but also did not even get their facts right."<br><br>  He explained that he had worked with NTUC Income from 1998 to 2001, and was appointed director of four subsidiary companies - i-Map, E-Lifestyle (S), Juzclickcar.com and ID Connect.com. He said all four were still operational when he left, and he neither owned them nor had a role in their operations after he left.<br><br>  Of the other four, Mr Png said he was in control of only three - Flora De Paradis, Crenner International and i Productions. One of them was dormant, he added.<br><br>  "The three companies were shut down in an orderly manner and they have no outstanding debt. No one suffered any financial loss as a result of the voluntary winding-up action."<br><br>  The last one, Trancost Singapore, was not his company, he said, and added that the media "has a duty to wield the pen responsibly and not present untruths or half-truths".</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 36pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">WP sacks veteran Poh over by-election conduct</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By ANDREA ONG<br></strong> </p>
              <p>NEARLY two months after he surprised his party leaders by staging a bid to be a spare candidate in the Hougang by-election, Dr Poh Lee Guan has been sacked by the Workers' Party (WP).</p>
              <p>  The opposition party told him that it was not satisfied with his explanation of his action, and was expelling him on the grounds that his conduct went against its principles.</p>
              <p>  But the veteran member, who has been with the WP for more than 10 years, yesterday maintained that he had the party's interests at heart when he decided to submit papers needed to run as a candidate - without its leaders' knowledge.</p>
              <p>  "All the while, I had the intention to be the quiet back-up and the spare tyre in the boot," the 50-year-old told The Straits Times. "I recognise the fact that I'm not WP's preferred candidate... but if anything happened, it would have been a walkover."</p>
              <p>  The private school lecturer caused a ruckus when his name emerged on the list of people qualified to stand, a day before Nomination Day on May 16. It prompted much speculation of a multi-cornered fight and talk of dissent within the WP.</p>
              <p>  In the end, he did not contest, leaving the by-election a straight fight between the WP's Mr Png Eng Huat and the People's Action Party's Mr Desmond Choo.</p>
              <p>  According to WP secretary-general Low Thia Khiang, the party's central executive council (CEC) met Dr Poh on Tuesday last week and asked him to explain his actions.</p>
              <p>  In a letter dated two days later, Mr Low wrote to him: "After due consideration, the council does not find your explanation acceptable. The council has decided to expel you from the party under Article 22 of the Workers' Party constitution, with immediate effect."</p>
              <p>  Dr Poh posted the letter on his Facebook page last night. Mr Low, who confirmed the expulsion yesterday, told The Straits Times that the CEC made its decision the same day it met Dr Poh.</p>
              <p>  WP's constitution allows the CEC to expel or suspend a member if his conduct is deemed "contrary to the principles or aims or objects of the party or prejudicial to the welfare of the party".</p>
              <p>  Mr Low declined to elaborate further, saying only that Article 22 was "very clear on the grounds". "I think it is an assessment and judgment of the members of the CEC as to whether his actions during the Hougang by-election... fall under Article 22, (thus) justifying the decision of the CEC," he said.</p>
              <p>  Mr Low added the CEC's decision was not unanimous, though a majority was in favour of expelling Dr Poh. It is not known who among the 16-member council did not back the move.</p>
              <p>  Dr Poh joined the WP in 2001 and fought three general elections under its banner. As its first assistant secretary-general from 2001 to 2006, he was once its No. 2 man after Mr Low.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, he said the party had not explained sufficiently its decision to expel him.</p>
              <p>  He also stood by an explanation he gave the media on Nomination Day - that he was a "quiet spare". He wanted to prevent a recurrence of 2001, when the WP team in Aljunied GRC was disqualified because its nomination forms were incomplete.</p>
              <p>  "If something had happened to Png on Nomination Day, the situation would be very different," he said. "I would be viewed in a different light."</p>
              <p>  He said he did not tell the party of his intentions as the Elections Department told him his application for a political donations certificate - which candidates need to get - was confidential.</p>
              <p>  So it was a surprise when the names of those who got the certificate were released. When news broke, Dr Poh did not contact Mr Low "because it happened in a very short time and I was thinking of what to do, wondering what was going to happen next".</p>
              <p>  Asked if he would join other political parties, Dr Poh would only say that he planned to focus on a few projects "close to my heart", such as working with faith-based organisations to help the community.</p>
              <p>  Asked how he felt on being expelled, he replied: "It's water under the bridge. I still have many good friends within WP. Life has its ups and downs but it needs to go on."</p>
