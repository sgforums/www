              <p>What has caused Desmond Choo to lose?</p>
              <p>Apart from LTK's all time popularity in the constituency,
              Desmond's defeat was attributed by:</p>
              <p>1) the harping on NCMP issue</p>
              <p>As Dr Tan Cheng Bok has shared in his facebook "Desmond tried
              hard but his attempt was distracted and dampened by the NCMP
              issue."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) mainstream media bias. </p>
              <p>How often did they report on what Desmond Choo wanted to do, his
              policy etc, as compared to their day and night reporting of TCH's
              allegation? </p>
              <p>As reported in <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC120524-0000064/PAPs-Desmond-Choo-steering-clear-of-NCMP-controversy">Today</a>, "While Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee
              Hean has questioned the integrity of Mr Choo's opponent, Mr Png Eng
              Huat, Mr Choo reiterated that he is focused on his own
              campaign."  But how many ppl paid attention to that? 
              Can't blame the ppl cuz the mainstream media kept echoing what TCH
              alleged and reported on WP's response to the allegation.  The
              whole media reporting in this episode made Desmond look like a
              calefare.  As such, this has not been a <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_802442.html">good, clean fight</a> that Desmond has wanted.
               </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Somebody ought to stay at home today to do some soul searching
              and the person is not Desmond nor Png.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p>Deputy Political Editor</p>
              <p>The Workers' Party won its sixth straight election in Hougang yesterday  with 62.1 per cent of valid votes cast.</p>
              <p>  It was a strong showing by its candidate Png Eng Huat, whose winning margin  was just three percentage points lower than  the party's best of  64.8 per cent in last May's general election.</p>
              <p>  WP chief Low Thia Khiang went on the offensive after the results were announced at 10.30pm, challenging Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to show his sincerity in building an inclusive society by approving estate upgrading for Hougang.</p>
              <p> The Aljunied-Hougang Town Council had put up Hougang town for the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme and  Home  Improvement Programme, he said, and the National Development Ministry had yet to give its decision.An opposition ward for 21 years, the single-member constituency has been at the end of the upgrading queue.</p>
              <p>  In a statement last night, the Prime Minister said the People's Action Party had offered Hougang voters a chance for a fresh start and he was disappointed that its man, Mr Desmond Choo, did not win.</p>
              <p>  Adding that he respected the voters' choice, he said the PAP would continue to be present in Hougang, and he was confident it would win back the ward in future.</p>
              <p>  Hougang voters' loyalty to the WP was on show at several coffeeshops,  where supporters gathered to await the result over food and drinks.</p>
              <p>  Hundreds thronged the coffeeshop at Block 322, Hougang AvenueS, and filled the air with chants of "Huat ah (prosper) Low Thia Khiang and WP".</p>
              <p>  The by-election was called because Mr Low's handpicked successor, Mr Yaw Shin Leong, lost his seat in Parliament and left Singapore after being expelled by the party amid allegations of infidelity.</p>
              <p>  Though he won the backing of Hougang voters yesterday, Mr Low was clearly angry at aspects of the campaign. He accused the PAP of resuming  election  tactics it had  employed in decades past, such as "character  assassinations" and "distractions".</p>
              <p>  He also accused the mainstream media of once again becoming a "political tool of the  PAP" in the by-election.</p>
              <p>  Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean responded to Mr Low's comments, which  were televised live from the WP headquarters in Syed Alwi Road. He said he was surprised that  Mr Low spoke about character assassination.</p>
              <p>  "If there was any of that, I think it came from contradictions within his own  party. And if there is anything that Mr Low wants to take up, he is free to take it up further, through legal action , even, if he feels that it's necessary," Mr Teo said.</p>
              <p>  During the campaign, Mr Teo raised questions about Mr Png's integrity after the latter gave conflicting accounts of whether his name was on the ballot when the WP selected a Non-Constituency MP.</p>
              <p>  Mr Teo also responded to Mr Low's charge that the Government had denied upgrading programmes to wards like Hougang that supported the opposition.</p>
              <p>  "The upgrading project is going ahead, and we have always said that Hougang residents will get their upgrading, and I think that they will," said Mr Teo.</p>
              <p>  Political observers yesterday had mixed reactions to the WP's winning margin in its stronghold.</p>
              <p>  Assistant Professor Reuben Wong of the National University of Singapore said he had expected the gap to be narrower. He said that Mr Desmond Choo started out as an underdog but interventions by PAP leaders led to the WP taking back the "underdog mantle".</p>
              <p>  Dr Derek da Cunha said the result showed that "it is extremely difficult to shift the vote significantly in any direction, especially when it comes to a contest between the PAP and  what is perceived to be a Workers' Party  that is moderate and, therefore, considered a very worthy opponent by the electorate".</p>

                   Actually it is worrying that  some of these so called politicians lack poltical savvy, even though it was only domestic front-local  by -elections. it was a good opportunity for the party in power to narrow the gap in this by-election at least. So that in the next GE they can really re-capture the ward. The window of opportunity was there by" courtesy" of Yaw  but  not opitimised. However I look upon the Yaw episode as  a timely reminder for the Opposition that  they must always be vigilant even internally as to the candidates they appoint, but they must also always have continuity and able succesors  or they end up like Potong Pasir.

              <p>DAY after emerging victorious in the Hougang by-election, the Workers' Party said it wants to move on and work with the People's Action Party to tackle important national issues.<br><br>  WP chief Low Thia Khiang said he noted Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's call to Singaporeans late on Saturday to refocus on longer term issues and "work together as one  people  to achieve the best for Singapore".<br><br>  Speaking to reporters yesterday morning, Mr Low said: "The WP will move on from this election and work together with the ruling party for the betterment of Singapore."<br><br>  It was the opposition leader's way of explaining why he would not be taking up points raised by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean during the by-election campaign,  which  Mr Low described on Saturday night as "character assassinations".<br><br>  Mr Teo had questioned Mr Png Eng Huat's differing accounts of whether his name had been in the running when the WP picked a Non-Constituency MP last year.<br><br>  On Saturday night, after the by-election results were announced, Mr Low and Mr Teo had an exchange through the media. It culminated in Mr Teo saying Mr Low was "free to take it up further, through legal action".<br><br>  Last  night, Mr Teo said at a community event that he hoped Mr Low would "move away from the combative tone that he took during the by-election and work in a constructive way with the Government".<br><br>  In another sign the WP chief did not want to "let the by-election topics continue to trouble us", he said yesterday there would be no witch-hunt to find the party member who had feaked internal documents to the media.<br><br>  Instead, he highlighted several national issues that the WP would be keeping an eye on.<br><br>  These include the high cost of living, in particular, the prices of electricity and certificates of entitlement, the productivity drive and its effectiveness in raising pay for low-wage workers, and adjustments to foreign worker inflows and their impact on small and medium-sized enterprises and wages at the bottom.<br><br>  In Hougang, Mr Low said the WP's priority is to improve the estate for residents as that was one of Mr Png's election promises.<br><br>  The National Solidarity Party and a group led by former civil servant Benjamin Pwee congratulated the WP on its victory.</p>
