              <p> </p>
              <p>By Tessa Wong</p>
              <p>FORMER Workers’ Party (WP) member and Nee Soon GRC candidate Sajeev Kamalasanan has dismissed online suggestions that he timed his resignation to discredit the party.</p>
              <p>  He also rejected accusations that he had alleged that the party and its chairman Sylvia Lim, who is an MP for Aljunied GRC, were racist.</p>
              <p>  He quit the WP on Sunday, and after copies of his announcement began appearing online, netizens wondered whether his resignation was aimed at damaging WP’s credibility at a critical period.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, in a statement, he said his departure was “not timed to discredit/affect WP in the Hougang by-elections”.</p>
              <p>  “The timing is incidental, a natural progression of the multiple unsatisfactory discussions/talks” he said he had with Ms Lim in March and last month on the party’s selection process for cadres.</p>
              <p>  He also pointed out that he had never said “at any time that Ms Lim or WP is racist, and I would urge others not to misconstrue the reasons for my resignation”.</p>
              <p>  He admitted that as there were no witness present during his talks with Ms Lim, neither side could prove what was said.</p>
              <p>  “The public is free to form its own opinions and I respect that,” he said.</p>
              <p>  In his earlier statement, Mr Sajeev said he was not made a cadre after standing in last year’s general election.</p>
              <p>  He alleged that when he asked Ms Lim why he was not nominated, one reason she gave was that “it has been the party’s experience that Indians tend to leave after getting party cadreship”.</p>
              <p>  On Monday, Ms Lim dismissed the allegations that she and her party were racist as “baseless and absurd”.</p>
              <p>  Mr Pritam Singh, one of two minority-race MPs in Aljunied, also said “racism was not an issue” in the WP. The other minority-race MP is Mr Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap.</p>
              <p>  But in his statement yesterday, Mr Sajeev called on the WP to be “transparent and account to the public if there is a healthy and active participation of minorities” in its cadreship or central executive committee, “besides the minority Aljunied GRC MPs”.</p>
              <p>  His resignation led former WP East Coast GRC candidate Mohamed Fazli Talip to post on his Facebook page yesterday: “With Sajeev’s departure from the party, I am still disappointed about the selection process for cadreship and candidacy.”</p>
              <p>  Pointing out that representing a party in an election involves a sacrifice of time and money, he added: “Recognition should be given.”</p>
              <p>  Mr Fazli left the WP in February, citing personal and work commitments as his reasons for leaving.</p>
              <p>  Their departure notwithstanding, both men wished the WP candidate Png Eng Huat “all the best” in the May 26 Hougang by-election.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>By Andrea Ong &amp; Tessa Wong</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>THE possible entry of another Workers’ Party member into the by-election fray has sparked speculation that all may not be well within the opposition party.</p>
              <p>  Yesterday, the appearance of WP veteran Poh Lee Guan’s name among the four men issued political donation certificates took party members by surprise. WP said he had not informed it of any intention to contest.</p>
              <p>  The shock event, which comes days after another member resigned, has led to talk that some members are not happy with how things are run in WP.</p>
              <p>  Dr Poh, who contested in three general elections under the WP banner, used to be the party’s No. 2 man after WP chief Low Thia Khiang. He was WP’s first assistant secretary-general, from 2001 to 2006, before he left its central executive council in 2008. Last year, he contested in Nee Soon GRC.</p>
              <p>  Sources say the 50-year-old might have felt unappreciated for his contributions, and was seeking to send a signal to WP leaders to register his unhappiness.</p>
              <p>  Some Party members recalled the case of Mr Eric Tan, 56, who quit the party last year after WP’s executive council picked younger member Gerald Giam as a Non-Constituency MP, even though Mr Tan was a council member and leader of the East Coast GRC team that posted the highest results among losing teams.</p>
              <p>  Others suggest that Dr Poh had harboured hopes of contesting in Hougang.</p>
              <p>  He has been spotted at nearly every meet-the-people session in the ward ever since its former MP Yaw Shin Leong was expelled. He was also active in Hougang when Mr Low was its MP, serving as vice-chairman of the WP’s grassroots arm there and as a Hougang Town Council councillor.</p>
              <p>  Several, however, believe that Dr Poh was merely volunteering himself as a back-up, though WP leaders made clear that he was not meant to be one.</p>
              <p>  Dr Poh did not answer repeated calls and messages to his phone yesterday. When The Straits Times visited his last known address in Yishun last night, neighbours said they had not seen him in months.</p>
              <p>  Sources said National Solidarity Party founder and council member Tan Chee Kien may have helped Dr Poh to pick up nomination forms last week.</p>
              <p>  Mr Sajeev Kamalasanan, who quit the WP on Sunday citing disappointment over not being recognised for his contributions, said the party should it had “a healthy and active participation of minorities within its cadreship/CEC ranks”.<br> <br>  Fellow ex-East Coast GRC candidate Mohamed Fazli Talip, who quit in February, also posted a message on Facebook saying he was “still disappointed” about the party’s selection process for cadreship and candidacy.</p>

              party unity is the most critical component in any party leadership...and more so during election campaign....
              
              its important for WP to sustain multi-racial representation within the party...as such it is essential to give due recognition ...but this could also be quite tough to balance if any member has personal hidden agendas....

              <p> </p>
              <p>POLITIAL party renewal is not new. But sometimes, the process can be painful, and public.</p>
              <p>Veteran Workers' Party (WP) member Poh Lee Guan, 50 surprised everyone, including his party leadership, when he said he was the unofficial backup candidate, the "spare type".</p>
              <p>  The WP stalwart had contested in the 2001, 2006 and 2011 General Elections (GEs).</p>
              <p>  His action raised questions.</p>
              <p>  Party insiders said he was unhappy at being passed over in favour of Mr Png Eng Huat.</p>
              <p>  Mr Png, also 50, a businessman, is the party-endorsed candidate.</p>
              <p>  Renewal can be a "touchy" issue for veteran politicians, said Mr Goh Meng Seng, the former secretary-general of the National Solidarity Party (NSP).</p>
              <p>  Said Mr Goh: "Sucess should not just belong only to those who get elected, but should also be credited to the whole team.</p>
              <p>  "Politicians largely want face.</p>
              <p>  "If they were to step down, you have to do it properly, pat their backs and recognise whatever contributions they made. Don't brush them aside."</p>
              <p>  Ms Hazel Poa took over as NSP's secretary-general after Mr Goh stepped down in June.</p>
              <p>  But others step down because they did not get key positions. (See report on facing page.)</p>
              <p>  Last week, Mr Sajeev Kamalasanan, 42, quit WP because of unhappiness over the selection of cadre members.</p>
              <p>  He had joined WP in 2006</p>
              <p>  What is it about being a cadre member that's so important?</p>
              <p>  For WP, insiders said, cadreship in the party is exclusive. While there is no quota on the numbers, less than 10 people are made cadres each year.</p>
              <p>  A central executive committee (CEC) member must nominate a member to become a cadre. The CEC then decides if they should approve the choice.</p>
              <p>  The cadre can vote on who makes up the CEC, and you have to be a cadre in order to be elected to the CEC.</p>
              <p>  The New Paper understands that WP has more than 60 cadres.</p>
              <p>  The party did not reply to queries by press time.</p>
              <p>  Parties tend to reward members who have stood as candidates by making them cadres.</p>
              <p>  Calling cadreship "an issue of fairness", former WP member Eric Tan, 56 said: "It's not about pitting other members against the candidates."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #c00000; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Recognising contributions</span></span></p>
              <p><br>Mr Tan, who joined WP in 2004, added: "Some backroom members have contributed a lot to the party. They are also important.</p>
              <p>  "All who have contributed and performed well should be made cadres."</p>
              <p>  And since opposition candidates undertake some personal risks as they put their jobs on the line when contesting the GE, "the party must recognise and appreciate them for courage and contributions", he said.</p>
              <p>  Said Mr Goh: "The rationale is that if we offer you as a candidate in the election,there should be no problem for you to be made a cadre.</p>
              <p>  "The selection process for a candidate should be stringent enough."</p>
              <p>  opposition watcher Wong Wee Nam said that the problem of managing the expectations of both the old-timers and newcomers in the party is something that every political party faces.</p>
              <p>  Said Dr Wong: "People who fought the battle must be recognised in whatever way.</p>
              <p>  "You can't just cast them aside when they are no longer of use."</p>
              <p>  But he conceded that it's more difficult for smaller political parties to manage the problem due to their limited resources.</p>
              <p>  However, even as others leave, the party has also attracted new members over the past year.</p>
              <p>  Party insiders said it's normal to see more volunteers join the ranks during the GE period.</p>
              <p>  A WP member said their numbers swell in the run-up to the GE and during the first two months after the voters go to the polls.</p>
              <p>  But numbers tend to taper off post-election. usually, less than half of the volunteers who sign up remain.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 18pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Gone since GE</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #0d0d0d; font-size: 16pt;  "></span></p>
              <p>SINCE the General Election last May, a number of opposition politicians have left their parties.</p>
              <p>  Workers' Party (WP) Eric Tan left last May after he was passed over for the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament position, which went to Mr Gerald Giam.</p>
              <p>  And Mr Mohamed Fazli Talip quit in February, citing disappointment with the cadre selection process.</p>
              <p>  It's the same at other parties.</p>
              <p>  Six members left the Singapore People's Party (SPP) in January.</p>
              <p>  Those who resigned included former civil servant Benjamin Pwee and industrial design manager Wilfred Leung, who had been tipped to take over leadership from SPP veteran Chiam See Tong.</p>
              <p>  They cited differences in opinion over the party's leadership style and direction.</p>
              <p>  Likewise at the Singapore Democratic Party.</p>
              <p>  Mr Jarrod Luo, the former honorary secretary of the youth wing, left in February.</p>
              <p>  Mr Luo had questioned the central executive committee's handling of issues and the delay of party affairs.</p>
