              <p>Lee Kuan Yew must survive until the next elections in 2016 and he must contest again in Tanjong Pagar GRC and opposition must go there and defeat him.</p>
              <p>I want Lee Kuan Yew to be rejected by the voters and taste defeat before he dies.</p>
              <p>And the opposition must dig out all of his filth like how he joined pro-british progressive party, connived with british to bring down Lim Chin Siong, worked for Japanese in WWII, hakka peranakan but still posed as a fake chinese, suppress chinese schools, destroy dialects etc</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew escaped the voter's wrath this time, he won't be so lucky the next time.</p>

              <p>ALJUNIED GRC residents are being treated as 'chips in a game of high stakes' Foreign Minister George Yeo said on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>At a press conference at the People's Action Party's (PAP) Paya Lebar branch, he used his most hard-hitting language in the campaign to date, saying that Workers' Party (WP) chief Low Thia Khiang was using the residents 'for much larger gain'.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo said: 'He is prepared to have instability, because instability will give him and WP the opportunity to achieve their ambitions. He has already abandoned the people who voted for him in Hougang. Now, he wants to use the people of Aljunied.'</p>
              <p>He and his teammates, Mrs Lim Hwee Hua, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office; Mr Zainul Abidin Rasheed, Senior Minister of State (Foreign Affairs); Madam Cynthia Phua, town council chairman, and Mr Ong Ye Kung, an assistant secretary-general of NTUC, are going head to head with the WP's A-team, comprising Mr Low, party chairman Sylvia Lim, top lawyer Chen Show Mao, family counsellor Muhamad Faisal Abdul Manap, and postgraduate law student Pritam Singh.</p>
