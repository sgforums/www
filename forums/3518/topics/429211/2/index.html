              <p>I'm pretty politically apathetic, I'd say. But what I really don't get are a few things:<br></p>
              <ul>
              <li>Why are there positions of SM and MM? If our dear MM's always pulling the strings, we won't need a PM innit?</li>
              <li>Politics are Politics but, seriously, why flame the opposition till this extent? I mean, LKY has a right to say that WP/NSP/SDP/RP or whatever has no track record but bloody hell, back in 1959, PAP didn't really have the track record too aye? People could've continued with LF if LKY didn't come out and thrashed everything they did. It's all about faith... if people believe that WP's for them, then they're probably right. We don't make choices without being informed first, right?</li>
              <li>PAP may be ROCK SOLID, but they aren't perfect. If other parties are offering solutions, why don't we try them? The education system here ain't perfect and PAP's the one behind it.</li>
              <li>"Don't rock the foundations", "Voters in Aljunied will regret it". Seriously man, he should stop it. The fact that he's STILL uncontested in Tanjong Pagar clearly outlines his desire to stay in government. Not cursing him here but if he stays around long enough for a switch in PM, would there be a SMM? Senior Minister Mentor position?</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li>The fact that he said "Muslims are the ones not integrating" already shows he doesn't come down to Earth. Not since he was (effectively) PM from 1965. That's why PAP Ministers always make comments that people get pissed about. Buses, MRTs sufficient during Rush Hour, much? Please.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Let Them Lose. Le tthe the people decide. Do not slam each other. Be gracious and humble. I always believe politics is dirty- and the latest GE is no exception. Look at how the PAP belittles the other opposition parties. See how they slam LTK over his bid over Aljunid GRC. I wish there was only more alternative voices. Then the can at least keep an eye on the ruling party. No party is infallible and I believe PAP is the same. You cannot be the ruling party always. I will vote for any oppposition party who will fight for the rights of PRs here. Mr Goh made a very big maistake when he tried to limit the flow if foreign talents into Singapore. PR's have built a generation of ministers in Singapore and they should all the treated equally well. SM Goh's remarks abt PRs is a dissapointment. He shoudl learn not to be too blunt, sinister and arrogant but humble himself to the level of the commoners.</p>

              <p>why do people expect oppositions to come up with solutions?</p>
              <p>its not their job.  they're there only to look for weaknesses in policies.  its the job of the current govt to find solutions.  thats why they are the govt!!!  people who vote for oppositions are doing so they can have a voice in the parliament, not voting them to run the country. </p>
