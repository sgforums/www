              <p>The results that they have delivered are using force to increase daily cost to improve the profit margin of ah kong company so that they can get their bonus.</p>
              <p>They have formed ghost committee to cook up statistic to justify the price increase and tell us to change more buses to waste more time to save some money.</p>

Where was your voice when mr LTK raised the issue of accountability in parliament following the prison break by mas selemat? why were you silent on those 2 milestone occasions? I am sorry sir, you have had your chance throughout these 5 years to speak out for us but you've only remained silent until now.

              <p>I see nothing wrong with voting out the PAP. PAP's stance towards singaporeans may soften. Health care will improve. Edu cost, medical cost may reduce. More GST offset package will come in the next 5 years. <br><br>Most imptly, less FT to compete for jobs, university places. FT already occupies 40% of singapore population. Anything more and we singaporeans will be outnumbered.<br><br>Time to vote for change. Vote for opposition.</p>

              <p>Looking at it, the PAP is now treating wong as a liability to their team.   People still have not forgotten about the Mas Selamat case.   He asked for it, he should have volunteered to resign then.   Now arrows at him.</p>

              <p>Let me say again:</p>
              <div id="post-body-10241537" class="body">
              <p>I AM STILL VERY ANGRY BY LEE KUAN YEW'S THREAT TO ALJUNEDIANS
                                      THEY THEY WOULD 'LIVE AND REPENT' IF THEY VOTE FOR WORKER'S
                                      PARTY.<br> <br> LKY is supposed to be an intelligent man and I cannot believe he
                                      can say something like that. He is no longer logical. He has
                                      definitely reached the stage of senility.<br> <br> Voters don't take to threats easily because MM has always used
                                      threats and intimidation. Less people are frightened by him now
                                      than in the last election. And his threat that property prices in
                                      Aljunied will fall is stupid. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In fact
                                      this time round, the PAP seems to be talking nonsense. 10 years
                                      ago, the opposition spoke a lot of nonsense. This time it is the
                                      PAP who is talking nonsense and the opposition are the ones making
                                      sense</span>.</p>
              <p>BTW HDB statistics have shown that property prices in Hougang
                                      SMC and Potong Pasir SMC have risen over the years. See
                                      http://www.bernardleong.com/2011/05/01/are-property-prices-affected-by-who-you-vote-for/</p>
              <p>Back to LKY 'live and repent' words.  How dare Lee Kuan Yew
                                      USE THE USUAL THREATS AND INTIMIDATION to threaten that the
                                      Aljunied Constituency under Worker's Party will regret it for 5
                                      years and they will finally repent? <span style="color: #ff0000;">What is this? REPENTANCE IS ONY TO GOD FOR YOUR
                                      SINS. You don't repent to PAP who are MERELY HUMANS. Does PAP think
                                      they are gods so much so that Aljunedians will fall to their feet
                                      and repent?<br></span><br> George Yeo's free badges given out at Serangoon Stadium distorted
                                      the phrase in the US dollar bill <span style="color: #ff0000;">'IN
                                      GOD WE TRUST'</span>. George Yeo's team changed the phrase into
                                      <span style="color: #ff0000;">'IN GEORGE WE TRUST'</span>.<br> <br> <strong>NOT ONLY ARE THE PAP now regarding themselves as gods,
                                      George Yeo is also assuming the position of a god.<br> <br> THIS IS OUTRIGHT BLASPHEMY.</strong></p>
