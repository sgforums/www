              <p>In 2006. it is almost like 60% PAP to 40% opposition. Many GRC and SMC are uncontested. With so much complaint nowadays, and almost all are contested. Hard to say. Hard to say.</p>

              <p>It might be possible. If you go the rallies and make friends, you might realise not all are opposition supporters. Some go there just to look see look see. But will still vote PAP. Just like buying car or insurance, look see look see first, after that make their choice.</p>

              <p>USUAL PAP TACTICS of THREATS and INTIMIDATION</p>
              <p>(when they do not have an agenda to counter)</p>
              <p>MM is very unfair. He said that Alugunied will regret for 5
                                      years for selecting an alternative party and they were eventually
                                      repent. Let me say that this is such a usual/normal/typical threat
                                      for PAP to opp voters but modern voters are now less intinmated by
                                      such meaningless threats. Isn't Hougang and Potong Pasir still
                                      thriving? Many are sick of 40 years of the SAME threats and
                                      initimidation from PAP. In 2006, Goh Chok Tong said that Hougang
                                      and Potong Pasir have become slums.  As far as I'm concered,
                                      they are thriving in their HEARTS and are estactic that they are special from other
                                      constituencies.</p>

              <p><br>Typical talk by a PAP supporter.    Let your golden gun be used for profit making which profit you should donate to your beloved PAP.   You know they love MONEY and who knows they may make you President.</p>

              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE : Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has urged the voters in Aljunied GRC to think carefully about their vote as it is an important one.<br><br>Speaking to the media after visiting two markets and foodstalls in the Kaki Bukit division of the GRC on Monday morning, he said he is fighting to win.<br><br>The People's Action Party's Aljunied GRC team have been working hard on the ground.<br><br>Giving them the added support on Monday was the party's Secretary General. When asked about Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew's views on the consequences for the PAP losing a GRC, PM Lee said: "I am running the election, MM is expressing his views.<br><br>"But my view is this is an important fight and that is why we put a strong team here and I came to support Ong Ye Kung and that's why I told George (Yeo), 'anything which you need to support you from HQ just shout and we will provide the backing to you. You have our full support, we are fighting to win.' <br><br>If we were not fighting to win, we would not put such a strong team down here and I would not have reinforced it with Ong Ye Kung and I would not be here going table to table encouraging people to vote for us."<br><br>Prime Minister Lee said voters in Aljunied GRC have been supporting the People's Action Party for successive elections since 1988 and the candidates for the coming election are well recognised. Mr Lee said he is confident that the team will do their best.<br><br>Like in the 2006 election, the PAP is being opposed by the Workers' Party in this division.<br><br>Mr Lee said that the competition this time round is fiercer.<br><br>He added: "The PAP has fielded a very good team to look after Aljunied GRC. George Yeo is an outstanding foreign minister and minister - not just in foreign affairs but with ideas and contributions in many different areas outside of his own ministry. <br><br>"Lim Hwee Hua also is a very capable person - very reliable, meticulous and strict in her standards. Zainul Abidin has been very successful in MFA also because he represents Singapore with confidence and ability and can hold our position and advance our cause internationally and I am hoping he will be our next Speaker. <br><br>"Then we have Cynthia Phua as town council chairman - everywhere, every place and even when she is not there, there is an iPhone app you can tell her what's happening and she will see through it and she is one of our best town council chairman. <br><br>"We have Ong Ye Kung - a very strong candidate from the labour movement who has great potential to go further and to be an office holder. He cares for people. He did a very good job in the Workforce Development Agency."<br><br>"So for Aljunied voters - you really want the best team to look after Aljunied, to look after you in the constituency and also to look after you nationally and in Parliament. <br><br>"Our team has got the ability, they have the plans, they have the track record and they have the determination and commitment to see it through.<br><br>"Our advice to voters is think carefully and vote in your own best interest. ... make sure that you will get a team that will take care of Aljunied, take care of your neighbourhood, your estate, your own block, your flats and make sure it preserves the value of your property as well as take care of you on a broader national stage in Parliament and in government. <br><br>"If you make that calculation, I think rationally it makes sense and the correct choice we think is the PAP."<br><br>To a question about the opposition's proposal that a minister who loses in a GRC become a "nominated minister", Mr Lee said it was a frivolous idea and there is no such arrangement. <br><br>The prime minister also dismissed as "ridiculous" a suggestion from the Workers' Party's candidate Pritam Singh that Mr George Yeo run for the Presidency. <br><br>Mr Lee said: "You don't expect me to answer that kind of a question, neither does Pritam Singh."<br><br>- CNA/</span></span></p>
