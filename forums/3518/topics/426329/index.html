              <p><span class="update">By Hetty Musfirah Abdul Khamid | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 27 March 2011 1934 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              National Solidarity Party (NSP) has named four of five candidates who 
              will stand in the five-member Tampines Group Representation Constituency
               (GRC) in the upcoming General Election.<br><br>Apart from the party's secretary-general Goh Meng Seng, the other three are first-time candidates.<br><br>The NSP introduced its three candidates bright and early in Tampines GRC.<br><br>One
               of them is 49 year-old Gilbert Goh, the president of Social Welfare 
              Organisation Transitioning.Org, which provides counselling for the 
              unemployed.<br><br>Mr Goh was a former Reform Party member. <br><br>Another candidate is 35-year-old Syafarin Sarif, a researcher in a multi-national company.<br><br>The NSP said Mr Syafarim has volunteering experience in Malay grassroots organisations such as 4PM.<br><br>NSP's
               third and youngest candidate to be fielded so far, is 27-year-old 
              Raymond Lim, an ex-IT consultant who was a member of the People's Action
               Party (PAP).<br><br>Mr Goh Meng Seng said his team is looking for a 
              straight fight against the PAP as no other opposition parties have 
              indicated interest to contest in Tampines GRC.<br><br>Mr Goh said: "It will be an uphill battle but I think our job is made easy because of (our early) campaign".<br><br>Meanwhile, at Punggol East Single Member Constituency (SMC), a three-cornered fight looks likely.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) said it is standing firm, even if the Workers' Party is keen to contest there.<br><br>SDA
               secretary-general Desmond Lim said: "Since they are so persistent, we 
              should not stop them because, maybe, they have better programmes for the
               people. <br><br>"However, I'm here with the programmes and at the end of the day, I will still say, let the people decide. <br><br>"So, I'm here with the experience plus a five-year development programme for the Punggol East residents. <br><br>"The
               whole objective of the programme is to enhance their property values, 
              improve their living environment and provide quality of life. <br><br>"I
               believe the voters will determine whether these candidate come here 
              just to offer themselves or they come with programmes. So I would say 
              that I welcome any three-cornered fight".<br><br>The SDA has introduced a
               community hotline vehicle that will go around the estate twice daily to
               encourage residents to give their feedback using this 24-hour hotline.<br><br>Mr Lim was speaking to reporters at a walkabout at Rivervale Plaza on Sunday morning. <br><br>Mr Lim also met PAP MP Michael Palmer.<br><br>Both greeted each other and shook hands.<br><br>Mr Palmer, who is widely tipped to stand in Punggol East, said a three-cornered fight will give residents more choices.<br><br>He
               said he is quietly confident about his chances and will continue to 
              work the ground. He said he welcomed the opposition presence but felt 
              residents are still unfamiliar with the opposition.<br><br>"I think we 
              welcome the competition, because I think it gives the residents a chance
               to decide on how we have been doing in the last five years, and 
              basically it will be a report card for us," Mr Palmer said. <br><br>"I 
              would want them to think carefully, consider among the choices that they
               have and they ultimately have to decide on who have served, and who 
              they think can serve them going forward, and who they think can engage 
              them. <br><br>"That is really the decision that they have to make."<br><br>Besides Punggol East SMC, Radin Mas SMC could also see a three-cornered or four-cornered fight. <br><br>The NSP and Reform Party are keen to contest there. SDA said the area is an open ground and that the competition is healthy.<br><br>The Reform Party was seen on Sunday morning at Telok Blangah Crescent, which is part of Radin Mas SMC.<br><br>Reform
               party's candidate for Radin Mas, Alec Tok, said: "I am continuing with 
              my plans to get to know the residents. But I hope that there will be 
              opportunities for the three of us (the three parties) to discuss this.<br><br>The NSP and the Singapore Democratic Party have also voiced interest to contest in Yuhua SMC.<br> <br>Meanwhile, MP Grace Fu, who is overseeing the ward, said she is not letting down her guard.<br><br>"They
               have not introduced the candidates; they have visited but I'm sure they
               will be able to provide good candidates," Ms Fu said. <br><br>"I will 
              be very happy to meet the candidates and won't take them lightly. I 
              think the calibre has improved and we should respect our opponents."<br><br>Ms Fu said it's a "logical assumption" that she will run for the seat.<br><br>Speaking
               to reporters at a community event on Sunday morning, Ms Fu said: 
              "Unless something really unexpected turns up, otherwise I should be 
              fielded as a candidate here, and I would like to be fielded as a 
              candidate here.<br><br>She added that campaigning preparations and logistics requirements are already under way.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>
