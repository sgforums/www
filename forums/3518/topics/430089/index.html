              Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has weighed in the results of the General Election, saying that the ruling People's Action Party will have to "adapt our policies."
              <p> </p>
              <p>In his first comments about the GE results, in which the ruling PAP was returned to power but with the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/tin-pei-ling-factor-weaker-performance-sm-goh-160414205.html"><span style="color: #005790;">lowest majority of votes since independence, </span></a>MM Lee said on Sunday, "I am sure the Prime Minister and his team will sit down carefully and analyse the reasons and adapt our policies."</p>
              <p>MM Lee added that he "couldn't say more, I am not the prime minister," reported <em>Channel NewsAsia.</em></p>
              <p>MM Lee's view echoed that of his eldest son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who has said the PAP will have to do some "soul searching" so that it could "improve ourselves and serve you better."</p>
              <p>Just last week, PM Lee also <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/pm-lee-didn-t-m-sorry-152850327.html"><span style="color: #005790;">distanced himself from father's style of governing</span></a> when he said, "We don't try to do it MM's style... We do it our way."</p>
              <p>Earlier this month, MM Lee's controversial comments that <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/aljunied-voters-will-regret-choosing-wp--mm-lee.html"><span style="color: #005790;">Aljunied voters would regret</span></a> and have <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/pap-loses-aljunied-voters-5-years-repent-mm-155825423.html"><span style="color: #005790;">"five years to repent"</span></a> if they voted for the Opposition had sparked heated discussion.</p>
              <p>But speaking at a community event in Tanjong Pagar GRC on Sunday, the 87-year-old elder statesman of Singapore said the country's younger generation "does not remember from whence we came."</p>
              <p>"That is to be expected. But I do and those amongst you who are older than 50 will remember," he said.</p>
              <p>On the loss of Foreign Minister George Yeo, who was defeated in the Aljunied polls, he said  Singapore has lost a vaulable minister.</p>
              <p>"Not just Foreign Minister, he was also Minister for Trade and Industry but that's the way the cards have fallen and we have to live with it," said MM Lee, whose Tanjong Pagar ward was the only constituency that was not contested.</p>
              <p>He added that Singapore will always need "good pilots" and capable leaders because the "Singapore flight" cannot be on "auto-pilot".</p>
              <p>"We will run into a storm, we will run into all kinds of emergencies and we must have good pilots on board and passengers who do not panic,"he said.</p>

              <p>After election reading what LHL said he will do to better the life of the citizens, really is not different from what he was doing and stating before election.   So what is the adapting the LKY is talking about?</p>

              <p>Maybe aljunied will not lost if mm lee keep quiet and not putting fear on the residents. Thus making the residents more resentment.</p>
              <p>Anyway, that is already history.</p>
              <p>What lhl and his team need to do is to sit and do some soul searching. What can they do and what policies pple dont like and what will make pple love pap again.</p>
              <p>Not an easy jobs but with your talented group of mps, I am sure there will be solution to any problems.</p>
              <p>Right now, pple still feel the hurt and suffer they are going thru right now especially with the cost of living and inflation rising and rsing, our salary , our saving spiral downwards....it is getting harder and harder for our daily life.</p>
              <p>If some of your internal ministers begin to pour cold water or increase any bills, they will make the fire ignite again and will make your pap collapse in the next ge.</p>

              <p>SINGAPORE: Better communications and dialogue with citizens - that's
              what the government will do more of, said Minister of Community
              Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan.<br> <br> He was speaking to the media at the sidelines of a graduation ceremony at Republic Polytechnic.<br> <br> <strong>Dr Balakrishnan said the election has been a good learning journey and
              at the strategic level, many PAP policies are right but their
              implementation and communication can be improved.</strong><br> <br> He gave a medical analogy to illustrate his point.<br> <br> He said: "It's not good enough just to do the right operation. We have
              to take informed consent, which means especially when you are going
              into an uncertain future, especially when there may be more than one
              option, and especially when there are trade offs, complications,
              implications and consequences from different choices of procedure.<br> <br> "It's very very important to talk to the patient, to explain these
              choices and the different trade offs and make sure the people of
              Singapore understand this and participate more actively in the
              decision-making process."<br> <br> At the same time, he said Singapore needs a strong government that can make tough decisions.<br> <br> As for George Yeo's defeat in Aljunied GRC, Dr Balakrishnan said it is
              not the fault of the GRC system and that the people have made their
              choice. However, he added it is a loss for Singapore.<br> <br> Dr Balakrishnan said: "George was one of the people who brought me into
              politics. I have served under him in MTI and he has been such an
              inspiration and a mentor, so it was very disappointing but politics
              isn't fair and politics is not predictable, so in a sense, these are
              the realities of politics that all have us have to learn to live with."<br> <br> He said Mr Yeo's defeat proved that no politician is "indispensable".<br> <br> "It's an affirmation of a lesson in humility for all politicians and
              never never take people for granted and never take people's feelings,
              hopes, fears and pain for granted - and beyond policies and
              implementation, we need to make sure people will trust us."<br> <br> As for the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, he said his team will find out why
              some 40 per cent voted against them and sort out any issues residents
              may have.<br> <br> At the graduation ceremony at Republic Polytechnic, Dr Balakrishnan
              told graduates of an uncertain future, with more challenges and
              opportunities ahead. He also told them that family was more important
              than money in their pursuit of happiness.</p>
