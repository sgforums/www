              <p>he never even lived one day as a true singaporean life.how to understand our hardship?? they only stand and talk,and make prices rise up.economy go up,prices go up,salary stays the same?? dont be funny ley.CPF,once you going to die then can bring out,either that or by the time you can take it out you also die already le.</p>
              <p>but  thanks to LKY singapore is where it is now.but its time for a change of hands,we also want see how opp can handle this country,opp also cannot talk to much cos they got no power like PAP.GE coming then all do walkabout.no GE,no walkabout,they come for special events for 1 or 2 hours and then go off</p>

              <p>Scenario1:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i once saw people on a sinking ship fulla holes in the middles of a huge ocean...fulla holes.no one wanted to repair it even though it was sinking....then some people founded some material to repair the holes on sinking ship.then some found a dinghyand floated it in the middle of the huge ocean.</p>
              <p>so some started patching up the ship with material and found it was difficult because they didnt have the right engneer or people with knowledge to fix it.then some decided to climb into the dinghy b4 the ship sinks.</p>
              <p>so the situation ended where one group of people climbed into a small dinghy in the middle of the ocean.the other stayed back on sinking ship scratching heads trying to know how to fix the holes on sinking ship with water gushing out of the many holes.</p>
              <p>results:people in dinghy were found 1 month later dried up like ikan bilis.</p>
              <p>sinking ship sank a bit at a time until there was no way get materials to fix the holes underwater.everyone died on it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>scenario 2:sinking ship had people and no one cared much n pretended ship would fix itself somehow...everyone died  as ship slowly sank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>captain of ship was dry n comfy all the while until he was on the roof top of his sinking ship a few metres from circling sharks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>solution:</p>
              <p>1)either u get experts to fix the holes on sinkin ship.</p>
              <p>2) build another brand new ship b4 old ship eventually sinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>I am not sure which I find more hilarious and mind-boggling - your ill-conceived logic or your brand of delusional grandeur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you're making a supposedly rational decision on the basis of "See which 1 appeal and see who understand what we suffer and support lor", are you not effectively a paradox of contradiction when you then suggest "Will you vote for Opposition if the guy was the guy who broke your leg, laugh at the broken legs and peed over it just being they are opposition?"</p>
              <p>Are you even rational enough to assess the merits of the respective policies in that regard? So you're suggesting it makes perfect and rational sense to oppose the fella who broke your leg purely because of a personal vendetta when you had, simultaneously, suggested assessing the candidates on the merits of what they represent?</p>
              <p>No wonder the fascist regime has survived for half a century with drones like you around... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>if i can vote, i will still vote for PAP. the reason being its not easy making nation-wide decisions. you will definitely offend some groups of people. ultimately you need to weigh carefully the benefits against the problems. And so far, i think they have made good decisions which benefit the majority as awhole. People might not see it now, however i think the results would show in the long term.</p>
              <p>Even though the opposition parties' ideas are fresh and new, i don think they will be able to implement them as it would require drastic changes to the lifes of the people. It may do good for each individual, but think in the shoes of the government, it can turn out detrimental for the country as a whole in terms of economy, security, housing etc.</p>

              <p>I am from West Coast GRC and live in a high income area within the GRC. I am very pleased with S. Iswaran because he worked hard on the ground and would have definitely voted for him. However, I am in the ward supposedly led by Lim Hng Kiang. I have not seen him at all for 5 years and I hear comments from residents that he is high handed and arrogant. I want to see him come here and campaign for my vote and tell me why I should vote for him. He has done nothing for me, my family and my estate as my MP! Therefore, voting for local municipal issues is out.</p>
              <p>I am unhappy about the excessive power that our executive branch has in this country. Ministers were paid more than 30 months bonus last year to help their salary reach more than 2m. This is totally unacceptable. Their bonuses should be pegged to the rise in median incomes of Singaporeans at not more than 20X. They help us earn more, the more bonus they can get, which I think is fair.</p>
              <p>I also cannot accept the GRC system because it dilutes my vote. I do not want to vote for a someone assigned to me from a team. The PAP sold me a GRC system to ensure minority representation but I now see on nomination day, a doctor becoming MP in Tanjong Pagar GRC doing nothing at the grassroots except the fact he is wearing a PAP badge on a white shirt. LTK might  not be in Parliament after working 20 years for Hougang residents because he is wearing another badge.</p>
              <p>I voted 14 years ago for PAP, i will change my vote now because I do not want the opposition to disappear and it is unfair for my children that they might not get to vote in the future because of what his father's generation did. </p>
