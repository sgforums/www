              <p>nice words! maintain neutral..go for the party which you trust! Make an informed choice. But if you choose the opposition, you will take a bigger risk as the results need not be necessarily bad. They offer good ideas but can they carry that out? Its one thing to say and one thing to do.</p>
              <p>As for PAP, i got nothing to say. they have showed their actions through the years of governance.</p>

              <p><br>when the first batch of PAP leaders and ministers started out they got any track records? NO! the future batch has the experiences as 2IC, backup and following their seniors to learn and make themselves present in the pblic eyes. hippos ever got any chance to do all this? NO! we must give them a chance to proof it. if they can't 5 yrs in time will tell if the hippos are only bullshitters only. when you know you going to die slowly, and there is a medcine that can cure you just not proven effective in studies and trial yet, will you take the 50/50 risk and go for it? i say take it and go for it!</p>

              do these folks here have a choice?spore now with PAP is like a sinking ship with many holes n problems.they need even more smarter people than current PAP folks.
              
              if spore were to go on its present course with PAP n its problems, spore will be sunk in future.
              
              the oppositions must come onto the ship!make sure they are able to fix the problems.then only can spore stay a float in the future and all problems solved.
              if oppositions come in and are weak....then everyone ends up in dinghy small n wet.

              <p>I'll vote for PAP when I'm of age to do so. What I'm seeing is opposition parties are trying to gain only voters from the low-income group. They are the ones who are concerned about this rising cost of living and lost of employment opportunities. I'm sorry, if you are low-skilled and lowly-paid, you will forever be trapped in that vicious cycle unless you go for skills upgrading. No company would be willing to pay more to hire locals because foreigners are cheaper and of the same quality. Accept that fact. The argument on rising prices of HDB flats is unfounded since the usual people complaining about high prices are young couples. Are you expecting to afford a house before 35? Are you insane? And the reason why not many HDB flats have been constructed in the last 10 years is because many new condos and BTO flats have sprung up. See where the demand has shifted to? To be honest, I don't see a problem with the rising inflation costs. Don't people have money they should have saved for rainy days to pay for that incremental increase? The worst thing is SDP's robin hood style of distributing wealth. Are we communist? I'm not going to pay $2000 every month in taxes to help some lazy ass who only has primary school education. I'm sorry, people should fend for themselves. Time waits for no man and so does society. </p>
              <p>I don't know just WTF is wrong with everyone? I have benefitted most of PAP's policies and I don't see why you haven't. Stop complaining about nothing and instead consider the many things the current government has done for you. Ask yourself, are you voting for the opposition because you trust that they will do a better job than PAP, or out of curiosity or just to get some random opposition party member into Parliament to sprout nonsense like killing the manufacturing industry that contributes around one quarter of our GDP?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>No, that's not what I meant. I'm not a rich snob or something! Don't get me wrong. I'm just questioning why the opposition parties are only focusing on bread-and-butter issues which aren't really there because no one is as poor as they'd imagine. No one will live on the streets or die or hunger. They are blowing up the issues! The issues are not with FTs replacing us in the workplace, it is why we are being replaced! The solution is not to stop them from coming, because they are cheap and efficient; the solution is how to make Singaporeans more employable. What the opposition parties are campaigning for is like what Malaysia is doing. A Malaysia for Malays. It's like Singapore only for Singaporeans. This doesn't work well because not every one has the capability and if we insist on hiring Singaporeans, some quality jobs will never be filled and the economy does not progress. I know people are concerned about real incomes not growing with GDP, but that's just a minority issue. Everything's been blown out of proportions to gun down PAP! How unfair.</p></div>
