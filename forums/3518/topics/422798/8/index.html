              <p>Malaysia and Singapore are symbiotic, one big brother , the other little brother. Like it or not, they will use Singapore like how Singapore will use them. At the end , both benefits. Both owe each other nothing.</p>

              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Singapore Pte Ltd – a letter<br></strong></span><span style="color: #000080;"><br><strong>Dearest PAP,</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>You have been running Singapore like a business, like a corporation, where you are the top management, where the people of Singapore are your employees and where all other institutions like education, health and transport, are your subsidiaries. No sir, this is not Singapore Pte Ltd, and we are not working for you.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Every policy that you have come up with has been made with economic growth in mind, i.e., to increase profitability for Singapore Pte Ltd, with retained earnings going into the national reserves.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Our education model has been structured to produce a quality workforce so that we can contribute efficiently and effectively to the nation’s economic growth. You dispense with the arts and concentrate on the commerce and sciences. You bring in plenty of foreigners into our schools so that we have to learn to work and study harder in the face of more competition. And you have succeeded. We now work one of the longest hours in the world with low wages.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>This has been done at the expense of social costs. As human beings, we have needs to get married, to start a family, to have kids. As human beings, we have needs for work-life balance, needs for social activities, and needs for communal living. The culture and environment you have so delicately created have come at the expense of those needs. We don’t have time to play football and therefore we suck at it. Ok, in fact we suck at everything that does not make money. And we definitely suck at making children.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>When you look at our low fertility rate, which you have so created because of the environment you have made, you try to improve it by offering stop-gap solutions in baby bonuses and tax reliefs. And in fact, the reasons you want the fertility rate to rise is to continue providing quality workers to work for Singapore Pte Ltd, put more money into the reserves through taxes, HDB profits, consumption, investment, i.e. increase Singapore’s GDP.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>And of course, the other viable solution is to attract talented foreigners to fill up this institutional void. This causes another set of problems, like whether locals find it harder to get jobs, and whether these diasporic communities will take up citizenship, or leave without further contributing to birth rates. Well, what the hell, talented foreigners are always good for Singapore Pte Ltd.</strong></span></em></p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">You privatize our transportation system. You couldn’t run such a basic necessity of a first-world country with the same efficient and effective fervor. So, running it as a private entity was the only viable way? You talk about health tourism. Is that what the health sector is about, making money from foreigners?</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Once in a while you declare dividends (grow and share) to appease us, so that we don’t remove you from your managerial posts.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Perhaps the most telling of Singapore Pte Ltd are the KPIs of top management. Our CEO, earning $3 million per annum, has his wages pegged to GDP growth, and so are the wages of the COOs, the CFOs, and the various department heads. Your main motivation is Singapore Pte Ltd’s profitability. And given that at least 60% of Singapore’s GDP is contributed by Temasek Holdings and GIC, it certainly makes sense to increase the coffers of the national reserves.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">It’s all about economic growth, economic growth, and economic growth.<br>However, countries are not just rated by economic growth. There are many other indicators that one may use to determine a country’s standing in the world, such as the purchasing power of the average citizen, the culture and ease of living, the efficiency of transportation, the range of quality education, the cleanliness of the streets, personal safety risks, and so on and so forth. </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">You have undoubtedly excelled in some areas, but certainly not in others.<br>You forget that Singapore is not a corporation, but a community of individual human beings who have feelings, who can discern between what is good for us and what is not, what is fair and unfair. We, who have basic needs to have a roof put over our heads, and food to eat, have willingly contributed to your goal of building up the nation’s economy not because we are your employees but because we want Singapore to prosper, to achieve the vision of a first-world nation in which its citizens do not have negative emotions of fear, fear to vote, fear to speak freely, fear of the struggles of putting food on our table.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">So, let me remind you, dearest PAP, that we have voted to put you where you are today. This makes us the shareholders. We are social beings, not economic assets. Together, we the citizens of Singapore own Singapore. It is us, the citizens, with our problems of rising costs of living, and not the profitability of the country that you have to care more about. And if you, dearest PAP, continue to run Singapore not as a nation of citizens but as a business, there will come a time when us, the shareholders, the real board of directors, vote you out and replace you with another management team.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;">Yours sincerely,</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000080;"><br>A shareholder of Singapore Pte Ltd</span> </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>

              <p><br>This is very much a regime on its last legs - in many ways, it does draw so many parallels with the final days of the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc.</p>
              <p>Is it very much rocket science that the half-baked policies enacted in recent years serves as nothing more than a desperate attempt at reviving failed policies?</p>
              <p>As you may very well know, in simple economic terms, your output is derived from the fundamentals of costs of capital and labour. While the costs of capital is very much beyond the control of these "extraordinary talents", they're enhancing your economic output by decreasing the cost of labour through the vast influx of cheap labour.</p>
              <p>Is this really sustainable? 20 years ago, the bulk of these foreigners were Malaysians who lived across the border. Right now, this lot have been displaced by even cheaper labour from China, Myanmmar, India, Vietnam and other parts of the emerging economies. Would this lot someday be displaced by Kenyans, Ethiopians and Eritreans? That seems the only solution the incompetent lot of fascists have got - as a matter of fact, even by fascist standards, they're an abject failure compared to what Hitler achieved in slightly over 6 years on a far grander scale.</p>
              <p>Obviously, in light of these circumstances, how then can the fascists then advocate minimum wage when the very principle of it is to weed out and stem out the enhanced economic output achieved through such artificially-induced means?</p>
              <p>It is truly amazing that, therefore, millions are paid to a bunch of spineless clowns who believe productivity could be enhanced when the very policies put in place are intended to undermine productivity and prostituting the workforce through artificially-induced wage suppression from the outset.</p>
              <p>Draw your own conclusions as to how such a flawed economic principle could flourish...</p>

              <p>To 4SG, you bring out a great point, which is people ultimately behave according to what their incentives are. </p>
              <p>If you tie my KPIs and bonuses to increasing GDP, I will do everything to increase GDP.  Never mind if it doesn't make sense.  If importing a corpse in a coffin plus enough cash in the coffin to Singapore allows me to increase GDP via provision of funeral services, I will do it, get a promotion plus a bonus.</p>
              <p>If my KPI is to increase reserves, I will think of ways to extract money from the people to increase reserves.  I will get promoted and a bonus.</p>
              <p>If my KPI is to increase the prices of flats, I will do my best to reduce supply and increase demand.  I will then get promoted and collect a nice cheque.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Which leaves us to the next point - conflict of interest.  Conflict of interest is when what is good for the owners / people, isn't necesarily good for the managers / government.</p>
              <p>For example, causing housing prices to increase quickly may be good for somebody's KPI and personal financial well being, but not so good for the people. </p>
              <p>What is the best way to prevent conflict of interest?  A good set of governance and robust checks and balances.   </p>

              <p>Then what different are we from the ones who keep voting these MIW in without even bothering to read the manifesto of the MIW?</p>

              <p>The question is "IF" you know them personally. Not everyone has the chance and if you don't have the chance to know them, then the factor has no value. Then we look at other factors such as manifestos etc. You tend to limit yourself to your own little corner because you think everyone didn't have the chance to work with some of these people.</p>
              <p>Similarly, those who didn't had the chance should try to engage them, read the manifestos and engage them to understand how they are trying to help Singapore. We help them help us. Whether your choice is the MIW or the Opposition.</p>

              <p>Anyway, you seemed so happy to be happy to defend a forum troll who just runs around changing from pro-Christian to anti-Christian overnight and then back again and then act as if you are a smart alec.</p>

              <p><br>When did I suggest giving the job to anyone in particular? I was merely addressing your simplistic fallacy of questioning if you'd actually vote for someone who "pissed on you" even though he may be in a better position to address your socio-economic concerns?</p>
              <p>So, are you therefore daft enough to suggest you're actually advocating throwing your support behind someone who actually doesn't better represent you, but has actually been less evil? So much for objectivity indeed!</p>
              <p>As mentioned previously, do you know any candidate "personally"? What do you think you're voting for? A playmate who shares your hobbies, interests? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> So how would you define knowing them personally?

              <p>You're indeed quite pathetic at making a reasonable case of an objective issue. So, really, besides realizing your utopian fantasy of getting cosy with your dream playmate, what's the primary criterion in your decision?</p>
              <p>I am pretty sure you don't mean engaging in the opposition's manifesto isn't a viable option for you for it is simply far-fetched for your simple mind to absorb these are nothing more than skullduggery utopian ideals that can never be realized.</p>
              <p>After all, aren't you gonna come back with more hogwash that the opposition hasn't done anything for you besides further rubber-stamping the fascists' policies (conveniently ignoring the fact that they've been powerless to do anything on virtue of them commanding 2.3% of seats in the Legislature)? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Oh, and I certainly take heart from the fact a "smart alec" like me is still lightyears more intelligent than naive idiots like you who advocate evaluating the merits of each candidate/party in its entirety, yet contradicting yourself by suggesting this rule wouldn't then apply to someone who "pissed on you" even if he ultimately better represents your political interests.
