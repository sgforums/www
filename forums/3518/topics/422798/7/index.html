              <p><br> I am not sure which I find more hilarious and mind-boggling - your
              ill-conceived logic or your brand of delusional grandeur. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>If you're making a supposedly rational decision on the basis of
              "See which 1 appeal and see who understand what we suffer and
              support lor", are you not effectively a paradox of contradiction
              when you then suggest "Will you vote for Opposition if the guy was
              the guy who broke your leg, laugh at the broken legs and peed over
              it just being they are opposition?"</p>
              <p>Are you even rational enough to assess the merits of the
              respective policies in that regard? So you're suggesting it makes
              perfect and rational sense to oppose the fella who broke your leg
              purely because of a personal vendetta when you had, simultaneously,
              suggested assessing the candidates on the merits of what they
              represent?</p>
              <p>No wonder the fascist regime has survived for half a century
              with drones like you around... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>I doubt you have it in you to understand the co-existence of two separate factors to decide whether the candidate is suitable for the position.</p>
              <p>Instead of trying to be rationale, you nitpick on two separate responses and consolidate into a single paradox where A means B is wrong and B means A is wrong.</p>
              <p>Personal vendetta aside, I believe the characteristic of the person, if any voter happen to know the person personally matters, should matter most in their choice. If the person can inflict suffering on purpose and still laugh over it, the person is likely to abuse his authority for the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>It amuses me that you do not have the capacity to easily see through these two separate responses and make a judgement. Instead, you are fixated at A means A and B means B and these two are mutually exclusive.</p>
              <p>It does reflect how thickheaded you are.</p>
              <p>Instead of criticising the highhandedness of PAP/opposition, shortsightness of PAP/opposition, or provide sufficient reasons that the manifestos from the PAP/opposition are for the good of the nation, you are just nitpicking and trying to troll in the forums.</p>

              <p>Personal vendetta aside, I believe the characteristic of the person, if any voter happen to know the person personally matters, should matter most in their choice.

              <p>Right, so I guess it's perfectly reasonable for you to vote for someone who doesn't represent your interest better at the socio-economic level in the legislature, but connects better with you in an affable manner socially. Are you therefore nothing more than a brainwashed drone espousing seemingly irreconcilable, yet contradicting schools of thought?</p>

              <p>remember what PM Lee said when he commented on the 66% popular vote for the PAP in 2006 elections?</p>
              <p>he said he dunno what the popular vote is going to be, seems like he is resigned to the fate that PAP popular vote may be less than 66% this time round.</p>
              <p>I surmised PAP will get 55-58% popular vote this time round, a minus of -8% -11% from the 2006 elections results.</p>
              <p>if it happened, PAP will surely take notice of the issue like foreigners as singaporeans are really unhappy about this issue. if the foreigner policy still continue until the next election, then sporeans have a chance to really cast their protest votes and PAP may get lower than the 50% popular vote, losing a few GRCS and single seats.</p>

              <p><br>With due respect, I find this argument a complete and utter load of crap.</p>
              <p>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (yes, North Korea to you and me) too offers no riots, no protests and has stringent laws to safeguard the regime's interests (as a matter of fact, it's even a safer place to live in).</p>
              <p>With its closed society, it is also probably the only country on the planet which is safe and immuned from the social ills and threats we see in today's globalized world (no organised crime, no threats of terrorism). With insufficient electricity to light up the capital after dark, it's even more environmentally friendly than many other countries on the planet!</p>
              <p>Would that therefore render it a more humane, pleasant environment to live in?</p>
              <p>Perhaps, more pertinently, are the Nordic countries (Finland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden) necessarily more rowdy or inefficient in running a country where protests, independent trade unions and ever-changing coalition governments are (as a matter of fact, have been since time immemorial) the order of the day?</p>
              <p>Incidentally, these are countries with a higher ranking for human development, press freedom, standards of living (yes, their GDP figures translate to benefit the vast majority of its resident population and is not artificially inflated through an ultra-liberal immigration policy), corruption and a functioning democracy to boot.</p>
              <p>Last I check, the combined earnings of those four heads of state do not even constitute 30% of the fascist head honcho's paycheck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>if i can vote, i will still vote for PAP. the reason being its not easy making nation-wide decisions. you will definitely offend some groups of people. ultimately you need to weigh carefully the benefits against the problems. And so far, i think they have made good decisions which benefit the majority as awhole. People might not see it now, however i think the results would show in the long term.</p>
              <p>Even though the opposition parties' ideas are fresh and new, i don think they will be able to implement them as it would require drastic changes to the lifes of the people. It may do good for each individual, but think in the shoes of the government, it can turn out detrimental for the country as a whole in terms of economy, security, housing etc.</p>

              <p>I think that there is something called consultancy ....and a new government would be very cautious with the voters who voted them in because they would want to stay in power. Even when PAP was new, they were assisted by international foreign talents - not the second class foreign talents who came to Singapore because they cannot make it on their home ground or on the international stage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I saw no improvement - I just see alot of 'little' Singapores popping out overseas. What improvement? Are the homeless on the streets an improvement? Giving foreigners your jobs an improvement?  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't know whether to laugh or cry when my ang moh friend was so excited about getting an executive job in Singapore. His university scores were half past six and his experience miniscule but because he is 'foreign', his pay packet was higher than most Singaporeans. Plus he can't get a proper job on his home ground.  That's your foreign talent. But of course, I congratulated him on his luck.</p>
