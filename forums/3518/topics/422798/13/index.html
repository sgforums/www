              <span class="comment right"><a class="comments-link" title="Comment on Looking back on five years" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/05/looking-back-on-five-years/#comments"></a></span></div>
              <p><strong>Andrew Loh /</strong></p>
              <p>In the last five years or so of being involved with The Online 
                      Citizen (TOC), I have had the opportunities to meet with and work with 
                      many people. It is privilege indeed. These are people in flesh and blood
                       who have taught me many things. Their situations, predicaments and 
                      plights have been instructive to me and those at TOC.</p>
              <p>As I ponder on the General Election, I recall these people whom I 
                      met, the stories they told me, the looks on their faces, in their eyes, 
                      the children whom they have. The helplessness they felt, the indignity 
                      they were subjected to. How the sense of abandonment was so acute for 
                      them.</p>
              <p>There are many policies and practices of the People’s Action Party 
                      Government which directly contribute to these. The Government is not 
                      unaware of these faulty and discriminatory policies and practices, yet 
                      it has either dismissed these out of hand or has plainly ignored them 
                      even when they were brought to their direct attention.</p>
              <p><img class="alignleft" title="TOC" src="http://i140.photobucket.com/albums/r19/theonlinecitizen/Pictures%20Posted%20on%20TOC/World/Lim%20Chu%20Kang%20Dorm/dorm580300.jpg" alt="" width="300">In
                       2009, I was attending a funeral at Lim Chu Kang cemetery. While the 
                      rituals were being performed, I noticed a row of buildings at the other 
                      end of the cemetery.  A curious sight. I made a mental note to return 
                      the next day and find out what those buildings were. As it turned out, 
                      they were dormitories for foreign workers. I was truly shocked when I 
                      found this out. My friend Damien and I wrote a report about this: <strong><a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2009/11/social-isolation-left-among-the-dead/">Social isolation – left among the dead</a></strong>.</p>
              <p>I wondered in that report: “While one can understand the shortage of 
                      space in Singapore to provide housing for these workers, one wonders if 
                      siting their living quarters in an isolated area of Singapore and within
                       a cemetery with little amenities and with the nearest bus stop some 5 
                      km away, is a “humane” solution…”</p>
              <p>While the Government insists that foreign workers are crucial to our 
                      progress, the treatment of these workers, who are paid as little as 
                      S$2.20 an hour for heavy menial work, is tantamount to the treatment of 
                      slaves. Indeed, some have called such treatment modern slavery. TOC has 
                      highlighted and reported numerous stories of the abuse of these foreign 
                      workers in Singapore, the policies which contribute to these and the 
                      lack of Government action to correct them.</p>
              <p>Foreign workers are but one community of people for which the 
                      Government has abandoned its responsibility. Another group is homeless 
                      Singaporeans. Spread out across the major parks in Singapore in 2009 and
                       2010, these tented communities were made up of people who got into such
                       predicament for various reasons. Some had lost their flats, or had run 
                      out of money, or lost their jobs. They had children with them. Some had 
                      been homeless for months, living in the only area they had, our public 
                      parks. Yet, they too faced problems with the authorities for doing so. 
                      They were shouted at, told to pack up and leave. Their appeals for 
                      rental flats were denied until we broke the story. Yet, not all of them 
                      were given these flats.</p>
              <p>When we followed up on the issue of the availability of such flats, 
                      we found that there were indeed flats available. But because of HDB’s 
                      stringent qualification criterias, many of these did not qualify. Where 
                      else could they go? Instead, these available flats were rented out to 
                      foreigners.</p>
              <p>What about the poor, old and sick, those on Public Assistance? PAP MP
                       Dr Lily Neo had to fight tooth and nail for just a few dollars more 
                      from the Minister for Community, Youth and Sports (MCYS) in Parliament. 
                      Even so, she was given a terse and insensitive response by the minister.
                       From S$260 for each recipient, it is now S$400 – after five years of Dr
                       Neo’s request for more.</p>
              <p>And then there are the disabled. Many of them are in lowly-paid jobs.
                       The community has been campaigning for 12 years now for the government 
                      to provide subsidies for their public transport needs. They even went to
                       Speakers’ Corner to do this. And each time, all these years, the 
                      government has flatly refused.</p>
              <p>Foreign domestic maids are at the mercy of their employers. There is 
                      no provision in law, for example, to give them the right to even a day 
                      off per month. Non-governmental groups have been campaigning for this to
                       no avail. How is it that in a supposedly first-world country, a day off
                       in a month is something which is evidently considered anathema?</p>
              <p>You might say that these issues do not concern most Singaporeans. You
                       would be right if our society were based on starkly demarcated lines of
                       black and white. But it is not. What happens to another community 
                      affects all of us. Giving more allowances to the elderly and sick and 
                      poor educates our younger generation about what it means to care. Giving
                       maids a day off is, if you need a reason, simply the humane thing to 
                      do. For which of us Singaporeans would want to be on employers’ beck and
                       call virtually 24-hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year – and be 
                      paid peanuts for it? Giving homeless Singaporeans priority in housing is
                       also the humane thing to do, especially when such families consist of 
                      children.</p>
              <p>We may be proud to call ourselves “first world” but it is but only a 
                      superficial meaningless title if we do not also care for the less 
                      fortunate in substantial ways.</p>
              <p>PAP leaders have, in the last few days, admitted shortcomings and 
                      that they are not perfect. The truth is that no one expects them to be. 
                      What one expects instead is that they are open to hearing views which 
                      they would not normally hear – views from well-meaning individuals and 
                      groups which dedicate time and effort in raising these issues.</p>
              <p>Issues such as the discriminatory government policies such as HDB 
                      ethnic quotas for minority races, admissions to tertiary institutions 
                      for locals, employment policies for those above 40 and the elderly 
                      workers, practices such as the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) 
                      system which has been perverted to serve the selfish agenda of an 
                      incumbent political party, breaking up communities at each general 
                      election and dividing Singaporeans with its threats and carrots approach
                       in trying to win votes.</p>
              <p><img class="alignright" title="TOC" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_10071-1024x764.jpg" alt="" width="300"><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Our
                       politics have descended to the level of gutter politics. Petty, 
                      personal and prejudicial. A distinct example of this is the fact that 
                      both our elected opposition Members of Parliament – Mr Chiam See Tong 
                      and Mr Low Thia Khiang – have had and is still having to conduct their 
                      Meet-The-People sessions with nothing more than makeshift offices – just
                       a table and some chairs – at the void deck. Where is the respect which a
                       government should accord to elected representatives of the people?</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Yet, the PAP government garlands itself with laurels, calling it and 
                      its ministers “unique”, “special” and “extraordinary” – when justifying 
                      its multi-million salaries for each of its ministers. It has not 
                      subjected itself to scrutiny, transparency or accountability.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Instead, it has ever so flagrantly and blatantly turned the spotlight
                       on Singaporeans – and derided them, labeling them with derogatory 
                      terms. “Mollycoddled”. “The spurs are not stuck to their hides”. 
                      “Champion grumblers”. “Complacent”. “Not productive”. “Lesser mortals”. 
                      “Whiners”. Even our less fortunate were not spared such derision. “How 
                      much do you want? Do you want to have three meals in a hawker centre, a 
                      foodcourt, or a restaurant?” one minister said in the august chambers of
                       Parliament, when asked to provide more for them.</strong></p>
              <p>Catherine Lim’s 1994 article, The Great Affective Divide, rings so true at this time.</p>
              <p>Government policies matter. They matter because they affect real 
                      people. They affect families, mothers, fathers, children. And 
                      policy-makers must not be entrenched in the ivory tower, oblivious to 
                      the cries of the common man and woman. To be so is to shield oneself 
                      from the truth of what ordinary Singaporeans face and are going through 
                      on a daily basis.</p>
              <p>In these last five years, no other issue has made me more determined 
                      to vote for an alternative than the issue of the mandatory death 
                      penalty. Some may and will say that this issue does not affect most 
                      Singaporeans and therefore it is not something which we should care 
                      about. But such thinking belies the fact that how a government 
                      implements a law which takes away a life represents how much a 
                      government value human life. And by extension, how government policies 
                      are formulated and based.</p>
              <p>If a government is cavalier and callous about how it snuffs out human
                       life, then it is a government which needs to be checked, and if it 
                      continues to do so, removed.</p>
              <p><a rel="attachment wp-att-27125" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/10/op-ed-by-uk-minister-of-state-jeremy-browne/mdp-5/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-27125" title="MDP" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/MDP1.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250"></a>The
                       mandatory death penalty is a terribly flawed practice. The provisions 
                      in the Misuse of Drugs Act are against best practices adopted by 
                      countries around the world. It firmly and unreasonably places the burden
                       of proof on the accused who many a time are young drug mules who come 
                      from disenfranchised, poor, and illiterate backgrounds.</p>
              <p>The PAP government, through its ministers, have stoutly defended this
                       practice – of putting to death those as young as 18 – without so much 
                      as a detailed explanation of the facts, or provided statistics or 
                      studies to back up its stance.</p>
              <p>As a result, many have been hung.</p>
              <p>With a system that is viewed as flawed, or at least which needs a 
                      serious re-look, can e be sure that no one has ever been hung wrongly? 
                      Why is the government so afraid of being open and provide information 
                      about such executions? Or commission independent studies to ascertain 
                      the effectiveness of the mandatory death penalty? Why does the 
                      government feel that our esteemed judges, in the High Court and the 
                      Supreme Court, unfit, unable and untrustworthy to be able to mete out 
                      alternative sentences?</p>
              <p>The turning of the deaf ear to the views from lawyers, the Law 
                      Society, Parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations, international
                       rights groups, activists and ordinary Singaporeans, shows that this is a
                       government which indeed, as one minister put it, “deaf to all 
                      criticisms”. And I might add, perhaps suggestions as well.</p>
              <p>The Prime Minister has apologized, on behalf of his government, for 
                      mistakes made. It is all well and good, although the timing of his 
                      apology leaves questions about why it is only offered now, days before 
                      Singaporeans go to the poll. Is the Prime Minister sincere? Are all his 
                      ministers truly behind the apology?</p>
              <p>The PAP will most probably be returned as the government after the 
                      polls close on Saturday night. What it does in the next five years will 
                      determine if the PM’s apology is genuine, or just a cheap desperate 
                      stunt to win votes.</p>
              <p>But we cannot wait another five years to see if his apology is 
                      genuine. For in those five years, the people mentioned in this article –
                       the poor, elderly, children, maids, foreign workers, those on death row
                       – do not have five years. Their needs are immediate.</p>

              <p>19-years old when he was caught for drug trafficking in 2007, he has 
                      been sitting on death row for close to four years now. In that time, he 
                      has repented, availed himself to studies, and has embraced the teachings
                       of Buddhism. He has counseled his fellow inmates on death row, those 
                      who were sent to the chamber to be hanged. Each time one is dragged out 
                      from his cell, each one of them that he tried to console, is a terribly 
                      tortured reminder that he would be next at any moment.</p>
              <p><strong>PM Lee asks for another five years to correct the mistakes his ministers and government has made.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Who then would give the homeless, the poor, the sick, the elderly, 
                      the disabled, the domestic maids, the abused and exploited, lowly-paid 
                      foreign workers a second chance or afford them basic human decency?</strong></p>
              <p>Who indeed will give Yong Vui Kong a second chance?</p>
              <p><strong>To my mind, the only and best way to keep an all-powerful, 
                      all-controlling government from either running amok with unbridled 
                      power, or to segue back into complacency and arrogance, is to have 
                      another group of people in Parliament to truly keep it awake and on its 
                      toes.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Indeed, a first world government in a first world country requires also a first world Parliament.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And no single party can ever claim to be first world-anything all by itself, no matter how much it claims it can.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>This is an opportunity for Singaporeans to claim back their power which has been lost in helplessness these last five years.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So when you vote on Saturday, do think of those who are struggling and suffering in silence.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Your vote will speak on their behalf.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And as Singaporeans, this is what we must always remember – to care 
                      for one another, especially those whom you may not see in your midst, 
                      but whose pains are nonetheless real.</strong></p>

              <h2 class="art-PostHeader"><a title="Permanent Link to Singaporeans will pay a dear price after 7 May 2011" rel="bookmark" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/05/06/singaporeans-will-pay-a-dear-price-after-7-may-2011/">Singaporeans will pay a dear price after 7 May 2011</a></h2>
              <p>Singaporeans will pay a dear price for able to deny the PAP its 
              traditional two-thirds majority in parliament on 7 May which will enable
               the opposition to serve as an effective check on its power.</p>
              <p>PAP 
              leaders pay lip service only to democracy. Elections are merely a once 
              in five year ‘wayang’ for them to secure another ‘mandate’ from 
              Singaporeans to entrench itself in power and perpetuate its political 
              hegemony forever.</p>
              <p>The PAP is never interested in sharing power 
              with other alternative parties. To PAP leaders, they have the only ones 
              who have the moral authority, mandate and capability to govern 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>In an interview with PETIR in 1984, then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew said ashamedly:</p>
              <p><strong>“I made no apologies that the PAP is the Singapore government and the Singapore government is the PAP.”</strong></p>
              <p>After
               fifty years of PAP rule, the line between the party and the government 
              has become so blurred that the state media is still addressing the PAP 
              candidates in their ministerial posts!</p>
              <p>The PAP believes that being
               a small, vulnerable island state, Singapore needs a single dominant 
              ruling party to govern Singapore – a ’strong and effective’ government 
              which was espoused by Lee Hsien Loong and Shanmugam in the last few 
              months.</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of the 2006 election, Lee Kuan Yew said:</p>
              <p><strong>“Please do not assume that you can change governments. Young people don’t understand this.”</strong></p>
              <p>The
               PAP has a very strong instinct of self-preservation and will do 
              anything and everything to retain its power simply because there is an 
              ingrained mindset among PAP leaders that Singapore will collapse without
               the PAP.</p>
              <p>In 1962, the PAP government unleashed Operation 
              Coldstore to arrest hundreds of leaders and members of the Barisan 
              Sosialist which was split from the PAP only a year earlier.</p>
              <p>In 
              1987, Operation Spectrum was launched to detain 22 social activists, 
              some of whom are members of the Workers’ Party going to participate in 
              the election the following year.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew even threatened to call in the army if the PAP is voted out of office at the ballot box:</p>
              <p><strong>“Without
               the elected president and if there is a freak result, within two or 
              three years, the army would have to come in and stop it”</strong></p>
              <p>As
               history has shown, the PAP has no qualms using the powers conferred to 
              it by its incumbency to change the rules as and when it likes in order 
              to perpetuate its political hegemony forever and to keep the opposition 
              weak.</p>
              <p>After Chiam See Tong and Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam won two 
              seats in the 1984 election, the PAP introduced the GRC system in 1988 to
               prevent more seats from falling to the opposition.</p>
              <p>In response to
               the slide in percentage of votes to 61 percent in the 1991 general 
              election, the PAP uses estate upgrading as a carrot to entice 
              Singaporeans to vote for them.</p>
              <p>And after the 2006 election, the 
              PAP again introduce new election laws to curb the influence of the 
              internet by designating a ‘Cooling off’ day before polling day.</p>
              <p>Due
               to the prevailing unhappiness on the ground against the PAP’s policies,
               its percentage of votes is likely to decrease in the coming polls.</p>
              <p>The
               problem is, the decrease in support does not translate into more seats 
              of the opposition. The PAP can still win all the 82 contested seats with
               only 55 percent of the votes.</p>
              <p><strong>It is highly unlikely that the 
              opposition will win the minimal 30 seats required to deny the PAP its 
              two-thirds majority in parliament and only then can it check on the PAP 
              effectively because all bills and constitution amendments will need 
              approval from more than two-thirds of parliament in order to pass.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>If
               the PAP gets a real scare on 7 May and still retains its two-thirds 
              majority, it will SURELY do whatever it takes to prevent itself from 
              being booted out from office in the subsequent elections.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>Below are some of the things it can do:</strong></p>
              <p><strong>1.
               Rampant gerry-mandering by removing GRCs with close contests from the 
              electoral map altogether to dilute bastions of opposition support from 
              arising like Eunos and Cheng San GRCs.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. Changing the election 
              laws like increasing the election deposit to $20,000, limiting the sizes
               of rallies, lengthening the ‘Cooling off’ period to three days etc.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3.
               Opening the floodgates to more immigrants and fast converting them into
               new citizens. As a last resort, PRs are granted the right to vote.</strong></p>
              <p>The
               above scenario is a terrifying thought, but it will happen because the 
              PAP doesn’t care what Singaporeans think so long it can preserve its own
               interests and power and there is nothing Singaporeans can do about it 
              because our civil rights as citizens have long been taken away by a 
              series of repressive laws introduced over the years.</p>
              <p>90,000 
              grateful new citizens will be voting on 7 May with another 900,000 more 
              foreign workers coming as promised by PAP de facto leader Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Foreigners
               now make up 43 percent of Singapore’s population. Of the remaining 57 
              percent who are citizens, an increasing number are born overseas. The 
              number of native Singaporeans who are born and bred here probablty 
              constitute less than half the population and is likely to decline in the
               next few years as a result of our low birth rate.</p>
              <p>The radical 
              change in demographics over the last few years have already diluted our 
              voices and votes. We will become a minority in five years’ time after 
              which the PAP can count on the new citizens to keep itself in power 
              forever.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew has already outlined his vision for 
              Singapore to become a cosmopolitan city which is open to immigrants from
               all over the world. What he didn’t say is that Singapore will become a 
              PAP’s city forever under its control and where its citizens are only 
              allowed to make some ‘noise’ every five year, but ultimately has no say 
              in the running of the city.</p>
              <p>Mr George Yeo promised in his last 
              rally that he will transform the PAP after failing to do anything in his
               twenty years in office. We do not have another 5 years to gamble away.</p>
              <p><strong>This
               is our LAST CHANCE to reclaim the ownership of our beloved country. It 
              is NOW or NEVER. The stakes have never been higher than before. Lose it 
              and we will have no second chance to repent.</strong></p>

              29,000 of the GRC's constituents have been cut into AMK's pie.
              Thanks to the elections dept. And these 29,000 could have voted for
              WP in 2006.</p>
              <p>The large crowds at their rallies could have come from all over

              <p>And sgporeans being kiasee, may just swing towards PAP at the

              <p>tml voting...I'm still looking around online..and have a final vote tml..</p>
              <p>PAP leh ~ Yea , cos they already part of the goverment liao. Protect the singapore and so on. But the % of of raising the $ is getting high,yet no increase of salary for those civil servant who is no where top nor low.</p>
              <p>Seeing pple who has super high post in goverment sector doing nothing but take huge amount of $ home is abit piss lor. And what about those middle class pple, who also neither rich or poor. Like the maid issue ba..subsidise for married couple to take of of elderly.. 0.0 But single how. Pay full amount because you r not married 0.0 .</p>
              <p>and some other stuff..my sis say. LOL. Cos my sister is like supporting herself so hard yet nothing much helps her. She is single btw. So i assume alot of single too having issue for not getting enough help si bo?</p>
              <p>WP leh - Yea, They talk alot on how to make things well for us . Sound ok lo. But, if they win ~ do they have enough support to maintain for us for 5 years  so that PAP can eat their words?</p>
              <p>Aiya...sianz..PAP, WP..WP..PAP.</p>
