              <p>I being TS was sincere about having reasons. Voting for just PAP because they are PAP or voting for opposition because they are opposition doesnt sound like a reason.</p>
              <p>It sound like a child. I do it cause I liked it. Why? I LIKE IT. Why? I LIKE IT.</p>

              <p>You only vote once in 5 years and if you vote because you're childish enough to cast in due to "dislike" rather than review what is beneficial in the future then any information is more than important.</p>
              <p>Having quality opposition and quality government is what that can move Singapore onwards.</p>
              <p>There are so many mistakes in the past, but it doesn't help to reinforce mistakes. We must repair the damage and make brave decisions.</p>

              <p>Having quality opposition and quality government is what that can move Singapore onwards.</p>
