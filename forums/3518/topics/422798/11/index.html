              <p>No, that's not what I meant. I'm not a rich snob or something!
                  Don't get me wrong. I'm just questioning why the opposition parties
                  are only focusing on bread-and-butter issues which aren't really
                  there because no one is as poor as they'd imagine. No one will live
                  on the streets or die or hunger. They are blowing up the issues!
                  The issues are not with FTs replacing us in the workplace, it is
                  why we are being replaced! The solution is not to stop them from
                  coming, because they are cheap and efficient; the solution is how
                  to make Singaporeans more employable. What the opposition parties
                  are campaigning for is like what Malaysia is doing. A Malaysia for
                  Malays. It's like Singapore only for Singaporeans. This doesn't
                  work well because not every one has the capability and if we insist
                  on hiring Singaporeans, some quality jobs will never be filled and
                  the economy does not progress. I know people are concerned about
                  real incomes not growing with GDP, but that's just a minority
                  issue. Everything's been blown out of proportions to gun down PAP!
                  How unfair.</p>

              <p>Yes. One of the foreign talent ang moh from Australia who I know and congratulated him on his luck can't find a job in Australia while I can secure one in his country. My sister's income in Singapore put her at a low percentile. She wanted to go back to Singapore because she loves it there.  Like that foreign talent, her type of qualification is average but she had MORE experience. She doesn't get the pay packet of the FT guy ...my only guess is that she doesn't hold a foreign passport.</p>
              <p>Of course, elite can always say 'get out of my elite uncaring face' to the common person. A person who never suffered will not understand what it is like to be at the bottom rung of society. Very much like how Marie Antoinette who was surprised at hunger in France and said 'let them eat cake' .....in the end, she got guillotined.</p>

              <p>I'll vote for PAP when I'm of age to do so. What I'm seeing is
              opposition parties are trying to gain only voters from the
              low-income group. They are the ones who are concerned about this
              rising cost of living and lost of employment opportunities. I'm
              sorry, if you are low-skilled and lowly-paid, you will forever be
              trapped in that vicious cycle unless you go for skills upgrading.
              No company would be willing to pay more to hire locals because
              foreigners are cheaper and of the same quality. Accept that fact.
              The argument on rising prices of HDB flats is unfounded since the
              usual people complaining about high prices are young couples. Are
              you expecting to afford a house before 35? Are you insane? And the
              reason why not many HDB flats have been constructed in the last 10
              years is because many new condos and BTO flats have sprung up. See
              where the demand has shifted to? To be honest, I don't see a
              problem with the rising inflation costs. Don't people have money
              they should have saved for rainy days to pay for that incremental
              increase? The worst thing is SDP's robin hood style of distributing
              wealth. Are we communist? I'm not going to pay $2000 every month in
              taxes to help some lazy ass who only has primary school education.
              I'm sorry, people should fend for themselves. Time waits for no man
              and so does society. </p>
              <p>I don't know just WTF is wrong with everyone? I have benefitted
              most of PAP's policies and I don't see why you haven't. Stop
              complaining about nothing and instead consider the many things the
              current government has done for you. Ask yourself, are you voting
              for the opposition because you trust that they will do a better job
              than PAP, or out of curiosity or just to get some random opposition
              party member into Parliament to sprout nonsense like killing the
              manufacturing industry that contributes around one quarter of our
              GDP?</p>

              <p>The rich Singaporean is the worse.</p>
              <p>You pay GST 7% for anything you buy, more income tax, COE, road tax, property tax, ERP, company tax and more.Seriously, how much money do you pay to the governement per annum.</p>
              <p>Then...</p>
              <p>Buy a BMW and ferrari, but can get stucked on the road, crawl like snail everyday. Can they just build another PIE?</p>
              <p>No bus to the private housing estate and have walk kilometres to the nearest busstop or mrt.</p>
              <p>Do they upgrade the private housing estate with upgrading program?</p>
              <p>Thomson road and Bukit Timah is still flooded.</p>
              <p>Buy a car with high COE, but no place to park at the house.</p>
              <p>Share &amp; grow?</p>
              <p>Actually the goverment take them most of the rich but give back less. I salute the rich for providing for us poor people.</p>

I should be the one pissed about being taxed that much but the opposition still wants me to pay more?!

              <p>The demographics of Singapore has changed radically in the last few years due to the PAP’s open-door policy to immigration. All of sudden, the floodgates were flung opened to foreigners from all over the world without any discrimination or quality control, <strong>making some Singaporeans feel like strangers in their own country</strong>.</p>
              <p>The mainstream media is full of reports of construction workers, cleaners, masseurs, nursery teachers and even freelance prostitutes being given Singapore PR and citizenship.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong used the examples of a PRC bus driver and chambermaid in his recent National Day Rally to highlight the “contributions” of these newcomers.</p>
              <p>A Wall Street Journal editorial in January reported that the relentless influx of foreigners has <strong>depressed the wages of ordinary Singaporeans</strong>, <strong>increased the cost of living and led to an overall decline in the standard of living.</strong></p>
              <p>Foreigners provide a ready source of cheap labor which reduce labor costs thereby inflating GDP growth artificially in the process. A certain percentage of the PAP ministers’ multi-million dollar salary package is pegged to GDP growth – the higher the figures, the more money they bring home.</p>
              <p>They also provide more votes for the PAP regime as immigrants tend to vote for the incumbent, a fact not lost about the PAP regime as it has been actively recruiting PRs and new citizens into its Youth Wing and grassroots organizations.</p>
              <p>The next general election may be the last window of opportunity for native Singaporeans to reclaim ownership of their country after which they will surely be overwhelmed by the hordes of foreigners the PAP regime is mass importing to replace them.</p>
