              <p>Hi Edd1,</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply, but judging from the "ground"  most singaporeans seem fed-up. It's not abt managing well. Look at Hougang and Potong Pasir, this areas have also been managed well. Look at what has happened after last election 2006.</p>
              <p>1) Floodgates opened up, foreigners swarmed in, prices of everything went up.Prices of HDB went up overnight.</p>
              <p>2) Lehman Bros crisis, town councils ventured in and got "burnt".</p>
              <p>3) Inflation has gone up tremendously, wages have not, y? GDP output was more important,thus there is a big gap between inflation and wages.</p>
              <p>4) Foreign Talent - Government has recently tightened the influx, cos they admitted, that PRs are given out so easily. Many have attributed this as a government oversight.</p>
              <p>So you decide, if the world class salaries paid justify the frustrations experienced by Singaporeans,.</p>
