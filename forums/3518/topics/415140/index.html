              <div class="entry-meta"><span class="meta-prep meta-prep-author">Posted on</span> <a title="7:17 am" rel="bookmark" href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/government-curtails-question-time/"><span class="entry-date">November 10, 2010</span></a> <span class="meta-sep">by</span> <span class="author vcard"><a class="url fn n" title="View all posts by votingrp" href="http://votingrp.wordpress.com/author/votingrp/">votingrp</a></span></div>
              <p>In
               a sign of just how disingenuous the government is when it says it says 
              it wants to answer the public’s desire for more non-government voices in
               Parliament, the Standing Order Committee of Parliament has proposed 
              that the time given to MPs to make their speeches or ask questions is to
               be cut from 30 minutes to 20 (see link below):</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_601460.html">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_601460.html</a></p>
              <p>Parliament meets infrequently enough as it is. Not content with 
              perfecting a system where more than half the electorate is deprived of 
              the chance to vote and 34% of those able to vote largely unrepresented 
              in Parliament, the PAP want to ensure that there is less scrutiny and 
              accountability of their Ministers and policies by limiting Question 
              Time. Despite introducing innovations to a deeply flawed and 
              undemocratic system to allow for more NCMPs, who are unable to vote on 
              any issue of substance, the government appears to want to severely 
              curtail their one useful function, which is to be able to ask questions 
              and compel Ministers to answer.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party urges Singaporeans not to be taken in by the charade
               of the NCMP scheme and to remember that without electing sufficient 
              numbers of RP MPs there is no chance of seeing any changes to the 
              disastrous PAP policies of the last ten years.</p>
              <p>We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of our five immediate pledges if we are elected to government:</p>
              <p>1. Implement a stricter immigration and foreign worker policy<br> 2. Introduce a minimum wage<br> 3. Ensure housing affordability and quality<br> 4. Reform CPF and return control of savings decisions to individuals<br> 5. Give Singaporeans a direct stake in Temasek and GIC</p>
              <p>The remaining 19 other policy pledges can be found at <a href="http://www.votingrp.wordpress.com/">www.votingrp.wordpress.com</a>, including proposals to improve town council management.</p>
              <p>Vote RP! It’s time to take your country back!</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>National Service</strong></span></p>
              <p>The only concrete initiative was to reward NS men with a grant of $9,000. Few details were provided other than to say that it could be used to pay for further education (which the Reform Party would make free for NS men) and for housing (where sky-high prices are the result of deliberate government policy in restricting the supply of land and growing the population at an unsustainable rate).</p>
              <p><strong>The Reform Party believes that $9,000 in a restricted account does not come close to reflecting the economic cost Singaporean NS men face with two years of lost earnings. Furthermore, the PM said that future education fees will have to rise, presumably to cover this additional expense. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>The Reform Party continues to propose, in this regard:</strong></p>
              <ul>
              <li><strong>Lower taxes for NS men</strong> </li>
              <li><strong>Obligation on  foreign students on Singapore scholarships wishing to work here  to serve NS</strong> </li>
              <li><strong>Cutting the NS period down to a year at maximum within 5 years</strong> </li>
              <li><strong>A target for zero death in training</strong> </li>
              </ul>
              <p> </p>
              <p>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am sure parents with boys will love to vote for you if your point as above can be achieve. That is reduction to 1 yr of ns. No parents would want to see their boys serve 2 yr ns. They want them to come out quickly and work to compete in the soceity.</p>

              <p>For people who are still unsure, please vote wisely so that this 
              country can be saved, cast off all cynicism, fear and apathy to save our
               homeland. Please be reminded that if people think that politics is only
               for the elites, that's only partly true.</p>
              <p>If we do not elect 
              people who can represent us and expect the PAPist to do what they like 
              then good luck to everyone. Today their policies might suits you, 
              tomorrow, their policies might destroy you, do you have any recourse or 
              redress means?</p>
              <p>What we the citizens can do is to elect people to 
              navigate through bureaucracy and red tape, to help us, the people who 
              mostly do not have any access or more in depth working knowledge of 
              governance to participate in the running of this country. We the 
              commoners partipate in politics at ground level while our elected will 
              help us represent our concerns.</p>
              <p>If people did not feel that they have a stake in this country, 
              that's also partly true. We can ask ourselves why is it, only the people
               that is feeling the pain of job losess, high cost of living and most 
              importantly of all, a bleak future that destroyed people hopes and, 
              pardon me, lowered the driving hormones of everyone desires to start a 
              family in such a hopeless state. Why, why, is that so? Who are the ones 
              now, falling aleep in parliament, having pay increament despite not 
              solving the problems of the citizens, who are all these people living it
               up in pleasure while we, the people suffered. Who are those dogs?</p>
              <p>We partly ceded our citizens participation, through the loss of 
              adequate opposition people to represent  our citizens, partly also due 
              to the PAPist suppression of oppositions through decades to render us 
              unable to be active participants of this country.</p>
              <p>People will have
               to understand that in the grand scheme of life, there are actually a 
              paradox of choices and non choices, this paradox causality will still 
              come crashing down with events that might harm you whether or not you 
              have done anything to avert it. So why do it? We have to answer to our 
              duty bound birth rights as a citizen of this country to do our best, 
              whether if to adopt a stoic, happy or frightened state of mind to set 
              this country free.</p>
              <p>We don't have to care about the eventual 
              outcome, we care about whether have we fufill our duties as a citizen of
               this state or not. The outcome can only be good or bad, which I'm sure 
              no one is afraid of the latter. What we should be afraid of is whether 
              did we throw in the towel even before the fight bell has rang. It ain't 
              over til the fat lady sings.</p>
              <p>Now is our time, if we still do 
              not reclaim what belonged to us, are we so hopelessly weak willed and 
              poisoned by this Matrix not to chose the red pill to smash this ring of 
              oligarchy traitor bastards that betrayed all citzens for their own 
              cowardly party survival?</p>
              <p>Fight and fight we must, not through the trigger of a rifle, not through the forestation,
               not through mindless marching drills, not through section movements or 
              FIBUA, we fight our own cynicism, our own aparthy, our own fears to 
              fight for a future for this country and our fellow country men. Fight we
               must and fight, we will, for our will deserves a more noble endeavour</p>

              <p>Housing affordability probably refers to public housing, once you restrict the foreign workers &amp; immigrants, there will be less demand on housing and housing prices will stabilise. When PAP open the doors to foreign immigrants in the hope of increasing Singapore's population to 7 million, the increased demand for housing drove up prices.

              <p>The land wasn't enough for 3-4 million Singaporeans that we have to import another 2-3 million? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When economy took a downturn in 2008-2009, COE prices dropped to below $10,000, they realised that there is no point for them to release more COEs as they are not getting good profits, so the reduce the COE by half and Voila, prices for COE went up by 2-3 times their $10,000 levels. One sure way to influence the price is to control the supply, which was what they have done when COE plummeted. Of course they can come up with umpteen "valid" excuses for the drastic cut in COE quota, but we all know the ultimate motive behind it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since when I said conspiracy theory between car dealers and government? You ran out of good points and making up your own points to retort me? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If they had known that high COE quota would increase traffic jams, they should have reduced the quota years or even decades in advance and not when COE prices dropped to under $10,000. They could also build more roads. Ermmm..., let me guess, increasing the population by 30% would have no dire effect on the car population. A result of their own policy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I want the best for Singapore citizens irrespective of which political party is in control, I have no past loyalty to any political party, it's the political party which can provide the best living for Singapore citizens that matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I just want to add that all those 5 immediate pledges are formulated by all those walkabouts that the Reform Party has been conducting for the past few months.

Those pledges are not something that they  formulated over at a kopitiam in one night over a few beers but is a result of HEARING, not deaf to what citizens' concerns are.</p>
              <p>Of course, if they do not have a majority in government, they might not be able to push til fruitation for some of these pledges, but at least they will make sure that citizens' concerns are being conveyed and a degree of importance to it attached as well.</p>

              covered 214 cities across five continents, measuring the comparative 
              cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, 
              food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. It is acknowledged to
               be the world’s most comprehensive survey on the cost of living. <strong>It 
              revealed that Singaporeans’ ability to replace their last earned salary 
              at the point of retirement by accessing their retirement funds (CPF) is 
              ‘particularly low.’ </strong>This highlights what many Singaporeans have 
              discovered for themselves: our present CPF Scheme cannot provide a 
              retirement income that can replace what we were earning while in the 
              workforce.</p>
              <p>Cast your mind back, and you will probably be able to 
              pinpoint the exact time when our CPF Scheme lost its direction. In an 
              attempt to subdue increasing resentment from voters reacting to the 
              government’s authoritarian high-handedness and the fact that it seizes 
              40% of our incomes, a major change occurred. The government raised the 
              amount of CPF funds that could be used to purchase first HDB flats and 
              then private properties from 80% to 100%. This caused the prices of 
              homes to skyrocket overnight. The situation was made worse by the 
              government’s conflict of interest as the owner of 80% of the land 
              (through the SLA), provider of 90% of the housing (through HDB) and 
              provider of housing finance (CPF). It meant they had every reason to not
               to take steps to rein in the growing bubble in property prices. This 
              was exacerbated by their decision to expand our population at an 
              exponential rate starting in the 1990s which put further pressure on the
               already limited supply. The rise in HDB prices the resale index is up 
              342% meant that Singaporeans committ themselves to decades of using 
              their CPF contributions to pay for housing which started out as budget 
              homes meant to house a young population in a developing young country. 
              Furthermore most of household wealth ended up tied up in property. This 
              resulted in a situation where the government has to keep prices rising 
              if they are to avoid the kind of housing bust we have seen in the US, 
              but on an altogether bigger scale. This is undoubtedly one of the 
              reasons why the government continues to encourage massive immigration to
               Singapore because the implications of an end to their deliberately 
              engineered boom are too horrendous to contemplate.</p>
              <p>In addition the
               government CPF usage to allow certain shares and equities to be bought 
              and sold, medical bills to be paid for, and even children’s tertiary 
              education to be financed, all with CPF money. No long-term planning was 
              done for the health problems of an aging population with the result that
               we face a situation where ordinary Singaporeans will quickly exhaust 
              their Medisave and Medishield accounts to pay for medical treatment and 
              may have to go without the treatment they need, receive substandard 
              treatmentor face potential bankruptcy and the loss of their housing.</p>
              <p>Underlying
               all this was a gradual erosion of the bond between the government and 
              people which had been created by the government thanks to its “High Pay 
              For Government Ministers and Top Civil Servants” talent pricing scheme, 
              and using the liberalisation of our CPF funds as a cure-all to placate 
              Singaporeans’ anger and sense of outrage. In simple terms, the CPF was 
              compromised by a need to stay in power at any cost.</p>
              <p>Today, 
              Singaporeans are paying the price for that decision – two incomes 
              tethered to thirty-year mortgages, skyrocketing HDB prices which are out
               of reach for most and retirement becoming a luxury for the minority of 
              generously paid Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>What has made life worse is that 
              amidst all that, our incomes have mostly stagnated or have even been 
              reduced, resulting in our contributions to CPF lagging far behind the 
              rising cost of living and inflation. The end result? Out of the 700,000 
              Singaporeans who were aged between 55 and 80 years old when invited to 
              join the CPF Life Scheme, only 30,000 signed up. I believe this is 
              because Singaporeans have lost faith in the government, its policies and
               its direction. What’s more – a large number of Singaporeans will be 
              retiring from work with insufficient savings in our CPF. A whopping 30% 
              of us will not have the Minimum Sum of $40,000 in our CPF when we reach 
              the age of 55, and thus, will be automatically excluded from the CPF 
              Life scheme.</p>
              <p>In response, our government tries to assure us that 
              our assets have appreciated in value, we are richer than we were before 
              and we are even better off than our neighbours. I do not believe this to
               be true. I see it as a case of asset inflation, where we pay a lot more
               for the biggest ticket item, leaving nothing for having or even 
              bringing up children, starting a business or making retirement a 
              possibility.</p>
              <p><strong>The Reform Party is convinced that nothing short of 
              an overhaul of the CPF Scheme and a return to providing low cost housing
               to the average Singaporean by the HDB is going to solve the problems 
              created by the indiscretionary depletion of our CPF funds. We propose 
              keeping the growth in the prices of HDB flats pegged to the growth in 
              median incomes by increasing supply, so that if we earn more, we can 
              have better homes, and not vice versa. In the longer term we want to 
              give the private sector a much bigger role in providing housing for the 
              majority of the population so as to improve affordability and quality 
              through competition. We propose that part of CPF be augmented converted 
              into a Basic Pension Scheme, in which every Singaporean who has worked 
              in Singapore and paid CPF for twenty years or more is entitled to a 
              pay-out. Part of the funding for this could come from our plan to give 
              our citizens a stake in Temasek and GIC. We also want a basic universal 
              health insurance scheme to be funded out of CPF to replace the current 
              inadequate Medisave and Medishield schemes. After providing for these 
              two requirements the Reform Party believes that savings decisions should
               be an individual decision and not determined by the government.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>The
               Reform Party also intends to restore your ability to withdraw the 
              employee contributions portion of your CPF savings at 55 if you so wish 
              while still providing incentives to persuade you to buy an annuity.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>However
               when making any decision we have to be sensitive to the decisions of 
              the incumbents which have created a situation where most of our 
              household wealth is tied up in property. </strong><strong>At the moment most of people’s 
              CPF contributions is used to service their housing loans. Any attempt to
               divert part of CPF into paying for basic pensions may result in people 
              being unable to service their loans and a precipitate fall in property 
              prices. This could create a serious recession along the lines of what 
              has occurred in the US. However the Reform Party believes that such a 
              scenario grows more likely with every year that this government 
              continues to stoke an unsustainable property boom. Our steps to reduce 
              the rate of increase of prices and peg it back to the same as or less 
              than the growth in median incomes are designed to achieve a reallocation
               of resources without causing any adverse consequences for the domestic.</strong></p>
              <p>If
               you have been feeling that your worst fears are coming true lately, you
               are not alone. We at The Reform Party feel the same way. So do many 
              Singaporeans. The time to rescue ourselves from a bleak future is now. 
              Vote us into Parliament, so that we can achieve a better Singapore for 
              you confidently. Support us and ensure that we Singaporeans are heard, 
              loud and clear. We want our CPF back to what it was meant to be: saving,
               day by day, so that when the time comes, we can stop working, look back
               and not have to feel as if our life’s work has all been for nothing. 
              The time has come for us to stand up for a better Singapore.</p>
