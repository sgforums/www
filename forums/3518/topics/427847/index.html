              <p>by <strong>Andrew Loh</strong></p>
              <p>New People’s Action Party (PAP) candidate, Dr Janil Puthucheary, says
               that he “felt it was important to step up and stand forward to advocate
               on behalf of those who can’t do so for themselves, or aren’t heard.” He
               was responding to a question posed to him on his Facebook page on what 
              he thought of Mr <strong>Chen Show Mao</strong> (Workers’ Party’s potential candidate) serving his National Service (NS), while he did not.</p>
              <p>“I did not do NS, Mr Chen did, those are the facts, yes,” he said.</p>
              <p>Dr Janil is 38-years old and is a pediatrician. He received his Singapore citizenship three years ago.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen, 50, was born in Taiwan and moved to Singapore when he was 
              11-years old. Mr Chen had volunteered to serve his NS before he became a
               Singapore citizen in 1986.</p>
              <p>The comparison between the two men have led to criticisms of Dr Janil
               not doing what most Singaporean men are required by law to do  – 
              dedicating two years of their lives to serving the nation. As the 
              criticisms mounted, Dr Janil finally responded in late March. According 
              to the local press, he was reported thus:</p>
              <p><em>“…As for criticism that he did not serve national service, as he 
              became a Singapore citizen at the age of 35, the pediatrician said he 
              has been in public service: ‘I’ve spent the last 10 years saving kids’ 
              lives.’”</em></p>
              <p>This led to further outrage as critics saw his answer as equating 
              what he does as a profession to what Singaporeans do as an act of 
              patriotism, besides the fact that as a pediatrician he is paid more than
               the average NSman.</p>
              <p>In his reply on his Facebook page, while acknowledging that Mr Chen 
              has done his NS and he did not, Dr Janil seems to avoid commenting any 
              further than that.</p>
              <p>National Service is not the only controversy surrounding the new PAP 
              face who is expected to be fielded as a PAP candidate in Pasir 
              Ris-Punngol GRC, under the wings of Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.</p>
              <p>In an earlier interview, he was asked if he was angry about the 10-month detention of his father, Mr <strong>Dominic Puthucheary</strong>,
               under the Internal Security Act (ISA) in 1963. Dr Janil said he “could 
              not express any anger for that.” He said “it was something… that 
              happened in the long history that we were told about. It wasn’t 
              something that we lived with or we knew of ourselves.” He seemed to 
              pledge support for the ISA, despite what his father had gone through, 
              when he said, “The potential uses for that law after 9/11 are very 
              different. I may philosophically argue with some aspects of policy. But 
              the philosophy is not as important as the pragmatic implications for our
               state, security and country.” (<strong>Asia One</strong>)</p>
              <p>His remarks were criticised, particularly by online commentators, for
               seemingly supporting the stand that things like the right to an open 
              trial, access to counsel, and burden of proof, were not important as 
              important as the “pragmatic implications for our state.”</p>
              <p>On his Facebook page, Dr Janil also said he is giving his first 
              speech (as an MP) “a lot of thought”. But he said “this is premature” as
               he has not been elected or even nominated yet.</p>
              <p>He says his focus now is to “demonstrate” his sincerity and “earn the trust of the residents.”</p>
              <p>Dr Janil’s latest comments on his lack of a National Service stint 
              will probably fuel more criticisms. It is left to be seen if the PAP 
              will address this head-on. The party has so far kept mum about it.</p>

              <p>You never served time, don't play the "occupation" card and try to trade off because you had been paid your salary. If you do free voluntary service for the past ten years saving Singaporean lives, then maybe that is a slightly better trade off.</p>

              <p>Well, if a man's reflex reaction is going to go that way, we have to recognise that he is indeed a lesser man.</p>
              <p>He can be firm to say that he did not serve NS and go on about how he is prepared to help Singaporeans in future. Afterall, he is going to have voting rights in parliament to decide the future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Instead, we see a man who feels pressured to go fully defensive and tries to perform the balancing act. Being reactive, he is less likely to implement new rules that will improve the livelihood of Singaporeans and move on. He seemed like a man that's always looking at past achievements, and will be the type that always reinforcing failures and go fully on defensive mode.</p>
              <p>Are we a progressive country or regressive? With what he said, he is regressive and in fact he convinced me that he is a lesser man not capable of future greats.</p>

              <p>Agreed. Being a good politician is not just about making good policies. It is also about being able to engage well with the masses and to come across as being in tune with them.</p>
              <p>It may be true that he was faced with a hard question. However, his answering skills are certainly far off the mark. As many job-seekers and scholarship applicants know, one may have to face difficult questions in an interview. In such cases, it is not so much about giving the correct answer, because some questions do not necessarily have a strictly correct answer. Rather, it is about being able to handle the question and to answer it with the proper grace without making yourself look bad.</p>
              <p>He could have taken a few seconds to properly think through the question and to answer it with a flourish.</p>
              <p>Instead, he was being <em>reactive</em> instead of being <em>active</em>, and now people have a dimmer view of him.</p>
