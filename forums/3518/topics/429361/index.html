              <p>one thing must confirm. if the polling ticket is issue at random and not tagged to your polling card, then it is secret. if ticket '1234' has to be issued to polling card '1234', then the chances of them cross-referencing your poll card to the ticket issued can be done. however if the ticket is issued at random to any poll card number, then even if someone sees your vote at the counting centre without seeing the card number issued to you at the polling centre thehn there is no way anyone can check.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>CONFIRM THAT please, then i can say VOTING IS SECRET!</p>

              <p>The one who issue you the voting slip is not the one at the counting station. The one at the counting station does not have the voting list.</p>
              <p>So if the one at the polling station sees you, your eyes shows that you are paranoid, he remembers you, he memorise your number, he cannot write it down, because there are political parties members watching everything like a hawk, he must memorise. At the end of the day how many can he memorise, and for what.</p>
              <p>He must stay stay at the polling station until it ends.</p>
              <p>The counting venue is elsewhere, with a different set of people, and again with members of political parties watching everything like a hawk.</p>
              <p>You only need to ask any OPPOSITION party members whether voting is secret. They will give you a resounding YES.</p>
              <p>Voting is a very serious matter and must be taken seriously by everyone. Just cast your vote and leave. No hanky panky. The voting slip has two or three (if three cornered fight) blank boxes for you to mark your X. The blank spaces is very good for writing and drawing things. If there is no serial number many people will write or draw who knows what, you can guess yourself what they can write or draw. If they do, at the counting venue the ones that has nonsense or vulgarity written on it will be taken out, and handed over to the police. Remember voting is a very serious matter.Those marked properly will be just counted and be lost in the piles and piles of voting slips.</p>
              <p>Again, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALL</span> voting slips will be under the scrutiny of members of all political parties at the counting venue. All have to agree the defaced one can be taken out and handed to the police.</p>
              <p>These political parties members observe every thing, follow the boxes, check box seals, box opened too slow/too fast complain, helper look at slip too long, light too strong, light too weak, too many people around, why this person there, why this person not there, why the policeman stand so near, check and re-check the count.</p>
              <p>Its the OPPOSITION parties that can give you the assurance that voting is secret and kept secret.</p>
              <p>Only PAP moles want to spread the fear that it may not be secret. For obvious reasons.</p>

              <p><br>sorry I not going vote for them or pay and pay.    Don't have time to go their rallies and the venues all so far.   They don't even distribute info on their background of the candidates.  My neighbours don't know them and they also don't know us.   They show not much interest in my area so I should not give them a damn.   It is against my wish to vote for the unknown.   Called their phone, phone mail full.  No email to send message to them.</p>

              </p><p>According to the Election Dept, it said that tracking is only in theory, may or may not be able to track. Have not try yet since the first election. Must be ordered by Court under very serious condition only. </p>
              <p>Anyway, do you how much manpower is needed to try out this theory. This election alone alot of manpower needed. You think they are going to waste 1000 staff to sift through millions of voting slips. Where are they going to do it, need a big open space and lots of transportation also. All this just to find out who you or your family or friends voted for. Must be crazy right. Would you do it yourself logically?</p>
              <p>The appropriate way is to use computation like you do in school or University to derive an estimation. The number of voters in a constituency is fixed. The percentage of votes is also known. The boundary of the constituency also known. From the estimation, it will give you a map segmented by constituencies and their boundary. There would some with better percentage and some lower. Just redraw the boundary base on these estimates you would be assured a balance spread of voters. That's why you see there is always changes in boundary. Don't believe just check with your friends, some don't even know which constituency they belong to as it keep changing.</p>
