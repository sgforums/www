              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Dear Mdm,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">It was reported on Temasek Review that a person working in Jurong Town Council by the name of Geraldine Soh Shin Lin has been sacked by the General Manager, Mr Ho Thian Poh. According to the report, the official reason given for her sudden sacking was due to “poor performance” even though she has been working for three years without any incidents or warnings to note.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">However, what is worrying is that the report also mentioned that she was probably sacked due to her support for the opposition party, NSP. She was seen helping NSP to sell its merchandise at the NSP rally during the election:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;"><a style="color: #ab6f07; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/05/10/nsp-supporter-sacked-from-jurong-town-council-after-being-caught-selling-nsp-merchandise-at-rallies/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2011/05/10/nsp-supporter-sacked-from-jurong-town-council-after-being-caught-selling-nsp-merchandise-at-rallies/</a></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Thanks to Mr Ho’s action, we now have one more Singaporean out of job. The netizens are completely outraged by the report. As Chairman of JRTC as well as a senior member of NTUC, you should thoroughly investigate the background of this incident and give everyone, especially Ms Soh, a proper redress.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">And if there are no wrong doings found committed by Ms Soh other than supporting her choice political party, NSP, then perhaps the JRTC General Manager, Mr Ho Thian Poh, should be sacked for politicizing an apolitical organization, the Jurong Town Council, whose job is merely to manage housing, shop and office units in Jurong area. I’m sure you also don’t want the netizens to link this incident back to PAP, accusing PAP of bullying or suppressing oppositions in Singapore.<br>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0.5em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.5em; margin-left: 0px; color: #262c2c; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Times, serif;">Yours sincerely,</p>

              <p>Now we know why a opposition party is very essential in the parliament. They are here to ask why and what make them do this kind of action. They are simply lead by their nose and will care a damn on how the grounds felt.</p>
              <p>And as you can see the ts posted, he has cc to pm. But, will pm read? Will pm rec the mail? Will it direct to his sec? Or will it bounce back to ts?</p>

Luckily people didn't say that the car accident that involved Hougang opposition candidate was planned by PAP or government to get rid of oppositions. I think the government has done to well for the country and yet the people take it for granted. Just compare our life with those in the region around us and touch your heart and ask yourself if we have a good life here. Just like inflation, it happens in every country, including those with natural resources. Singapore has nothing and we import everything we use or consume and all the import prices has increased, not due to the doing of our government. In fact the government help us to fight inflation with our strong currency and also by giving out rebates and growth dividends. What else do we want more? More oppositions? What better alternatives can the oppositions offer? Would they be able to see us through should another crisis comes along? If the whole PAP is voted out, are they able to form the next government and see us prosper like before? Who will the oppositions appoint their men as ministers and senior office holders? The list goes on, what more to say if people just don't understand the good life we enjoy here in Singapore.</p></div>

              everything we use or consume and all the import prices has
              increased, not due to the doing of our government. In fact the
              government help us to fight inflation with our strong currency and
              also by giving out rebates and growth dividends. What else do we
              want more? More oppositions? What better alternatives can the
              oppositions offer? Would they be able to see us through should
              another crisis comes along? If the whole PAP is voted out, are they
              able to form the next government and see us prosper like before?
              Who will the oppositions appoint their men as ministers and senior
              office holders? The list goes on, what more to say if people just
              don't understand the good life we enjoy here in Singapore.</p>
