              Steve Tan</span></strong></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: He is possibly the first candidate the
              People's Action Party (PAP) has put up for a General Election only
              to drop out on the eve of Nomination Day.<br>
              <br>
              "Personal reasons" have been cited for Mr Steve Tan's eleventh-hour
              decision.<br>
              <br>
              The 37-year-old who was introduced as a new PAP candidate on March
              23, was to have been part of the five-member team in Tampines Group
              Representation Constituency (GRC) helmed by National Development
              Minister Mah Bow Tan.<br>
              <br>
              As a result of Mr Tan's sudden decision, Mr Baey Yam Keng was moved
              from Tanjong Pagar GRC to Tampines.<br>
              <br>
              When asked if his withdrawal was related to allegations about him
              that have appeared online, Mr Tan, the Young NTUC executive
              secretary who married Sarah Ng in June last year, said: "My
              conscience is clear. My wife is fully aware of this and I have her
              support."<br>
              <br>
              Asked if the allegations had led to any legal action, he said:
              "There was never any criminal conviction or disciplinary action
              involved. You can check the records...I am wondering why all this
              only started to come up in the past two days. These allegations are
              not true."<br>
              <br>
              Asked for his view on the switch of candidates, Mr Tan, who was
              calm throughout the five-minute phone interview, said: "I do not
              want to comment further on this or make a big issue out of it, as I
              do not want it to overshadow the General Election.<br>
              <br>
              "It's not about me, it's about the General Election, and many of my
              colleagues are working very hard on the ground."<br>
              <br>
              On his place in history, he said: "I'm not aware of this but,
              obviously, I didn't make the decision (to withdraw) just to be in
              history. It is a personal decision which I had considered carefully
              and discussed with my wife."<br>
              <br>
              Despite unwittingly becoming one of the major talking points on
              Nomination Day, Mr Tan stressed that he would continue helping the
              PAP at the grassroots and community levels.<br>
