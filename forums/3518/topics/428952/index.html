              <p>YOUNG NTUC executive secretary Steve Tan, has dropped out of the race. The 37-year-old, who was expected to be fielded in Tampines GRC to take over from outgoing MP Ong Kian Min, said on Wednesday: 'It's a personal decision, and a hard one.'</p>
              <p>The Nanyang Technological University business graduate joined NTUC in a marketing position in 2001. When introduced as a candidate last month, he had said that he sees being an 'ordinary guy' as a strength.</p>
              <p>'When I'm doing my union work, this is one aspect I love: I hang out at the same places and do the same things as my workers... we eat roti prata at Jalan Kayu together,' he said. 'It will make it easier for me to relate to voters.'</p>
              <p>He had also said he will be able to connect most with Mandarin- and dialect-speaking residents due to his 'bilingual and bicultural background'. He has been involved in xinyao, Singapore's Chinese folk-pop music scene, since his secondary school days.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PM explains why Steve Tan dropped out</span></strong></p>
              <p>PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that 'there is no absolute certainty in any process of choosing people,' when explaining the unprecedented last-minute pullout of unionist Steve Tan from the PAP slate on Nomination Day.</p>
              <p>'We're looking for many attributes, strengths and capabilities, and also testing for weaknesses, and there's no process which is 100 per cent accurate.'</p>
              <p>'And even if you're accurate now, something may happen later on and we have to revise our assessment,' he said at a press conference after nominations closed on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, 37, told reporters that he had stepped down for 'personal reasons'. MP Baey Yam Kheng replaced him in the Tampines GRC lineup, while new face, surgeon Chia Shih Lu, took Mr Baey's place in Tanjong Pagar GRC.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee was unequivocal that party leadership had not known about Mr Tan's past troubles, arguing that the change would not have been at the eleventh hour if they had.</p>
              <p>He said that the party and Mr Tan could have 'pretended there was no problem and just carried on'.</p>
              <p>'But Steve Tan is honourable, we are (as well), and we decided that awkward as it is, we just had to go through with this and made the last-minute change and explain to people: I'm sorry, something has come up...we have had to make a change.'</p>
              <p>Separately, Labour chief Lim Swee Say said Mr Tan was put up as a candidate 'based on our knowledge of his track records over the last 10 years'.</p>
              <p>On Mr Tan's decision to drop out of the contest, he said: 'I'm glad he took the decision before the GE. I suppose he came to the decision in the interest of the party, in the interest of the voters. I take consolation that we have responsible people who put the bigger voter interest ahead of personal interest.'</p>

              <p><span></span></p>
              <p><span><span>SINGAPORE: He is possibly the first candidate the People's Action Party (PAP) has put up for a General Election only to drop out on the eve of Nomination Day.<br><br>"Personal reasons" have been cited for Mr Steve Tan's eleventh-hour decision.<br><br>The 37-year-old who was introduced as a new PAP candidate on March 23, was to have been part of the five-member team in Tampines Group Representation Constituency (GRC) helmed by National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.<br><br>As a result of Mr Tan's sudden decision, Mr Baey Yam Keng was moved from Tanjong Pagar GRC to Tampines.<br><br>When asked if his withdrawal was related to allegations about him that have appeared online, Mr Tan, the Young NTUC executive secretary who married Sarah Ng in June last year, said: "My conscience is clear. My wife is fully aware of this and I have her support."<br><br>Asked if the allegations had led to any legal action, he said: "There was never any criminal conviction or disciplinary action involved. You can check the records...I am wondering why all this only started to come up in the past two days. These allegations are not true."<br><br>Asked for his view on the switch of candidates, Mr Tan, who was calm throughout the five-minute phone interview, said: "I do not want to comment further on this or make a big issue out of it, as I do not want it to overshadow the General Election.<br><br>"It's not about me, it's about the General Election, and many of my colleagues are working very hard on the ground."<br><br>On his place in history, he said: "I'm not aware of this but, obviously, I didn't make the decision (to withdraw) just to be in history. It is a personal decision which I had considered carefully and discussed with my wife."<br><br>Despite unwittingly becoming one of the major talking points on Nomination Day, Mr Tan stressed that he would continue helping the PAP at the grassroots and community levels.<br><br>-</span><a class="path" href="http://%3chttp//www.todayonline.com%3E"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">TODAY</span></span></a><span>/ac</span> </span></p>
