Therefore whatever that is written here is but just my humble opinion and do not represent the view of others.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The election begins with the formation of a a new political party, the “Reform Party” by the late Joseph Benjamin Jeyaratnam (JBJ). However, the late JBJ was not able to fullfill his ambition of contesting in the GE2011 under the flag of Reform Party. We saw Kenneth Jeyaratnam took over the Reform Party and saw large number of new members making its way into the new Reform Party. However, just a quickly it grows, it quickly shrink when there was a mass resignation. The 21 mass resignation reduces the Reform Party to only be able to contest in 2 GRC (and to loan 2 candidates). Others simply joined the other opposition parties and the biggest benificary was NSP Party, with 2 scholars contesting under the arm of NSP.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Finally when the electoral boundaries was reviewed, we can parties laying claims on each SMC and GRC. There were up to 4 candidates laying <span> </span>claims to the newly formed Radin Mas SMC, Ponggol East SMC, Kallang-Moulmien GRC etc. Independent candidates also joined in the fray. But all the oppositions agreed that they didn’t want to see a multiple corners contest thus the “pow wow” meeting among them. Everyone finally met eye to eye before Nomination day , thus avoiding 3 corners contest, with the exception of Ponggol East.</span></span></p>

People’s Action Party (PAP) candidate Minister Ng Eng Hen fired the first salvo by questioning the agenda of CSM into the political fray. PAP also introduced their most controversial candidate Ms Tin Pei Lin. Ms Foo Mee Har and Dr Puthuceary. Netizens immediately went into action by digging out facebook and video introduction of Ms Tin. There was an uproar by the performance <span> </span>of Ms Tin and Dr Puthuceary claiming that his ten years of service in the KK Hospital is an equivalent of him performing National Service.</span></span></p>

              <p><strong>Lessons from General Election 2011</strong></p>
              <p>I gather the following lessons by looking at the voting results of the general election 2011.</p>
              <p><strong>1. Party brand counts</strong></p>
              <p>This is clearly reflected by the high votes obtained by the Worker Party, compared to the other opposition parties. </p>
              <p>Their team won the Aljunied GRC. Their team in East Coast GRC, comprising of relatively young and unknown </p>
              <p>candidates, obtained 45% of the votes against the People Action Party that fielded two ministers.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Quality of candidate counts</strong></p>
              <p>The WP team in Aljunied, comprising of well known and high respected candidates, Low Thia Khiang, Sylvia Lim, Chen </p>
              <p>Show Mao and the other candidates, won over another 10% of the voters and tipped the balance.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Credibility counts</strong></p>
              <p>The high profile candidates that moved from the Reform Party to the National Solidarity Party, Tony Tan and Hazel </p>
              <p>Poa, fared poorly in Chua Chu Kang GRC against a weaker team from the PAP (no disrespect to Gan Kim Yong). The </p>
              <p>voters probably did not like their high profile walkover to another party.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Negative impact from leadership squabbles</strong></p>
              <p>Kenneth Jeyaretnam and Chiam See Tong lost votes due to the high profile disputes within their parties. They could </p>
              <p>have done much better.</p>
              <p><strong>5. The baggage of the Singapore Democratic Party</strong></p>
              <p>The SDP fared rather poorly, in spite of their impressive website, preparation and outreach activities. The public still had a bad impression of the SDP, carried over from the old days. The SDP has a task to change this image.</p>
              <p>I hope that the smaller parties, such as the NSP, SDP, Reform Party, Singapore People Party and the Singapore </p>
              <p>Democratic Alliance will study the lessons from this general election and plan their strategy for the future.</p>

              <p>My heartiest congratulations to the SDP. I am very proud of you. You have returned from the brink of defeat and garnered the support of 36.8 percent of Singaporeans. It is a remarkable feat for a party that was almost written off. Please keep you faith and return to represent us again.<br><br>Well close to 39.9 percent of us Singaporeans have registered our dissent for the ruling party. That percentage is set to grow when the citizens struggle with the challenges of daily life in the island.<br><br>Singaporeans will rise again to question these realities: rising healthcare, stressed school curriculum, rote educational practices. Ever increasing transport costs and overcrowded buses and trains. Declining job opportunities and depressed wages for the lower income groups. Foreigners preferred over citizens for jobs in many sectors.<br><br>Our electorate is maturing, the shackles and blinkers that bound and blinded them are breaking and dropping. People will become more aware and take the brave step towards change.</p>
              <p>Be patient, 52 years of learned fear and earned insecurity will take some time to be de-conditioned. Singaporeans will recover to become their own persons and make informed decisions. Yes, the self-serving will always be with us, the blind may never see and others may doubt they can carry on without the familiar comforts, but enough of us have also stood up to voice our stand. At this time, this is sufficient, the next time, we will make clear inroads.<br><br>We have told the PAP that we are not pleased, if the party disregards the concerns of the ground, it will be held accountable in five years time. Once again, we will question the tax-exempt million dollar salaries and life time pensions for the leaders of the ruling party.</p>
              <p>How is it that other men and women with similar if not better talent and training are willing to work for less to serve the people with rectitude and sincerity and resist the temptations of mammon while others from the PAP demand an exorbitant price from the taxpayers?<br><br>This is our country. This is our nation that existed before us and will exist after us, so let's look to a better future. We retreat not in defeat or failure, we will retreat to rethink and recover what is ours to cherish and love. This is a promise we owe to our children and their future. <br><br>Since 2006 till this day in 2011, we see a dramatic metamorphosis of SDP. It was once dismissed as a ragtag band of radicals led by Dr Chee and was villainised in mainstream media for being a radical party.</p>
              <p>But fast forward to today, it has changed its image, so much so that it managed to recruit more good people into its rank and file: Mr Tan Jee Say, Dr Ang Yong Guan, Dr Vincent Wijeysingha, Dr James Gomez and it had won the support from highly-qualified professionals such as Prof. Tambyah to lend support for SDP's healthcare policies.</p>
              <p>Despite SDP's longstanding existence, it must still be said that such achievements since 2006 are considered a baby step towards transforming its image as a credible party, and SDP this time has made it despite not winning any wards contested.<br><br>Dr Chee and folks, you all are heroes. You had changed the game the other way round. In the past, you folks were accused of using smear and character assassinations.</p>
              <p>But this time round, the role was reversed: it was the MIWs who are using smear and all that, including TNP's coverage of SDP's 'protest march' to discredit you. On the contrary, you folks in SDP stood firm and steadfast, refusing to be drawn into the same smear shop as MIWs.</p>
              <p>That's why, by all virtues, I personally agree wholeheartedly that SDP has indeed fought a principled fight, with integrity and for the just cause you had been championing. In that, despite your defeat, your defeat is glorious and honorable.<br><br><a name="more"></a>Please continue to keep up the good work, and not waste the foundation you had created for yourselves this GE. There are still much work to do. Please continue your outreach and if possible, walk the ground to build up rapport so that you can win over more people's heart with your sincerity.</p>
              <p>Also, take this 5-year hiatus as an opportunity to evaluate your electoral strate, and also, recruit more heavyweights and maintain and expand your A-team formations. The key word here is continuity and sustainability. Don't be criticised by people for 'disappearing' after the elections. The work has only started since nomination day, and it has not ended yet. This is forever a work in progress.<br><br>As amateurish my above suggestions are, I hope they can be useful because they come from my own observation as a third-party in this election using a citizens' perspective. I'm sure SDP is capable of rejuvenating itself further and by 2016, will emerge as a stronger party which is credible. Like the Energizer battery commercial: never say die!</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>it's true what TKL said. Those last minute change of parties speak very badly about the candidate. No matter what, if you've chosen that party, then toe the party line. Politics are not about self interests. Think hazel poa, tony tan and alec tok. They walked out on RP in the blink of an eye....what credibility they expect? No surprise they didn't do well. Party hoppers never do well. Nevertheless, there's always 2016 to look forward to and I hope by that time, old man is no longer around in the political arena.</p></div>
