              <p>Look at how near it is .....if Hougang is secured by WP and Aljunied by WP ...they can control the town councils . It is a tactical choice and a good one. WP candidates for Aljunied are the best candidates. Low Thia Kang is going for all or none.</p>

              <p>Well, at least you are given a choice to which drug you can take to commit suicide. Compared to the people of Tanjong Pagar GRC, who had another 5 years of wait before prescribing their own drugs.</p>

              <p>Are you in those constituencies affected by that 'musical chairs'? You are in a GRC not an SMC. Unless you stayed in those SMCs for long, I don't think you are qualified to make a judgement on who is standing there as a replacement.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My view is that Lina Chiam is probably known around as Chiam See Tong's wife around Potong Pasir (from my friend living there). Better old Chiam join a GRC team - he still has his leftover effects of stroke and he needs a team to run while he guides them. Lina Chiam will be a person capable of running an SMC on her own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Low Thia Kang left his colleague there in Hougang . From what I heard , my friend in Hougang told me that they know who that guy is and they are familiar with his face due to grassroots work done by WP in Hougang.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From friends in Hougang and Potong Pasir, at least some know that they are looked after by SOMEONE they know in grassroots. Not some nitwit kate spade bag wielding ditzy youngster resting comfortably within the shadow of an old face.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At least WP is fielding the best candidates in their lot in Aljunied GRC , NONE of their candidates can be said as without substance ...unlike Kate Spade I-think-medical-fees-are-affordable-and-I-don't-know-what-to-say candidate-OR-I-will-repeat-what-PAPa-says-for-15k-per-month who is part of a team led by a respectable politician.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you need to know who that ditzy youngster with PAPa is , please go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0jzvLn2NeA">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0jzvLn2NeA</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then re-evaluate who is in the opposition team in Aljunied GRC against that in Marina GRC....and get back to me about the respect shown for the constituents of both GRCs.</p>
