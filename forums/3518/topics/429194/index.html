              <p><strong>Plans to go ahead even if PAP loses: George Yeo </strong></p>
              <p><strong>ST 30 April 2011</strong></p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party's (PAP) team leader in the hotly contested Aljunied GRC has assured residents there that programmes such as the extension of the North East MRT Line would carry on regardless of whether the team was re-elected.</p>
              <p>Other plans such as lift upgrading for housing estates that had already been announced would also go ahead, added Mr George Yeo, who leads a five-man team contesting the GRC against a Workers' Party 'A' team that includes its chief Low Thia Khiang, Ms Sylvia Lim and Mr Chen Show Mao.</p>
              <p>But beyond this, voters would have to make a choice between the PAP's plans and those of the opposition, he said on Friday.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo, who is the Foreign Minister, was responding to comments made earlier in the day by the WP leader Low, who had called on the PAP team to say whether it would still implement its manifesto in Aljunied even if it lost the GRC, so that voters could make a choice ahead of the May 7 polls.</p>
              <p>Speaking to reporters on Friday night, Mr Yeo said that, such programmes aside, much depended on how local officials tackled issues on the ground.</p>
              <p>'Take the NE line. There will be four stations serving residents in Aljunied GRC. How these stations are linked to various shopping areas and housing estates will be activities undertaken by local town councils and national agencies.'</p>
              <p>He also cited another example of when local officials worked with the National Environment Agency earlier this year to eradicate an insect infestation in an estate in Bedok Reservoir: 'So we have a track record that people are aware of, from which we hope to have gained their trust.'</p>
              <p>Mr Low had said that voting for the opposition did not mean having to make a choice between issues such as estate upgrading and a desire for greater checks on the ruling party's power in Parliament.</p>
              <p>In response, Mr Yeo repeated his attack on the WP for lacking specific local plans for Aljunied.</p>

              <p>George Yeo said WP is putting Aljunied into a dilemma.  This is admitting that WP is a better team than PAP team.  Aljunied is in dilemma because they are considering to vote for a better team (WP) or to keep the previous foreign minister.  It is really hard to decide!</p>
              <p>Actually it is not WP who causes the dilemma.  If PAP did not mess up then there would be no dilemma at all.  George Yeo said "dilemma" means he admitted that PAP messed up a lot.  It is PAP that caused the dilemma, and not WP.  WP is offering the solution.</p>

              <p>yeh vote for a change. 5 yrs to see. if the hippos cannot delivery, then out they will go next election.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what we want to know is what is foreign talent. the slogen started as it is what it mean ' foreign talent'. but the recent old man speech says that in order for us to have more jobs, we must hire foreigntalent - i am fine with that. but he added that we must let these foreign investors have free (FREE) access to foreign 'skilled' labor. 10-20 percent of that will ceate 80-90 percent jobs. with statistics or records. let me let us see the records - they go by smapling check or 100% statistics collection on all singapores all jobs they doping? fuck me in the arse if its true so that i believe it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no one handles workers issues best than the WP - that's who they are workers party. and i believe PAP started out a true and wholesome party for the good of spore. not that i say now they are not good anymore. but in order for a true blue PAP supportor to uphold the PAP spirit - they must act, like its the PEOPLE's ACTIONS PARTY. this election the way to see if it is really true will depned on us - the PEOPLE's ACTION like what the PARTY motto says.</p>
