              <div class="tm-l align-left"><img class="attachment-single-post-main wp-post-image" title="PAP elections rally. (AFP)." src="http://yfittopostblogsg.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/400afp_pap.jpg?w=400" alt="PAP elections rally. (AFP)." width="400" height="250"></div>

              <div class="entry">
              <p>The <span style="color: #334499;">People’s Action Party</span> (PAP) second assistant secretary-general Teo Chee Hean says its election line-up will include about 25 new faces.</p>
              <p>These new candidates will come from a range of occupations, some with grassroots experience and some from the public and private sector.</p>
              <p>Mr Teo said in an interview with the <em>Straits Times (ST)</em>, “For every election we bring in about 25 new candidates. I think you can see from our record from the last few elections that we’ve always put an emphasis on making sure we get good people in, renew (the ranks of) MPs and leadership. That’s important for us.”<em></em></p>
              <p>“You can expect the same sort of proportions in the coming elections,” he added.</p>
              <p>The PAP typically replaces up to a third of its MPs for the elections. The party replaced 24 in 2006, 23 in 2001 and 18 in 1997.</p>
              <p>When asked if the party is finalising its line-up of candidates, he said, “You can assume that’s so.”</p>
              <p>Mr Teo also gave an idea of when the next General Elections, due by February 2012, will be.</p>
              <p>He told <em>ST</em>, the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Electoral+Boundaries+Review+Committee&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Electoral Boundaries Review Committee</span></a> was only convened last Saturday, when Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong made the announcement.</p>
              <p>The committees take at least two months to map changes, and polling day comes after some 17 days to six months from the release of the committee reports.</p>
              <p>When it is time to contest, Mr Teo said, the PAP will do so on the basis of having people and programmes to “take Singapore well into the future – 10 to 20 years ahead”.</p>
              <p>Adding his thoughts on Senior Minster Goh Chok Tong’s comment last week, that the next elections would be a watershed, he said, “We need to start bringing in new people who will be ready to take over in the future. They will do so with the others we’ve brought in at previous elections. We do need to focus on them too.”</p>
              <p>Mr Teo said the party would have to continue bringing in people from the post-65 generation to have “a good solid group of people”.</p>
              <p>What about the larger role the new media is expected to play in this elections?</p>
              <p>Said Mr Teo: “The more noise you make on the Internet doesn’t mean that you have better programmes or better solution. Focus on the substance of what you can actually do for people. Sincerity, honesty, what you can actually do for people.”</p>

              <p>My humble opinon is that the PAPist have many sources to look for candidates, most of the candidates are from GLCs, stats boards and other government linked companies. All the PAPist have to do is to paint a picture of great happiness for the potential candidate, that he is going to do a very exciting and rewarding job, a noble yet painless job. There isn't any need to confront any authourity, no necessity to bother about any difficulty of volunteers, there are plenty at RCees and PAees. There's no need to ask anyone for donations, everything is well taken care of, in fact for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>When the PAPist MP steps down, he or she can expect to sit on some GLC company and still receive a fat cheque til the day he or she is sick of receiving all that money. A wealthy, worry free life til their grave.</p>
              <p>If you are an opposition MP, the ISDee and PAPist are always breathing down your neck, ready to break you til financial and physical ruins, if you step out of the PAPist tolerated line. You will have to appeal to everyone for donation , but that is hard as the opposition candidate have to submit a report with names of all donors in it to the Registry of Political Donations when election is called, who will dare to donate?</p>
              <p>Your family will also not be spared if you happen to annoy the PAPist, I will take a passege from an interview of Tang LIang Hong who described the ordeal faced by his wife, orchestrated by the PAPist.</p>
              <p>"<span style="font-weight: bold;">They demanded documents from her which 
              were supposed to prove that Tang had been involved in tax evasion, they 
              took her passport so that she could not visit Malaysia, They froze 
              Tang’s assets and served lawsuits against her as well. One day they 
              served thirteen suits against her. She received the documents at 3.45pm 
              and was expected to appear in court at 5pm that same day with a full 
              understanding of the case and a lawyer to represent her."</span></p>
              <p>Here's the link for the full interview</p>
              <p>http://singaporeelection.blogspot.com/2006/05/feature-on-tang-liang-hong.html</p>
              <p>Many people will have to think really very hard of all the consequences, they will face from standing up against the PAPist. For the rest of their political life in Sinkapore, the opposition member will have to fight a one armed battle against a very real enemy that could bring danger to his or her family.</p>

              <p>The PAP would be daft if they say "come join us and we will offer you riches" to potential candidates.</p>
              <p>The PAP and the Opposition Parties all would sound out their potential candidates first. They would seek their political views on whether a paternalistic government, or an equal opportunity government would be preferable. These views would be matched with party's political goals and the selection made.</p>
              <p>The opposition parties would have a low regard for anyone who join their ranks because of vehement hatred for the PAP.</p>
              <p>There are opposition stalwarts who know that fear of governmental repercussion is unfounded. That fear is only good for yokel consumption.</p>
