              <p>Funny how this election PAP starts making "threats" or start telling stories of its past glories; like someone not so great said: if u don't vote for PAP you won't get upgrading. Just to remind this person who's name I cant even be bothered to type out, the money that goes to upgrading comes from taxpayers money, not from the PAP. Without taxpayers where do you even get that money to invest and bring in revenue to Singapore's economy? When we talk about not biting the hand that feeds you, this sir, refers to PAP not forgetting where the money originated from. Not mention the billions our 'beloved' government has lost in investments. No hard feelings with losing the money though, its all in the game.</p>
              <p>PAP promises a load of bullshit right before elections, and after elections proceed to fulfil a minimum of the promised bullshit they promised the masses. And then right before the next elections, they boast and sing their own praises about being able to fulfil its promises made during the last election. PAP's own pockets first, the masses' wealth and well-being second. Its time for a wakeup call for a political party too comfortable in its reputation, too deep in money.</p>
