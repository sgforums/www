I am troubled that a terrorist attack will sow suspicion and discord among Singaporeans.<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We must respond boldly and creatively to these opportunities and challenges</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expand our horizons and aim high</span>. </strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>We will continue to restructure our economy to make it more productive and resilient</strong></span>. We should make our society more vibrant and cohesive.<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And our young must be imbued with the same can-do, never-say-die Singapore spirit</span> that has brought us here”</strong></em><br><strong><em>.– Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his letter to Singaporeans, PAP Manifesto for General Election 2006.</em><br></strong><br>You remember this letter sent to you during the last election? I want to show it to you to remind you of PM Lee’s promise in 2006 to “respond boldly and creatively” to the challenges faced by Singaporeans. That was 4 years ago. Just look at the above paragraph – right on top, he said “I’m concerned…about less skilled Singaporeans whose jobs and wages are under pressure”. He sent this letter to all Singaporeans during the last election and after he got elected he opened the floodgates to cheap foreign labor and that increased the downward pressure on the wages of lower skilled workers. He increased GST – a regressive tax that would be most heavily shouldered by low wages earners. He increased the pay of his cabinet which was already the highest in the world prior to the increase.</p>

              I think they should stop giving excuses that Singaporean doesn't want the job.
              
              Koreans and Japanese also have road sweepers and cleaners and they are proud of doing it because they are pay correctly. Even in America the builders are americans because the pay was reasonable.
              
              With HDB prices going up , everything going up yet ppl still not willing to pay reasonable salary that is obvious govt fault for opening the flood gate and spoil the employers. Now the employers are on drugs, threaten to close down their business if they are not feed with cheap labours.
              
              Million dollars pay, for such a short-sighted solutions. 
              
              So to please the poor or to please the rich that is the most important answer we need from the govt. 
              
              A few obvious factors :-
              Lower personal tax only helps the rich, 
              While suppressing pay only kills the poor. 
              GST on rice, sugar, oil, water and power kills the poor more. 
              While more ppl helps business to thrive.
              
              Believe what you want but the facts are there , you only need to use your eyes to see.

              <p>Yup. We need to pay workers more, thats the key. <br><br>Frankly speaking, my generation (the 20s), nobody seems to want to work anymore. If you have realised, many entrepreneurs wanna-bes are springing up.. flea markets, pushcarts.... everywhere.... Everyone wants to be boss already. "Workers group" seems to be coming to an end.</p>

              <p>That's a bit late, right? Only in this millenium, youngsters think this way. Everyone grows up wanting to be a military officer, some big time manager, director, pilot, minister. All belonging to the category of "workers".</p>

              To Killtheink:
              
              My mom is a part time cleaner she sweeps offices for 3 dollars an hour earning only $240 for 80 hours of work.
              
              Seng siong pays only 4 dollar an hour for cashier and u lose money u pay.
              
              If I am jobless and my family needs me to feed them - 2k to sweep floor why not??
              
              When u are old and jobless and nobody else wants u - what is face? 
              
              Face is for the rich and famous ppl. 
              
              Try being poor and desperate then talk abt face.
              
              The truth is the poor are exploited, just because there are so many foreigners sweeping floor doesn't mean no Singaporean wants to sweep floor. 
              
              Stop listening to lies and open your eyes!!

              <p>When you're old and jobless and nobody wants you, and worse if you got children you raised and yet you're still not taken care of WHEN you're old and jobless, means your children are losers who know nuts about filial piety. that's different. I'm talking about young, 30 somethings who are not old, probably jobless and of course, very much desperate but then again have never properly touched a broom/mop in the entire span of their lives, and probably would not do so for 2k. there's a sick and twisted culture going on here. yeah you'd do it, sure, but you sure as hell won't like doing it. and that would lead to you not doing it for many years cos in the first place u dont take pride in it, you just want the damned money.</p>
              <p>oh wait. no, they're still losers. same same.</p>

              Killtheink,
              
              Excuse me? Are you saying poor ppl are losers? Ppl in their 30s drive lorry, sweep roads are losers? So you are those type of Singaporeans whom think high and mighty of yourself and call everyone else LOSERS? Is that so?
              
              Not everybody can be managers, Lawyers or doctors. 
              
              Some people are born this way but never a loser. 
              
              I have no mood to talk to the elitist in my country.
              
              If you think taxi drivers, road sweepers, hawkers, fish mongers are losers [most of them are 30 plus btw] then u are the one whom is sick and twisted.
              
              My mom just don't want to feel useless thus we encourage her to work part time but that doesn't mean she should be abuse with seriously LOW PAY.
