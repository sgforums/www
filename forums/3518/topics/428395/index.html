              <p><strong>Independents surface at Elections Department </strong></p>
              <p>AT LEAST five independent candidates turned up at the Elections 
              Department before lunchtime on Thursday to collect or submit application
               forms ahead of Nomination Day next Wednesday.</p>
              <p>Among them was a representative for the chairman of Stansfield 
              Education Group, Mr Kannappan Chettiar. The representative, who is Mr 
              Chettiar's assistant, said his boss would contest in the Mountbatten 
              single-seat ward.</p>
              <p>Another was Mr Zeng Guoyuan, 57, a former Workers' Party candidate, 
              who said he would be running in any uncontested constituency. Mr Zeng 
              was convicted in late 2009 of putting up banners of escaped Jemaah 
              Islamiah detainee Mas Selamat Kastari without permission and went to 
              jail for three weeks instead of paying the total fines of $3,000 on 
              three charges. He contested under the WP banner in Bukit Timah ward in 
              1991.</p>
              <p>Mr Andrew Kuan, who is likely to stand in Joo Chiat single-member 
              constituency, turned up at 10am and picked up forms for SMC and GRC. At 
              10.20 am, a man in his 50s, who would only give his name as Mr Cheang, 
              collected two sets of SMC forms. He said he would reveal all on 
              Nomination Day.</p>
              <p>The mysterious man who showed up at the Elections Department on 
              Wednesday and covered his face when approached by reporters and then ran
               away, was back again on Thursday.</p>
              <p>Asked where he was planning to contest, he said curtly in Mandarin: "I want to go to heaven."</p>

              <p>RETIRED acupuncturist Zeng Guoyuan, 57, who had announced his plans 
              to contest the May 7 elections as an independent candidate said that he 
              would vote for the People's Action Party (PAP) in his own ward, in Toa 
              Payoh Central.</p>
              <p>Mr Zeng who greeted the PAP MPs of Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC during their 
              walkabout on Friday morning told Dr Ng Eng Hen that he would be probably
               be contesting in Mountbatten. But in Toa Payoh, the PAP will have his 
              vote.</p>
              <p>Later he told reporters that he supports the PAP team as it had done a good job in the Bishan-Toa Payoh constituency.</p>
              <p>'Mr Wong Kan Seng had done a good job. He had looked after the people
               well,' he said, with one of his pet parrots perched on his shoulder.</p>
              <p>Mr Zeng, who was a Workers' Party candidate in Bukit Timah in 1991, 
              said he will stand in Mountbatten as long as there are no more than 
              three candidates standing there.</p>
              <p>The father of two was last in the news in December 2009, when he was 
              fined $3,000 for putting up banners - featuring a picture of terrorist 
              Mas Selamat Kastari - without approval. He said the banners were
