              <p>In an interview with Today paper, Sylvia Lim told us why we should vote for her.</p>
              <p>"It's time to use your vote to get the PAP Government to take action and control the cost of living - just like what happened in 1991."</p>
              <p><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1126404/1/.html">http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1126404/1/.html</a></p>
              <p>Strange. She wants to be an MP but at the same time wants PAP to do all job of controlling the cost of living. How brilliant.</p>
              <p>So let's say she gets voted in this time. If the PAP did well and curb the rise in cost of living, our dear Sylvia would say "See. First World Parliament works. PAP had a wake up call after the election and so are doing more to alleviate hardship of people". If, however, the cost of living still remains high and people dissatisfied, dear Sylvia can say "the PAP are inadequate. Let WP take over". How smart Sylvia. Let PAP do all the work and you get the credit.</p>
              <p>Seriously Sylvia, you have not shown yourself much in Aljunied for the past 5 years. Come election, you reappear. You want to be our voice in Parliament. How many times have you come to Aljunied to hear our voices? Ask the residents in Aljunied. Whose voice do you represent if you are in the Parliament?</p>
              <p>As for your friend, Mr Low, has he even graduated from managing Hougang? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_e9ODv9jo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY_e9ODv9jo</a></p>
              <p>So if Hougang has not been well-managed, is it only because PAP didn't give him enough money? Very smart Mr Low. This gives you a licence to blame PAP if Hougang is in anyway less well-managed them other places.</p>

              <p>emilyy, you sound like one of those employed by PAP to retort alternative parties online (so sad). So no Worker's Party supporter is going to respond to your love for PAP.</p>
              <p>In fact, I won't even address the issues you raised because voting for Worker's Party is logical and self-explanatory. No need to explain our choice to vote for Worker's Party.</p>

              <p>Of course if you like her, you will hope she gets her dream job as an elected MP. It's really a dream job. Not to sound too repetitive, her dream job allows her to speak up and let PAP do the job. Put it in her own words: "It's time to use your vote to get the PAP Government to take action and control the cost of living - just like what happened in 1991."</p>
              <p>Yes help her get the job. So that PAP can do the work. If you like her, please continue to do so.</p>

              <p>I agree with your views emilyy.</p>
              <p>opposition's goal should be to gain power and implement their own political goals as a ruling government.</p>
              <p>I hope that PAP can be completely wiped out, suffer total defeat and an opposition party be installed as government.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your concurrence.</p>
              <p>No your pap-total-annihilation dream should not come true. If not, Sylvia and Thia Khiang would have no one to oppose, to blame and their job would not be so easy. Imagine Sylvia have to come up with concrete plans. She cannot say this anymore: "It's time to use your vote to get the PAP Government to take action and control the cost of living - just like what happened in 1991." I just repeated myself. Thia Khiang cannot blame PAP anymore for under-developed HDB estate. You will make life so difficult for the two. Why not let PAP do the hard work. Let them work, work, work. So Sylvia and Thia Khiang can just talk, tallk, talk. They are very good at talking I'm sure all of you know. Your emotion must be so high during their rallies. Like watching some concert. If your pap-total-annihilation dream do come true, you will not have such high concert-like rallies anymore. Imagine how bad that is.</p>

              <p>Maybe ur just rich, or a boss who needs cheap labour, or I dunno a new citizen..?</p>
              <p>Hell, u can vote for PAP if u want. PAP is SUPERBLY interested in money only.</p>
              <p>As for the argument the oppositions dun come to see u during non-elections time, pls ask urself how many times do u actually SEE A MP IN YOUR LIFE! I haven't seen one MP before in my life to be honest. I believe they are real busy people to be honest.</p>

              <p>The MP is to represent people like you and me. If she is not up to the job. There is also no need for her to be inside the parliment, the same reason as why you choose to support opposition to vote out PAP.</p>
              <p>I prefer to be screw by someone i am aware for more than a person who i totally have no ideas If she is up to the job or just a inspirational speaker. As a non-elected member of the parliment, she have make no great comment, message and arguement only when come to election, her well known speech is the minister salary. Make me wonder what is her role as a non-elected member where she could have voice out for us and not wait until election come near.</p>

              <p>PAP does not represent us.  PAP as said by lee hsein loong they do it their way.  They always want their way ignoring the needs of the voters.     Let us excluding you the pap supporter do it our way to tell lee hsein loong and his team we want our way that is not to vote for them.</p>

              <p>Berner, I know your agenda here.  Save your breath, time and effort , we will vote against the thieves, crooks and robbers who steal our jobs away, pay themselves undeserved highest salary in the world. do things their way to fulfill their selfish interest.   We don't want our money to go maintain their world class salary.    We want better, faster, cheaper ministers who can do a good job. </p>
