              <p>Obviously you do not know the problems.   Bet you have not read the thread here on Contact Singapore.    If you have no problems in jobs then it is good for you but does not mean others don't have the problems.    </p>
              <p>There is no cheaper, better and faster ministers from PAP.   Ministers are all from PAP.   PAP has no concrete plans, oppositions are able to see the problems and bring up good suggestions.     Well, no point keeps slamming the oppositions, we are mature to know the truth and see the shit of PAP.</p>

              <p>Thank you for your concurrence.</p>
              <p>No your pap-total-annihilation dream should not come true.
              If not, Sylvia and Thia Khiang would have no one to oppose, to
              blame and their job would not be so easy. Imagine Sylvia have to
              come up with concrete plans. She cannot say this anymore: "It's
              time to use your vote to get the PAP Government to take action and
              control the cost of living - just like what happened in 1991." I
              just repeated myself. Thia Khiang cannot blame PAP anymore for
              under-developed HDB estate. You will make life so difficult for the
              two. Why not let PAP do the hard work. Let them work, work, work.
              So Sylvia and Thia Khiang can just talk, tallk, talk. They are very
              good at talking I'm sure all of you know. Your emotion must be so
              high during their rallies. Like watching some concert. If your
              pap-total-annihilation dream do come true, you will not have such
              high concert-like rallies anymore. Imagine how bad that is.</p>

              <p>Sorry, My english no good. What can she do there by visiting Aljunied..? She cannot represent anyone since she is no an elected MP. Go there walk walk see see can, do thing no authorised and no power. Go there "Kong Song" you like?.</p>
              <p>Sylvia should considered to drive part time taxi. So every weekend can put on Aljunied and appear there to canvass the Aljunied passengers.</p>
              <p>Coming up with development plan for Aljunied or any GRC or SMC used to be URA or HDB or  some other unknown authorities role. Singapore will look like a misfix if every town come out with their own plan.</p>
              <p>Currently MPs looked like running dept collection company to pay the state cleaning company. Every week see the people for 2 hours etc exc PHs and write some letters. Come "Hello" Hello" occasionally when important days.</p>
              <p>Oppositions are mostly for construction of Singapore futures and block if the idea is no right. No running this kind of jobs. You need only an AO to run such roles.</p>
