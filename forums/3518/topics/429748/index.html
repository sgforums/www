              <p>As an avid supporter of Mr. Low Thia Kiang, i am in view that WPs A-team should have contested for Tampines GRC.</p>
              <p>My reason to this is so that Mr. Mah Bow Tan (hereafter to be referred to as MBT) would lose his seat in the parliament.</p>
              <p>As everyone would know, MBT started out loosing at an SMC, from which he was then placed by PAP in a safe and not so well challenged GRC - Tampines where he rises thru the cabinet.</p>
              <p>It is about time that this MBT who has been coming out with outrageous policies be removed with the mandate of the people.</p>
              <p>Some here may argue that MBTs removal from the parliament would have little effect on the policies in placed by him during his tenure in parliament due to the presence of a 2nd Minister for MND. But no 2 man are the same in character and mindset.</p>
              <p>Should the 2nd Minister for MND does the same, we could always put him through the same treatment. By doing this, bad eggs of the parliament would be removed, future bad eggs would be deterred from doing so and the governing party would be forced to fully scrutinised their choice of candidate for Ministerial posts.</p>
              <p>Remove MBTs as a start and we would see flexibility and good changes coming in from the already outrageous policies.</p>
              <p>Please do comment dear forumers. :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>True, but the longer MBT stays in parliament, the more he would influence the others to make bad decisions like him. That means more time for him also to train someone who will share similar ideology to his. No one can ask PAP to remove MBT just like that but WP or any other party can remove MBT through GE with our strong mandate.</p></div>

              <p><br>goh meng seng is a true blue Singaporeans who understand the people well. He has fought hard for SIngapore. I think he stand some chance against MBT( the minister who has been paid so well that he can retire anytime)</p>
              <p>Hopefully, his brother didnt die in vain. Also,  heard Mr Goh meng Seng even sold his own HDB to fund his party's election campaign....</p>
