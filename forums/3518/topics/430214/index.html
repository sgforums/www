              <p>If u think Tin Pei Lin was a mistake by the PAP, think again. The PAP are not so stupid to recruit her without a good reason.</p>
              <p>Talk around town has it on good authority that Tin Pei Lin is being used by PAP as a scapegoat.</p>
              <p>Our
              esteemed PM Lee Hisen Loong desires his son to enter politics. Getting
              his son, who is in his 20s into politics (in such a short time) will
              ruffle voters.</p>
              <p>Tin Pei Lin is portrayed by the media as a bird
              brain so that when the right time comes, LHL can introduce his son into
              politics. When people compare Tin Pei Lin with LHL's son, they will be
              more than ready to accept LHL's son as MP.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew did the
              same thing also when Lee Hsien Loong was of age to enter Uni. At the
              time when LHL entered the arm forces, LKY introduced the SAF
              Scholarship so that LHL can win the scholarship to study overseas. Why
              LHL needs a scholarship when LKY is so rich is beyond anyone's
              comprehension.</p>
              <p>The same footsteps are being adhered to by LHL for his beloved son.</p>

              <p>Not to mention that PAP uses tactics to distract us from their main agenda.
              Just like foreign talent. They claim foreign talent is to top up our
              population. But their intention is actually to grant these foreign
              talent citizenship in order to obtain more votes for themselves in the
              general election.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 26px; line-height: normal;"><strong></strong>By Randy David</span></p>
              <p><br><span class="fontbyline" style="font: normal normal normal 11px/normal Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; text-decoration: none; padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px;">Philippine Daily Inquirer</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: normal;"> </span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE HELD its general election last Saturday, May 7. But even in our politically obsessed society, hardly anyone took notice. This indifference is understandable. Filipinos are generally uninterested in the politics of other countries, except the United States. Singapore is also one country that most people do not associate with politics. After all, this city-state has been ruled by the same party, the People’s Action Party, since it became self-governing in 1959. One cannot expect to find meaningful politics in a situation like that.</p>
              <p>But all societies evolve. And, as we are seeing all over the world, even the most tightly ruled states must sooner or later change, if they are to avoid implosion. The problem of all authoritarian societies is the same: when people are unable to freely express their opinions, the feedback mechanism is blocked. Out of fear, citizens censor themselves, giving the impression that everything is all right. Government thus operates ever more blindly, guided only by its illusions.</p>
              <p>Singapore is no exception. Despite registering the highest economic growth rate in the world (14.5 percent) in 2010, its leaders could sense the simmering dissatisfaction among ordinary Singaporeans. Public housing has become more expensive, well beyond the reach of low-income groups. The latter see the growing foreign community, which now constitutes more than a third of the population, as edging them out of the nation’s jobs and limited facilities. They are not persuaded by the argument that foreign workers contribute immensely to the nation’s prosperity.</p>
              <p>Globalization is certainly a factor. Young Singaporeans are heavy Internet users. They are more connected to their generation and are aware of what is happening in the world. Despite government regulations that block websites deemed offensive, they find ways of expressing themselves on many issues facing their society.</p>
              <p>Recognizing the importance of the political discourse that is going on in personal blogs and social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter, the Singapore government recently allowed cyberspace campaigning for the elections. “For the first time,” reports the New York Times, “campaign recordings can be posted as long as they are not ‘dramatized’ or published ‘out of context.’ Video taken at an election rally can be uploaded onto the Web without being submitted to the Board of Film Censors.”</p>
              <p>By coincidence, I found myself in Singapore on election day. Campaign posters and tarpaulins were not visible in the center of the city. But the engagement of ordinary Singaporeans in this year’s general election could be felt from the first hour that the results started to come in. All the taxicabs I took had their radios tuned into the announcements, with the drivers pounding on the steering wheel in unabashed elation or dismay over the results. This continued well into the following day, Sunday, when the total votes obtained by the government and the opposition became clear.</p>
              <p>The PAP-led government posted its lowest share of the votes since the 1965 general elections, after Singapore broke away from the Federation of Malaysia. At 60.1 percent of the total votes, this was still a decisive victory for the PAP. Winning 81 of the 87 parliamentary seats, and conceding only six to the opposition, they retain control of parliament. So, what is new?</p>
              <p>What is new is what the figures above do not, by themselves, tell. The six seats that the ruling party lost were won by only one opposition party—the Workers’ Party (WP)—the party founded by David Marshall, Singapore’s first chief minister. Five of those six opposition seats are for the Aljunied group representation constituency (GRC), where the government fielded one of its brightest and most senior Cabinet members, Foreign Minister George Yeo. An opposition slate led by the WP secretary general himself, Low Thia Khiang, trounced Yeo’s re-electionist team.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I met George Yeo casually at an international conference in Singapore in April last year. He was the luncheon speaker at one of the sessions. I must say I have never been impressed listening to a government official of any country speak. He was different. Unassuming and laid-back in demeanor, he spoke without notes for about 15 minutes, covering a broad range of issues from history to culture, from economics to biotechnology. He spoke about globalization and the future of Asia with sensitivity and optimism.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Yeo represents the most outstanding achievers of the generation after Lee Kwan Yew, who were not specifically trained to become politicians.</span></strong> A Catholic in a predominantly Buddhist society, he earned a first honors degree in engineering from Cambridge University on a scholarship. He rose to become brigadier general in the Singapore Air Force, and then took an MBA at Harvard Business School.</p>
              <p>A close friend of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, Yeo will lose his Cabinet position. It is no small irony that this man who pledged to be the voice of reform in the People’s Action party should be the main casualty of the party’s perceived shortcomings.</p>
              <p>Yeo is the kind of leader that Singapore needs most in a time of transition. He has his ears closely pressed to the global ground in which his country has to manage the contingencies of its transformation into a fully modern society.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> If Singapore were the Philippines, Yeo would be the opposition’s best bet in the next election.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> But he’s not a politician, and he seems, in any case, far too ahead of his country’s politics.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Apparently, from an e-mail i received, other people also suspect that all that the PAP did in the last election is strategic. These are their comments.</p>
              <p>1. The PAP knew that this time LTK is
               going to contest the Aljunied<br>GRC, especially after the electoral boundaries were redrawn. They had<br>factored that in and they knew that Aljunied is a goner in that case.<br>There was apparently considerable thinking to
               move George to East Coast GRC<br>so that his success is guaranteed. This was mooted by GCT. It carried<br>through the day and apparently George was also sure that he would be moved<br>to East Coast.</p>
              <p>Suddenly for no apparent reason, Lim Swee Say was moved to East Coast<br>GRC and George was retained at Aljunied. Apparently the decision was taken<br>by LHL, TCH and WKS. No one knows the rationale for that decision. There<br>are 2 theories going around.<br><br>One, they didn't want to sacrifice Lim Swee Say and wanted a safe seat<br>for him. Second, some sections in the PAP believed that George was gaining<br>international stature (much more than the PM himself) and wanted to cut him<br>down. He was also considered to be GCT's man and LHL wanted him<br>out respectably. One should also note that it is only GCT who is making<br>statements supporting George. LHL is conspicuous by his silence on GCT.<br>LKY's threat to Aljunied residents (leaving residents confused
               as per<br>George, while causing more Aljunied residents to be frustrated &amp; vote for<br>Workers' Party) is actually sounding the death knell for George (and do<br>S'poreans still think that LKY is old &amp; senile?). So, PAP wants George to<br>lose. LTK has questioned the rally attendees that if George is so important<br>to the PAP team, why doesn't<br>George be removed from Aljunied GRC. If this has even some truth to it, one<br>can easily speculate that there's enough dissent even within PAP ranks<br>and one just has to wait for Mentor Lee to exit for the dissent to come<br>out in the open. They have given up on Aljunied and Hougang.<br><br>What's next for George? Could he stand for the coming President election?<br>Or hop on in another high profile job in the civil service? You draw<br>your own conclusion.</p>
              <p>So, you think the PAP are morons??? Think again..<br><br>PAP is using Tin Pei Ling as test-water (as a young candidate). In<br>GE2016, the most exciting
               moment is the arrival of Li ShengWu (elder son<br>of Lee Hsien Yang), LKY grandson and he should be 28 years old by then<br>to continue the process of dynasty building.<br><br>Other possible candidates in 2016:</p>
              <p>1. Li HonYi (elder son of LHL/Ho Ching)<br>Li was apparently being groomed for a future leadership role after being<br>awarded a government scholarship to study economics at the Massachusetts<br>Institute of Technology (in 2008). The Singapore military has served as<br>a training ground for political leaders and executives in state<br>companies.<br><br>2. Teo Eng Siang (son of Teo Chee Hean)<br>Singapore pays S$280,825 for tuition for Teo's son - Teo Eng Siang was<br>awarded a Public Service Commission Scholarship in a public ceremony by<br>his own daddy, Singapore Admiral and Minister Teo Chee Hean. Young Teo<br>now(2008) heads for the United States where he will be attending Brown<br>University in Providence, Rhode Island. Brown
               University is a<br>fashionable Ivy Leage school and has a huge annual tuition of US$42,303,<br>or US$169,202 (S$280,825) for the full four years. Don't you think there<br>are needier students in Singapore?<br><br>3.Warren Mah<br>Warren Mah, son of Mah Bow Tan, Singapore's Minister for National<br>Development, is living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.<br>He is on a scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania from the<br>Monetary Authority of Singapore. This is Singapore Politics. The PAP do have<br>contingency and far-sight plans ahead.</p>

              <p>Ministers are reshuffled, retired all the time. I'm sure PAP got people lined up ready to replace him. He already said 5 years more is the max he will serve.</p>

              <div id="post-body-5000513554218005473" class="post-body entry-content" style="width: 509px; position: relative; line-height: 1.4;">Now that George Yeo is quitting politics, many people are saying that this is such a pity for Singapore's foreign affairs. Personally I am somewhat hazy about what George Yeo actually achieved in this area, but perhaps that's just because Singapore's foreign affairs is not an area to which I've paid that much attention.<br><br>Instead I will remember George Yeo as the minister who brought the casinos to Singapore. Yes, in case you've forgotten, George was the guy who first proposed the idea and pushed for it. Even within the PAP, there was plenty of debate and resistance about the casino proposal (to such an extent that another ex-minister, Lim Boon Heng, recently broke down in tears when he revisited those memories). But in the end George prevailed. <br><br>(George Yeo was also the man who famously said, "But we are building integrated resorts, not casinos". I found this statement very annoying, not merely because of its inherent dishonesty, but because it also assumed that Singaporeans were so stupid that they would fall for it. However, let's not digress.)<br><br>George Yeo's true legacy for Singapore is the casinos, for they will continue to exert an influence and impact on our society long after George himself is dead and gone. Billion-dollar infrastructure projects backed by serious international investors will not just fold up and expire tomorrow - once they are here, they are here to stay.<br><br>I am not one of those people who are fervently against casinos. Firstly I am not a Christian nor a Muslim and therefore have no religious objections against gambling. <br><br>Secondly, I recognise that the casinos do earn easy tourist dollars and create jobs (even though I do not think well of many of these jobs - would you really encourage your son to pursue a career as a professional croupier?). <br><br>Thirdly, I am not terribly persuaded by the argument that the casinos will spawn widespread gambling addictions among our people. That's because (in my view) such addictions may just as well arise in relation to 4D, Toto, Big Sweep or mahjong, all of which are forms of gambling which were here in Singapore long before the casinos ever came.<br><br><strong>My concern about the casinos is that they will breed a lot of crime in Singapore.</strong> As long-time readers of this blog know, I began my legal career as a DPP, working frequently with the police as well as with CPIB and the Central Narcotics Bureau. Through my work experience, I have developed an intuitive sense of the kinds of environments and conditions under which crime, like magic, will spontaneously appear and flourish. <br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Casinos strike me as a rich, natural breeding ground for many types of crimes. Casinos are to criminals what garbage dumps are to rats, or shit is to houseflies. Specifically, a casino environment is supportive of the following species of criminal offences - theft, robbery, extortion, cheating, drug trafficking, consumption of illegal drugs, illegal moneylending, money laundering, vice activities, human trafficking and other immigration-related offences.</span></strong><br><br>The two casinos have opened only in the recent past, so some of you will argue that it is too early to say if I am right or wrong. In fact I hope to be proven wrong about what I have said about the casinos - for who would want to live in a crime-infested country? Nevertheless, we can already begin to get a flavour of George Yeo's true legacy for Singapore.
