              <p>This quite good, a recommended reading.</p>
              <p>Some quotes from this :</p>
              <p><strong>A/Prof George observed that the results for the Singapore Democratic 
                  Party (SDP) showed that the majority of Singaporeans still rejected 
                  progressive positions</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>A/Prof Tambyah next highlighted that consistently across all three 
                  newspapers, PAP candidates were, more often than not, shown in positive 
                  photos as compared to opposition candidates. He also noted that readers generally needed to flip to Page 6 of any 
                  newspaper before news of an opposition party appeared. This was 
                  contrasted with the PAP receiving the front page coverage on every day 
                  of the election campaign.</strong></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>However, Mr Au cautioned against the SDP moving its platform closer to 
                  where the majority of voters were located, simply to gain votes, as that
                   could jeopardise the SDP’s existing support base without any assurance 
                  of winning more support. He also noted that the WP was ideologically 
                  very close to the PAP, which represented a risk to the WP since 
                  successful reform by the PAP would remove the incentive for many voters 
                  to vote for the WP instead of the PAP.</strong></p>

              <p>Malaysia’s opinion research firm Merdeka Center carried out telephone
                               interviews among 611 Singaporeans between 27 April and 5 May in the 
                              run-up to Singapore’s general election which shows an increasingly 
                              polarized electorate. (read more <a href="http://www.merdeka.org/index.html">here</a>)</p>
              <p>While the older generation of voters and the middle class are largely
                               supportive of the ruling PAP, the percentage dropped significantly 
                              among younger voters and the higher income groups.</p>
              <p>A significant minority of Singaporeans who earn more than $5,000 
                              monthly and those between the ages of 21 and 29 did not have confident 
                              in the PAP’s renewal process compared to the rest of the population:</p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka011.jpg"><img title="merdeka01" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka011.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="357"></a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The same group of Singaporeans also felt strongly that Singapore 
                              should have a stronger opposition in parliament. More than 70 percent of
                               young Singaporeans between the ages of 21 and 40 Singaporeans think so 
                              as compared to less than 60 percent for the older generation of 
                              Singaporeans:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka02.jpg"><img title="merdeka02" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka02.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="357"></a></p>
              <p>Not surprisingly, the percentage of Singaporeans who perceived the 
                              opposition as being credible declined from the younger to older age 
                              groups. 44 percent of Singaporeans between the ages of 21 and 29 trust 
                              the opposition as compared to only 25 percent for those above the age of
                               40.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><a href="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka03.jpg"><img title="merdeka03" src="http://singaporege2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/merdeka03.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="357"></a></p>
              <p>The statistics appeared to commensurate with the sources of 
                              information from which Singaporeans obtained news about the election 
                              from.</p>
              <p>Despite the high internet penetration rate of Singapore, only 25 
                              percent of the population obtained their news from the internet as 
                              compared to over 70 percent for both the newspapers and TV channels.</p>
              <p>In general, Singaporeans who are exposed to the internet are more 
                              likely to trust and support the opposition. 55 percent of  Singaporeans 
                              between the ages of 21 and 29 obtained their primary and secondary 
                              sources of news from the internet.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
              <p>1. The Singapore electorate is becoming increasingly polarized along 
                              the lines of generation and class with younger and richer Singaporeans 
                              switching their support away from the PAP to the opposition.</p>
              <p>2. The internet plays a key role in influencing the choice of younger
                               voters, but has limited reach among the older generation of 
                              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Future trend:</strong></p>
              <p>1. Going by current trend, the PAP is likely to suffer a gradual 
                              decline in support among Singaporeans as younger Singaporeans enter the 
                              voting pool to replace the older generation.</p>
              <p>2. The new media’s influence will continue to grow with more 
                              alternative news portals like ‘The Satay Club’ making their mark in the 
                              socio-political blogosphere as established sites like the ‘Temasek 
                              Review’ builds on its existing readership.</p>
              <p>3. Social media will tilt the playing field further in favor of the 
                              opposition which has Facebook pages with the highest number of ‘likes’.</p>
              <p>4. Younger and richer Singaporeans who want a more robust opposition 
                              in parliament to check on the PAP are unlikely to support the PAP and 
                              their views will rub off on future generation of voters.</p>
              <p>5.  The PAP should expect its percentage of votes to slide further in
                               the next general election with the loss of more seats to the opposition
                               as its support base becomes diluted by an increasing number of young 
                              Singaporeans who are inclined to support the opposition.</p>

              <p>Opposition have to do a lot of ground work even after elections are over, working the ground maintaining contacts with residents to continue and also to gain more voters trust and faith in the opposition.</p>
              <p>Even within their ranks, some opposition cadidates like NSP's Gilbert Goh have to go and work overseas again as there's no jobs for him in Singapore. People like James Gomez might have to work overseas again. But a least for Gilbert Goh have a website called http://www.transitioning.org/author/gilbert-goh/ that can help him at least maintain a profile web presence.</p>
              <p>Overseas party members can try to blog or return occasionally back to Singapore to at least maintain some form of communications.</p>

              <p>The internet advantage that the opposition holds must not be lost, they must continue with the good work so sfar and continue it with credible form of information for supporters and detractors alike.</p>
              <p>The workers party have revamped their website, so good work on their part. Their website before the elction is horrendous but now it is good, on par with the rest of the opposition parties if not better.</p>

              <p>The oppostion should have more avenues for receiving residents feedback regarding national issues. Residents who write to opposition parties should include their real particulars. Their will help them gather feedback and formulate responses to hopeless government policies, building up a database of information to be used to couner whatever denial the government could muster. Surveys and so on should be conducted and made known to public through each opposition web sites. Main Stream media is still not credible, despite them trying, they are still a mouthpiece for the government.</p>
              <p>Oppositions should run their media wing the same way, newspapers and broadcasts do, at least in the way facts are being present, in the vein of having surveys done and then presenting arguments whether government policies are working or not.</p>
              <p>This will present a side of opposition that engages the public, formulates policies and also exposes the problems facing citizens in a credible manner.</p>
              <p>Articles have to be done with surveys, facts and figures gathered from the public. Issuing ideas will not convert non-belivers to the side of opposition. Present viewpoints with facts and figures, IMO, stand a better chance.</p>
              <p>Oppositions should pool their resources in setting up a central database gathering organisation where each opposition parties will have access to to formulate wahtever each oppostion deems is the right policy changes.</p>
