              <p>THE People's Action Party (PAP) candidate for Hougang in

              <p>Mr Eric Low, 62, on Thursday told The Straits Times that age was the main factor in his desire to step aside.</p>
              <p>If he were to win in Hougang at the next polls, and victory 
              is far from certain, he would be able to serve at most another two

              <p>Mr Low first expressed these sentiments in an interview with Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao, which was published on Thursday.</p>
