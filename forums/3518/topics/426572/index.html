              <p><strong>By Seah Chiang Nee</strong></p>
              <p>For the first time in years, Singapore's opposition is  seeing a 
              little light in a dark tunnel, at least in recruiting the  
              highly-educated.</p>
              <p>An impressive number of top scholars and professionals,  including a 
              dozen with Masters and Doctorates (PhD), will likely emerge  to 
              challenge the People's Action Party (PAP) in the elections expected in  May.</p>
              <p>It is something Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew had long predicted would happen after his political retirement.</p>
              <p>He is, of course, still around, but not in the best of  health. His 
              prediction of better-quality opposition representatives is  slowly 
              coming true.</p>
              <p>The PAP has begun to introduce its 24 new candidates who as usual would likely come with high academic or professional records.</p>
              <p>This has stood the party in good stead so far, but the opposition may be narrowing the gap.</p>
              <p>Not all agree. One opposition politician admitted the going would be tough, "like fighting a tank with bows and arrows".</p>
              <p>In the previous election as quoted in the Straits  Times, the 
              opposition said 70 percent of its candidates were professionals and  
              graduates.</p>
              <p>This time the percentage would almost certainly increase, it said.</p>
              <p>A sprinkling of these opposition academic high-fliers comparative to the ruling party's, will be fielded in the coming election.</p>
              <p>They are leaders of two parties: Dr Chee Soon Juan  (Singapore 
              Democratic Party) who has a PhD in neuro-psychology and  Kenneth 
              Jeyaretnam (Reform Party) with a double first in Economics from  
              Cambridge University.</p>
              <p>Among other candidates who will stand in the elections are:</p>
              <p><strong>* </strong>Dr Vincent Wijeysingha (Reform  Party), the son of
               the respected long-standing principal of Raffles  Institution, who has a
               PhD in Sociological Studies from University of  Sheffield, England.</p>
              <p><strong>*</strong> Dr John Yam (Workers Party) who  holds a PhD 
              (Australia) and Masters in Business Administration  (Scotland) and 
              Electrical Engineering degree (Singapore).</p>
              <p><strong>*</strong> Husband-and-wife team of government  scholars and 
              civil service high-flyers Tony Tan (engineering) and Hazel  Poa (maths),
               who obtained first-class honours from Cambridge University.</p>
              <p><strong>*</strong> Wong Wee Nam, 63 with a PhD from Imperial College who last stood as a Workers Party candidate in 2006.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are now waiting anxiously to see whether  another 
              prominent scholar, Chen Show Mao, will stand as a Workers Party  
              candidate.</p>
              <p>Chen, an ex-Rhodes Scholar, has a doctorate in law from America's Stanford University.</p>
              <p>Likewise, the ruling party still has tons of achievers joining its ranks, which will take a book to fill.</p>
              <p>Is a candidate's degree still important to the 21st Century voter?</p>
              <p>The answer is yes probably more so than in most  countries. This 
              sacred cow may be around for quite awhile even after MM  Lee's 
              departure.</p>
              <p>Forty years ago, when I first started reporting  elections, the 
              profile of candidates often ranged from bicycle shop  owners to factory 
              supervisors — not very highly educated -- like the  electorate.</p>
              <p>As time passed by, academic levels of both steadily rose to a level when voters would shun candidates without a degree.</p>
              <p>For many elderly citizens, the higher the degree the better!</p>
              <p>Less enamoured are younger citizens who are blaming  their country's 
              ills in the past five years on scholars who planned and  carried out 
              policies.</p>
              <p>The whole thing was introduced by Lee in the early days. His views on this have not changed.</p>
              <p>His government created a scholarship system to not only  feed talent 
              to run the political and civil service leaderships but also  as 
              recruitment feeder for the PAP.</p>
              <p>Its success lies in its ability to reward scholars who  join it by 
              offering top jobs with the best pay, with the result that few  found it 
              attractive to join the opposition.</p>
              <p>Lee had shaped the scholarship system along China's  imperial exams 
              for the Emperor to select the best scholars who would be  sent far and 
              wide to serve as magistrates and administrators to  represent him in 
              governing the large country.</p>
              <p>In his latest book, Lee said he believed that, in future, China's leaders would have PhDs and MBAs from American universities.</p>
              <p>Several years ago, Lee explained that one reason he had  chosen 
              Suzhou to site a joint industrial park was because of its  talents.</p>
              <p>"Look at China. The bright ones came from everywhere. You can be the son of a farmer or worker.</p>
              <p>"If you pass the Imperial Examinations ... you're a xiu  cai (county 
              scholar) or a jun shi (military strategist), or a zhuang  yuan (top 
              imperial scholar).</p>
              <p>"If you are the highest scorer in the examination, chances are the Emperor will want you to marry his daughter.</p>
              <p>"When these scholars retire, they go to a place with a milder climate along the Yangtze river." said Lee.</p>
              <p>"That was Suzhou, which became a popular place for ex-Imperials to live with their multiple wives and children.</p>
              <p>"That's why we chose Suzhou. It succeeded. We were  dealing with 
              extremely smart and bright people, brighter than the people  we sent.</p>
              <p>"Our people have the knowledge; they didn't but they had a fine IQ." Lee added.</p>
              <p>That was a tacit admission that Singapore's breed of  scholars may 
              not fare well in a changing world against natural  intelligence.</p>
              <p>Two months ago in a moment of candour, Lee predicted that the PAP's rule in Singapore would one day come to an end.</p>
              <p>"There will come a time when the public would  eventually say: 'Look,
               let's try the other side either because the PAP  has declined in 
              quality or the opposition has put up a team which is  equal to the PAP's
               and they'll say, let's try the other side'," Lee  wrote.</p>

              <p>Ms Tin Pei Ling, seen here speaking to the media after a press 
              conference at the PAP's headquarters on Monday, has had pictures from 
              her Facebook account posted online. Netizens have also raged over the 
              27-year-old's youth, and alleged that she was being fielded because of 
              her husband's position as principal private secretary to Prime Minister 
              Lee Hsien Loong. -- ST PHOTO: NG SOR LUAN</p>
              <p>NEW People's Action Party (PAP) candidates may have been prepared 
              beforehand for a frosty reception in cyberspace, but the speed and 
              malice with which some of them are being picked apart online have come 
              as a shock.<br><br>Within days and sometimes hours of their introduction
               to the media as PAP candidates, private pictures and even court 
              documents have been dug up and disseminated online, and forums lit up 
              with debate and speculation.<br><br>Although the new candidates admit 
              that the sound and fury of cyberspace has taken them aback, they say 
              they are trying to tune out the most vicious comments and focus on 
              working the ground for the coming general election.<br><br>The two female candidates introduced thus far have been the subject of the most intense scrutiny online.<br><br>Pictures
               from the Facebook account of the PAP's youngest female candidate, 
              27-year-old business consultant Tin Pei Ling, showing her posing with a 
              Kate Spade shopping bag or with her husband on holiday, were posted on 
              various websites and blogs.<br><br>Netizens have also raged over her 
              young age, and alleged that her being fielded was due to her husband's 
              position as principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien 
              Loong.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">In the case of Ms Foo Mee Har,</span></strong> the Standard Chartered banker, an application for a bankruptcy order 
              against a Mr Bernard Chan, who netizens claim is her husband, has spread
               to various forums.<br><br>The fact that she became a Singaporean only in 2008 has also come under heavy fire online.<br><br><strong><span style="font-size: medium;">For Dr Janil Puthucheary, another new candidate</span></strong> whose status as a new citizen has also ruffled feathers, what surprised
               him was 'how readily people are willing to make stuff up'.<br><br>'If the forums are to be believed, I have betrayed both my 'Malaysian' wife and my 'dead' father,' he quipped.<br><br>For
               the record, he pointed out that his wife is Singaporean, and his 
              father, former Internal Security Act detainee Dominic Puthucheary, is 
              still alive.<br><br>The latter was detained in 1963, before Singapore 
              became independent. The Internal Security Council then comprised 
              representatives from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain.<br><br>During Dr 
              Puthucheary's introduction as a new candidate last week, he told the 
              media that he once promised his wife not to enter politics, but later 
              sought her permission to do so.<br><br><span style="color: #000000;">As for 
              criticism that he did not serve national service, as he became a 
              Singapore citizen at the age of 35, the paediatrician said he has been 
              in public service: 'I've spent the last 10 years saving kids' lives.'</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span><br>Both female candidates told The Straits Times that their focus is on their grassroots work and reaching out to residents.<br><br>Ms Tin has now made her Facebook pictures private.<br><br>Ms
               Foo did not want to respond to online comments about her husband, Mr 
              Chan, apart from saying that he works as a general manager at an 
              information technology firm.<br><br>Separately, a Straits Times check 
              revealed that Mr Chan has never been made bankrupt and that the 
              bankruptcy order against him, brought by Standard Chartered Bank, was 
              later withdrawn.<br><br>Political observers interviewed by The Straits 
              Times were split on whether the online firestorm is par for the course 
              in politics, or has crossed the line.<br><br>Former Nominated MP Siew 
              Kum Hong, for example, spoke out against the personal attacks on Ms Tin,
               writing on his blog that 'this is not what I want Singapore politics to
               be like'.<br><br>He told The Straits Times that the 'unfounded insinuations' made about her 'are quite offensive and to my mind beyond the pale'.<br><br>However,
               he defended the role of socio-political websites and Internet forums in
               subjecting political candidates to rightful scrutiny of their public 
              statements and track records.<br><br>Some online have justified the 
              attacks on Ms Tin and other new PAP candidates as mud-slinging which is 
              to be expected in politics, in Singapore or elsewhere.<br><br>It has 
              also been pointed out that the PAP itself has a rich history of lobbing 
              verbal grenades - and worse - at selected political opponents.<br><br>But
               Mr Siew argued that the two are separate matters: 'The PAP has been and
               will be judged by those actions. Many do not agree with those actions 
              and accordingly take a negative view of the PAP. But those of us on the 
              Internet will also be judged by our actions.'<br><br>As for any actual 
              impact that the cyberstorm may have on the new candidates or the PAP at 
              the polls, Nanyang Technological University associate professor Cherian 
              George believes that there may be none, as the Internet could just be 
              'making visible what was being said in countless conversations in 
              elections past'.<br><br>'We can probably trust in Singaporeans' ability to distinguish relevant arguments from cheap shots,' he added.</p>

              'Malaysian' wife and my 'dead' father,' he quipped.<br> <br> For the record, he pointed out that his wife is Singaporean, and
              his father, former Internal Security Act detainee Dominic
              Puthucheary, is still alive.<br> <br> The latter was detained in 1963, before Singapore became
              independent. The Internal Security Council then comprised
              representatives from Singapore, Malaysia and Britain.<br> <br> During Dr Puthucheary's introduction as a new candidate last week,
              he told the media that he once promised his wife not to enter
              politics, but later sought her permission to do so.<br> <br> <span style="color: #000000;">As for criticism that he did not
              serve national service, as he became a Singapore citizen at the age
              of 35, the paediatrician said he has been in public service: 'I've
              spent the last 10 years saving kids' lives.'</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span><br> Both female candidates told The Straits Times that their focus is

              <p>i remembered how the PAP looked down on the opposition candidates as a bunch of not-as-highly-educated people, saying that the best are already taken up by the PAP.</p>
              <p>So, who do they end up filling their ranks with? 27 yr old greenhorn, with at most 5 yrs of working experience.</p>
              <p>and opposition are now attracting highly educated PHD holders. And not just any phd issued by some unheard-of university, but rather, top notch uni such as stanford.</p>

              <p>Dr Junil, my word for you is you avoid the NS. You save kids
              live is because you are well paid for your work done. it is a job!!
              you are not doing national service. Maybe you should serve the NS
              first before you open your mouth!!. only mentally sick, handicapp
              can avoid NS in singapore, not a man!!</p>
