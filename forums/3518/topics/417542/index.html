              <p>In his latest speech, Goh said that one of the purposes of <a name="return1">Group Representation Constituencies</a> <a href="http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2006/yax-615.htm#foot1">[1]</a> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">was to help People's Action Party (PAP) candidates win election easily. </span></strong></p>
              <p>There! He has admitted it. The State and its electoral system have been corrupted to serve partisan ends.</p>
              <p>Goh was quite brazen about it. He said that the role of GRCs was not just to ensure minorities are adequately represented -– a nearly 2-decades-old justification for GRCs. By doing so, he has conceded that for the last 2 decades, the PAP been less than truthful about their motives.</p>
              <p>His logic was that the ends justify the means.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> The PAP wanted to put "younger and capable candidates" into Parliament, but they might not want to risk their careers to join politics. Solution? Remove risk. Change the electoral system.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Not only do we have a winner-takes-all effect in GRCs, in practice, every GRC team is led by a minister or political heavyweight and new candidates get into office by riding their coattails.</p>
              <p>The arrogance displayed by such distortions to a democratic system that we inherited from the British may be bad enough, but now, there is the added arrogance of Goh saying to the effect that: Yes we distorted the system at the price of fairness, so what?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are not even ashamed of themselves.</span></strong></p>

              <p>this mah clown...dunno whether to thank him or kill him. Thank him because I will have a hefty bit of estate money to inherit in future. Kill him because I think he made life pretty tough for young singaporeans especially? Well didnt affect me though becos I'm not based in sg. But it was definitely one of the push factors for me because I dont want my children to suffer under such weight of future property prices.</p>
              <p>I remember he was once shown on TV questioned by one of the opposition members on why he has not disclosed the breakdown of HDB prices. Yeh one of those election walkabouts. His answer was a counter question....one which asked how the opposition member arrived at the cost price of $70k. That's pretty lame shit from an experienced MP.

              <p>where got earn a few hundred k when you downgrade..</p>
              <p>for example you sell off your 4 room flat and buy a 3 room flat I don't think you will earn a feew hundred k too</p>
              <p>As for illness, I think most people will buy insurance and it covers their illness..</p>
