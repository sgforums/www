              <h2><span style="color: black;">To the Men-in-White</span></h2>
              <p><span style="color: black;">Sunday,
              24 April 2011 at 22:14</span> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color: black;">You guys were once my heroes. When
              I was young, I was so proud that I had a government that was indeed one of the
              world's best, if not, THE BEST. Although LKY was (and still is) portrayed as a
              fearsome, if ruthless leader, he was much respected. When he appeared as our PM
              on the world stage, my heart never failed to swell with pride because it was
              obvious that he was also someone other world leaders respected.<br>  <br> But not now. The problem is, you are victims of your own success. And the world
              has changed, yet you remain stuck in the 1960s. This is why your once-fantastic
              branding is being eroded, why I find it hard to support you like before.<br>  <br> </span><em><span style="color: black;">1) You
              were too successful</span></em><span style="color: black;"><br> First, there was LKY and he was a great leader. He was like a god and still
              being treated like one. He "miraculously" transformed a small, poor,
              resource-less little island into a country that now has one of the highest GDPs
              in the world, where other countries are now trying to learn from. No one can
              take that achievement away from the first PAP team and indeed, I would guess
              that this is also the main reason why many in the older generation are still
              your loyal fans. I may not agree to all the strategies you've used then (and
              some were downright questionable) but I can't deny that you had some very good
              reasons to do so. But unfortunately, when you've set the standard of governance
              so high, every other subsequent PAP team that comes along can only look worse
              and worse. And it doesn't help that you constantly try too hard to be perfect.
              The higher the bar is set, the more difficult it is for the PAP teams that come
              after to match it. In a way, I think LKY only does his own team a great
              disservice by publishing so many personal memoirs, recounting again and again
              how good he was. Because the more god-like he is, the more voters like me will
              wonder, how can we ever have another "god" like him to lead us? And
              the answers you propose will always be a disappointment. Because, against a
              god, everyone will look like a mere mortal. Didn't anyone tell you that you
              can't replicate a god using your same old cookie-cutter?!! Great leaders are
              first of all rebels, don't you know (and LKY was one too!)?<br>  <br> </span><em><span style="color: black;">2) You
              were too smart for your own good</span></em><span style="color: black;"><br> No one can or has been able to rival you in terms of your (mostly) rational and
              well-thought through, sound policies. Especially in terms of our economic
              policies. You're so darn good with your cost-benefit analyses, your economic
              forecasts, your financial planning. Every policy you rolled out is justified
              using very rational arguments that the opposition and the public find hard to
              counter argue. You are top-notch, because you have a very brainy team, all with
              impeccable qualifications from world renowned universities. Unfortunately, this
              made you assume that only you have the brains and everyone else is just an
              idiot who needs only to listen and obey. The game of politics cannot be played
              by cold logic alone. And it certainly can't be won by treating your voters as
              morons.<br>  <br> An example of this would be the issue of bringing in the IRs. Yes, your cold,
              rational argument makes very good economic reasons for having casinos in
              Singapore. No one can argue against that. But not everything can or should be
              measured by dollars and cents or by the amount of GDP it will generate for Sg.
              We're no longer the generation in the 1960s that constantly had to worry about
              money or material matters. We've moved up the Maslow's hierarchy of needs. In
              fact, most Singaporeans work ridiculously long hours, are constantly too
              stressed to even go on dates or have sex (hence the low marriage and fertility
              rate) that we're all very very disillusioned with the constant drive for
              wealth. Increasingly, we want to slow down, have time to smell the flowers and
              be with our families. And having casinos that will bring in more crime
              (organised ones too), encourage more addictive behaviour and increase broken
              families will not sit well with a population who now values quality of life
              rather than personal wealth. Yet, you bull-dosed these concerns and won yet
              again with your cold, rational, economic arguments because there wasn't enough
              opposition in the parliament to stop you.<br>  <br> While people may buy into the cold logic of your policies now, your lack of
              empathy and human touch are slowly alienating voters. The breaking point may
              not be now, but you can be sure that the disconnection is getting wider by the
              day. It's a time-bomb that will go off at some point.<br>  <br> </span><em><span style="color: black;">3) You
              forgot evolutionary laws, history and your own past</span></em><span style="color: black;"><br> While you're very brainy, you're mostly all technocrats and specialists. You've
              scorned the social sciences and the humanities, you think these are only for
              sissy people whose A Levels don't qualify them for specialist degrees. Yet, if
              you had been more well-informed in these areas, you might have learnt some
              valuable lessons about power. History, for example, is the best teacher that
              could have taught you that power never ever ever ever lasts forever. Indeed,
              the more you try to hang on to it, the more it will invite adversity. History
              would also have taught you that every regime was once in opposition. As Marx
              could have told you, the history of mankind is all about class (or power)
              struggles. You may be in power now, but one day you'll be overthrown. However,
              you have hope of leaving your great legacy behind if you take a leaf from the
              pages of human evolution, which would have taught you that it's human diversity
              that has helped the human race to overcome the odds, to survive this long. But
              instead of embracing diversity, you tried your hardest to kill off any form of
              alternative views, whether these come from within your party or externally. You
              only wanted to hear your own voice or voices that are exactly the same as
              yours. This inbreeding will eventually be your demise. Most of all, you forgot
              your own roots, where you were once an opposition party too. You focused so
              much on hanging on to your power, you forgot your original vision, you forgot
              your voters and you forgot why you are governing Singapore.<br>  <br> </span><em><span style="color: black;">4) Power
              breeds fear and paranoia</span></em><span style="color: black;"><br> In the beginning, you used power in order to stabilise the political situation
              so that you can give the masses homes, food, clean water and their livelihoods.
              That seemed a justifiable use of power even though it involved some ruthless
              and ugly tactics. But over the years, you started to crave power for itself.
              Again, you forgot the story of Macbeth (see, I told you the humanities are
              important!!) - where an originally good leader was so obsessed with his new
              power that he saw everything as a threat towards it. He became so paranoid that
              he even killed his best friend whom he thought was after his throne. He only
              heard what he wanted to hear from dubious soothsayers (which turned out to be
              half-truths). Needless to say, Macbeth eventually had a tragic end. Like
              Macbeth, you've become so obsessed with winning overwhelmingly in every GE that
              you use every weapon you have, every trick up your sleeves to clobber the
              opposition to smithereens. Smear campaigns, legal suits, changing electoral
              boundaries, raising the cost of candidature, forming GRCs, threatening the
              electorate with upgrading...it's like watching the Brazilian football team beat
              the Singapore team by 82-2, except in football the rules are fairer and the
              referee neutral. Why do you need to resort to such gangster-like ways? You
              could have won overwhelmingly anyway with all the talent you have! I'm not sure
              how long this bullying strategy can go on but sooner or later you'll become the
              thug that the electorate can't wait to get rid of.<br>  <br> </span><em><span style="color: black;">5) Power
              corrupts absolutely</span></em><span style="color: black;"><br> Power is not power without money. And in this aspect you've outdone yourselves
              by pegging your salaries to the private sector. You're the highest paid
              politicians in the world and your income is &gt;40 times that of the median
              income of the general population (only less than Kenya). Of course, you justify
              it with yet another one of your cold, rational arguments of attracting and
              retaining the best talents in the government. But seriously, how can you
              compare public sector salaries to the private sector? In fact, many of your
              candidates have never worked in the private sector before and one wonders if
              they'll survive even for a day in a private company. Yet, they are paid private
              sector salaries, paid not from profits but from taxpayers' money. And though I
              fully agree that politicians must be paid their worth, don't you think getting
              40x the median income is crossing into the lines of corruption? Ok, even if all
              our Ministers and PM are worth every cent of their $4m annual salary, it also
              means that they have to perform much much much better than any other government
              in the world. Again, you have set the standards and expectations so high, you
              only have yourselves to blame when you cannot meet those expectations from the
              ground. And the more you fail to meet their expectations, the more the
              electorate will think you're not worth your astronomical salaries. It's a
              vicious cycle that you've started and it's going to be very hard to stop now.<br>  <br> You talk about the so-called "crutch-mentality" of the poor, yet this
              same mentality can be applied on yourselves. When you've used money as the main
              means to attract people into your party, you've basically recruited people who
              value money above serving the country in the people's interest. These
              politicians who are in it for the money will not have the incentive to think
              independently or to represent the people's interests because they've got
              millions to lose if they don't toe party lines. Because they're paid millions,
              what incentives do they have to empathize with someone struggling with 2 jobs
              to make ends meet? Very soon, the voters will feel that you're just a bunch of
              corrupt officials, no different from those in many 3rd-world countries.<br>  <br> The way I see it, you only have yourselves to blame for this situation you're
              in. The only way you can somehow reverse these trends is to learn from Madonna
              (see, you never thought popular culture could teach you anything right?). She
              keeps herself relevant not by sticking to the same old formula again and again.
              That would have killed her career long ago as it did to countless of other pop
              stars. Rather, she keeps re-inventing herself and her image to keep them
              relevant to the current times. And she pushes the boundaries. She's always
              ahead of her time and like a true leader, she sets the trends not follow them.
              She's a rebel. Yet, all you have done is to remain exactly the same as you were
              in 1960s. The electorate is increasingly tired of your same old scare tactics
              using HDB upgrading as a stick, tired of you saying that Singapore will go to
              ruins if the opposition wins, tired of you always using smear campaigns against
              opposition candidates, tired of your arrogance and lack of empathy, tired of
              you giving out inconsequential hongbaos before elections only to increase your
              own salaries by millions after.<br>  <br> You keep encouraging us to think out-of-the-box, yet you're perpetually stuck
              in the same adversarial mindset towards the opposition. If you can only start
              to think of your relationship with the opposition as a mutual symbiosis - you share
              a portion of power with them in return for your longevity and credibility.
              Power is always temporary, but your legacy needn't be. Just look at the current
              Conservative Party of UK which traces its roots back to the Tory Party in 1678.
              Do you think they could have survived this long without any meaningful
              opposition, no defeats, no radical internal reforms? Are you so politically
              shortsighted that you can only see your future in the next 10, 20 or 50 years?
              C'mon, think further!! And didn't anyone tell you that in other to be the best,
              you need to have competition? Otherwise, how can the electorate be sure that
              you're indeed the best, if they can't compare you to any other party?<br>  <br> I'm no military strategist, but I do think that sometimes, you need to lose
              some battles first in order to win bigger battles later. It will not be a bad
              thing for you to lose a few GRCs in this GE. In fact, if I were you, I will be
              celebrating. Because nothing gets people going like failure. Rather lose some
              small battles now than to wait for the big bomb to explode later. By then, not
              only will you disappear into the dust heap of history, so too will Singapore.
              That will be your ultimate betrayal to this country that you so painstakingly
              and successfully created out of a little red dot on the map.</span></p>

They are (from left) Mr Koo Young, Mr Ong Lian Teng, Mr Tan Cheng Tong, Mr Chia Thye Poh and Mr Poh Ber Liak. -- ST FILE PHOTOS</em></span> <br><br>WHEN National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Ong Ye Kung, 41, was unveiled as a People's Action Party (PAP) candidate for the coming polls, Singaporeans were astonished to learn that his father was one of the Barisan Sosialis MPs who sought to overthrow the PAP Government in the 1960s. <br><br>Mr Ong Lian Teng, who died in 2009 aged 74, was once a firebrand leftist politician and one of the 13 Barisan Sosialis representatives elected in the crucial 1963 General Election.<br><br>He was among the group of Barisan MPs who took their party's struggle to the streets. They marched to Parliament House with their supporters to hand in their resignation letters on Oct 8, 1966.<br><br>As the picture above shows, they posed behind a black banner with the seven Chinese characters - guo hui min zhu yi si wang, meaning 'parliamentary democracy is dead' - outside the chamber's building before riot policemen dispersed them.<br><br>The elder Ong was an active Chinese community leader in rural Singapore in 1961 when he joined Barisan, a breakaway faction of the PAP which came into power three years earlier. <br><br>The camp led by leftist trade unionist Lim Chin Siong was opposed to the PAP's founding secretary-general Lee Kuan Yew and company over Singapore's merger with Malaysia and other ideological issues.<br><br>Mr Ong was one of the few remaining Barisan MPs who boycotted Singapore's first Parliament session after its independence in August 1965 to resign his seat, claiming that parliamentary democracy was dead after a series of government arrests just before and after the 1963 elections. <br><br>The crackdown included Operation Cold Store in February, which imprisoned more than 110 activists, and Operation Pechah in October, which rounded up another 190.<br><br>Three of the 13 Barisan MPs - trade unionists S.T. Bani, Lee Tee Tong and Loh Miaw Gong - were among those arrested in Operation Pechah on the eve of an industrial strike planned by the then left-wing Singapore Association of Trade Unions (Satu).<br><br>Mr Bani, who was Satu's president, resigned from Barisan and his seat in Parliament on his release, following a public confession on Jan 9, 1966. Both Madam Loh and Mr Lee resigned from Parliament later in 1966 while they were still in prison.<br><br>Three other elected members, Mr Chan Sun Wing, Mr Wong Soon Fong and Mr Tan Cheng Tong, were among the original 13 leftist PAP legislative assemblymen who broke away from the PAP to form Barisan in 1961. After escaping arrest in Operation Pechah, Mr Chan and Mr Wong vacated their parliamentary seats. They now live in exile in Southern Thailand.<br><br>Mr Lim Huan Boon, a chemistry graduate from the former Nanyang University (Nantah) was the first to quit in December 1965, four months after Singapore's independence. He resigned from Barisan and his seat in Parliament because he disagreed with party chairman Dr Lee Siew Choh's decision to opt for 'extra-parliamentary struggle', claiming Singapore's independence was phoney and there was no parliamentary democracy.<br><br>Now 82, Mr Lim, who is better known as a Malay language scholar today, had said that Barisan should not have boycotted Parliament.<br><br>Explaining his decision to retire from politics for good, he had said: 'I joined Barisan because I was against merger with Malaysia. With Singapore's independence, there is nothing for me to fight for.'<br><br>His departure was followed in January 1966 by that of Mr Chio Cheng Thun and Mr Kow Kee Seng, who were also at loggerheads with Dr Lee.<br><br>With the opposition bench empty, the PAP held and won all the by-elections to fill the seats, resulting in its total dominance of Parliament until 1981 when Anson was captured by then Workers' Party secretary-general J.B. Jeyaretnam in a by-election.<br><br>So why did the most powerful opposition party in the history of Singapore boycott Parliament, thus handing it to the PAP on a silver platter? This is one question that has long intrigued historians and political pundits.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, in the book Men In White, published by Singapore Press Holdings in 2009, called it 'a stroke of destiny' because Barisan's action led to the absence of opposition in Parliament, allowing the ruling party to focus on economic and social development unhindered and undistracted by politicking.<br><br>In the book, which featured the voices of many leftists, Barisan chairman Dr Lee defended his decision, saying the 1965 parliamentary walkout was the right move as it drew people's attention to the 'undemocratic practices' of the PAP.<br><br>For example, he said, after the September 1962 referendum on merger, Barisan MPs had been pressing the Government for an open meeting on merger, but they were always ignored.<br><br>He added: 'For quite a number of months, there was hardly any meeting in Parliament. And while we were waiting, Singapore's independence was declared!'<br><br>Instead of holding any Parliament sitting, he charged, 'there were only arrests, arrests and arrests of our people'.<br><br>On reflection, Mr Lee Tee Tong, now 79, tells Insight this week that he agreed with Dr Lee. He notes that Operation Cold Store in February 1963 had already nabbed Barisan's top leaders before the general election in September.<br><br>They included Mr Lim Chin Siong, Mr Fong Swee Suan, Dr Lim Hock Siew, Dr Poh Soo Kai, Mr S. Woodhull and Mr Dominic Puthucheary. <br><br>The son of Mr Puthucheary, Dr Janil Puthucheary, a 38-year-old paediatrician in Singapore, was also introduced as a PAP candidate last week.<br><br>Mr Lee says: 'After the general election, a second wave of arrests put more of our leaders, including myself and two other elected Barisan members, behind bars. Many others who contested unsuccessfully were also not spared.<br><br>'I don't think Barisan lost in the 1963 election for lack of good people or a better party ideology, but because of the wave after wave of arrests of our leaders.'<br><br>Another former Barisan MP, Mr Tan Cheng Tong, now 80, says he was in a fix and had no choice but to resign his Jalan Kayu seat because it was the party's position.<br><br>'Looking back, it was an extreme position that we had taken, but the actions against us then were really undemocratic,' he adds.<br><br>Former Barisan activist C.C. Chin, 70, now an independent scholar on leftist history, however, takes the view that Barisan's boycott of Parliament was political suicide.<br><br>'The party should have continued to fight the PAP constitutionally in spite of the arrests and I am sure today it will still be a political force the ruling party would have to contend with,' he argues.<br><br>He believes that the party, having taken the fight to the streets by boycotting Parliament, had lost the support and trust of the people almost completely.<br><br>He points out that when Dr Lee merged Barisan with the Workers' Party in 1988 and fielded a unified team for Eunos GRC in the general election held that year, it lost, albeit narrowly, to the PAP. Barisan was a spent force, he says.<br><br>In the view of National University of Singapore history lecturer Huang Jianli, every current situation would be contingent upon the past and no one could tell what the outcome would have been if all 13 elected Barisan MPs did not resign their seats between 1965 and 1966.<br><br>'Hypothetically speaking, there can be a broad range of possibilities. At the optimistic end of the spectrum is the possibility of greater political pluralism with a much less dominating PAP Government. At the pessimistic end is having more or less the same as today.<br><br>'This is because, given the overall authoritarian tendency of the PAP leadership, it would still probably have used other avenues and summoned other means to clamp down on alternative voices,' he says.<br><br>Dr Cheng Yinghong, an associate professor in history at Delaware State University in the United States, believes that Barisan in the 1960s was greatly influenced by the Cultural Revolution in China. Whether its elected members remained in Parliament after the 1963 General Election or not, he was pessimistic of the party's prospects.<br><br>'The Barisan was a Maoist party by the mid- and the second half of the 1960s. Globally, Maoist influence was disastrous not just in terms of its destructive impact on societies but also to leftist movements themselves.<br><br>'When I read those ferocious verbal attacks on their own comrades published in Barisan newspapers, I believed that it was fortunate that such a party failed in its struggle for state power,' he says.<br><br>-----------------------------------------<br><br>WHY BARISAN LOST <br>'I don't think Barisan lost in the 1963 election for lack of good people or a better party ideology, but because of the wave after wave of arrests of our leaders.'<br><a style="color: #e1771e;" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UJ8uzQeo9S8/TZWL9OFWagI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/EmHaLbNhC4k/s1600/Lee%2BTee%2BTong%2B-%2BST.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590528396319156738" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 330px; height: 400px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UJ8uzQeo9S8/TZWL9OFWagI/AAAAAAAAA6Q/EmHaLbNhC4k/s400/Lee%2BTee%2BTong%2B-%2BST.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><em>Mr Lee Tee Tong</em> <br>-- ST PHOTO: LEONG WENG KAM<br><br><br><a style="color: #e1771e;" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sXG7XDxjAPg/TZWMTdYw1_I/AAAAAAAAA6Y/E9kWbEQOSd0/s1600/Barisan%2B1963%2BRally%2B-%2BST.jpg"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5590528778384234482" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 330px; height: 329px; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sXG7XDxjAPg/TZWMTdYw1_I/AAAAAAAAA6Y/E9kWbEQOSd0/s400/Barisan%2B1963%2BRally%2B-%2BST.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><em>Barisan's rallies before the 1963 General Election attracted large crowds. -- ST FILE PHOTOS</em><br><br><br>Of the 13 former Barisan Sosialis MPs, six are in Singapore, two live in exile in Thailand, four have passed away, and the whereabouts of one is unknown.
