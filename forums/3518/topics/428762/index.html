              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A group 
              of residents in Clementi have expressed unhappiness over the Selective 
              En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) whereby the government identifies 
              old blocks for redevelopment.<br><br>Some residents reached out to the Reform Party, which has plans to contest the wider West Coast GRC.<br><br>Reform
               Party secretary-general Kenneth Jeyaretnam said: "For sometime we've 
              had a Facebook page for feedback from the residents of West Coast on 
              local issues and basically it's exploded. We're receiving so much 
              feedback. <br><br>"We were told by residents here about their 
              unhappiness. So we've come down (here) and find out for ourselves what's
               wrong and why they're unhappy."<br><br>Despite the invitation, 
              residents were surprised with the Reform Party's presence as they did 
              not want to politicise the situation.<br><br>The meeting was attended by about 50 homeowners at Block 322, Clementi Avenue 5.<br><br>The
               meeting was organised by a group of homeowners to collect more feedback
               to support an appeal to the Housing and Development Board (HDB).<br><br>They voiced various concerns, ranging from the compensation package being insufficient to an unwillingness to relocate.<br><br>Some
               said that although the compensation being offered is higher than the 
              current value of their flats, it is not enough to cover stamp duties, 
              levies and renovation costs.<br><br>Some also expressed difficulty getting loans from banks due to their old age.<br><br>When
               contacted, the incumbent MP Arthur Fong said he has a sense that most 
              of the residents are happy with the package and only about one out of 10
               residents has concerns.<br><br>He said he has helped this group to write in to the HDB for it to consider more favourable packages and discounts.<br><br>A reply is expected within three to six weeks.<br><br>The government in February identified Blocks 321, 322 and 323 in Clementi Avenue 5 for the SERS.<br><br>The blocks are 34 years old and are made up of 374 sold flats.<br><br>The
               HDB will build about 500 units of new two-room, three-room, four-room 
              and five-room replacement flats at Clementi Avenue 3 to re-house the 
              flat owners.<br><br>These new flats are located next to the nearby Clementi Town Centre, Clementi MRT Station and bus interchange.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Welcome RP!  Clementi is one of the most neglected towns in Singapore, mostly run by Arthur Fong.  Through the various community events, you would know that Arthur is just an arrogant private banker.  It is only recently (last 1 year) that they tried to make lift upgrading programs for blocks around Ave 2.  The terms were expensive.  When they finally announced this lift upgrading, the residents immediately acknowledged, "elections must be coming."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">PAP also closed down 2 cinemas in the interchange and up till now there is no replacement.  They rushed a shopping center just in time for this election.  But as a result the bus interchange was shifted far away from the Clementi MRT.  Old folks have to walk a far distance if they come to Clementi by MRT and would like to change to a short distance bus shuttle. This shift has also made the Clement MRT bus stop into the bus interchange's dropping off site.  Imagine how can a single bus stop along the Commonwealth Avenue West be the drop off point for an entire bus interchange?  Needless to say, that bus stop is jammed all day, and is extremely accident prone.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Clementi road is a night mare every 6pm - 8pm full of jams.  It is a special road where people would exit AYE and go north towards Ngee Ann Poly, UniSIM and Bukit Timah Road.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Stadium is completely wasted as it is on the other side of the AYE.  There is no convenient bus shuttle there as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is a completely run down Clement Woods park that has become more like a jungle than a park by now.  I even heard that there were rape cases there as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In short there are lots of room for improvement in Clementi.  We are kind of like living without a manager all these years. Activities are very localised around Blk 381 and does not spread to the rest of the town.  There were no PAP making rounds before RP mentioned that they are interested in West Coast GRP.  In fact up till today, there were still no news about PAP making rounds.  Therefore in this sense, RP has won already PAP already (well done!)  I guess our MPs are much more busy than other PAP members such as Wong Kan Seng and Goh Chok Tong. No wonder we are so neglected.  Our MPs are more like fire-fighters rather than having a plan on how to make Clementi better.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Please come and rescue us and we shall give you at least 10 years of refuge as MPs.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Welcome RP!  Clementi is one of the most neglected towns in
                  Singapore, mostly run by Arthur Fong.  Through the various
                  community events, you would know that Arthur is just an arrogant
                  private banker.  It is only recently (last 1 year) that they
                  tried to make lift upgrading programs for blocks around Ave 2.
                   The terms were expensive.  When they finally announced
                  this lift upgrading, the residents immediately acknowledged,
                  "elections must be coming."</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">PAP also closed down 2 cinemas in the interchange and up till now
                  there is no replacement.  They rushed a shopping center just
                  in time for this election.  But as a result the bus
                  interchange was shifted far away from the Clementi MRT.  Old
                  folks have to walk a far distance if they come to Clementi by MRT
                  and would like to change to a short distance bus shuttle. This
                  shift has also made the Clement MRT bus stop into the bus
                  interchange's dropping off site.  Imagine how can a single bus
                  stop along the Commonwealth Avenue West be the drop off point for
                  an entire bus interchange?  Needless to say, that bus stop is
                  jammed all day, and is extremely accident prone.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Clementi road is a night mare every 6pm - 8pm full of jams.
                   It is a special road where people would exit AYE and go north
                  towards Ngee Ann Poly, UniSIM and Bukit Timah Road.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The Stadium is completely wasted as it is on the other side of the
                  AYE.  There is no convenient bus shuttle there as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">There is a completely run down Clement Woods park that has become
                  more like a jungle than a park by now.  I even heard that
                  there were rape cases there as well.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">In short there are lots of room for improvement in Clementi.
                   We are kind of like living without a manager all these years.
                  Activities are very localised around Blk 381 and does not spread to
                  the rest of the town.  There were no PAP making rounds before
                  RP mentioned that they are interested in West Coast GRP.  In
                  fact up till today, there were still no news about PAP making
                  rounds.  Therefore in this sense, RP has won already PAP
                  already (well done!)  I guess our MPs are much more busy than
                  other PAP members such as Wong Kan Seng and Goh Chok Tong. No
                  wonder we are so neglected.  Our MPs are more like
                  fire-fighters rather than having a plan on how to make Clementi
                  better.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">Please come and rescue us and we shall give you at least 10 years

              <p><cite></cite><cite>(<a href="http://thereformparty.net/blog/2011/04/25/the-reform-partys-stance-on-sers/">http://thereformparty.net/blog/2011/04/25/the-reform-partys-stance-on-sers/</a>)</cite>
              
              </p>
              <p>Yesterday Channel News Asia carried a report* on our visit to Blk 323 Clementi Avenue 5 to find out why homeowners were so unhappy with the compensation they had been offered under the SERS (Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme).<br>Unfortunately they left out my explanation as to why the SERS scheme was inequitable and how we would improve current policy.</p>
              <p>As we understood it, the residents, many of whom were elderly, had had no choice as the HDB had selected their blocks for SERS. They were offered new flats but discovered that they would have to come up with in the region of $50,000 to bring their flats up to any kind of habitable standard. They would have to come up with much more if they wanted to live on a higher floor. As their current flats are only 34 years old and have recently been upgraded they are entitled to feel aggrieved.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party’s stance has always been that 99-year leases leave Singaporeans dependent on the government for the value of their property. There is an assumed implicit contract that the government will replace old HDB flats for new and that owners will receive a favourable exchange rate. How else to explain why the price of a second-hand HDB flat does not depreciate like a similar leasehold private property does? The problem arises that the government could at any time withdraw its commitment to SERS old flats and then their resale value would drop sharply. Ultimately the price of these flats would go to zero as the lease expiry date approached. In my comment on the upgrading schemes in “Why Singaporeans Should See through the Upgrading Carrot”**, I wrote:</p>
              <p>Residents of older flats which are subject to the Selective Enbloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) may think they are getting a good deal as their old flats are replaced with new ones with approximately the same market value. However as there is normally a change in land density, involving the construction of much taller and bigger blocks packed more tightly together , the whole of the increase in the market value of the land may not be passed on to the leaseholder. In addition the new flats, though technically the same number of rooms, are much smaller than those built even fifteen or twenty years ago.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party plans to allow HDB leaseholders to buy out their freeholds if this is technically possible so that they can sell their flats to the highest bidder and benefit from the full uplift in value just as those who own private property are allowed to do. We are confident that this will be of much greater economic benefit to homeowners than upgrading schemes that are largely self-financing. It will also be better than being effectively forced to relocate to new blocks at a location of the government’s choosing. Nothing could more clearly illustrate that HDB owners are merely long-term tenants than owners with full rights to their property.</p>
              <p>Mr Arthur Fong, the PAP MP for West Coast Clementi ward, has commented that only 1 in 10 householders are unhappy with the deal they receive from SERS. While we are sceptical that residents would be entirely truthful when faced with a monopoly government-owned freeholder with so much power over their lives, they may also be simply unaware of the better terms they would get if they owned the freehold to their property and were able to receive more of the value of any change in land use or density.</p>
              <p>While the government’s Asset Inflation (Enhancement) Strategy works as our population grows exponentially while the HDB holds down supply like a typical monopolist, HDB owners may be happy because they never have to face up to the economic implications of owning a leasehold property. However should there be a substantial and sustained fall in property prices, due, say, to a global economic slowdown and a shrinkage in Singapore’s foreign worker population, then the government may no longer find it profitable to honour the implicit guarantee and HDB leaseholders may be stuck with what are in essence limited time value claims that go to zero eventually.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party wants to give all Singaporeans the right to buy the freehold to their HDB at a reasonable price. This will allow them to receive the full economic value of their property when they sell. It will also prevent the decision of whether they get to exchange their old property for a new one or whether their leasehold interest goes to zero being at the whim of the government. As an initial step, if we are elected to represent the people of West Coast we promise to fight in Parliament for better terms for residents from the SERS.</p>

While we are sceptical that residents would be entirely truthful when faced with a monopoly government-owned freeholder with so much power over their lives, they may also be simply unaware of the better terms they would get if they owned the freehold to their property and were able to receive more of the value of any change in land use or density.</p>
              <p>While the government’s Asset Inflation (Enhancement) Strategy works as our population grows exponentially while the HDB holds down supply like a typical monopolist, HDB owners may be happy because they never have to face up to the economic implications of owning a leasehold property. However should there be a substantial and sustained fall in property prices, due, say, to a global economic slowdown and a shrinkage in Singapore’s foreign worker population, then the government may no longer find it profitable to honour the implicit guarantee and HDB leaseholders may be stuck with what are in essence limited time value claims that go to zero eventually.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party wants to give all Singaporeans the right to buy the freehold to their HDB at a reasonable price. This will allow them to receive the full economic value of their property when they sell. It will also prevent the decision of whether they get to exchange their old property for a new one or whether their leasehold interest goes to zero being at the whim of the government. As an initial step, if we are elected to represent the people of West Coast we promise to fight in Parliament for better terms for residents from the SERS.</p>

              <p>_________________________</p>
              <p>I think there are quite a lot of half truths floating around so this is my take:</p>
              <p>An apple to apple (eg 4rm to 4rm) switch would allow the flat owner to receive 50k of compensation but....is it worth it? There's renovation for the new flat, stress of moving from your comfort zone, new environment etc.</p>
              <p>4 rm to 4 rm switch does not mean the new flat is of the same floor area. It is likely to much smaller. And so, residents are considering upgrades to 5 rm flats but that means forking out at least 50k cash. Moreover, the market value of a 4 rm clementi flat as above is 400k plus but HDB offers just 294k. It's a kind of short change if you ask me. Doesn't help that the SERS letter is just shoved cold in their faces, expecting them to comply.</p>
              <p>The way this SERS shit is going, every singaporean will eventually be screwed. There are so many 35 year old flats out there and it's a only a matter of time before it's your turn.</p>
              <p>So vote wisely, vote the PAP out  for change.</p>

              <p>The valuation report by the HDB is not done yet. So, the actual compensation value for my uncle's 3 room flat is not known yet. In the SER package, the esimated compensation value by the HDB for a 3-room (67m^2) is $350,000 to $400,000 depending on the floor level and condition of the flat. The compensation value for my uncle's flat will probably be on the lower end as my uncle is the original ie first owner with little and worn-out renovation. With the estimated removal allowance and stamp and legal fees provided by the HDB, the compensation value for his 3-room flat will be $365,500 to $408,000.</p>
