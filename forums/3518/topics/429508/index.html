              <p>Channel News Asia reported Goh Chok Tong speaking to reporters in Joo Chiat yesterday. Mr Goh said that George Yeo is too “important” a person for the
              cabinet to lose when asked about the likelihood of the PAP losing
              Aljunied GRC which was helmed by Mr Yeo to the Workers’ Party, which is
              fielding its strongest team there.</p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong was quoted as saying on Channel News Asia last night. <strong>“What mistake has George Yeo made? You can take a minister and
              criticise him for not delivering on perhaps housing and transport. Like
              Wong Kan Seng you can say he let Mas Selamat escape. George Yeo, what
              has he done to deserve this? And he is a core member,”</strong> he was quoted as saying on Channel News Asia last night.</p>
              <p>However, the damaging statement has been removed today from Channel News Asia.</p>
              <p>Is Mr Goh insinuating that Mr Wong Kan Seng is ‘less’ important a leader for the PAP regime to lose as compared to George Yeo?</p>
              <p>And why does the local news feel compelled to censor statements that don't favour PAP? That's why we should not read or hear anything from SPH.</p>

(read article <a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/01/15/george-yeo-to-molest-victim-crying-for-help-go-and-see-your-mp/"><span style="color: #a91b33;">here</span></a>)<br><br><br>On 11 January 2010, Miss Ang posted a comment on Mr Yeo’s Facebook seeking help to expedite police investigations in a pending molest case. Miss Ang had lodged a report in November last year and had yet to receive a reply from the police.<br><br><br>Instead of offering some words of consolation and support to her, Mr Yeo gave a one-liner reply:<br><br><strong>“Please see your MP”.</strong><br><br><br>Mr Yeo’s rather insensitive reply drew flak from netizens who lambasted him for lacking “emotional intelligence” on our article which has drawn nearly 100 comments so far.<br><br><br><strong>Out-of-touch</strong> felt that Mr Yeo’s lack of empathy is reflective of the entire PAP government:<br><br><br><em>“The Govt is getting out of touch with the common people. A story is told that if you put a frog in a pan of water and slowly raise its temperature, the frog can be cooked without being aware that it is unable to feel the changes in the ambient temperature….</em><br><br><em>Its not cool to act “corporate” style by short curt but efficient answers such as Mr George Yeo gave to Ms Ang. We need smart mangers, BUT leaders capable of compassion and able to show caring feelings.”</em><br><br><br><strong>sibeidulan</strong> concurred that the reply is a bad PR move:<br><br><br><em>“Even if he’s not truly concerned, the least he could do is to be nice about it and refer the case to the Wong Cunt Sink at MHA nicely. His response is full of negativity. a bad PR move for a politician, to say the least. “PLEASE SEE YOUR MP” – I really wonder what went through his mind as he posted this on his wall.”</em><br><br><br><strong>bochapliao</strong> felt he could have given a better answer:<br><br><br><em>“Georgie Yeo could have suggested counselling for the poor girl and all he said was go see your MP? </em><br><br><em>And the police can send 3 patrol cars with about 6 policemen to issue summons to an illegal hawker at Sungei flea market as reported in Stomp ST. And no police wants to attend to this poor girl who is traumatized?”</em><br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?p=55276942">http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?p=55276942</a></p></div>
