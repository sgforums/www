              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Residents
               of the newly-formed Nee Soon GRC received a mailer recently, an entry 
              form for a contest that says "connect with us" and win an iPad.<br><br>On the back, residents are asked to name the five "familiar faces" seen on neesoon.org or colour the logo on the website.<br><br>The faces are, of course, the ruling People's Action Party team likely to stand in Nee Soon and the logo, the PAP's.<br><br>This latest outreach effort has led some to question if it contravenes election rules.<br><br>Associate
               Professor Hussin Mutalib, a political analyst from the National 
              University of Singapore, said: "The law is new and this political 
              adventurism in campaigning and packaging it in a kind of business-like 
              goodie approach, it goes into the grey area of realism and ethics.<br><br>"If
               you are going to be very realistic and you realise, this is the way to 
              woo the crowd, especially the younger IT savvy generation, then there is
               nothing wrong with it."<br><br>Dr Hussin added that while the site can help raise awareness among residents, it will not necessarily translate to votes.<br><br>The
               website is fronted by the PAP's potential team for Nee Soon. Click on 
              the potential candidate's picture and it brings you to their Facebook 
              page. The website also highlights events held at the various divisions 
              within the constituency. According to some of the potential MPs for the 
              GRC, each constituency has a new media team handling their online 
              campaign.<br><br>When contacted, one of the PAP candidates for Nee Soon 
              GRC, Dr Lim Wee Kiak, said the website was launched about two weeks back
               during a grassroots event, PCF Celebration.<br><br>Dr Lim described the
               initiative as an "outreach programme" for residents to know what is 
              happening in their ward and the candidates better. He said it is a 
              contest to get the public to visit the website and the team is not 
              giving out freebies to entice voters to vote for the party or 
              candidates.<br><br>The Elections Department said the Parliamentary 
              Elections Act comes into effect once the writ is issued, meaning parties
               can campaign only after nomination closes. The law though does not 
              clearly spell out if this particular initiative constitutes Internet 
              election advertising.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>I suspect they want the email database of the residents, so they can do marketing in future. Or perhaps they trying to sell their website address. Strangely the website is under the umbrella of PAP. So does it mean after the election, they will continue to maintain and updateÂ it? Or they will leave it to the Peoples Association to maintain it? Â  OneÂ IPAD to win the heart of Yishun people...That's a good strategy.</p>
              <p>Using the network of Grassroot leader resourcesÂ to help them canvass for votes. Is it a fair process?</p>
