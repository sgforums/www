              <p>If you noticed, aljunied GRC, also cover a certain part of aljunied, where PAP support is extremely strong one.

              <p><strong>GE: PAP candidates prepare for possible contest in all wards</strong><br> <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 22 April 2011 2139 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Seven office holders in government have never faced an electoral battle.<br><br>But this could change if the opposition manages to field candidates in all 27 constituencies at the coming polls.<br><br>One
               quarter (21 members) of Singapore's most recent Parliament has never 
              faced an electoral contest. They include four ministers, two of whom 
              were introduced in the 2001 election and one brought in at the last 
              election in 2006. <br><br>Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports, Dr Vivian Balakrishnan and Education Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen were
               introduced in the 2001 election while Minister for Information, 
              Communications and the Arts Mr Lui Tuck Yew was elected as Member of 
              Parliament for Tanjong Pagar GRC in the 2006 election.<br><br>Among the 
              four, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Mr Lim Swee Say is the 
              most seasoned politician. He had walkovers in three elections.<br><br>And in the 2006 election, half of the 25 new faces had walkovers.<br><br>Some
               have asked if new PAP candidates, standing in Group Representation 
              Constituencies (GRCs), have an easy route into Parliament.<br><br>Over 
              the years, the opposition has continued to oppose the system, saying it 
              is one which benefits the People's Action Party (PAP).<br><br>Introduced in 1988, GRCs are multi-member constituencies to ensure minority representation in Parliament.<br><br>The GRC system is also seen as a way to induct high-calibre new candidates, given Singapore's limited talent pool.<br> <br>Associate
               Professor Hussin Mutalib, a political analyst at the National 
              University of Singapore (NUS), said: "There has not been a single GRC 
              lost; there has not been a single candidate lost within the GRC system. 
              We want them to win first. So, once they win the election through their 
              own work and contribution and articulation of policies and so on, by 
              their own right, gradually they will build up and become their own 
              leaders."<br><br>Candidates who have gone through a contest like Denise Phua described it as a "baptism of fire".<br><br>She
               said: "It was a steep learning curve. I had to get a good knowledge of 
              the activist I was working with, people I served and really getting a 
              grip of the local and national issues and making sure my predecessor, 
              whatever knowledge and wisdom he has, I get to learn from him. But all 
              in, I had a very good experience. I'm glad I went through it. Having 
              gone through it, this time round, I'm even better prepared."<br><br>Still, she said that going through a contest is not what defines a politician.<br><br>"Going
               through an election is important and is a good development of a 
              politician but if a politician focuses on that - just winning elections,
               making the competition look bad, posturing too much - then I think over
               time the voters and the residents will know and that must not be the 
              end."<br><br>She said winning an election is a means to serve the people and the causes one is interested in and feels strongly about.<br><br>"So
               to me, that is the end....Going through an election is important but 
              let's not get overboard on focusing so much on just the election and 
              sounding good or looking good," said Ms Phua, adviser to Jalan Besar GRC
               Grassroots Organisations. <br><br>When asked about how he feels to be 
              possibly facing his first contest since entering politics 14 years ago, 
              Mr Lim Swee Say told Channel NewsAsia that contest or not, he approaches
               each election the same way - fully prepared.<br><br>Mr Lim has been announced as part of the PAP team contesting East Coast GRC.<br><br>Observers
               have said that even though the percentage of votes going to the 
              opposition may increase this coming election, it may not necessarily 
              translate to elected seats in Parliament. <br><br>Having said that, 
              though, they added that the Constitution has been amended to allow for 
              at least nine opposition members in the House, but they include 
              Non-Constituency MPs (NCMPs). The post of NCMP is given to opposition 
              members who pulled in the highest number of votes among losers.<br><br>One thing all agree on is that the prospect of a contest for all constituencies is a good development for Singapore.<br><br>"Many
               of the times in the past, many candidates did not have a chance to face
               the baptism of fire not because they did not want to but because they 
              had not enough candidates to contest. And most Singaporeans, I know, 
              would like to be able to exercise a vote and to choose who they want to 
              represent them," said Ms Phua.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
