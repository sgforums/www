              <p>Yes we do have scholarship, president scholars...all those bright students and future leaders. But we also not not neglect the other group of children (average children). They can become a future leaders too.</p>

              <p>It is a failing across the education system. From an early age, we were streamed according to potential (I remember primary 3 for gifted programs), then at 12 , we are screened again to make sure that it is confirmed that we are 'smart' academically.

              <p>The biggest laughable matter was that they tried to teach creativity. The second laughable matter is that in Poly old days (about 10-15 years ago) , you can't go against the text book even if the journals or experts says otherwise. I also hear current poly grads and A level grads bemoaning how tough overseas university can be - damn straight because they are not allowed to copy out of the textbook .</p>

              <p>Rigidity in the system is a problem. The system is rote-based learning. You are not encouraged to question or oppose the view OR promote a new idea ,except maybe if you come from the 'elites'.</p>

              <p>The environment is not at all conducive for any form of creativity, new ideas or opposing views against the main dominant ones. Singaporeans have not been trained to be 'thinkers' for a long time. Everything is directed as it should be and followed in the most inflexible pathway.</p>

              <p><br>I live overseas now . Got worried about the FT policy and got out as one FT from Singapore.  People of all walks of life in my host country are allowed to make submissions to a policy proposal (even foreigners). And every single submission is tabled for policy makers and made available to the public. If they have interest in your idea, they will continue to interface with you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have written submissions for fun . One out of 10 got a follow up but it was not acceptable due to cost considerations . The funny part is that I got a nice thank you letter and a regret with the reason. That's overseas and that's democracy - you do have a say if you wish to say it. Public accountability but as with all governments, transparency can be an issue ..at least it is opaque here , not a big blur. People can accessed the submission booklet of any public proposal anytime for a read.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP asks for opinions in forums, but from previous experience, they don't really keep it in mind unless you got a large booing crowd who supports a certain youngster's ideas....plus a youngster asking an arrogant PAP MP (who responded by asking for that person's NRIC number), whether the MP wanted the telephone and address as well.</p>
