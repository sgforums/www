              <p>When PAP didn't have a track record back then.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore's army was built by commanding officers from the Israeli Defence Force and the Israelis left back for their own country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The late Mr Albert Winsemius, a dutch economist, was handpicked by the United Nations to assess the potential of Singapore for industrialisation. He played an advisory role to the PAP and he is known as the father of Jurong. Not only that , he provided economic advice on public housing and other policies. He left a huge contribution to Singapore and I don't think he took a multimillion dollar handshake. He died in his home country after a long contribution to Singapore (to 1980s).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yes, with the PAP's foreign talent policy, an alternate government can also do the same thing. Get good consultants on the basis of their experience or headhunt the ones used by international authorities.</p>

              <p>Seriously lots of things was boleh in e past because the old guards were responsive and willing to learn from others.</p>
              <p>I still remembered the MRT underground station doors was Asia's first after seeing the problem faced in HK &amp; London. Hong Kong soon followed in 2000.</p>
              <p>What I'm trying to put is, to survive we've to learn from others.. Look at how they do things, think can we improvise to our own needs.</p>

              <p>I think even the simple bus/ MRT farecard, that time Asia didn't had a hybird card for bus and train. Idea came from Europe and SBS wanted to automate fare collection to cut manpower.</p>
              <p>SBS first bought it in 1985 for trial (There was in fact 2 prototypes before the actual one). Hong Kong had theirs only in 2000.</p>

              <p>We would assume that in all meritocractic principle that the public service have experienced staff which can provide advice, after all taxpayers funded the brightest kids for overseas studies in order for them to return and serve . Furthermore , advice can come from other sources (international/regional etc) to minimise any potential bias and the decision makers can weigh one against the other .</p>

              <p>New blood with different ideas are needed, not the damn foreign talent or whatever. A political scene is like a book. If you get the same authors , they can't see past their ideas at all . Only others will.</p>

              <p>Yes we do have scholarship, president scholars...all those bright students and future leaders. But we also not not neglect the other group of children (average children). They can become a future leaders too.</p>
              <p>They should review that not only brightest kids get scholarship, they should also give the opportunities to the average children.</p>

              <p><br>Government can't make mistakes ....so those are the best of your flock.

              <p>It is time to review their mindset of picking the best workers to work for them and not looking at their A, Poly, U and Cca, thus they are missing out those better than the scholars if they keep out non scholars holders.</p>
