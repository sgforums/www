My completed 5-room flat is a real classic case of how the HDB highhandedly orchestrated events by making me meet the MP at Sengkang West for at least 5-6 times just to get the HDB to grant me a higher loan amount. Even a logical explanation on why the housing loan granted to me was less than half of the purchase price fell on deaf ears. My spouse and I were told that we had to cough out at least $170,000 in cash to get the keys of our 5-room flat at Fernvale. Makes me wonder whether the MP just wrote the letter to the HDB out of formality coz' after 8 months' of waiting and still counting, nothing much has changed. Instead, things got even worse. I'll stop here for now. It's too sad to continue looking at how the ruling party appeared so 'compassionate and caring' in the media, but when it really matters most, could it be just a facade? Even 2 desperate emails sent to the PM went unheeded and failed to produce any result. So much for being a loyal PAP supporter. </span></p></div>

              <p>Unlikely to merge into one party as all the party leaders want to be in control and have difference ideologies and different ways of doing things.  </p>
              <p>At most they would do is contest under one umbrella like in 2001 and 2006 whereby SPP and NSP contested under the umbrella of Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA).  And even this is not easy as seen by the departure of NSP in 2007 and SPP in 2011.</p>
              <p>So they are better off operating as different parties in their own respective districts and meeting once or twice before every election to avoid multi-corner fights.</p>

              <p>I see it differently from you.   I see it as WP could afford not to contest in Macpherson wheras NSP has to at least get a person into parliament in order for their party to have a chance to grow and speak up for ordinary Singaporeans.  WP indicated before they really want Marine Parade (because Joo Chiat is in it) and they are prepared not to contest in Macpherson if NSP backs out of Marine Parade.</p>

              <p>Cedric Foo is also the Group Deputy President  and Chief Financial Officer of NOL( Temasek Holdings is the largest shareholder of NOL). However NOL has been losing money for 5 consecutive years ever since he last won at Pioneer SMC.  Perhaps Cedric should stop his political role as an MP and stop drawing five salaries to focus on getting NOL back to profit.   He is making too much money while the company is making a loss.   It is not just 1 year of loss, it is 5 years of consecutive losses.  He is also not devoting full effort into getting the company back to profit spliting his times with political activities.</p>
              <p>According to Wikipedia, he is also <span style="color: #252525; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px;">Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, as well as the Chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee for Transport.</span></p>

              <p>Personally I feel that WP should just focus on the other 27 seats and let NSP compete in their area since 2006.  NSP already scaled down from 24 seats to 12 seats if it includes Macpherson wheras WP upped from 23 to 27.  WP is crossing into NSP's area and NSP already let them have Marine Parade.  </p>
              <p>Sembawang GRC is what SDP does not want to contest in and let out.</p>
              <p>NSP is not Nicole Seah's Party.   Nicole Seah fitted in nicely in 2011 because she appealed to voters below 30.  </p>
              <p>NSP is offering voters in Macpherson a choice of whether they want a 31 year old lady who happens to be the 6th most hated PAP MP or a matured guy who has 5 years experienced as NCMP.   Since all 7 WP MPs are staying put in their existing districts, and WP's two other NCMPs are fighting Marine Parade GRC and East Coast GRC or Feng Shan SMC, there is no one more qualified than NSP's Steve Chia (was NCMP for 1 term) or Cheo Chai Chen (was an MP for 1 term and contested in Marine Parade in 2011) for Macpherson.   So WP should be backing out of Macpherson.  </p>
              <p>Key facts:</p>
              <p>NSP let out Jurong GRC to Singaporean First party.</p>
              <p>NSP let out Marine Parade GRC to Workers Party</p>
              <p>NSP let out Radin Mas SMC to Reform Party</p>
              <p>NSP let out Choa Chu Kang GRC to People's Power Party</p>
              <p>NSP let out Mountbatten SMC to Singapore People's Party</p>
              <p>NSP took Sembawang GRC which SDP does not want to contest in.</p>
