              <p>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has 
              asked the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC) to have smaller 
              Group Representation Constituencies, and to have at least 12 Single 
              Member Constituencies.</p>
              <p>The committee was formed two months ago, the Prime Minister told Parliament on Monday (Jul 13).</p>
              <p>Mr
               Lee said he asked the committee to consider the population shifts and 
              housing developments since the last boundary delineation exercise.</p>
              <p>He
               also asked the committee to have smaller GRCs, "so as to reduce the 
              average size of the GRCs below five", and to have at least 12 SMCs.</p>
              <p>"As
               per past practice, the committee is chaired by the Secretary to the 
              Prime Minister. It is now in the midst of its deliberations and will 
              make its recommendations to me when ready," he said.</p>

              </div>
              <p>In response to a question by Mr Yee 
              Jenn Jong of the Workers' Party, Mr Lee said that while Singapore would 
              consider bringing in outside expertise to advise the EBRC, it is 
              unlikely to have different political parties working on the boundary 
              recommendations.</p>
              <p>“On the composition of the EBRC: It has 
              for many years comprised civil servants who have domain knowledge which 
              enables them to make considered decisions on how to divide up the 
              constituencies - taking into account, as I have said, population shifts,
               housing develepments, and also how to do this in a practical sort of 
              way, so that we do not have complete upheaval each time there is 
              redemarcation," said the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>"If there is a need for outside expertise I think that can be considered. We have no hesitation to look for outside expertise.</p>
              <p>"As
               for bringing in political parties I’m not sure that’s entirely a good 
              idea. The Americans do it with political parties, and the way it is done
               is usually that the sitting members (of the House of Representatives) 
              decide on a demarcation.</p>
              <p>"And usually what happens is 
              that they carve it up among themselves. It’s a political deal and I 
              think that’s not a good arrangement and it’s best we leave this to the 
              civil servants to work at."</p>
              <p><strong>SIGNAL OF AN UPCOMING GENERAL ELECTION?</strong></p>
              <p>The
               committee reviews and draws up the boundaries for election, and submits
               a report with its recommendations. The report, when released by the 
              committee, is seen as one of the clearest signals that a General 
              Election (GE) is around the corner.</p>
              <p>The convening of the 
              committee kickstarts a series of events that culminates in the nation 
              heading to the polls. Singapore’s next GE must be held by January 2017.</p>
              <p>The expected sequence of events is as follows:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Electoral Boundaries Review Committee convenes</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2. Committee submits report with recommendations on electoral changes</strong><br>In
               the lead-up to the two previous GEs in 2006 and 2011, the committee 
              took about four months after being convened to issue its report.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Parliament dissolved</strong><br>The
               Prime Minister may advise the President to dissolve Parliament by 
              Proclamation in the Gazette before the expiry of its term. Once 
              Parliament has been dissolved, the GE must be held within three months. 
              In the last GE, the committee’s report was issued on Feb 24, 2011, and 
              Parliament was dissolved on Apr 19, 2011.</p>
              <p><strong>4. President issues Writ of Election</strong><br>The
               President, acting on the Prime Minister's advice, issues a Writ of 
              Election. This will specify the date and location for the nomination of 
              candidates.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Nomination Day takes place</strong><br>Nomination
               Day, when prospective candidates submit their nomination papers, must 
              take place between five days and one month after the Writ of Election is
               issued.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Polling Day</strong><br>Polling Day 
              must be held between 10 and 56 days after the Returning Officer 
              publishes the Notice of Contested Elections after Nomination Day. For 
              the 2011 GE, Cooling-Off Day, on the eve of Polling Day, was introduced,
               when candidates are banned from campaigning. This was instituted to 
              give voters time to reflect and make their decision before going to the 
              polls.</p>
