              																				Sue-Ann Chia SENIOR POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT The Straits Times</p>
              <p>THE current contentious issue on the affordability of public housing
              was given another airing by Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew who cautioned
              Singaporeans not to cast a protest vote against the ruling party over
              this.</p>
              <p>As Singaporeans lament about rising flat
              prices, he said they ought to understand the Government sells them at a
              subsidised price, below market rate, so that they can own an asset that
              will appreciate in value over the years. It adds to their wealth and
              this is asset-enhancing policy Mr Lee believes citizens should not find
              fault with.</p>
              <p>If they do, they must be 'daft', he
              said at a dialogue during a housing conference as part of a series of
              events to mark the Housing Board's (HDB) 50th anniversary.</p>
              <p>And
              if National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan is unable to defend this
              policy, 'he deserves to lose' at the next General Election, he quipped
              to laughter from the participants, including a chuckling Mr Mah.</p>
              <p>But
              if Mr Mah loses to the opposition, he warned that Singaporeans better
              sell their flats fast as it would no longer be of any value.</p>
              <p>Mr
              Lee's blunt remarks were in response to a question by dialogue
              moderator Tommy Koh, who pulled out a Straits Times report which said
              at least three opposition parties are keen to contest Tampines GRC that
              Mr Mah helms, as they want to raise the affordability of public housing
              as an election issue to gain votes.</p>

              <p>The high value of HDB is just a false sense of security, an illusion of having something of high value when it is inconsequential. It's like having a piece ofÂ rock thinking it is worth it's weight in gold.</p>
