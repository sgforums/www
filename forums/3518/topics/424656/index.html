              <h3 class="date_story">Mar 9, 2011 - ST Forum</h3>
              <p>I AM curious about the role of the National Trades Union Congress 
              (NTUC) in politics. In recent announcements of potential candidates for 
              the People's Action Party (PAP), I read that civil servants resigned 
              their posts to join the NTUC.</p>
              <p>The switch was aimed ostensibly at preparing these former 
              civil servants to stand as PAP candidates in the upcoming general 
              election.</p>
              <p>I understand why civil servants cannot be Members of Parliament, but I have several questions:</p>
              <div class="ststory_large">
              <li>How is NTUC able to absorb these people? In any 
              corporation, positions are based on needs. Were the positions specially 
              created for these candidates? </li>
              <li>Why is NTUC providing candidates only for the 
              PAP? Can senior executives of NTUC stand as opposition candidates? Can 
              one be part of the NTUC leadership and remain an opposition party 
              member? Can we separate these jobs from politics? </li>
              <li>Do MPs who work for NTUC take directions from 
              NTUC secretary-general Lim Swee Say, who is Minister in the Prime 
              Minister's Office, in Parliament? </li>
              <li>Finally, how many MPs should come from the 
              NTUC? While I acknowledge that the voices of the union members should be
               heard, I am less certain about the number who should represent the 
              congress in the House.
              <p>In fact, it may well be unhealthy for Parliament to be 
              overwhelmed by unionists. My perception is that there are too many MPs 
              from NTUC in Parliament now and there may well be even more.</p>

              <p>Wah Shit Times actually published this letter. Quite a lot of sticky questions but my great foresight powers tell me that NTUC will publish a very shifty reply. Heh.</p>
              <p>NTUC, Govt and Citizens form a tripartism. This is a world's first. The greatest political theory of its kind since the days of Mao, Karl Marx and Hitler. If I'm not wrong, NTUC was a legacy of the English. It was meant to fight for the rights of blue collared workers. Today it has become a leashed hound.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Why NTUC works closely with PAP</h1>
              <p>THE mission of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and its 
              affiliated unions is to protect and advance the interests of the workers
               of Singapore ('Explain role of NTUC in politics' by Mr Ang Miah Boon; 
              last Wednesday).</p>
              <p>Having seen militant unions disrupt growth and destroy jobs 
              in the 1950s and 1960s, NTUC believes that a constructive brand of trade
               unionism and tripartism remains the best way of serving our workers.</p>
              <p>Since 1961, NTUC has worked closely with the People's Action
               Party (PAP) Government to grow our economy and strengthen our society. 
              Our low unemployment rate and steady increase in real wages have not 
              happened by chance.</p>
              <p>They are the direct result of this shared effort between 
              NTUC and PAP to enable our people to have meaningful jobs and lead a 
              purposeful life.</p>
              <p>Labour MPs give workers a voice in Parliament and make NTUC a
               more effective labour movement. As labour leaders, they are responsible
               to the unions, members and workers at large. They express the concerns 
              and aspirations of workers and speak up for balanced government policies
               that are both pro-business and pro-worker. They also work directly on 
              measures to benefit workers, such as re-employment of older workers and 
              back-to-work women, re-skilling of low-wage workers and upgrading of 
              PMETs (professionals, managers, executives and technicians).</p>
              <p>As MPs, they are responsible to their voters and the public,
               and contribute actively to nation-building. Currently, three labour MPs
               lead the Government Parliamentary Committees for Manpower, Education, 
              and Community Development, Youth and Sports, having been elected by 
              their fellow PAP MPs to these posts.</p>
              <p>How many labour MPs we have depends on the quality of NTUC 
              candidates. Labour MPs undergo the same stringent selection process as 
              other PAP candidates. As NTUC nurtures promising candidates for 
              selection by PAP, we also recruit potential PAP candidates who can 
              contribute to the labour movement. Such a two-way approach has served 
              our workers and union members well.</p>
              <p>On this 50th anniversary of NTUC, it is timely to 
              recapitulate this symbiotic relationship between NTUC and PAP. Together,
               we are partners in nation-building.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">NTUC key to nation's evolution</h1>
              <p>THE connection between the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and 
              the People's Action Party (PAP) is a historical one and is part of 
              Singapore's ongoing process of nation-building ('Why NTUC works closely 
              with PAP' by NTUC president and secretary-general; Tuesday).</p>
              <p>It would have been difficult for Singapore's evolution if 
              the unions were fractured and run by disparate interests bent on scoring
               political points rather than focusing on the welfare of the country and
               its people.</p>
              <p>Rather than have them as a large interest group on the 
              outside lobbying the Government for change, a symbiotic relationship 
              allows for labour interests to be represented and tailored within the 
              administration.</p>
              <p>If the PAP sees itself as a national movement, then it is 
              logical for it to create a symbiotic relationship with the NTUC. The 
              Democratic and Labour parties in the United States and Britain openly 
              support union-backed candidates for high office.</p>
              <p>How effectively those elected to political office serve the 
              interests of the workers is another matter. In the case of Singapore, 
              this can be worked through with greater ease than elsewhere.</p>
              <p>The issue is not really about whether there are more labour 
              candidates fielded in the coming general election compared to previous 
              ones; it is whether the PAP, though in itself a non-ideological party, 
              advocates clearly and carries out effectively policies grounded on 
              labour and social values.</p>

              <p><strong>MR PATRICK SIO:</strong> 'The symbiosis between the NTUC and 
              PAP has benefited Singaporeans in many ways ('Why NTUC works closely 
              with PAP'; Tuesday). Though NTUC's reply did not mention the 
              contributions by FairPrice, I remember that as a boy living in 
              Commonwealth Drive in the 1970s, I used to go with my parents to 
              Strathmore Avenue's cooperative store to buy rice. Over the years, 
              FairPrice has taken over the role of regulating prices of rice and other
               daily essentials. My children who were born into this stable and 
              prosperous society may not know of the contributions to nation-building

              <p><strong>MR PIETER KOK:</strong> 'An effective labour movement should 
              be independent of the ruling party. Suppose the PAP government wants to 
              push through an unpopular law against the wishes of workers.</p>
              <p>What would be the stance of NTUC secretary-general Lim Swee 
              Say, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office? Would Mr Lim 
              act in the best interests of the Singapore worker or would he be 
              influenced by the PAP government? Can people who wear multiple hats take
               an unbiased and objective stance for the Singapore worker?'</p>
