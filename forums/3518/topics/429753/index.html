              <p>On the final day of the <span id="lw_1304607701_1" class="yshortcuts">hustings</span>, she just couldn't hold it in anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span id="lw_1304607701_5" class="yshortcuts">National Solidarity Party candidate</span> Nicole Seah broke down during a rally at a field in Chinese Garden on Thursday night, after recalling a meeting she had with a poor female resident in MacPherson earlier in the day.</p>
              <p>The 24-year-old, who is contesting the Marine Parade GRC, said the resident told her how she could not afford an $80 deposit that was required over and above the rent for her flat. Worse, when she sought help from grassroots leaders, she was chided for the small amount.</p>
              <p>Pausing to compose herself, Seah told the estimated 10,000-strong crowd, "This is the kind of problem we have. We need a government who has a heart for Singaporeans."</p>
              <p>It was the second time in a day that the advertising executive broke down. While speaking to the same resident earlier, she had also cried after listening to the mother's desperate situation.</p>
              <p>An emotionally-charged Seah then told the audience at the rally that it was time for change.</p>
              <p>She said, "They (the <span id="lw_1304607701_0" class="yshortcuts">PAP</span>) do not have the mandate of heaven but the consent of the people... We must move towards the next phase of nation building to build a future that comes in more colours than white."</p>
              <p>After the rally, which was the final chance for NSP candidates to address voters, members in the crowd told <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em> that Seah had left a deep impression on them.</p>
              <p>Ting Lee Yiaw, 48, banker, a Jurong GRC resident, said, "What she said resonated with me. She's very down-to-earth and very real. I can see that she is truly compassionate and really stands for the NSP."</p>
              <p>Nelson Tong, 36, civil servant, also a Jurong resident,  said, "It is very encouraging to see someone like her. I can really see that she is feeling it like a true Singaporean. We feel it together with her and that's what being Singaporean is all about."</p>
              <p>Undergraduate Brandon Chen, 26, added, "We need an MP like her to give the alternative voice. Age doesn't matter, as long as people can feel that she is real."</p>
              <p>A total of 12 other NSP candidates spoke during the rally.</p>
              <p>They will be contesting the Marine Parade, Jurong, Chua Chu Kang and Tampines GRCs as well as the Radin Mas, Pioneer and Mountbatten SMCs.</p>

              <p>+++++++++++++++++</p>
              <p>They should advised her to contest in other grc instead of head on with sm gct. Just like a ligt weight vs heavy weight boxing game. To stand a good chance to get into the parliament.</p>
              <p>They can give solace and feel sad for her, but cannot do much if they are in no marine parade residnts.</p>
              <p>She should contest in the grc where pple has a deep hatred for a particular mps. She might able to win. Of course nsp.</p>
