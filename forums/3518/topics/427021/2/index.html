              <p>Yeh we let rubbish like koo tsai kee sneak into Tg Pgr GRC for 20 years under the armpit of LKY and he's finally retiring. Even Teo Ser Luck and Vivian all sneaked in that way.</p>

              <p>I've spoken on an extended basis with both Teo Ser Luck and Yu-Foo Yee Shon. The former sounds like a typical ah beng, has low IQ and zero eloquence and seems to think he's some lady killer. He even tried to flirt with the aunties, I guess he thinks he's some aunty killer and with his empty airhead, getting the aunty votes is his only way of keeping the riches.</p>
              <p>Yu Foo Yee Shon speaks like your typical office cleaning aunty, no kidding. I wonder if there's any Youtube video of her speaking in action. Go find, listening to her makes you barf. She sounds nothing like the politicians in the states. Even the typical 21 year old NUS farmer who already sounds like shit sounds better than her, which says a lot. In fact if you had no idea she's allegedly a minister of state, a foreigner talking to her on the phone wouldn't be blamed if he thought she was the janitor.</p>
              <p>Most of the local grad candidates in parliament seem to be placed there not for decision making purposes due to overwhelmingly obvious low calibre and lack of any brains, but for other purposes. Watch any tv interview done of normal passers by in the US. Even a blue collar black guy speaks better than most of the young people in Singapore who have been victimised by the inferior education system.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Rookie in single ward makes even less sense</h1>
              <p>MR TAN Siong Kuan argues that the People's Action Party's (PAP) 
              youngest new candidate in the upcoming general election, Ms Tin Pei 
              Ling, should be fielded in a single-member constituency so that she can 
              prove herself ('Wrong to let young candidate sneak in'; yesterday) .</p>
              <p>It is extremely unfair to expect that of a young candidate. 
              In fact, if the PAP were to field a candidate with little experience in a
               single-member constituency, I will not vote for that candidate.</p>
              <p>I will not, simply because of the confidence factor and the fact that the candidate is new and unfamiliar.</p>
              <p>Because of these reasons, it would be poor political 
              strategy for any party to pit a young and inexperienced rookie in a 
              straight fight.</p>
              <p>The situation is different when a newcomer is grouped with 
              experienced politicians. I believe in leadership renewal. The 
              arrangement of having a new candidate understudy the experienced 
              veterans allows for a smooth transition.</p>
              <p>It also gives the new candidate hands-on experience and 
              simultaneously allows the public to judge whether the new candidate is 
              indeed capable, without jeopardising public interest.</p>

              <p>'No party should let their new candidates ride on the shoulders of heavyweight leaders.'</p>
              <p><strong>MR TAN HO GIAN:</strong> 'New candidates of all political 
              parties should be tested in a straight fight to prove that they can 
              stand on their own and gain the voters' respect ('Wrong to let young 
              candidate sneak in' by Mr Tan Siong Kuan; yesterday). These candidates 
              should be fielded in a group representation constituency (GRC) team only
               after completing at least a term in Parliament. A straight fight should
               be the first test of their mettle. No party should let their new 
              candidates ride on the shoulders of heavyweight leaders. New candidates 
              should earn their political spurs the hard way like the previous 
              generation of leaders. By the same token, the People's Action Party 
              should not let an MP who won in the previous general election through a 
              walkover join a GRC slate. All candidates must be tested on their own 
              steam, and earn their place in Parliament to gain the respect of all 
              Singaporeans.'</p>

              <p>'It is unproductive for Ms Tin to spend precious time countering negative comments.'</p>
              <p><strong>MADAM YEAP KIN HAN:</strong> 'My view, as a housewife, is 
              different from Mr Tan Siong Kuan's ('Wrong to let young candidate sneak 
              in'; yesterday). It is unproductive for the PAP's youngest new 
              candidate, Ms Tin Pei Ling, to spend precious time countering negative 
              comments. The simple reality is that she will prove herself when she 
              works the ground. Many may agree with Mr Tan's argument that she should 
              stand in a single ward to prove herself, but we should remember that we 
              all needed a mentor or mentors to help us gradually fulfil our potential
               while we were schooling, or embarking on a career. Mentoring is even 
              more important if one is serving the country. It takes hard work and 
              sacrifices by many people to create a peaceful, vibrant society. We 
              should not take for granted what we are enjoying now.'</p>

              <h1>Rookie in single ward makes even less sense</h1>
              <p>MR TAN Siong Kuan argues that the People's Action Party's (PAP)
              youngest new candidate in the upcoming general election, Ms Tin Pei
              Ling, should be fielded in a single-member constituency so that she
              can prove herself ('Wrong to let young candidate sneak in';
              yesterday) .</p>
              <p>It is extremely unfair to expect that of a young candidate. In
              fact, if the PAP were to field a candidate with little experience
              in a single-member constituency, I will not vote for that
              candidate.</p>
              <p>I will not, simply because of the confidence factor and the fact
              that the candidate is new and unfamiliar.</p>
              <p>Because of these reasons, it would be poor political strategy
              for any party to pit a young and inexperienced rookie in a straight
              fight.</p>
              <p>The situation is different when a newcomer is grouped with
              experienced politicians. I believe in leadership renewal. The
              arrangement of having a new candidate understudy the experienced
              veterans allows for a smooth transition.</p>
              <p>It also gives the new candidate hands-on experience and
              simultaneously allows the public to judge whether the new candidate
              is indeed capable, without jeopardising public interest.</p>

              <p>'No party should let their new candidates ride on the shoulders
              of heavyweight leaders.'</p>
              <p><strong>MR TAN HO GIAN:</strong> 'New candidates of all
              political parties should be tested in a straight fight to prove
              that they can stand on their own and gain the voters' respect
              ('Wrong to let young candidate sneak in' by Mr Tan Siong Kuan;
              yesterday). These candidates should be fielded in a group
              representation constituency (GRC) team only after completing at
              least a term in Parliament. A straight fight should be the first
              test of their mettle. No party should let their new candidates ride
              on the shoulders of heavyweight leaders. New candidates should earn
              their political spurs the hard way like the previous generation of
              leaders. By the same token, the People's Action Party should not
              let an MP who won in the previous general election through a
              walkover join a GRC slate. All candidates must be tested on their
              own steam, and earn their place in Parliament to gain the respect
              of all Singaporeans.'</p>
              <p><strong>Earning her spurs</strong></p>
              <p>'It is unproductive for Ms Tin to spend precious time countering
              negative comments.'</p>
              <p><strong>MADAM YEAP KIN HAN:</strong> 'My view, as a housewife,
              is different from Mr Tan Siong Kuan's ('Wrong to let young
              candidate sneak in'; yesterday). It is unproductive for the PAP's
              youngest new candidate, Ms Tin Pei Ling, to spend precious time
              countering negative comments. The simple reality is that she will
              prove herself when she works the ground. Many may agree with Mr
              Tan's argument that she should stand in a single ward to prove
              herself, but we should remember that we all needed a mentor or
              mentors to help us gradually fulfil our potential while we were
              schooling, or embarking on a career. Mentoring is even more
              important if one is serving the country. It takes hard work and
              sacrifices by many people to create a peaceful, vibrant society. We
              should not take for granted what we are enjoying now.'</p>

              <p>Colombo Plan Scholarship has been around in the 1950s. In fact the current Keppel Group CEO is a Colombo Plan scholar. It gets more embarrassing for you. The president scholarship, is just an updated name of a very old and established scholarship from Raffles era.The name change is purely cosmetic, when independence was given to Malaya, and then another name change, when Singapore separated from Malaysia. The names that predate the president scholarship is Queen's Scholarship (Kwa Geok Choo)and later Yang Di-Pertuan Negara and Singapore state scholarship (Tony Tan). These are the old names of the president scholarship.</p>
              <p>Do you know how old Kwa Geok Choo was when she died and how old Tony Tan is? No scholarship in 1965? LOL</p>
              <p>Suggest you read this. Ignorant</p>
