              <p>It is election season in Singapore! And there is good reason why the ruling Peoples’ Action Party (PAP) should be thinking of calling a snap election before June.</p>
              <p>As always the economy always gives the best clue.</p>
              <p>To everybody’s surprise it romped home with 14% growth in goods and services. That not only put state-owned shipping company Neptune Orient Lines (NOL) back in black, but created just the kind of jobs that many in the West are still struggling to find.</p>
              <p>Before that euphoria could settle down most of the nation’s populace did after all find some kind of ‘solace’ when the government said it would limit the intake of foreigners who have been blamed widely for snatching jobs away from Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>Yet the depth of disenchantment with rising prices, crowded places, and fierce competition for jobs and houses has been blamed widely on foreigners.</p>
              <p>“I am quite sure that the issue of the influx of foreigners into Singapore is more significant than many people would care to admit openly”, declared scholar Derek Da Cunha in the city-state’s Today paper.</p>
              <p>His views give vent and echo the sentiments of the country’s first premier and strongman Lee Kuan Yew who not too recently, said the straw polls could not be an accurate gauge because respondents usually give politically correct answers.</p>
              <p>Yet there is a certain ‘excitement’ this time around.</p>
              <p>Not since the country first attained independence after separating from Malaysia in 1965, has the electoral landscape changed so very dramatically.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Historic election</strong></span></p>
              <p>For the first time in living memory the ruling PAP will not be returned to power on Nomination Day. That is historic!</p>
              <p>And for the first time in living memory a new crop of cadres – especially from opposition ranks – are stepping forth to step into the breach.</p>
              <p>Many are also ‘untainted’, having had distinguished careers and eager to cross swords with their political foes, which by no flight of imagination happens to be the ruling PAP.</p>
              <p>But yet many have no memories of the tumultuous times in the 1960s when separation was forced onto Singapore.</p>
              <p>Yet the changed atmosphere in which political parties have gone about canvassing votes and engaging residents have all pointed to a distinctly palpable air of calm and maturity; signalling not just a generational change in attitudes but perhaps to also heralding a new era in Singapore politics.</p>
              <p>That however, is not the end of the matter.</p>
              <p>For the first time in history a new political party, The Reform Party, has openly declared about its intention to take over the administering of the country from the ruling PAP.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Reform agenda</strong></span></p>
              <p>The party that the late Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam founded is now helmed by his son, Kenneth Jeyaretnam.</p>
              <p>The younger Jeyaretnam’s declaration at a recent forum expressing a readiness to form an alternative government and usher in a two-party ruling system perhaps is the most profound to date. No other party, not even the oldest opposition political party, The Workers Party, has ever dared make such an outright proclamation, let alone speak of a two-party democracy.</p>
              <p>Kenneth may have struck out in his quest for pluralism. But the idea of an alternative to the PAP actually belonged to Kenneth’s father who sometime in the middle of 1986 also spoke of his intentions to usher in a two-party system of governance.</p>
              <p>Interesting time lies ahead in Singapore and nowhere is that more discernible than in the climate of openness.</p>
              <p>And the ruling PAP which never had to deal with such problems suddenly finds its hands full, this time around.</p>

              <p>The incumbents are stuck in the old days, they are unable put forth new quality candidates.</p>
              <p>Other than the usual bunch from NTUC, glcs, civil service and some relation to previous incumbents, they fail to attract high calibre potentials from private sectors to give diverse and robust views and suggestions to bring Sg forward in an ever changing world.</p>
              <p>On the contrast the oppositions despite the odds are able to attract some interesting people with good calibre from private sectors. Why when such good opportunities when the incumbents can offer them a direct and easy access and good money?</p>
              <p>The voters are now presented with a better offer than before. Change is inevitable when a government no longer listen.</p>
