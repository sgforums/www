              <p>Heh.. The 60% supporters were before the little India riots... The massive mrt failures of 2013 and 14, LTA decision to upgrade their ERP ( ERP going to be satellite by 2020.. In case anyone do not know, I can link if anyone wants. ) but not upgrade trains and buses. Also we got a person called Roy on the loose and although him being right or wrong can be debated, he definitely managed to convert a few pap worshippers to his cause.. No matter how small the number is. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Plus the elections are not here yet.. More problems might arise. Definitely the pap will see a decline in votes by the next election. Even some of the new citizens have to agree with what's wrong here...</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why I am happy and proud to be Singaporean and also why I support the government.</span></p>
              <p>Let me start by saying that I seem to be always going against the crowd. When I was young, I was alway against the PAP and voted against them twice. At that time, most people did not agree with me. They were full of praise for the government. But now that I am older (and I presume wiser), I find that I like the PAP more and more.</p>
              <p>Let me explain why.</p>
              <p>1)We are one of the richest countries in the world. Our per capita income is US$65,000 according to the IMF. This makes us the 3rd richest countries in the world. This means that our governments policies are basically correct. See this link to show you that I am not making things up:</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita</p>
              <p>2)Our health care is ranked 6th best by the World Health Organization. See link:</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization_ranking_of_health_systems_in_2000</p>
              <p>This is the most authoritative and comprehensive ranking. Unfortunately, it was done in 2000 and not repeated. Perhaps its too expensive to do such a comprenhensive study. A simpler and cheaper ranking was done by Bloomberg recently. Bloomberg did not use the word 'best". But we were ranked most efficient healthcare in the world which in my opinion means about the same thing. See link:</p>
              <p>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-tops-in-global/1369964.html</p>
              <p>They ranked by weighing cost against results. The better your health care, the longer you live. But at what cost? Bloomberg simply divided the average lifespan with the amount of money spent on the average person with the money coming from himself and the government. </p>
              <p>So in the UK, the average health care expenditure per person was US$3,600. The average British person lives to 81.5 years. In the case of Singapore, the average health care expenditure (paid for by the individual as well as government subsidies) was US$2,400 and the average Singaporean lives to slightly more than 82 years. So we spend less on doctors but live longer than the average Briton.</p>
              <p>This means that we have better health care. By the way, it also means that our health care is relatively cheap, spending much less than the average Briton and even much less than the average American. I think the presence of so many cheap foreign nurses and other hospital staff has lowered cost. So stop griping about so many foreigners. </p>
              <p>3)Our education system is ranked 4th best in the world. Here is the link in case you don't believe me:</p>
              <p>http://eblogfa.com/tech/top-20-best-education-systems-countries-in-the-world#axzz3FFl2Sb4S</p>
              <p>Our success in so many fields means that government policies are basically correct. Otherwise, we could not have done so well. </p>
              <p>4)On another front, there is little corruption here compared to the rest of the world. We were ranked fifth cleanest country by Transparency International:</p>
              <p>http://www.transparency.org/cpi2013/results</p>
              <p>No other Asian country is in the top 10 list and the next most honest Asian country is Japan with a ranking of 18th most honest. This suggests that our ministers may be the poorest in Asia. Yes, I know that they earn millions of dollars. But that pales in comparison to the millions and sometimes billions in under-the-table money other Third World leaders get. </p>
              <p>For example, the New York Times reported that Wen JiaoBao former leader of China made billions of dollars which he put in his family members' accounts. Don't believe me? Here is the link:</p>
              <p>http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/26/business/global/family-of-wen-jiabao-holds-a-hidden-fortune-in-china.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0</p>
              <p>5)As for crime, we have among the lowest crime rates in the world. I don't have to show you statistics to prove that, right? If you do not believe, just google for homicide rates in the world. Don't be lazy and do your own googling. </p>
              <p>Our high standard of living, good schools, healthcare, low crime rate were all achieved with low taxes. I know many of you do not believe we have low taxes. But the truth is that even after COE, ERP the tax bite is much lower than most other countries. </p>
              <p>For example, GST (called VAT) in Europe is generally about 20%. Income taxes, property taxes, company taxes are all higher in US and Europe. Don't believe me? See this link:</p>
              <p> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates</p>
              <p>So the lower GST, income, corporate, property taxes more than make up for the high car taxes in Singapore. In Singapore taxes come to about 14% of GDP. The taxman in the UK and US takes 39% and 27% respectively. See link:</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP</p>
              <p>But that is not the end of the story. Despite their high taxes, the governments have been irresponsible and cannot make ends meet. They spend more than they tax and thus have to borrow. Today the US government owes $17 trillion. Most EU governments are in debt and some have gone broke. </p>
              <p>Despite our low taxes, our governements managed to SAVE money. We have huge reserves managed by GIC and Temasek. GIC is not so hot with a rate of return of 4% in Sing dollar terms. But Temasek was making 16% return since it started!</p>
              <p>If you don't believe me that our government has done an excellent job, will you believe the World Bank? The World Bank gives out annual 'report cards' on governance and it gave our government top marks in all except for one category. See this link:</p>
              <p>file:///C:/Users/PaPa-PC/Downloads/c193%20(1).pdf</p>
              <p>The one that we did not score top marks was in 'Voice and Accountability.' We got an average ranking. I guess that is because our government does what it thinks best and tends to ignore public opinion.  But in the other 5 categories, we were in the top 10%. Its like getting a report card with 5 'A's and 1 'C'. Pretty good. </p>

              lazy and do your own googling. </p>
              <p>Our high standard of living, good schools, healthcare, low crime
              rate were all achieved with low taxes. I know many of you do not
              believe we have low taxes. But the truth is that even after COE,
              ERP the tax bite is much lower than most other countries. </p>
              <p>For example, GST (called VAT) in Europe is generally about 20%.
              Income taxes, property taxes, company taxes are all higher in US
              and Europe. Don't believe me? See this link:</p>
              <p> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_rates</p>
              <p>So the lower, GST, income, corporate, property taxes more than
              make up for the high car taxes in Singapore. In Singapore taxes
              come to about 14% of GDP. The taxman in the UK and US takes 39% and
              27% respectively.</p>
              <p>But that is not the end of the story. Despite their high taxes,
              the governments have been irresponsible and cannot make ends meet.
              They spend more than they tax and thus have to borrow. Today the US
              government owes $17 trillion. Most EU governments are in debt and
              some have gone broke. </p>
              <p>Despite our low taxes, our governements managed to SAVE money.
              We have huge reserves managed by GIC and Temasek. GIC is not so hot
              with a rate of return of 4% in Sing dollar terms. But Temasek was
              making 16% return since it started!</p>
              <p>If you don't believe me that our government has done an
              excellent job, will you believe the World Bank? The World Bank
              gives out annual 'report cards' on governance and it gave our
              government top marks in all except for one category. See this
              link:</p>
              <p>file:///C:/Users/PaPa-PC/Downloads/c193%20(1).pdf</p>
              <p>The one that we did not score top marks was in 'Voice and
              Accountability.' We got an average ranking. I guess that is because
              our government does what it thinks best and tends to ignore public
              opinion.  But in the other 5 categories, we were in the top
              10%. Its like getting a report card with 5 'A's and 1 'C'. Pretty
              good. </p>
