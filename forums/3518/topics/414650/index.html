              <p>Opposition Reform Party or RP said today that it has withdrawn its application to join the Singapore Democratic Alliance or SDA.<br> <br>In a statement, RP says it will continue to explore other ways to collaborate with veteran MP Chiam See Tong and the Singapore People’s Party or SPP.<br> <br>The statement comes in the wake of the fallout between Mr Chiam and his former close aide, Desmond Lim. <br><br>Both men had disagreed over whether to let RP join the SDA.<br><br>This led to a feud over whether Mr Lim is still the Secretary General of the SDA, as both camps seek to oust the other from power. <br><br>The incident is reminiscent of the spat between Mr Chiam and his ex-protégé, Chee Soon Juan, which led to Mr Chiam leaving the Singapore Democratic Party. <br><br>RP’s Secretary General Kenneth Jeyaretnam says his party is still working on forming a "dream team" with Mr Chiam in the upcoming general elections. <br><br>This, he says, could come in the form of a new alliance, in place of SDA. <br><br>When asked if he would welcome Mr Chiam into RP, Mr Jeyaretnam says he’s open to the suggestion. <br><br><strong>"We’d certainly welcome Mr Chiam, coming into the Reform Party. Whether he would wish to do so or not, that’s another matter. But we would certainly offer him a very senior position in our Central Executive Committee were he to come in"</strong><br><br>Singapore’s next General Election must be called by February 2012.</p>

              <p>Terry:</p>
              <p>hahah what a load of nonsense. being a keyboard warrior is easy, try getting into the ground first then comment please.</p>
              <p>to everyone else:<br> alright since I’m no longer a member I can tell everyone what happened.</p>
              <p>1) No respect for orderliness and proper administration</p>
              <p>Desmond
               allowed 30 members barged into room without proper administration “Go 
              in go in don’t need to register”. a …SPP cadre and I stopped the crowd 
              and like a mad man he shouted and insisted his way through.</p>
              <p>2) Inappropriate behavior of a Sect Gen</p>
              <p>first thing right up to my face “Alex Tan your no longer a member of SPP because your application was not approved on 6 of May”</p>
              <p>(my
               application form is under his care all along. now it’s gone? and i’m 
              not with SPP? no worries I will stay with Chiam side as a non-member 
              supporter volunteer as an adviser.)</p>
              <p>the room was a rowdy drama for
               the first 1 hour with Desmond’s “members” and I can tell many of them 
              are clueless at what’s going on. are they members? SPP needs volunteers 
              every Thursday to help out at Meet-the-People session so badly and now 
              popped out so many members?</p>
              <p>2 “cadre” members voted into SPP CEC, 
              bryan chua bingsheng and Sydney soon. both just joined this year and yet
               they are “cadre”? just because Desmond insisted so? does Democracy 
              means disregard of proper procedures?</p>
              <p>Desmond’s men was so rude in
               the room. taunting Mrs Chiam, shouting words like “you are old and 
              slow”? like wth? is this a circus?</p>
              <p>I was giving my ending speech to the conference and Desmond can shout all the way from his seat “this is not a member!”</p>
              <p>let
               me share this scenario I saw personally with my own eyes. at the end of
               the conference, chiam asked Desmond for the 5 new “cadre” members’ hp 
              number and address. Desmond waved him off and rushed the 5 out of the 
              room.<br> what arrogance?! I pity the old man. I would have slapped Desmond if I am Mr Chiam.</p>
              <p>a
               sect gen of the Democratic Alliance with no regards for civilized and 
              democratic orderliness. SPP will be in ruins if it has a leader like 
              this. Singapore will be in ruins if it has a MP like this</p>
              <p>Alex Tan was formerly with the SPP.</p>
