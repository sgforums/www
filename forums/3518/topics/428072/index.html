              <p><strong>Apr 17, 2011 - Sunday Times</strong></p>
              <p>THE ruling People's Action Party has lived up to its responsibilities 
              to Singaporeans, the vast majority of whom should have seen their lives 
              improve over the last five years, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on
               Sunday.</p>
              <p>'We don't give ourselves our own report card, but I think if people 
              asked me, I would say, we have passed the examination,' said Mr Lee, in 
              his address at the 25th anniversary of Young PAP, the youth wing of the 
              party.</p>
              <p>Taking stock of the last five years, which he described as a 
              'tumultuous roller coaster ride', including weathering the global 
              economic crisis three years ago, Mr Lee said Singapore came through the 
              storm strengthened and more united than before.</p>
              <p>He ranged over the progress that had been achieved in many areas, 
              from housing and education to improving the environment and raising 
              workers' wages.</p>
              <p>Mr Lee said the lives of the vast majority of Singaporeans have 
              improved since the last elections, and their household incomes have gone
               up and in real terms, despite the rising cost of living, which is 
              looming as a top hot-button issue in the coming General Election.</p>
              <p>'So what we can do we have done, and in a practical outcome. I think it has helped many, many Singaporeans,' he said.</p>
              <p>PM Lee said the PAP, which will be campaigning on the slogan, 
              Securing Our Future Together, in the coming General Election, will 
              deliver on the promises outlined in its manifesto, because 'the PAP has 
              always delivered'.</p>

              <p>Scenario1:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i once saw people on a sinking ship fulla holes in the middles of a huge ocean...fulla holes.no one wanted to repair it even though it was sinking....then some people founded some material to repair the holes on sinking ship.then some found a dinghyand floated it in the middle of the huge ocean.</p>
              <p>so some started patching up the ship with material and found it was difficult because they didnt have the right engneer or people with knowledge to fix it.then some decided to climb into the dinghy b4 the ship sinks.</p>
              <p>so the situation ended where one group of people climbed into a small dinghy in the middle of the ocean.the other stayed back on sinking ship scratching heads trying to know how to fix the holes on sinking ship with water gushing out of the many holes.</p>
              <p>results:people in dinghy were found 1 month later dried up like ikan bilis.</p>
              <p>sinking ship sank a bit at a time until there was no way get materials to fix the holes underwater.everyone died on it...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>scenario 2:sinking ship had people and no one cared much n pretended ship would fix itself somehow...everyone died  as ship slowly sank.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>captain of ship was dry n comfy all the while until he was on the roof top of his sinking ship a few metres from circling sharks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>solution:</p>
              <p>1)either u get experts to fix the holes on sinkin ship.</p>
              <p>2) build another brand new ship b4 old ship eventually sinks.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
