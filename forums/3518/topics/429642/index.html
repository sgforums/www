              <p>When asked by a netizen Angela Xu on the PAP’s plans to address the tensions between foreign manpower needs and building a Singaporeans identity, PM Lee replied:</p>
              <p>“<strong>We won’t bring in too many foreigners too fast. We’ll work hard to integrate them with our people. We are not planning to make a 6+ million population. Not trying to get there. Dont worry.</strong>”</p>
              <p>PM Lee’s comment appeared to have contradicted his original stance on the matter in which he urged Singaporeans repeatedly to welcome more foreigners.</p>
              <p>During a National Day rally speech last year, PM Lee said:</p>
              <p>‘<strong>Let us welcome them (immigrants) with an open heart, help them to fit in and encourage those who will become citizens to strike roots here. If we do this well, by the next generation, their children will be native Singaporeans</strong>.”</p>
              <p><br>The sudden U-turn by Mr Lee does not change that fact that the PAP has planned all along to bring in more foreigners with PAP candidate for Tampines GRC Mah Bow Tan saying way back in 2007 that Singapore needs 6.5 million people.</p>
              <p><br>More importantly, PAP de facto leader Lee Kuan Yew proclaimed only last week that the PAP will still be bringing in more foreigners:</p>
              <p><br>“<strong>Please remember: We still need 900,000 foreign workers on work permits.</strong>”</p>
              <p><br>Singaporeans should not be hoodwinked by Mr Lee’s last-minute sweet talk for a desperate man will make all kinds of promises that he will not be able to fulfil.</p>
              <p>90,000 grateful new citizens will be voting on 7 May after which <strong>900,000 may be voting five years later</strong>.</p>

              <p>"Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We can deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members in Parliament.

              <p>what PM is doing now - apology, raise income ceiling for housing, lower foreigner intake - are just "<strong>cooling measures</strong>" (Mah Bow Tan's favourite term).  PAP hope to cool us down to vote them in 2 days time. </p>
              <p>hope singaporeans see through this and think long-term: the next 5 years are at stake.  without alternative party in parliament, PAP will fall back to its old stance.  power to the people comes in 5 years.  pls treasure our vote.  please treasure this opportunity to make a change.</p>

              <p>2006 Election aftermath</p>
              <p>What do you think was on voters minds when Lee Hsien Loong decided to increase the GST to 7% and increase ministers pay shortly after he was given a strong mandate the 2006?  When he campaigned for a strong mandate in 2006, his message was he will take care of the poor, look after Sngaporeans and address the widening income gap. But the moment he got into office his priority was to increase GST and increase his ministers' pay.<br><br>Now that it is election time he is saying the same things again - that he will take care of Singaporeans and help those in need.  These is only one intelligent line (and countless unintelligent ones) I remember from George Bush:</p>

              <div style="text-align: center;">With more and more foreigners coming in and taking over our <strong>job, housing and university places</strong>, only a fool will sit by and continue to vote for PAP which supports the foreigner policy so vigorously.</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">It has come to the point that we need to wake up the PAP or we Singaporeans will eventually get outnumbered by foreigners. Jobs are lost to foreigners. (wait till you get retrenched)</div>
