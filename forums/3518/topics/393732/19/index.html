              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>PARABLE of THE LIONS &amp; THE WOLF<br></strong></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Creator put 2 large flocks of Sheep in the field, one in the North, one in the South. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">The Creator also given them 2 types of Enemies : one is Lion, the other is Wolf. </span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #009900;">Choices Given</span></strong><br>The Creator said: <span style="color: purple;"><strong>"If
               you choose the Wolves, I will put EIGHTY-EIGHT on your land. It will 
              eat you as he like, but they are smaller size than the Lion therefore 
              smaller appetite. If you choose Lion, I will give two Lions but you can 
              choose which Lion to be put there and you can change it anytime you 
              want."<br></strong></span>So, if you are one of the Sheep, which one would you choose?<br><span style="color: green;"><strong></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="color: green;"><strong>Choices Made<br></strong></span><strong><span style="color: purple;">Well,
               the flock in the South thought : "The Lion is more violent than the 
              Wolf. Better choose the 88 Wolves." So, they chosen 88 wolves. The flock
               in the North thought : even though the Lion is more violent, but we get
               to choose which Lion. So, they chosen two Lions.</span></strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><span style="color: purple;"><strong>Immediate Outcome<br></strong>The
               88 Wolves entered the South and started to hunt for the Sheep. Due to 
              its small appetite, it ate only a sheep in a few days. Therefore, the 
              flock will only be hunted once in a few days.<br><br>In the North, the 
              Sheep chosen one of the Lions, and the other Lion was placed at the 
              Creator's place. The Lion was more violent and bigger appetite than the 
              Wolf. It ate one sheep in a day. Therefore, the flock has to run for 
              their lives every day. So, the Northern herd quickly asked the Creator 
              to switch the Lion. But the other Lion has starved for a few days 
              therefore more appetite than the earlier Lion. The Sheep has to run for 
              their lives all day long.<br><br><strong>Immediate Regret<br></strong>The
               Southern flock started to laugh at the Northern flock and felt glad 
              that they have chosen the right enemy. The Northern flock has regretted 
              and asked the Creator to change the enemy to the Wolf. But the Creator 
              said : <strong>"Once you have made your choice of your enemy, you cannot change. Your only right is to make a choice between the Lions."<br><br></strong>So,
               the Northern flock has to keep on switching the Lions. But both Lions 
              are violent, therefore they were suffering with either choice. At the 
              end, they finally decided not to change regularly since they were the 
              same : they kept one of the Lion with them until the other one is 
              starved until so thin and almost dead then only they switched the Lions.<br><br><strong></strong>
              </span></p><p><strong></strong> </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #6600cc;">Realization</span><br>Soon, the thin Lion realized that its fate was in the hands of the Sheep.</strong> <strong>The Sheep can send it back to the Creator anytime they wished and let it starved until almost dead. So,
               it treated the Sheep very well this time. It promised that it'll eat 
              only those that are sick or dead and it will not harm those healthy 
              ones.  The lambs were very 
              happy and suggested to keep only the thin Lion and let the fat Lion 
              starved to dead. An old sheep quickly reminded them : "Do not forget, 
              the thin Lion is afraid that we send it back to the Creator to starve, 
              that's why it is nice to us. If we let the fat Lion die, we will loose 
              our choice and the thin Lion will be back to its true colour." So, the 
              rest thought he is right therefore they switched the fat Lion back after
               it is starved to almost dead.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">Better Outcome</span><br></strong>The fat Lion is now so thin with only skin covering bones. It also realized that its fate is in the control of the Sheep. </p>
              In order to stay with the Sheep longer, it even be more self-controlled : it ate only those dead sheep and being very nice to the Sheep. It just 
              wished that it can stay longer here instead of starving at the Creator's
               place. So, the Lion that was sent back to the Creator was very very 
              very sad. After all these trials, the Northern flock finally can enjoy 
              their lives with freedom and fearless to the Government. <em><span style="color: #666666;">(Look at the Western countries like France, Australia &amp; States)</span></em><br><br><strong><span style="color: #000099;">Worse Outcome</span><br></strong>As
               for the flock in the South, the Wolf has no competitor therefore it 
              became wild and hegemony. It killed the Sheep in tens and twenties daily
               - it was sick of the mutton and now would just enjoyed to suck the warm
               blood. When sucking the blood, it didn't allow the Sheep to make noise. Whichever
               make noise, it'll kill them. Sometimes, it will just hunt the Sheep and
               killed them for fun. The Southern flock now regretted : "If we knew 
              it'd be like this, we should have chosen the Lions." <em><span style="color: #666666;">(Aren't we now regretting too?)</span></em><br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">It's Time to Make Your Choice!<br> </span></strong>
              <p>Now, our fellow friend, This Election is the chance for 
              us to make our new choice. You can choose to be like the Southern flock-
               like what the choice we have made for the past 50 years (choose PAP the
               Wolf, and there will always be new wolves that is regenerated, and not 
              to mention those new wolves like Tin-Tin, FUCK-Me-Hard or that callous 
              General who rubbed salt into serving National Service), OR you can 
              choose to be like the Northern flock - Vote for Change, Change the 
              Government to Alternative Parties (the Opposition) - just like the 
              Australians, French, and even Americans ! If you are not happy, you can 
              switch in 4 - 5 years time.</p>
              <p>What do you loose? It'll never be worse than our first 
              choice which we have suffered for 50 years. In fact, it'll only be 
              better because <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU FINALLY BE THE BOSS! YOU CAN CHOOSE! They'll have to be thankful to you and serve you well!</span></strong></p>

              <p>I just don't want the opposition to rule, and then the incumbent party becomes the opposition, and that will make things alot worse than it currently is. I can see alot of beneficial policies coming into place, but never put into action because of that.</p>

But they have no time to attend oppostion rallies as its their exam periods (be it NUS, NTU, SMU, SIM)<br>- 30 April - 2 May is a nice long weekend public holiday. Lots of families go overseas for a short vacation, no time to go for opposition rallies. <br>- Examination period is coming after the long weekend and after elections, parents are busy preparing for their childrens' examinations. <br><br>So who is attending the opposition rallies??? <br>Haha...</p></div>
