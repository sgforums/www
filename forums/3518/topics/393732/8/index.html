              <p>Singapore’s opposition parties are increasing the frequency of house visits ahead of the coming general election, now speculated to be held at the end of the year.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party conducted a walkabout at Clementi yesterday night while the Singapore Democratic Party has been making regular visits to Bukit Panjang and Bishan Toa-Payoh.</p>
              <p>Despite the effort and time put in by the party activists, their grassroots activities are seldom reported in the mainstream media, thereby giving the public an erroneous perception that they have been “inactive” and making a “cameo appearance” only once in five years.</p>
              <p>Due to limited manpower and resources, the opposition is unlikely to counter the well-oiled grassroots machinery of the ruling party effectively.</p>

              <p>Yup... thats why we must go deeper in our thinking at times.... <br><br>Your generation not happy doesnt mean everyone is unhappy. <br><br>Those generations have benefitted under PAP rule.... and apart from that getting topups everytime the govt announces budget.... whats there to be unhappy about the present govt? <br><br>Those unhappy are probably those in their mids 20s to 60.</p>
