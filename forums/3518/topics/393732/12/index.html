                                      January 2011 1911 hrs<br> <br></span> <span><span>SINGAPORE: Singapore's Registers of
                                      Electors are being revised once again.<br> <br> According to a Government Gazette notification, the Prime Minister
                                      has directed the Registration Officer to do the revision and
                                      complete it on, or before February 28 this year.<br> <br> The Registers for all 23 electoral divisions were last certified on
                                      March 31, 2010, and had 2.3 million names.<br> <br> The latest gazette notification also stipulates a new date for
                                      names of electors to qualify to be in the Registers.<br> <br> The order by the Prime Minister states that the prescribed date
                                      shall be January 1 in any year, instead of July 1.<br> <br> Analysts whom Channel NewsAsia spoke to said this would allow the
                                      revised registers to contain the names of those who qualify to vote
                                      as on January 1, 2011.<br> <br> Analysts said this is also an indication that elections are
                                      looming.<br> <br> Meanwhile, another report that's awaited is the Electoral
                                      Boundaries Review Committee.<br> <br> There is a likelihood of smaller group representation
                                      constituencies and more single member constituencies.<br> <br> The next General Election must be held by February 2012, while the
                                      election for the Presidency is due this year.<br> <br> -CNA/wk</span></span><br> <br> Source:<a rel="nofollow"><br> http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1102479/1/.html</a></p>

              <p><em>The registers of electors are being revised again – the third time since 2006 General Election. (AFP File Photo)</em></p>
              <p>Prime Minister <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Lee Hsien Loong</a> has directed that the registers of electors be updated again — 
              Singaporeans 21 years old and above, and new immigrants who have taken 
              up Singapore citizenship since Feb 1 last year are now qualified to be 
              electors.</p>
              <p>The third revision since the May 2006 <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+general+election&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">General Election</a>, the notice published in the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Government+Gazette&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Government Gazette</a> yesterday indicated that changes will be made and completed by Feb 18.</p>
              <p>MPs and political observers have seen the move as a way to ensure 
              that there would be more eligible voters at the next polls due by 
              February next year, reported <em>The Straits Times.</em></p>
              <p>“It’s a good move to allow more people who are entitled to vote to do so,” said Hong Kah GRC MP <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Alvin+Yeo&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Alvin Yeo</a>. “Those not entitled to vote can also take steps to put themselves back on the registers.”</p>
              <p>Not everyone feels positively about the latest update, however.</p>
              <p>Mr Eugene Tan, a law lecturer at the<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore+management+university&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> Singapore Management  University</a>,
               said there may be those who take the skeptical view that the latest 
              revision aims to include more new citizens who are more supportive of 
              the Government.</p>
              <p>“But the revision will also include more young people, who are 
              perceived to be more unpredictable in their voting decisions and less 
              enamoured with the ruling <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=people%27s+action+party&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">People’s Action Party</a>,” he added.</p>
              <p>News of the revision has also invited fresh speculation about the timing of the next polls.</p>
              <p>Ang Mo Kio GRC MP <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Inderjit+Singh&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Inderjit Singh</a> believes that the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Electoral+Boundaries+Review+Committee&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Electoral Boundaries Review Committee</a> will release its report shortly after the latest revision to reflect 
              the most updated demographic trends, paving the way for polls by June 
              this year.</p>
              <p>Polling and district boundaries will also be reviewed and altered to 
              ensure that no polling station handles too many or too few voters.</p>
              <p>The<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Parliamentary+Elections+Act&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> Parliamentary Elections Act</a> limits revision of voter rolls to a maximum of three years after an election.</p>
              <p>The rolls were revised once between the 1988 and 1991 general 
              elections and twice each time ahead of the elections in 1997, 2001 and 
              2006.</p>
              <p>The second revision ahead of the 2006 General Election, for instance,
               was ordered in January 2006 and completed by Feb 28, some two months 
              before the polls on May 6 that year.</p>
              <p>Since the 2006 election, the registers have also been revised twice – in February 2009 and February 2010.</p>
              <p>The second revision showed 2,311,582 eligible voters as at March 31 
              last year, approximately 40,000 more than 2.26 million names on the 
              rolls after the first.</p>
              <p>An Elections Department spokesman said more details about the revision can be expected in two weeks’ time.<br><strong><br>Source:</strong><a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/04/voter-rolls-updated-again/"><br>http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/04/voter-rolls-updated-again/</a></p>

              <div class="entry">
              <p><em>The boundaries of altered polling districts was published on Friday. (Photo: AFP)</em></p>
              <p>Three days after the announcement that voter rolls are being updated, changes to the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=polling+districts&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">polling districts</span></a> were released on Friday.</p>
              <p>The changes, to ensure no polling station handles too many or too few voters, were detailed in a 109-page document, published in the electronic version of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=government+gazette&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">government gazette</span></a>.</p>
              <p>This is the third time the polling districts, which form sub-units within constituencies, have been updated since the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=2006+General+Election&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">2006 General Election</span></a>. Polling district changes were last announced in Feburary 2010.</p>
              <p>Political observer Eugene Tan said he is “surprised” by the release of the boundaries of altered polling districts since the electoral rolls are still being updated.</p>
              <p>The registers of electors were reported to be undergoing revision on Tuesday, with Prime Minister <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Lee+Hsien+Loong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Lee Hsien Loong</span></a> directing that the revision be made and completed by Feb 28.</p>
              <p>“The <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Electoral+Boundaries+Review+Committee&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Electoral Boundaries Review Committee</span></a> report is more significant or acts as a precursor of when the elections will be because that is when the boundaries of the GRCs and SMCs are let known,” added Mr Tan.</p>
              <p>But the boundaries report will have to wait until the electoral roll is updated, he noted.</p>
              <p>In the last three elections, the time-lag between polling district changes and the release of the boundaries report ranged from 19 days in 2001 to six months in 2006. The general election followed soon after the report was released.</p>
              <p>In 1997, the election was held just over a month later, in 2001, 17 days later and in 2006, just over two months later.</p>
