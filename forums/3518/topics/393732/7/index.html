              <p> </p>
              <p>A few months ago, we “reported” (<em>on our scrolling bulletin board – now removed due to compatibility issue</em>) that Singapore’s General Election was originally planned for late November 2010, this year.</p>
              <p>However, due to the unfortunate passing of “Singapore’s mother” cum “first lady” Mdm Kwa Geok Choo, the ruling party decided to shelf the plan (<em>which again was reported exclusively by us through the same bulletin board</em>).</p>
              <p>According to our latest reliable sources, the General Election has now been scheduled for sometime <strong>11th December 2010 to 18th December 2010</strong> if there are no further complications and unforeseen circumstances. Should for some reason this date is vacated, then the next “backup” date would be sometime mid of March, 2011. </p>
              <p>Further checks with our local correspondent confirms that many of the requisite logistics have been arranged and being setup, including but not limited to polling stations, void decks, av equipment, etc. </p>
              <p>We are not sure if the ruling party will change these dates to catch the opposition parties “off guard” following our report but should they decide to keep to the schedule, then the ”accuracy” of our report on the respective dates are 8g% for mid December 2010 and 15% for mid March 2011.</p>
              <p>For “lucky” Singaporeans who gets to vote, do remember that when you cast that sacred vote of yours, you are not voting for yourself or for your present. You are voting for your children and their future.</p>
              <p>Remember also that when you cast that vote of yours, you are not voting for yourself, for him or for her, not for the Malays, for the Chinese or for the Indians but collectively for the FUTURE OF SINGAPORE as a CITIZEN OF SINGAPORE.</p>
              <p>Please “vote with your consciences, not with fear” </p>

              <p class="art-PostHeader"><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/10/14/exclusive-pap-grassroots-machinery-preparing-for-coming-general-election/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/10/14/exclusive-pap-grassroots-machinery-preparing-for-coming-general-election/</a></p>
              <p>According to reliable insider sources, the formidable PAP grassroots machinery is gearing up in preparation for the coming general election, speculated to be held at the end of the year.</p>
              <p>PAP MPs have increased the frequency of their walkabouts in their respective constituencies and PAP ministers have been conducting regular dialogue sessions with residents to allay their concerns and anxieties about various policies and issues such as its much maligned immigration and labor policies.</p>
              <p>PAP branch secretaries and grassroots leaders have also been asked to prepare for adequate logistical support in the event of a snap poll with more meetings being held among PAP activists to discuss plans and strategies for the election.</p>
              <p>The electoral boundaries are likely to be announced only in the ”last-minute” as in previous years to catch the opposition “off guard” again.</p>
              <p>Though there appears to be a groundswell of support for the opposition at the present moment, PAP activists are quietly confident of the support of Singaporeans who will be disinclined to “rock the boat.”</p>
              <p>Furthermore, any dip in votes from native Singaporeans are likely to be “compensated” with those from the new citizens who are largely behind the PAP regime.</p>
              <p>While the opposition parties such as the Reform Party have been working hard behind the scene, they lack the resources of the PAP to reach out to large number of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>As PAP strongman Lee Kuan Yew boasted to a visiting delegation of Chinese officials last year, “all CCs, CCCs and RCs are part of the PAP”.</p>
              <p>It remains an uphill task for the opposition parties to counter the pervasive influence of the PAP grassroots organizations which are ubiquitous in all parts of Singapore.</p>

              <p>Following The Temasek Review’s publication of an article yesterday predicting that the next general election is likely to be called in December this year, the Straits Times has corroborated our claims with an article that PAP MPs have been asked to have fresh photos taken.</p>
              <p>According to the report, PAP MPs received an email from the PAP HQ two weeks ago signed by Baey Yam Keng instructing them to have their official photographs taken at Parliament House.</p>
              <p>They will also be video recorded making speeches after which their performances will be assessed and criticized accordingly.</p>
              <p>This is yet another sign that the PAP is preparing its MPs for the coming general election which will be called anytime soon.</p>
              <p>With public disaffection and disgruntlement against the PAP regime at an all-time high, the ruling PAP is widely expected to lose a few seats including a GRC in the next general election.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans should vote wisely this time round as the stakes have never been higher.</p>

              <p class="post-title entry-title">There is speculation that the General Election is just around the corner (Dec 2010?) as Straits Times today (14 Oct 2010) reported that PAP MPs were asked to have their photos taken and prepare for rehearsal for speeches.<br><br>I just want to show you something from the 2006 Election:<br><br><em>"<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am concerned about less-skilled Singaporeans, whose jobs and wages are under pressure</span>. I worry for older Singaporeans too, living by themselves and having to provide for their medical and daily expenses. I am troubled that a terrorist attack will sow suspicion and discord among Singaporeans.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">We must respond boldly and creatively to these opportunities and challenges</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">expand our horizons and aim high</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">We will continue to restructure our economy to make it more productive and resilient</span>. We should make our society more vibrant and cohesive. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">And our young must be imbued with the same can-do, never-say-die Singapore spirit</span> that has brought us here"</em><br><em>.– Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, his letter to Singaporeans, PAP Manifesto for General Election 2006.</em><br><br>You remember this letter sent to you during the last election? I want to show it to you to remind you of PM Lee's promise in 2006 to "respond boldly and creatively" to the challenges faced by Singaporeans. That was 4 years ago. Just look at the above paragraph - right on top, he said "I'm concerned...about less skilled Singaporeans whose jobs and wages are under pressure". He sent this letter to all Singaporeans during the last election and after he got elected he opened the floodgates to cheap foreign labor and that increased the downward pressure on the wages of lower skilled workers. He increased GST - a regressive tax that would be most heavily shouldered by low wages earners. He increased the pay of his cabinet which was already the highest in the world prior to the increase.<br><br>When the campaigning starts and the PAP men give their speeches and make their promises, remember what Lee Hsien Loong said in 2006 and what he has done since.</p>

              <p>Because just before the 2006 elections, it was exactly in the same state, a major revamp. How often does a food centre/wet market get revamped? Before every election lor.</p>

              <p>I wonder this coming election will the MP uses his Grassroot leaders to help in the campaign?? Can the MP do their campaign without the Grassroots help? Can they solely rely on their party members??</p>
              <p>I was a GRL before and involved in RC activity.....The MP activated the Constituency manager / staff to mobilze the GRL in their respective RC to go door to door for votes. The best part the MP will ask the Town council/ HDB representative/RC Chairman to walk with them in case residents have some comment on neighbourliness matters</p>
              <p>On one occasion, I overheard the MP asked if this household a Singapore Citizen or this unit a rented one???  Quite sad to hear this.</p>
              <p>Do we really need Grassroot in the neighbourhood? Certain matters need grassroot help but not necessary for activities. The private sectors events are more appealing than the grassroots one. Why cant they save the $$$$ and give to the poor one?</p>
