              <p>General Election can only fall during school holiday when many facilities are available......</p>
              <p>I hope this round the PAP will not engage the uncle/auntie or goondu  from the grassroot organization to go along with them. Yes no doubt some of the grassroot leaders are PAP members but for fair play....The constituency office or PA Staff should not be involve in anyway. Last time election, all the goondu just follows the MP.</p>
              <p>Heard many PAP members receive their membership renewal notices. Not sure if this notice can be use as an benchmark whether there will be helpers in the next GE.</p>
              <p>If many renew the membership it means that indication of helping is there.</p>
              <p>With so many heartache policies and with us living in a chaotic world the voters will know what is good for them.  After all, we are living in the "LAST" days. A matter of fact, there's no perfect system on earth. </p>

              <p>SINGAPORE : The next general election is not due till February 2012, 
              but Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo said it could be in the second 
              quarter of this year.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo, who is in Bangkok for the Civil 
              Service Exchange Programme, was speaking at a dinner organised by the 
              Singapore Club and the Singapore—Thailand Chamber of Commerce.</p>
              <p>He said he has been advising party members to be prepared after the Budget debate in March.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Yeo, who is also the MP for Aljunied GRC, has ruled out the third 
              quarter because of the Presidential Election which is due by August.</p>
              <p>"Pity
               that you can’t vote here, but it is a short distance away from 
              Singapore, maybe some of you will go back. And you, if you live in 
              Aljunied GRC, I hope you will know what to do," Mr Yeo quipped, drawing 
              laughter from the audience.</p>
              <p>The minister also spoke about 
              developing an ASEAN identity, saying the idea of bidding for the 2030 
              World Cup could bring the region together.</p>
              <p>But there would be many
               obstacles, he added. "We in ASEAN, 600 million people, can collectively
               cough up eight to ten world class stadiums. The distances are no worse 
              than, say, soccer stadiums in Brazil, so why can’t we make this 
              attempt?"</p>
              <p>He also said member countries could work towards fielding a joint team in 20 years’ time.</p>
              <p>He
               said: "I told the other foreign ministers — we (should) make our bid 
              before China, because if China says it wants 2030, if it says it before 
              us, I think we will be at a disadvantage.</p>
              <p>"But if we say it before
               China, then China may have to "rang bu", give way, then ASEAN goes 
              first since they want to be good friends with ASEAN."</p>
              <p>At a recent 
              retreat for ASEAN foreign ministers in Lombok, Indonesia, member 
              countries also agreed to fly the ASEAN flag alongside their national 
              flags at overseas missions on ASEAN Day, which is August 8. This will 
              take place from this year.</p>

              <p><strong>I've not decided on GE date yet: PM Lee</strong><br> <span class="update">By Evelyn Choo | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 23 January 2011 1859 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has not decided when Singapore's General Election (GE) should be.<br><br>Mr
               Lee said this on Sunday, after a recent comment by Foreign Minister 
              George Yeo which suggested that polls could be held as early as the 
              second quarter of this year.<br><br>The talk of a General Election has been fuelled by various comments on possible dates. <br><br>But
               Prime Minister Lee made his stand on Sunday. He said: "It can be next 
              year, until February. I mean, we haven't decided yet. It's not likely to
               be on the same day as the presidential election. But other than that, 
              there are many possibilities. So I think when it comes, it will come. 
              There's always a lot of excitement. I don't think it is part of my job 
              to add to that excitement."<br><br>Mr Lee was speaking to reporters on 
              the sidelines of a walkabout in his Teck Ghee ward. When asked if the 
              walkabout itself was the start of his political campaigning, he said: 
              "No, I do this every year, please don't read so much into it!"<br><br>He
               also said he has yet to receive the Electoral Boundaries Review 
              Committee report. All eyes are on the report, which draws up Singapore's
               electoral boundaries for the General Election. <br><br>Once the report 
              is released, political pundits say it will be a clear sign the General 
              Election is around the corner. The committee handling this report 
              convened in October last year.<br><br>At another community event at his 
              Marine Parade constituency, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong also weighed 
              in on possible General Election dates and made his preference known.<br><br>He wants it to be before the presidential election due by August this year.<br><br>He
               said: "You can argue both ways, but my preference would be, if PM seeks
               my view, is to hold it before the presidential election. Get the issues
               out of the way, and leave the presidential election without issues."<br><br>The past three presidential elections have not been held in the same year as the General Election.<br><br>Mr
               Goh was also asked if he would run for the presidency, to which he 
              replied "no", and said he would continue running as a candidate for 
              Marine Parade GRC.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
