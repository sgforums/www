              <p>Basically like u and me , we are all very unhappy with the presence of these foreigners .</p>
              <p>I am unhappy coz</p>
              <p>(1) The people at the top always win, even though they blew few billions on UBS and Citi &amp; YOG , they are still there . Little guys like us will be fried in our asses if we do make the slightest mistakes.</p>
              <p>(2) No free press , i am sick of those PLPs writing in forums to worship the glorious gahment , creating a distorted impression of the ground.</p>
              <p>(3) The fact that they advocate working till death is really scary dont u think? Never retire? wtf? Cheaper , faster &amp; better?</p>
              <p>(4) The fact that our true blue singaporeans with diplomas , degrees , masters are in the same shitty taxi line with me . What is wrong with the system? </p>
              <p>The above is just 4 of a super long list.</p>
              <p>Back to my friend , she actually supported the view that we should allow more of this people in.</p>
              <p>Coming from an accountant which a so called FT can replace her anytime &amp; anywhere , she still supports the policy. incredible right? Dont be surprised , their machinery is one hell of  a massive scale. I have attended some of their dinners and events and the turn out is almost always packed to capacity.</p>
              <p>Can u and me make a difference? We will know very soon</p>

              <p>Yes based on point 3 , this really need to jolt Singaporeans up. This is a statement if u make in UK , US , u get kicked out of office right away.</p>
              <p>Never retire is something that cannot be tolerated. They say is simple , they use mouth and talk and get paid millions , of coz la i wont wanna retire too u know!</p>
              <p>If im going to drive till 70 , u guys dare to take my taxi? helloooo taxi driving is not use mouth and talk , its using alertness , focus and stamina.</p>
              <p>As for my friend , being in CCC , she is probably binded to vote well u know who.</p>

              <p>Is dis true????</p>
              <p>Is dis true dat Mr Chiam wants to abandon Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC to contest with Kenneth's RP in Hong Kah GRC,that will be helmed by</p>
              <p>Manpower Min Gan Kim Yong???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then,if Dr Chee's really want to take my place,DIS IS GONNA BE DA HAPPIEST MOMENT EVER......But,I'll rather vote for DPM Wong........What if Chiam and KJ will get to get RP into the SDA?????Will this be a new revolution???</p>
              <p><br>Here's my absolute prediction......</p>
              <p><br>-SDP to contest in Bishan-Toa Payoh and Holland-Bukit Timah GRCs,Bukit Panjang and a new SMC ahead.....</p>
              <p><br>-SDA together with RP will contest in absolutely 3 GRCs,including Potong Pasir too...Hong Kah, West Coast and Pasir Ris-</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Punggol,along with another new SMC there...I bet Potong Pasir will surely get back into PAP's hands and BTP will get it....</p>
              <p><br>-NSP to contest in Jurong,Jalan Besar and Tampines</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>GRCs,Macpherson,Nee Soon Central and Yio Chu Kang....With Steve Chia seen at the AMK GRC,could he lead a team to contest in Ang Mo Kio GRC as well,following the death of Dr Balaji Sadasivan???</p>
              <p><br>-WP to contest in Aljunied,East Coast(maybe)and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>even Sembawang GRC too....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Will Hougang be eventually remains the only opp SMC????Joo Chiat,most likely.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nee Soon East,unlikely,maybe taken by either SDP or NSP......</p>
              <p><br>-Socialist Front and USD to contest in the remaining GRCs and</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some SMCs,maybe Marine Parade and Tanjong Pagar GRCs????????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmmmmm,my predictions may be not confirmed exactly,BUT,there could be some possibility,IT could be never any walkovers all around dis TIME!!!!!!!!!!But I think PAP may win all or even almost all.......Opp fellas could step in to do the best they can,but I don't think they could.....See you by next year!!</p>
