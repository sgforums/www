              <p>I AM concerned that Mr Chiam See Tong and Mr Low Thia Khiang may leave 
              their single-member wards in Potong Pasir and Hougang respectively to 
              lead a team each to contest a group representation constituency (GRC) in
               the coming general election ('Gunning for a GRC'; March25).</p>
              <p>There can be only two outcomes.</p>
              <p>One, Singapore may lose two Cabinet ministers and up to 10 existing and prospective key political appointment holders.</p>
              <p>The self-renewal process within the People's Action Party (PAP) may also be derailed.</p>
              <p>Two, Singapore may lose two respected, veteran opposition leaders whose alternative views are valued by most citizens.</p>
              <p>I appeal to Mr Chiam and Mr Low to do what is in Singapore's best long-term interest.</p>
              <p>Already, there will be more single-member constituencies 
              (SMCs) in the upcoming GE. A number of rules which opposition parties 
              griped about have been relaxed.ï¿½</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam and Mr Low have also told the press that opposition parties do not have the strength in depth to govern just yet.</p>
              <p>I do not see how the electorate can win, regardless of the 
              outcome, if the two opposition stalwarts up the ante by leading a GRC 
              opposition team each.</p>
              <p>Should opposition parties aspiring to form the government 
              not take a longer-term view by preparing themselves better and not 
              squander precious credibility?</p>
              <p>Is it in Singapore's long-term interest if an opposition party wins a GRC in the upcoming GE?</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Chiam and Low should not stay put</h1>
              <p>MR ANG Kok Thiam ("Chiam, Low should stay put"; last Saturday) worries
               that Singapore would go down the drain if the opposition were to form 
              the next government. His fear is valid at this point in time.</p>
              <p>On a more likely scenario that the ruling party loses a 
              group representation constituency (GRC), Mr Ang fears that Singaporeans 
              will lose some key political appointment holders.</p>
              <p>One implication of Mr Ang's suggestion is that the People's 
              Action Party will always remain in power because of the GRC scheme. By 
              putting one or more heavyweight ministers in a GRC, voters are told that
               "good leaders" will be lost if they do not use their votes carefully.</p>
              <p>If this is true, it is sad for the opposition and Singapore 
              democracy. Are political leaders from the ruling party indispensable?</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam and Mr Low should not stay put. On the contrary, 
              they should strive to do better, for themselves as well as for 
              Singapore's political landscape. Even if they lose, we should salute 
              them for trying.</p>
              <p>The status quo will yield at best only two opposition 
              members in Parliament whose voices will continue to be drowned by the 
              overwhelming majority.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Don't equate interests of party with that of nation</h1>
              <p>Mr Ang Kok Thiam states his concern about opposition figures Chiam See
               Tong and Low Thia Khiang leaving their single-member constituencies 
              (SMCs) to contest in a group representation constituency ("Chiam, Low 
              should stay put"; April 2).</p>
              <p>He advocates Mr Chiam and Mr Low remain in their SMCs for 
              the long-term benefit of Singapore. By doing so, Singapore would retain 
              the alternative views of these two opposition leaders and at the same 
              time allow the People's Action Party (PAP) to continue with its 
              self-renewal process.</p>
              <p>However I respectfully disagree with Mr Ang's view.</p>
              <p>I believe the potential loss of two Cabinet ministers, 
              prospective key political appointment holders and the derailment of the 
              PAP's self-renewal process cannot be equated to being against 
              Singapore's long-term interest. We should not see the interest of a 
              political party to be the same as the interest of our country.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, if it is in the long-term interest of 
              Singapore to both allow the PAP its leadership renewal process and to 
              retain alternative views given by Mr Low and Mr Chiam, then perhaps 
              while Mr Chiam and Mr Low should stay put, PAP also should not contest 
              Potong Pasir and Hougang SMCs.</p>
              <p>This I believe, makes a mockery of Singapore's democratic 
              electoral system. Therefore, political parties should be free to contest
               wherever they choose to. Elections allow the people's will to be 
              expressed and the best party will naturally win the elections.</p>
