While the date is still a full five years away, the party realises that it is important to start early and build itself up in the constituency.<br><br>It is important that we get to know the constituents there and allow them to get to know the party. Tanjong Pagar GRC was uncontested in the last elections held in May this year.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in; padding-bottom: 10px; text-align: justify;"><br>A team of Democrats were on hand last Sunday at the ABC Market at Brickworks to do our walkabout led by new CEC member Mr Bryan Lim together with former candidates Dr James Gomez and Mr Mohd Isa.<br><br>There were several new members and volunteers as well. One of them was Mr Eugene Lim who said: “It was a refreshing experience. The response from public was very positive and encouraging. It's important to help spread the word and let the public know that SDP has not gone into hibernation after the GE.”<br><br>We met one Indian man who said that the PAP has failed to look after the needs of the poor, especially when some parts of the constituency are old and delapidated, housing elderly and low-income families.<br><br>He added that these families do not know how to seek help and that no one has taught them how to do it. The SDP's Community Services Subcommittee hopes to follow-up on this by organising training sessions to help poorer residents to approach the respect agencies and to articulate their concerns.<br><br>Another resident said that he has not seen the MP for the area, Dr Chia, and is happy to see SDP around.</p>

Danny, our Democracy Bear, joined us for the walkabout (see photos).<br><br>The weekend before, we were also at the Sembawang GRC continuing with our walkabouts there. This is all part of our ground campaign to get to know the people better and to listen to their concerns.<br><br>The next general elections may be years away but the party is not wasting any time by laying dormant in between the elections. We have been actively engaging constituents since the GE in May this year.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanjong Pagar GRC was not contest in the last elections and has remained so for a few decades.

              <p>The Singapore Democrats continued our groundwork at the Tanjong Pagar GRC, the second time in two weeks. Members were out chatting with residents on Sunday at the Tiong Bahru food centre and market. Danny, our Democracy Bear, joined us for the walkabout (see photos).<br><br>The weekend before, we were also at the Sembawang GRC continuing with our walkabouts there. This is all part of our ground campaign to get to know the people better and to listen to their concerns.<br><br>The next general elections may be years away but the party is not wasting any time by laying dormant in between the elections. We have been actively engaging constituents since the GE in May this year.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanjong Pagar GRC was not contest in the last elections and has remained so for a few decades.
