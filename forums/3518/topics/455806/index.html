The article has been reproduced here in full with permission from the authors.</em><br><br><strong>By Andrew Loh / Richard Wan</strong><br><br>On
               Monday morning at the High Court, a representative from the Law Society
               of Singapore attempted to have lawyer Mr M Ravi disallowed from 
              carrying out his legal duties in Court, Mr Ravi told <em>publichouse.sg </em>and TR Emeritus in an exclusive interview in the same afternoon.<br><br>Mr
               Ravi was acting on behalf of Mdm Vellama Marie Muthu in her case to 
              request the Court to declare that the Prime Minister does not have 
              unfettered discretion in deciding when to call by-elections.<br><br>Before
               the proceedings began in the morning, the representative from the Law 
              Society, Mr Wong Siew Hong, had approached both senior counsel Mr David 
              Chong, acting on behalf of the Attorney General, and Mr Ravi, outside 
              the Court room. Apparently, Mr Wong had a copy of a letter from Mr 
              Ravi’s psychiatrist, Dr Calvin Fones, which Dr Fones had earlier sent to
               the Law Society. The letter was shown to both Mr Chong and Mr Ravi.<br><br>In
               his letter, Dr Fones said: “I reviewed Mr Ravi on Saturday 14 May in my
               clinic following concerns expressed by his friends about his recent 
              moods and behaviours.”<br><br>Mr Ravi has confirmed that the date – 14 May – is wrongly stated by Dr Fones. It should be 14 July instead.<br><br>Indeed,
               Mr Ravi had gone to see Dr Fones because his law firm partner, Ms 
              Violet Netto, was concerned that Mr Ravi was feeling the pressure of the
               workload he was bearing. Ms Netto, according to Mr Ravi, had asked him 
              to see if he needed for Monday’s court hearing to be adjourned. If so, 
              he would require a doctor’s letter to give to the Court.<br><br>On 
              Saturday, Mr Ravi went to see Dr Fones who`gave him a letter, if he 
              needed to provide it to the Court. “I said I don’t need any letters for 
              adjournment and I am shocked that a letter was written,” Mr Ravi said. 
              Dr Fones also told Mr Ravi that he could go back to him if required and 
              provided Mr Ravi with the letter. Dr Fones basically said Mr Ravi is 
              under a lot of stress and that he may not be able to attend Court. In 
              effect, it was a medical certificate.<br><br>On Sunday, however, Mr Ravi
               was already feeling better and felt he could attend Court on Monday, 
              which he did. Dr Fones’ letter to the Law Society, however, said Mr Ravi
               “is having a manic relapse of his Bipolar Disorder” and added that Mr 
              Ravi “is currently unfit to practice law and his illness is likely to 
              affect his professional capacity.” Dr Fones' letter, noticeably, was 
              written in the present tense, although he had seen Mr Ravi two days 
              prior.<br><br>Dr Fones letter was dated 16 July 2012 which, 
              incidentally, was Monday, the day the hearing into the by-election case 
              took place.<br><br>According to Mr Ravi, Mr Chong seemed disinterested 
              in what Mr Wong had to say at first. Both parties then proceeded to 
              Court to submit their arguments on the case at hand, the PM’s 
              discretionary powers on by-elections.<br><br>Mr Ravi made his 
              submissions, followed by Mr Chong. However, before Mr Chong spoke on the
               by-election issue, he informed the Court that there were certain 
              matters to be addressed in Chambers before he proceeded.<br><br>Justice 
              Philip Pillai, the presiding judge, asked Mr Ravi if he had anything to 
              raise in Chambers. Mr Ravi said he had none. The judge then proceeded 
              with the hearing and Mr Chong went on with his submissions on the 
              by-election case.<br><br>After the proceedings had ended,  Mr Wong – the
               Law Society representative – asked to address the Court. Justice Pillai
               then called all parties into Chambers where Mr Wong argued why Mr Ravi 
              should not be allowed to continue with the case.<br><br>Justice Pillai, 
              who was reported to be upset with Mr Wong’s intrusion into the Court 
              room earlier, said that the behaviour of Mr Wong was “unprecedented” and
               admonished Mr Wong and the Law Society for it. He asked Mr Wong if Mr 
              Ravi currently had a valid practising certificate, to which Mr Wong 
              answered affirmatively. The judge said that was the only thing he was 
              interested in and said since Mr Ravi had a valid certificate, he was 
              free to act in Court.<br><br>“Justice Pillai made clear that the Law 
              Society had nothing in the day’s proceedings,” Mr Ravi told 
              publichouse.sg and TR Emeritus.<br><br>In the afternoon of the same day,
               an associate from Mr Ravi’s law firm was representing Mr Ravi in 
              another case in a separate Court involving another client. The Law 
              Society too tried to get that Court to halt proceedings on the same 
              grounds, that Mr Ravi was unfit to practise – even though Mr Ravi was 
              not in Court for that hearing. The judge dismissed the Law Society’s 
              arguments and allowed proceedings to continue.<br><br>According to the Legal Professions Act:<br><br>“25C.—(1)
               If the Attorney-General or the Council is satisfied that a solicitor’s 
              fitness to practise appears to have been impaired by reason of the 
              solicitor’s physical or mental condition, the Attorney-General or the 
              Council (as the case may be) may apply to a Judge by originating summons
               for`an order that the solicitor submit to a medical examination.”<br><br>No such summons had been filed by the Attorney General or the Law Society for Monday’s hearing.<br><br>It
               is however unclear if Dr Fones’ action of providing his diagnosis of Mr
               Ravi’s alleged medical condition to the Law Society is because Mr Ravi 
              had given his permission for the doctor to send his medical reports, 
              henceforth, to the Law Society, following an earlier case in 2008. In 
              August that year, Mr Ravi was ordered by District Judge Carol Ling to 
              submit himself to “psychiatric evaluation” at the Institute of Mental 
              Health, after the Attorney General had received the Court's approval to 
              compel Mr Ravi to do so.<br><br>When asked about this, Mr Ravi said 
              there were conditions on how the doctor could divulge information of his
               medical evaluation and to whom. The doctor could only do so after he 
              had examined him and after Mr Ravi had seen the report. Also, the report
               was to be made known only to his law firm partner, Ms Violet Netto, and
               Mr Ravi’s younger sister. Neither was informed of Dr Fones’ diagnosis 
              before the letter was sent to the Law Society on Monday.<br><br>Moreover,
               Mr Ravi said Dr Fones had seen him for only 10 minutes on Saturday, and
               thus questions if that is enough time for the doctor to assess him and 
              to say that he had had a "relapse."<br><br>Mr Ravi maintains that he is 
              well and that this was ev)dent in his behaviour in Court on Monday. He 
              says that the fact that Justice Pillai allowed him to continue with the 
              hearing and to make his submissions showed that there was nothing wrong 
              with him.<br><br>Also, he said, the Court room was packed in the gallery
               with members of the public who would have noticed if he had acted 
              unusually. He also questioned why, if he was having a relapse as Dr 
              Fones claimed, were his law firm and family not informed, and why only 
              the Law Society was informed about his alleged conditions.<br><br>Finally, Mr Ravi asked why Dr Fones had not prescribed him any medication, if his diagnosis was a serious one.<br><br>Mr
               Ravi said the Court and the Law Society had been fed “wrong 
              information”, referring to Dr Fones’ letter. He described what Dr Fones 
              had written as “ridiculous.”<br><br>“He did not examine me today,” Mr Ravi said on Monday.<br><br>He
               also referred to Dr Fones’ claim that Mr Ravi’s “friends” had expressed
               “concerns” about Mr Ravi’s behaviour. “I do not know which friends they
               are,” Mr Ravi said, “because I’ve asked Violet Netto, who is my 
              associate. If at all anyone should complain, it’s her. [But] she said 
              she had not spoken to anyone. So this is really out of line, to damage 
              my character and reputation.”<br><br>Mr Ravi admitted that he “is a 
              little stressed” but added that this was not unusual and that this was 
              understandably so as he has been involved in many cases” of late.<br><br>“To set the record straight, I am well,” he said. “The public saw my performance, the judge definitely was with me.”<br><br>Indeed,
               a member of the public seated at the public gallery – Mr Ng - felt that
               Mr Ravi had conducted himself professionally and had not noticed 
              anything wrong or unusual about the proceedings, he told publichouse.sg.<br><br>Mr
               Ravi has been involved in death penalty cases for 10 years and is 
              recognised as Singapore’s most eminent human rights lawyer. His most 
              prominent capital cases include those of Nigerian Amara Tochi and 
              Malaysian Yong Vui Kong, who currently sits on Singapore’s death row. A 
              week ago, he was invited by the United Nations rappoteurs on the death 
              penalty to a consultation in New York where Mr Ravi gave his views on 
              Singapore's use of the death penalty. The rappoteurs' reports will be 
              presented to the United Nations' General Assembly later this year.<br><br>On
               Tuesday, Mr Ravi goes back to Court for a pre-trial conference, to act 
              on behalf of Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam. Mr Jeyaretnam is seeking an 
              injunction from the Court to stop the Singapore Government from 
              providing loans to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of the 
              IMF’s plan for the Eurozone. Mr Jeyaretnam is arguing that the Singapore
               Government was in breach of the Constitution by not first having sought
               the approval of the elected president and Parliament.<br><br>As for Monday’s case into the PM’s discretionary powers in calling by-elections, Justice Pillai has reserved judgement.<br><br>“I love Singapore, I love my people,” Mr Ravi said. “That’s the reason why I am here despite all odds.”</p>
