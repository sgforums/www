              do better in the constituency."</span></span></em><br> <br> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bAW-i05ry3Q/TZ8NJtqBQ0I/AAAAAAAAAU0/h4wH_9pWj_M/s1600/Wong+Kan+Seng+on..+%2528highlight%2529.JPG"><img id="vBCodeIMG" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-bAW-i05ry3Q/TZ8NJtqBQ0I/AAAAAAAAAU0/h4wH_9pWj_M/s400/Wong+Kan+Seng+on..+%2528highlight%2529.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br> <br> So as DPM Wong has spoken, just as the PAP seeks to lead the way 
              forward, it too needs the 'opposition' as a form of quality assurance- 
              to give it better perspectives and the endorsement of the populace. If 
              the interest of Singaporeans is really paramount, then the PAP should 
              stop fixing the opposition but work together to democratically elect the
               new cabinet in parliament. <br> <br> I believe that in the most modern democracies to come to come, many will
               be coalition governments, as such, Cabinet Ministers may come from 
              differing parties or even amongst independents. What matters most is 
              that the independent vote of each MP in the best interest of their 
              constituents towards the appointment of fellow MPs as Cabinet Ministers 
              is done transparently to his own constituents. The sum total of all MP 
              votes is what determines whom the new cabinet Ministers should be.<br> <br> Of course political parties might fight it out as to whom should 
              populate the new cabinet, however, each party would be very mindful of 
              the limits of basic moral decency so as not to damage the moral 
              authority upon which they have been granted to govern- the very essence 
              of what yields them the public endorsement at every subsequent election.
               This is what politics ought to be about in the first place: the 
              principles of moral human leadership by example. <br> <br> People have to be focused upon the need for clean and efficient 
              political leadership. To procure anything less is a slant to one's own 
              dignity and the betrayal of one's society.<br> <br> ~ <strong>"The King will reply, 'I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one  of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.'"</strong>-- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25:40&amp;version=NIV">Matthew 25:40</a> (NIV)<br> <br> Rgds<br> B.C.<br> <br> End-notes/ References:<br> -  <strong>'Separation of powers'</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers">wiki</a>]: <em>"The
