              <p>
              </p><p>I have a team of ministers under me.</p>
              <p>Not all of them are new, some I inherit from the previous leader.</p>
              <p>The previous leader is still in my team as an advisor.</p>
              <p>How ridiculous this is, how can I function with him hanging </p>
              <p>around waiting to fault me if I make a mistake.</p>
              <p>To me I can't wait to boot him out of this team. My dream.</p>
              <p>However, in politics its complicated so I have to live with it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To be frank with you,  I prefer a fresh new team of ministers.</p>
              <p>These fresh virgin ministers would not have any bond with </p>
              <p>previous master so I can be their first real virgin master.</p>
              <p>Why? Let me tell you why. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am trying very hard to put together this hybrid team of young and old</p>
              <p>ministers to work together as a team. The problem is the older</p>
              <p>ministers are still very much attached to their previous master.</p>
              <p>To me, I am just their half master. Outwardly they show their respect</p>
              <p>and say nice things to inflate me but actualy they can't wait to tarnish me</p>
              <p>through and through.</p>
              <p>How do I know?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thinking of it just make me boil !!!</p>
              <p>Look eversince I took over as their leader, countless things has happened</p>
              <p>that make me look like an idiot. You know how it feels to be a leader of a team</p>
              <p>that make mistakes one after another, some are deliberate judging from the groundswell</p>
              <p>of unhappiness among locals. I have been thinking of giving them the boot</p>
              <p>but they make smart move, I can't fault them for bringing lots of money into the kitty can I?</p>
              <p>Bloodly hell, at my expense and the peoples' expense. No wonder I am getting unpopular</p>
              <p>by the minute.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tried to be nice, they want pay rise by the millions I went along with it thinking maybe this</p>
              <p>would make them worker harder and respect me even more.</p>
              <p>You know deep down inside, the guilt of paying myself this insane salary makes me sick.</p>
              <p>I wasn't brought up this way. Look my dad and mum were very prudent with money.</p>
              <p>That's why I decided to freeze mine for the next 5 years.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In introspect, I should have stopped them, but its too late. Now it seem I am the master mind.</p>
              <p> How can I be so stupid I should have seem through their plot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know I have been thinking of how to get rid of these clowns so that I can function </p>
              <p>more effectively as a leader. It would look good for me as well as my father.</p>
              <p>These guys don't even have an iota of respect for my old man trying ways to implicate him as well.</p>
              <p>I can't just fire them, I must have good reasons.</p>
              <p>You know these guys are damm smart when it comes to politicking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was hoping mummie could give me a helping hand, some sort of intuition, an idea or 2. </p>
              <p>I don't know why but lately the word ELECTION ELECTION have been popping out in my mind.</p>
              <p>Maybe its election fever but I am already used to that. Can't be. Can't be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Wait a second, election is a time when people gets to vote for their MPs and MP ministers.</p>
              <p>Its either you get voted in or you get booted out. That's it. Booted oh.. sorry I meant voted out</p>
              <p>by the people. It would look good on me if these clowns get voted out by the people.</p>
              <p>I don't have to dirty my hands. Great!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok. lets see. If I increase a few seats, reduce some sizes and do abit of adjustment</p>
              <p>here and there, throw in some smoke for the clowns that should work out pretty well.</p>
              <p>But how can I guarantee it. That previous master must go I can't endure it anymore..arrgghhh</p>
              <p>SIR.. SIR...  are you talking to yourself? are you alright?? </p>
              <p>YES YES.... I am ok... just bare with me... I am in the middle of a major breakthrough in my career</p>
              <p>so please bare with me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now.. where am I.. oh. yes that previous monster... how to get rid of this bug... ya</p>
              <p>a weak link... I must find a weak link someone the voters dislike and is also annoying.</p>
              <p>But where to find? It must be strictly confidential and private... nobody should know... TOP secret X-Files.</p>
              <p>hmm.. I think I know who this private person can be. Just nice .. my personal assistant.. have to rope him in...</p>
              <p>But his wife is not that type... hmmm... some acting lessons on short notice.. a few candid pictures</p>
              <p>ready to leak.. when time is right. That should worked out nice... genuis...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about those politicking clowns??? </p>
              <p>Judging from the feedback I get from my network, they are very unpopular with the voters right now....</p>
              <p>me included thanks to the bloody clowns... I guess they stand a fifty-fifty chance of being voted..</p>
              <p>local voters... arrrggh... when are they going to read between the lines.. </p>
              <p>I must sent some clear signal to the voters and opposition parties not too directly but easy to discern. </p>
              <p>This calls for some delicate works... got to sound out those opposition parties privately...</p>
              <p>ask them to standby some heavy weighs candidates as well to ensure those clowns don't stand a chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come to think it, its better to work with those opposition parties then these politicking clowns.</p>
              <p>At least I get better respect from the opposition and they have no problems with salary. clear my name</p>
              <p>and conscience once and for all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finally the clear signal for the voters... this is a tough one...  </p>
              <p>Got it... I am going to annouce in the press and through the media ...</p>
              <p>NO BY-ELECTION... must repeat a few times for voters to get the hint...</p>
              <p>Then bring it up again just before voting ... dammm it.. i forgot the cooling off period ... damm dammm damm</p>
              <p>never mind.. just bring it up during rally, inform the press to repeat it.</p>
              <p>Repeat this a few more times.. and the voters should get it.</p>
              <p>Hope the voters are not that daft this time.</p>
              <p>Got to sealed up those back doors real tight so those politicking clowns have not choice but to quit. </p>
              <p> </p>
