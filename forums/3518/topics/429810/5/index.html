              <p>Chaim made a mistake by putting his wife there... He should have put a younger guy like Jimmy Lee or Wilfred Leung and pull back Sin Kek Tong into his GRC bid... Cos those 2 can still speak well, his wife is rather useless and she don't even know how to talk... Like this how to ask questions in Parliament? If she takes the NCMP post also a waste of time...</p>
              <p>Another thing is, he shouldn't have made it so well known that he is leaving PP way before nomination day... Like this, that Sitoh guy wouldn't be encourage to stay back and go to a GRC instead and there who be a new young bird and not an old hand... See over at Hougang, it was a guessing game all along and LTK only made it known he is leaving on nomination day... Like this, the PAP put a new bird there...</p>

              There is no legal ground for a by-election as in the case of PP now. So, no matter how many names are in the petition, this will not lead to a by-election.
              
              Lina Chiam has messed up the election in PP and lost PP to PAP.
              
              In the next election, there will be no more PP as PP will be absorbed into a GRC.
              
              So, there will not be a re-match or a chance to win back PP in the next election.

              <p>Terrible news of the day... Lina Chiam is accepting the NCMP post.</p>
              <p>My goodness... She should just forget it lah... Seriously, what can she do in Parliament? Ask stupid questions? If anything, she will only bring the SPP brand even lower if it's not low enough yet...</p>
              <p>The SPP just gone down lower in my opinion...</p>
              <p>What a waste of time...</p>

              <p>SPP has lost their only bastion...potong pasir...</p>
              <p>but the offer comes well if she can make the best use of it to give her the exposure she so needed...while concurrrently and urgently, SPP needs to rebuild quickly the core fundamentals of their mission towards the next election </p>

              <p>I am not saying they shouldn't take the NCMP post but going to a better and more useful person would be better utilize I feel.</p>
              <p>Seriously, if I am being honest, I don't think many of us were impressed with Lina Chiam. So what can she do in Parliament? She can't speak, she can't connect with people, and she is 62 currently and will be 67 when the next one comes along...</p>
              <p>She can't even read a prepared speech properly during the party political broadcast... What more do you need to say? I guess she will just sit down and take the salary and do nothing much kind...</p>
              <p>If this is the kind of opposition to get into parliament, I think TPL isn't that bad all of a sudden... I rather have TPL than Lina Chiam.</p>

              <p>I feel the same way. Lina Chiam will not be helpful as WP or Nicole. But the most retarded idiot, if she has empathy for us, is better than the smartest brain working for the other side. Lina cannot offer good debate, but TPL will offer no debate at all. Lina's mind is weak, TPL has no mind of her own.</p>
