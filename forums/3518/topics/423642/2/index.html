              <p>EVERYTHING you have wanted to know about the coming elections - from 
              running as a candidate, the dos and don'ts on form filling to where you 
              can address supporters on Nomination Day - is now available in a 
              handbook published by the Elections Department of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The 60-page guide to help aspiring candidates on their road towards 
              Polling Day on May 7, is on sale at $7 each at the ELD premises on 
              Prinsep Link.</p>
              <p>The book, developed with the help of the Attorney-General's Chambers,
               has 10 sections, including information on how to fill up nomination 
              forms, prohibited activities on "cooling-off' day and what happens 
              post-election, like the destruction of ballots.</p>
              <p>It also details when rival candidates for the same constituency can 
              raise objections on Nomination Day, and other requirements like 
              submitting a declaration of the election advertising platforms the 
              candidates intend to make use of during the nine-day campaigning period.</p>

              <p>However, party political broadcasts are allowed.</p>

              <p>I haved this feeling that cooling off day is working to a huge advantage for pap.</p>
              <p>Why I say this? Well, cooling day is meant for the pple to think and reflect who is the best candidates to take the votes.</p>
              <p>And as you see the above para, party political broadcasts are allowed. Meaning tv and radios will be honking all the summaries of the pap and opposition.</p>
              <p>You tell me, which party will get the most broadcasts?</p>
              <p>Now, you get what I mean?</p>
