              </div>
              <p>The <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=national+solidarity+party&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">National Solidarity Party (NSP)</a> on Thursday unveiled seven new candidates who will be contesting in the Tampines <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=group+representation+constituency&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">group representation constituency (GRC)</a> and the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=single+member+constituency&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">single member constituencies (SMCs)</a> of Whampoa and Pioneer for the upcoming general election.</p>
              <p>The new candidates were introduced at a press conference held at the party's headquarters in 
              Jalan Besar.</p>
              <p>Five of those candidates will be contesting in Tampines GRC
               with the party's secretary-general <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=goh+meng+seng&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Goh Meng Seng</a> leading the charge.</p>
              <p>The other four members are company director and NSP's assistant 
              secretary-general Fong Chin Leong, 42; regional project manager Syafarin
               Sarif, 35; career counsellor Gilbert Goh, 49; and the party's youngest 
              candidate and former Young PAP member Raymond Lim Peng Ann, 27.</p>
              <p>Apart from Goh Meng Seng and Fong Chin Leong, the other three candidates will be contesting in their first election.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, Ken Sun, 64 - one of the party's founders - will contest in the single-seat ward of Whampoa.</p>
              <p>Mr Sun has contested in the area back in 1988 when it was an SMC. 
              After the 1988 polls, the area was merged to form part of the Jalan 
              Besar GRC but has now reverted back to a single-seat ward for the 
              upcoming election.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, party treasurer <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=steve+chia+singapore&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Steve Chia</a>, 40, will stand in Pioneer SMC. The former <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=non+constituency+members+of+parliament&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP)</a> has been contesting in every election since 1997.</p>
              <p>The area could potentially see a three-corner fight as Reform Party's (RP) chief <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=kenneth+jeyaretnam&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Kenneth Jeyaretnam</a> had also expressed his intention to contest there. The third candidate will be from the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=people%27s+action+party&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">People's Action Party (PAP)</a>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Commenting on the party’s slate of candidates, Mr Goh said, “All these
              people have been activists in one aspect or another. We do not have generals,
              we do not have high-level civil servants. But I believe we have the passion in
              all different aspect.”</p>
              <p>For the party’s youngest candidate Raymond Lim, age is just a number and
              said that one needs to also have the “political acumen” and “look at the needs
              of the residents”. This is despite the fact that he could also be seen as
              politically immature or inexperienced.</p>
              <p>This comes after PAP candidate, <span>Tin Pei Ling</span> also 27-years-old was heavily scrutinized
              by the public for what was seen as a candidate who is inexperienced to serve
              the needs of the residents due to her young age.</p>
              <p>Apart from the “conflict in ideology” as the main reason for his departure
              from the Young PAP where he was a member for seven years, Lim said that it was “tougher”
              to create a change from within the party which prompted to him to switch
              alliance to NSP.</p>
              <p>At the press conference, the candidates’ also highlighted some issues that
              will be addressed in its yet-to-be-released manifesto which include immigration
              policy, housing prices, rising cost of living and underemployment among younger
              and educated workforce.</p>
              <p>While the party is not against foreign workers, Mr Goh said that “there must
              be a certain control of how foreign talents have been introduced into the
              system”. He added that the foreign worker levy does not act as a control
              mechanism but rather a revenue mechanism.</p>
              <p>“If you are talking about control mechanism, the country in perspective must
              prove that it has tried its best to employ the local (workers) before it is
              allowed to employ foreigners,” said Mr Goh.</p>
              <p>This introduction brings the <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/nsp-unveils-six-candidates-ge-20110404-235706-231.html">party's candidates to eighteen</a> in the upcoming general election. It has introduced candidates who will
               be standing in the single-seats of Radin Mas and Mountbatten as well as
               Moulmein-Kallang and Jurong GRCs.</p>
              <p>While NSP has previously said that it would field at least 20 
              candidates for the next polls, it looks likely to exceed that number.</p>
              <p>The party has been eyeing two more constituencies, Chua Chu Kang and 
              Marine Parade GRCs. Just last Sunday, NSP members were seen doing a 
              walkabout at a food market in Marine Parade.</p>
              <p>When asked to confirm whether it will be fielding candidates to stand
               in the five-member Marine Parade GRC, Goh Meng Seng refused to reveal 
              the party's intentions but said that it is "seriously looking into it".</p>
              <p>However, he declined that the party will be sending a "suicide squad" to test the ground which is helmed by Senior Minister <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=goh+chok+tong&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=moz2-ytff-tyc">Goh Chok Tong</a>.</p>
