              <p class="header">MM Lee defends PAP's record on helping S'poreans cope with cost of living<br>GE: <span class="update">By Imelda Saad | </span><span class="update">Posted: 30 April 2011 2049 hrs </span></p>
              <p class="header"><span class="update"><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has come out strongly to defend his party's record on helping Singaporeans cope with the cost of living.<br><br>Meeting the media after a visit to Radin Mas on Saturday, he said it is because of a capable government that the benefits of growth can be shared with citizens.<br><br>Turning to the election battle, he told reporters "it's not the end of the world if the PAP loses a GRC".<br><br>The cost of living is an issue for all Singaporeans, and Mr Lee said the government has introduced a slew of measures to help citizens.<br><br>These include the Grow and Share Bonus, Workfare and utilities rebates.<br><br>But he stressed this was possible only because Singapore had good growth last year.<br><br>He said opposition's economic proposals may be detrimental to Singapore in the long run.<br><br>Mr Lee commented on a plan by Singapore Democratic Party's (SDP) candidate Tan Jee Say to move Singapore's economy away from manufacturing and focus on mainly services.<br><br>Mr Lee said: "He has no qualifications to say that and it's wrong. If you don't have manufacturing, you're going to have trouble with jobs. An economy that just depends on services is volatile and you always have high unemployment when services go down. Manufacturing is more steady."<br><br>When asked about the battle for Aljunied GRC, Mr Lee questioned the Workers' Party's real intentions.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="header"><span class="update"><span><span>"It's not just to win one GRC. Let's have no hypocrisy about this, every political party sets out to win and win a majority and they are setting out from a single constituency to a GRC and then expand to more GRCs and then take over. It's up to you to decide whether they are capable of running Singapore," said Mr Lee.<br><br>"The only hot seat is Aljunied and if Aljunied decides to go that way then Aljunied has five years to live and repent," he said.<br><br>"Losing one GRC does not mean the end of the world and we will try to regain it after five years, but they would have made an inroad into a GRC and they would try to make more inroads." <br><br>Amid criticisms that the GRC system allows untested candidates to ride on the coat-tails of Ministers, Mr Lee said the primary role of GRCs is to ensure minority representation.<br><br>He said that Mr Michael Palmer, the first PAP minority candidate to stand in a single-member constituency, is a "trial run" for the party.<br><br>He wants to see if Mr Palmer can carry the ground after serving residents for five years. <br><br>As for Dr Chia Shi Lu, who became an instant MP after the walkover in Tanjong Pagar GRC on Nomination Day, Mr Lee said the party didn't just pull someone like a rabbit out of a hat. <br><br>"He's not an untested person, we have interviewed him, we have gone through, he's a President's scholar, he scored straight A's. We had him on the top of our reserve list. Because he lacked people-to-people experience, so immediately (after Nomination Day) he went around shaking hands to get that experience, he knows his shortcomings, he's not a fool," said Mr Lee. <br><br>When asked about whether his recent remarks on the integration of Malays in Singapore will cost the PAP votes, Mr Lee said he meant no harm; he simply wants Malays to totally integrate.<br><br>He added that just like other communities, Malay Muslims in Singapore should support the PAP if they want a good government. <br><br>"You want a government that's incompetent, incapable, that can talk a lot but cannot produce, cannot bring results? We have never discriminated against the Malays. In fact we have many affirmative actions for the Malays," said Mr Lee.<br><br>He added that the Malay vote would be "sufficiently substantial" to carry the PAP through because it "makes no sense for the Malays to go and vote for an opposition that cannot form the government and cannot look after you". <br><br>Minister Mentor Lee described the younger generation of voters as a footloose generation that simply wants to try their luck. <br><br>He said as Minister Mentor, his role is to weigh in, provide the benefit of experience and speak about the consequences should citizens vote against a good team.<br><br><br>- CNA/ir <br></span></span></span>

              <p>I can tell the old man straight in the face that we have regretted for the last five years although we did not vote for u.</p>
              <p>All the measures came suddenly within two weeks after nomination day to take care of the people.</p>
              <p>So, what are the millionsters are doing for the last 5 years ?</p>
              <p>Why is it they dismissed feedback against them as gossip when they mentioned they listened to the people ?</p>
              <p>Or they just listen to all the good things ? boot licking stuff ?</p>
              <p>Strange enough, what they mentioned on their rally speech on taking care of the people, listening to the people are stuff they are paid to do but never ever done.</p>
              <p>So, do we still believe them any more ?</p>
              <p>One thing is for sure.</p>
              <p>They will forget what they said for the past two weeks and start to increase all costs to achieve their GDP and KPI.</p>
