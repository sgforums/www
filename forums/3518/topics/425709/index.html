              <p><strong>GE: PAP team for Tampines GRC not confirmed yet<br></strong> <span class="update">By Dylan Loh/Liang Kaixin | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 20 March 2011 1641 hrs <br></span><br><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : National
               Development Minister Mah Bow Tan on Sunday said the People's Action 
              Party's line-up of candidates for Tampines Group Representation 
              Constituency (GRC) in the coming General Election is not confirmed yet.<br><br>Mr Mah was speaking at the sidelines of a Tampines Sports Carnival and the launch of tamper-proof labels for bicycles.<br><br>Tampines,
               Singapore's first cycling town, is also the first constituency to 
              launch high security labels for bicycles as part of efforts to become a 
              model cycling town.<br><br>Under this initiative, residents who own 
              bicycles can be provided with tamper-proof labels which contain security
               features that offer cyclists a unique identifier for their bicycles.<br><br>Owners
               are encouraged to register their bicycle security labels in the online 
              Bicycle Identification System (BIDS) administered by Tampines Town 
              Council. <br><br>Introducing the system is part of ongoing efforts to improve the cycling environment in Tampines estate.<br><br>The
               initiative to introduce high security labels arose out of discussions 
              between the Tampines Cycling Town Committee, the police and Tampines 
              Town Council.<br><br>Meanwhile, Mr Mah also said that for the party's 
              candidates, what is important are integrity, commitment and a passion to
               serve. And his team is actively using new media tools like Facebook to 
              engage residents.<br><br>Mr Mah, who is also MP for Tampines GRC, said: 
              "Over the last 20-over years...in fact every block we have been to, 
              every house we have knocked on, sometimes they are in, sometimes they 
              are not in. But through Facebook, I hope we will be able to plug the 
              gaps."<br><br>- CNA/ms<br><br>Source:<a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1117700/1/.html"><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1117700/1/.html</a><br></span></span></p>

              quietly moved to increase the selected president’s salary to $4,267,500,
               a hefty 20.8% quantum jump of $890,700. That’s double the percentage

              Council of Presidential Advisers and a butler manager to meet increased 
              demand for butler services, and the high variable payments on account of
               a strong economic growth”. We know from Tom Plate’s account that Lee 
              Kuan Yew has two staff just to provide hot towels for his aching bones, 
              but are there so many butlers there in the Istana that they need a 
              “butler manager” to supervise the servants? It’s bad enough to read of 
              “higher variable payments”, Tharman also uses the term ‘”ad hoc

               the revised 2010 figure of $11,605,000. What he did not say to the
