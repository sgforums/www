              dialogue held at the Quality Hotel in Balestier. -- ST PHOTO: DESMOND 
              WEE</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SIX opposition leaders came together for a dialogue last night, giving
               an early glimpse of where their parties stood on key national issues.</p>
              <p>Topics like housing and the role of the media got an airing,
               alongside a wide range of other matters from the Internal Security Act 
              (ISA) to national service.</p>
              <p>And while the political parties differed slightly on some 
              issues, there was clear consensus on their rallying cry: Get more 
              opposition voices into Parliament.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 21/2-hour session at the Quality Hotel in 
              Balestier, the different opposition leaders took turns calling for 
              change and taking jibes at the People's Action Party (PAP). Often, these
               calls were met with cheers or applause from the largely partisan crowd 
              of 350 that showed up.</p>
              <p>Socialist Front secretary-general Chia Ti Lik, for instance,
               called for the PAP to be given a 'black eye'. Answering a question 
              about HDB prices, he said: 'The changes have to be made and the changes 
              can only be made if we give the PAP a black eye at the next general 
              election.'</p>
              <p>The forum, titled Face To Face, was organised by 
              socio-political website The Online Citizen (TOC) to mark its fourth 
              anniversary.</p>

              <h2>Ruling PAP a no-show at major political forum</h2>
              <p>By Faris – December 17th, 2010</p>
              <p><img src="http://yfittopostblogsg.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/600yahoo_panel.jpg?w=600" alt="" width="600" height="378"></p>
              <p><em>One chair (far right) is left empty as the six-member guest 
              panellists take their seats. (Yahoo!)</em></p>
              <p>The ruling <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=people+action+party&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">People’s
               Action Party (PAP)</a> skipped a major political forum on Thursday 
              evening which was attended by the leaders of Singapore’s political 
              parties.</p>
              <p>Organised by socio-political website, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=the+online+citizen&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">The
               Online Citizen</a>, the event which was held in a packed ballroom at 
              the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=quality+hotel+singapore&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Quality
               Hotel</a> in Balestier was attended by over 350 people, made up mostly 
              of the public, party activists  and the media.</p>
              <p>Leaders of the various political parties including <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=kenneth+jeyaretnam&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Kenneth
               Jeyaretnam</a> of the Reform Party (RP), <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=chia+ti+lik&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Chia
               Ti Lik</a> of the Socialist Front and Secretary-General of the National
               Solidarity Party, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=goh+meng+seng&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Goh Meng
               Seng</a> (NSP), were guest panellists.</p>
              <p><a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=chee+soon+juan&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Chee
               Soon Juan</a> of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=chiam+see+tong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Chiam See
               Tong</a> of Singapore People’s Party (SPP) and <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=gerald+giam&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Gerald
               Giam</a> representing The Workers’ Party (WP) were also present during 
              the 2-and-a-half-hour dialogue.</p>
              <p>However, as the political leaders took their seats, a chair was 
              conspicuously empty — the PAP was the only political party who chose 
              not to send a representative.</p>
              <p>Before the forum began, moderator  Mr Choo Zheng Xi, 25, addressed 
              the “elephant in the room” and said, “We did actually invite the PAP. We
               sent an email to the Secretary-general of the PAP, Mr <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=lee+hsien+loong&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Lee
               Hsien Loong</a>, and reached out to an MP who said was keen to come. He
               asked for clearance but did not get it.”</p>
              <p><em>Yahoo! SEA</em> understands the MP in question was Mr <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=zaqy+mohamad&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Zaqy Mohamad</a>,
               who is Vice-Chairman of the young PAP and head of the party’s media 
              subcommittee and new media engagement.</p>
              <p>In an email reply to<em> Yahoo! SEA</em>, the MP for <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=hong+kah+grc&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Hong
               Kah GRC</a> declined comment and suggested we contact PAP HQ for an 
              official comment.</p>
              <p>When asked about the PAP’s absence, Reform Party chief Mr Jeyaretnam 
              said “it was a definitely a huge loss for PAP itself. It was an 
              opportunity to engage those in the forum just like the debates held in 
              the US or the UK.”</p>
              <p>Forum moderator, Mr Choo, a 25-year-old law graduate added, “It was 
              not just plain debate, it was a debate of substantive quality. Real, 
              significant issues were profoundly discussed tonight and the PAP missed 
              out on it.”</p>
              <p>A member of the public who called himself Chetan said the PAP missed a
               chance to connect to their constituents  ahead of the next General 
              Election.</p>
              <p>“They missed an important process of dialogue with other political 
              figures. Perhaps they are still suspicious of the new media, ” said the 
              30-year-old engineer.</p>
              <p>However, a blogger who was present, Donaldson Tan, said that although
               their absence was disappointing, the party actually did not have much 
              to lose.</p>
              <p>“It’s not much of a loss for the party. The PAP conducts its own 
              forums and meetings with its activists to gain feedback from the ground.
               But their absence did mean that there was no robust debate between the 
              ruling party and the opposition,” said the editor of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=new+asia+republic&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">New
               Asia Republic</a>.</p>
              <p>Among the broad range of issues covered during the forum conducted in
               an open QnA style were housing, income inequality, the role of the 
              media and civil liberties such as freedom of assembly and the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=internal+security+act&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Internal
               Security Act (ISA)</a>.</p>
              <p>During the session, the audience was allowed to pose questions 
              specifically to a political party or general questions which all 
              speakers on the panel could answer.</p>
              <p>Housing proved to be the hottest issue of the night with Mr Chee of 
              the SDP calling on the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=housing+board+development&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz">Housing
               Board Development (HDB)</a> to be more transparent and reveal the true 
              costs of building flats in order to solve the issue of high housing 
              prices.</p>
              <p>But all came to an agreement that public housing should be made 
              accessible for the bottom 30 per cent of the population.</p>
              <p>On the role of the media, Socialist Front’s Mr Chia said, “We can use
               the internet to force the mainstream media to be more objective. Media 
              in other countries is supposed to be the watchdog and that is the role 
              that the media has to rise up to.”</p>
              <p>On the issue of the controversial ISA law, which allows people to be 
              detained without trial, Mr Chiam said, “It is arbitrary. Very dangerous.
               There is no emergency now unlike the 1940s” before calling for 
              compensation for those who have been unfairly detained.</p>
              <p>An audience member also raised the question on whether the ruling 
              party, PAP, was “divorced from reality” and creating policies which are 
              not in tune with its citizens.</p>
              <p>62-year-old retiree, Mr Bentley Tan told <em>Yahoo! SEA</em>, “I have
               grown up with PAP and they have done well in the initial years but now 
              they are not listening to the ground.”</p>
              <p>“The old guard is passionate, sincere and dedicated in serving the 
              people, but now public service is more of a career,” he added.</p>
              <p>WP”s Mr Giam addressed the issue during the forum and said, “The PAP 
              has a extensive network of grassroots who provide feeback. But worse 
              than being out of touch is to ignore that feedback. It is time to get 
              the opposition more representation in parliament.”</p>
              <p>On what voters can expect in the next GE, due to be held by Feb 2012,
               Reform Party’s Mr Jeyaretnam said, ”Don’t keep grumbling and then 
              on polling day, you vote for the incumbent, and then go on grumbling for
               the next four years. Do something about it.”</p>
              <p>Summing up the event, Andrew Loh, 44, and co-founder of organiser 
              TOC, said the forum was organised to allow the public to “see political 
              parties talking about real issues which have affected Singaporeans since
               the last general election in 2006″.</p>
              <p>Human rights activist, Ms<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=braema+mathi&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> Braema Mathi</a>, added, “I can sense a maturing in way public approach
               opposition and their response. (The opposition parties) seem to have 
              greater clarity on the approaches they want to take.”</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>SIX opposition leaders came together for a dialogue last night,
              giving an early glimpse of where their parties stood on key
              national issues.</p>
              <p>Topics like housing and the role of the media got an airing,
              alongside a wide range of other matters from the Internal Security
              Act (ISA) to national service.</p>
              <p>And while the political parties differed slightly on some
              issues, there was clear consensus on their rallying cry: Get more
              opposition voices into Parliament.</p>
              <p>Throughout the 21/2-hour session at the Quality Hotel in
              Balestier, the different opposition leaders took turns calling for
              change and taking jibes at the People's Action Party (PAP). Often,
              these calls were met with cheers or applause from the largely
              partisan crowd of 350 that showed up.</p>
              <p>Socialist Front secretary-general Chia Ti Lik, for instance,
              called for the PAP to be given a 'black eye'. Answering a question
              about HDB prices, he said: 'The changes have to be made and the
              changes can only be made if we give the PAP a black eye at the next
              general election.'</p>
              <p>The forum, titled Face To Face, was organised by socio-political
              website The Online Citizen (TOC) to mark its fourth
              anniversary.</p>
