              <p>A <span id="lw_1305608166_3" class="yshortcuts">police report</span> has been filed against <span id="lw_1305608166_6" class="yshortcuts">Marine Parade</span> MP-elect <a href="http://sg.news.yahoo.com/blogs/singaporescene/buzz-over-tin-pei-ling-video-081238560.html"><span style="color: #005790;">Tin Pei Ling</span></a> for posting a comment on her Facebook page on <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Cooling+off+day&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Cooling-off Day</span></a>.</p>
              <p>According to election regulations, candidates are not supposed to campaign during that period.</p>
              <p>But a police spokesman confirmed on Monday night that a report has been made and they will be investigating.  Details of the report or the person were not revealed but it's believed the report was filed by a member of the public.</p>
              <p>This incident in question is not new. A similar complaint was issued by the National Solidarity Party (NSP)'s <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Nicole+Seah&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Nicole Seah</span></a> to the <span id="lw_1305608166_9" class="yshortcuts">Elections Department</span> on May 6th --  designated to be Cooling-off Day -- regarding a comment posted Ms Tin's Facebook page at 1:33pm.</p>
              <p>The comment read, "OooOoooOooh! so that's what REALLY happened? Wow. I think tears in Parliament is worse than ANYTHING ELSE!"</p>
              <p>The comment was in reference to an incident involving Nicole Seah, who was part of the NSP team contesting Marine Parade GRC. A day earlier, it was reported she had cried upon listening to a story about how a resident in MacPherson could not afford tuition fees for her young son.</p>
              <p>The comment was removed 20 minutes after it was posted.</p>
              <p>Tin, who was part of SM <span id="lw_1305608166_8" class="yshortcuts">Goh Chok Tong</span>'s Marine Parade <span id="lw_1305608166_1" class="yshortcuts">PAP</span> team that beat the challenge by the NSP, had earlier explained that the comment was posted by one of her Facebook administrators, Ms Denise He.</p>
              <p>When contacted by <em><span id="lw_1305608166_2" class="yshortcuts">The New Paper</span></em>, Ms He clarified that she had mixed up her Facebook accounts and had mistakenly uploaded the post. Tin said the post was removed after she notified He.</p>
              <p>According to local socio-political blog <em><span id="lw_1305608166_5" class="yshortcuts">Temasek</span> Review</em>, the NSP now also intends to follow up on its initial complaint.</p>
              <p>NSP chief Goh Meng Seng said, "Now that someone has filed a <span id="lw_1305608166_4" class="yshortcuts">police report</span>, we can pursue it once we have the police statement … This is good for Singapore too. Cooling-off Day is a new rule and we don't know how the authorities will react to the filing of reports. This will set a precedent for future elections."</p>
              <p>The news has also created a buzz on micro-blogging platform Twitter.</p>

              <p>She is an adult and most importantly a MP , amazing she is contemplating to shirk her responsibility of her action.   Whether it is her own or her administrator's posting on FB on Cooling Off Day she has to be accountable for it.   Shirking responsibility is demonstrating ill example to the people</p>
              <p>What is she good at, really?     Stomp her feet and said she did not know what to say?  Flaunting her Kate Spade carrier?     Acting a "bimbo"?   </p>

              <p>i'm not being biased here.. but seems like whenever the MIW people make mistakes, they say "it's an honest mistake, let's move on"</p>
              <p>whenever the other people make mistakes, "we take a serious view about these offences, a deterrent sentence is requested so that this does not happen again"</p>

              <p>While it may be true that her administrative staff screwed up, she could have said something like '<em>My administrative staff made a mistake, but I take responsibility for the actions of my subordinates. I pledge full cooperation with the relevant authorities with regards to this matter and will accept any consequences that result from the investigation.'</em></p>
              <p>At least that sounds a whole lot better than just trying to pin the blame on her staff. Also, even if it was really an honest mistake, the fact is that she still has to take responsibility for that mistake and face the consequences.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, we'll just have everyone breaking the rules in the next election run-up and having all of them just brush it off as 'an honest mistake'.</p>
