              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Five of 
              Singapore's main political parties have taken part in a pre-election 
              television forum, organised by Channel NewsAsia, in the run up to the 
              General Election due by February 2012.<br><br>The hour long programme, in English, which will be broadcast unedited, is entitled "A political forum on Singapore's future".<br><br>It
               brought together representatives from the People's Action Party, the 
              Singapore People's Party, the Workers' Party, the Singapore Democratic 
              Alliance and the Singapore Democratic Party.<br><br>The programme 
              participants were Finance Minister and PAP Treasurer, Tharman 
              Shanmugaratnam and MP for Bishan-Toa Payoh Josephine Teo.<br><br>The 
              Singapore People's Party was represented by its Second Vice-Chairperson,
               Lina Chiam. The Workers' Party sent Gerald Giam, an Assistant webmaster
               and an executive council member.<br><br>The Singapore Democratic 
              Alliance had Mohd Nazem Suki, who is the Assistant Secretary-General of 
              the SDA and also PKMS Secretary-General. While the Singapore Democratic 
              Party was represented by its Assistant Treasurer, Dr Vincent 
              Wijeysingha.<br><br>It is the first such programme to be recorded since 
              1988 and Mr Tharman said that it was a good opportunity for people to 
              get to know the different parties.<br><br>He said: "I think one good 
              thing about it was that there is a deep concern about wanting to have a 
              sense of fairness in our society. Everyone shares that. That's foremost 
              on our minds in the PAP. And I think the electorate will be able to 
              judge on whether we're delivering.<br><br>"[The forum] went very well. 
              It's a good idea to have this exchange well before the elections so that
               people get to know what the different parties represent and whether 
              they've got real policies or rhetoric."<br><br>The programme adopted a 
              structured format with allotted times for representatives to present 
              their party's position and perspectives. Opposition members were given 
              half the air time during the structured segments, and the ruling PAP 
              given the other half of the time.<br><br>There were also discussion 
              segments, where participants freely argued and articulated their views 
              to give voters an insight into their thinking.  <br><br>Mr Giam said that he was looking forward to more similar forums in future.<br><br>"I
               would definitely want to see more of this because it gives people an 
              opportunity to understand us better and to be able to see whether or not
               what we say, is really what we'd be able to implement later on."<br><br>Dr
               Vijeysingha said: "It represents to some extent a sense of unease on 
              the part of the governing party. It shows itself now to be a party that 
              has found it important to engage with other parties precisely because 
              the other parties are now showing themselves to be so credible.<br><br>"[The
               forum] is important because it gives you snippets of what you can 
              expect. It's also important because you're then able to engage with the 
              politicians themselves and to watch the free for all debate between the 
              opposition parties and the PAP."<br><br>For Mrs Chiam, the forum was an opportunity to present herself to Singaporeans.<br><br>She
               said: "I think the forum is very interesting. It gives me a platform to
               view myself to the residents, to the people of Singapore. Because a lot
               of people have been saying that they know Mr Chiam but they don't know 
              who is Lina Chiam. And I hope that with this forum, on camera, I hope 
              they will know more about me, my views, our party stand.<br><br>"45 
              minutes, spread out among the six of us, I think it's a bit too thin. I 
              think we can just manage to say whatever we want to say and hopefully, 
              the people who are watching are not just looking at the face but 
              understand what we're talking. But having said that, I think in the end,
               we need to go to the ground, to talk to the people, to shake hands and 
              to explain our policies."<br><br>Meanwhile, Mrs Teo thought the forum was a chance to engage a wide spectrum of Singaporeans.<br><br>"I
               thought that it was an interesting opportunity for the political 
              parties to come together to have a verbal sparring of the ideas that we 
              have for Singapore.<br><br>"On the plus side, I think it gives us an 
              opportunity to engage a wide spectrum of Singaporeans for them to hear 
              what we have to offer. On the not-so-plus side, I think because of the 
              nature of a forum on television, usually it's going to be the sound 
              bites that come across more strongly.<br><br>"What I think Singaporeans 
              need to pay attention to closely is that behind the words that were 
              spoken, there's a lot of thought that needs to go into the thinking of 
              how to bring Singapore forward."<br><br>The forum's executive producer, 
              Lee Siew Hoon, said: "We have decided on this hybrid approach of a 
              structured deliberation and discussion which we think works better for 
              our viewers, and they will find it easier to understand the respective 
              party's position on how they see Singapore's future.<br><br>"This 
              ultimately is a platform to allow voters to hear views of the respective
               parties and an opportunity to hear from some candidates standing in the
               coming GE who want to represent them in parliament."<br><br>The programme was recorded at MediaCorp's Andrew Road studios and will be broadcast on Channel NewsAsia on Saturday at 10pm.<br><br>Encore
               telecasts are scheduled for Sunday at 6pm and Monday at 1pm and 6pm. 
              Channel 5 will also air the programme on Monday at 10pm.<br><br>A mandarin programme will also be recorded and is currently scheduled for broadcast on Channel 8 on Sunday at 9pm.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>
