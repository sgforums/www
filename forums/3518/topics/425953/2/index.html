              <p>by Cassandra Chew</p>
              <p>DEPUTY Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng fired a salvo at opposition
              parties on Wednesday.</p>
              <p>He accused them of wanting to capture a group representation
              constituency (GRC) for the wrong reasons.</p>
              <p>'Some say they are doing it for party renewal, some want to be
              the first ones to do so, but what is the election about? Is it
              about the ambitions of a political party or individuals to make
              history?' said Mr Wong, who is also Coordinating Minister for
              National Security, and an MP in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC.</p>
              <p>He was referring to comments made by opposition leaders Low Thia
              Khiang of the Workers' Party and Chiam See Tong of the Singapore
              People's Party in recent weeks on their plans to possibly contest
              in a GRC.</p>
              <p>He urged voters to back the stronger team that can serve them
              better, and not simply for the sake of having more opposition,
              especially at a time of global uncertainty when Singapore must keep
              pace or risk being left behind.</p>
              <p>He noted that Parliament will have at least nine opposition MPs
              after the next election under the Non-Constituency MP scheme even
              if they are not elected.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong was speaking at a media conference held on Wednesday to
              introduce three new candidates for the People's Action Party at the
              party's headquarters in Bedok.</p>
              <p>They are Ms Foo Mee Har, 45, Standard Chartered's global head of
              premium banking, Mr Steve Tan Peng Hoe, 38, executive secretary of
              Young NTUC, and Mr Desmond Lee Ti-Seng, 35, associate director in
              the legal and regulations department of Temasek Holdings, the
              government's investment arm.</p>

              <p>if opposition parties r wanting to capture the GRC for all the wrong reasons, can it not b questioned then, if the ruling party r bent on control over GRC for all the wrong reasons too? pot calling kettle black. typical politicians. </p>
              <p>to top it off how credible r his words after the mas selamat saga? almost wish i hadn't seen the episode in parliamentary debate when apologies were made, stares were thrown n no questions answered. it's laughable. the question was not over y it happened in the 1st place for bad things do happen, rather how it was handled after it happened. when will leaders learn that disproofing the integrity n credibility of their competitors does not make them look any better nxt to them anyway? if only to govern a country is as easy as showbusiness. </p>
              <p>when will leaders stop hacking old schemes n irrelevant policies that stopped working more than a decade ago? how do we stay relevant? </p>
              <p>when will it stop being all abt the alien things like the MPs, the Constituencies, the System, the Walkabouts, the Candidates, the Fingers pointing, the libel Suit Filing, the ungainly Protesting, unjustified Jailing and the contested Districts? when will they realise that these categories, objects n classification did not, will not gain them public favor nor inspire confidence in the next generation, much less majority of us singaporeans?</p>
              <p>weren't we warned of appearances?</p>
              <p>so what if ministers r well rewarded n incorruptibl? so what if candidates have world class education, r backed by years of experience, so what if any darned party consists of a multiplicity of races to engender the engineered multiplicity of colors? what exactly does issuing another generic statement on global uncertainty got to do with the people? r we wrong to demand Virtue in those who govern our blood n tears? </p>
              <p> might as well make them crawlers on national tv. make us a chronic repetition of the same threat made in 2001, 2006 n the years have gone on. </p>
              <p>come to think of it, when was the last time the world outside of sg had been certain n predictable anyways?</p>
              <p>when will this finally be abt the people n their welfare? when will this be abt improving the quality of life for the aged and alive? better still, when will this stop being all abt which party gets to grace the front pages on ST?</p>
              <p>this country is a joke. y on earth wld we care abt the general elections? </p>
              <p>voters r uninterested because we r regurgitating frm the surfeit of mess ruling n opposition parties alike have made for themselves for the past 20 years. </p>
              <p>darn circus clowns. </p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Opposition responds to DPM's 'short-change' accusation</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Jeremy Au Yong  &amp; Kor Kian Beng</p>
              <p>A WAR of words erupted yesterday between the People's Action Party 
              (PAP) and the opposition over who was 'short-changing' the voters.</p>
              <p>While unveiling the PAP's second group of new faces 
              yesterday, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng challenged opposition 
              parties to follow the party's lead and unveil their candidates too.</p>
              <p>He said late announcements would 'short-change' voters as 
              they might not have enough time to scrutinise the new faces, the way 
              they get to do with the PAP's newcomers.</p>
              <p>DPM Wong's call prompted Workers' Party chief Low Thia 
              Khiang to make similar accusations against the PAP, especially on the 
              electoral boundaries report released on Feb 24.</p>
              <p>He felt the changes in the electoral boundaries leave 
              Singaporeans unsure about who their MP is, until close to the general 
              election.</p>
              <p>Mr Low said: 'The PAP has been swopping candidates all over 
              the place, Singaporeans do not even know if their MP will remain 
              there... PAP has short-changed Singaporeans in that way, in a big way.'</p>

              <h3>Mar 24, 2011 - Straits Times<br></h3>
              <h1>Opposition responds to DPM's 'short-change'
              accusation</h1>
              <p>By Jeremy Au Yong &amp; Kor Kian Beng</p>
              <p>A WAR of words erupted yesterday between the People's Action
              Party (PAP) and the opposition over who was 'short-changing' the
              voters.</p>
              <p>While unveiling the PAP's second group of new faces yesterday,
              Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng challenged opposition parties
              to follow the party's lead and unveil their candidates too.</p>
              <p>He said late announcements would 'short-change' voters as they
              might not have enough time to scrutinise the new faces, the way
              they get to do with the PAP's newcomers.</p>
              <p>DPM Wong's call prompted Workers' Party chief Low Thia Khiang to
              make similar accusations against the PAP, especially on the
              electoral boundaries report released on Feb 24.</p>
              <p>He felt the changes in the electoral boundaries leave
              Singaporeans unsure about who their MP is, until close to the
              general election.</p>
              <p>Mr Low said: 'The PAP has been swopping candidates all over the
              place, Singaporeans do not even know if their MP will remain
              there... PAP has short-changed Singaporeans in that way, in a big
              way.'</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Applause for Low Thia Khiang for calling out the truth!</p>
              <p>Wong Kan Seng thinks we are 5 years old.</p>
