              <li class="news_byline"> By <span class="stories-byline-link"> Valerie Koh, TODAY</span> </li>

              </ul>
              <p>SINGAPORE: After the watershed 2011 General Election, the 
              possibility of a two-party political system in Singapore started being 
              bandied about. But four years on, the picture emerging from the ground 
              has been very different, with new entrants contributing to a more 
              fragmented Opposition scene.</p>
              <p>The submission of papers 
              last Friday by Opposition veteran Goh Meng Seng to register a new 
              political party comes after the formation of at least one new political 
              party since the last polls. The Democratic Progressive Party has also 
              sprung into action again, after being dormant for years.</p>
              <p>In
               the same period, the dominant Opposition party, The Workers’ Party 
              (WP), faced off with the National Environment Agency over the cleaning 
              of hawker centres. And more recently, it has been in the hot seat over <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mnd-details-exchange-it/1842454.html">major lapses</a> the Auditor-General found in its running of the Aljunied-Hougang-Punggol East Town Council (AHPETC).</p>
              <p>The
               various episodes the WP has been embroiled in could have played a part 
              in developments within the Opposition camp, political analysts say.</p>
              <p>Dr
               Gillian Koh, a senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy 
              Studies at the National University of Singapore, said the blueprint on 
              town council management released by the Singapore Democratic Party last 
              Saturday indicates the eagerness to capitalise on issues that have come 
              under the public spotlight.</p>
              <p>“Clearly, the Singapore 
              Democratic Party (SDP) has noticed, and put out a paper on how they 
              would run a town council, essentially promoting the idea of local 
              democracy,” she said.</p>
              <p>However, Dr Koh added that the 
              emergence of new political parties in the lead-up to the next polls, 
              which must be called by January 2017, is not surprising, given that past
               elections have always had a “smattering” of different parties.</p>
              <p>Founding
               Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s death could also have been an impetus for
               aspirants, political analysts say, because of the perception that the 
              ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) would become less “hegemonic”.</p>
              <p>The
               number of Opposition parties, however, should not be the be-all and 
              end-all in assessing the health of democratic space, said former 
              Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) and Singapore Management University
               law don, Associate Professor Eugene Tan. “We need to look at the 
              quality and contribution of these parties too.”</p>
              <p>He 
              remains in the camp that believes Singapore is on the cusp of a 
              two-party system, citing the 2013 Punggol East by-election, where two 
              candidates in a four-cornered fight lost their election deposits because
               they had garnered too few votes. That episode suggests there is a “real
               possibility” that many Opposition parties would be rendered 
              “politically irrelevant” due to the fragmented scene, he added.</p>
              <p>“As
               long as the WP contests (a seat), we’re very unlikely to see a second 
              Opposition party going in, because the voters who do not want to vote 
              for the PAP have shown that they’re discerning enough not to split the 
              vote significantly,” said Assoc Prof Tan, adding that there would be 
              little impact on the PAP.</p>
              <p>“Voters who wanted an 
              Opposition MP decided to pool their ballots for the Opposition candidate
               they assessed to be the best or had the best chance of winning,” Assoc 
              Prof Tan said.</p>
              <p><strong>UNITY ACROSS THE RANKS?</strong></p>
              <p>With
               the multiplication of Opposition voices, can the myriad parties forge 
              unity, or even a coalition, as most recently championed by Singaporeans 
              First Party (SFP) chief Tan Jee Say?</p>
              <p>The signs are not 
              pretty. Former NMP Zulkifli Baharudin said the Opposition remains 
              divided over “whether one party can represent all those who cannot agree
               with the PAP”.</p>
              <p>Assoc Prof Tan added: “When it comes to 
              the crunch, whether they can avoid a three-cornered fight, Opposition 
              parties show that unity is more apparent than real.”</p>
              <p>The 
              departures of several known faces from the Opposition since GE 2011 and 
              the number of those who have switched allegiances or founded their own 
              parties also suggest Opposition unity could be elusive.</p>
              <p>For
               example, Dr Vincent Wijeysingha has left the SDP, and the National 
              Solidarity Party (NSP) lost its former chief Goh Meng Seng and Ms Nicole
               Seah.</p>
              <p>The NSP was also hit with other high-profile 
              exits. Two months ago, its former secretary-general Jeannette 
              Chong-Aruldoss moved to the Singapore People’s Party (SPP), together 
              with three ex-council members.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, former SPP 
              member Benjamin Pwee joined the DPP in 2013 while former civil servant 
              Tan Jee Say opted out of the SDP to contest in the presidential 
              elections, before setting up the SFP last year.</p>
              <p><strong>MANY PARTIES, NO DISTINCTION </strong></p>
              <p>Despite the game of musical chairs, observers say the Opposition parties are still barely distinguishable in terms of ideology.</p>
              <p>“They think of modifying (current policies) a little,” said Opposition watcher Wong Wee Nam. “That’s not an ideology.”</p>
              <p>Dr
               Koh thinks otherwise. “Even with the formation of the new parties, you 
              don’t see a build-up where everyone moves into one stream. There’s quite
               a lot of diversity,” she said.</p>
              <p>But Associate Professor 
              Alan Chong of the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies said: 
              “Most are clones of the PAP, with some slight differences in terms of 
              being more pro-welfare, pro-liberal or pro-Singaporean.”</p>
              <p>The leaders of the new parties contend that they have something to bring to the table.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Goh, who recently applied to found the People’s Power Party, is pushing
               for a four-pillar governance system — social, cultural, political and 
              economic.</p>
              <p>The SFP positions itself as a party for the middle-class, with a locals-first mentality.</p>
              <p>Waving
               aside concerns of a further splitting of the Opposition votes, the 
              party chiefs maintained they will try to avoid three-cornered fights.</p>
              <p>They were also firm in their belief in a multi-party system, stressing that having two parties in power would be “unstable”.</p>
              <p>“You
               will end up with a constant bickering between the two parties, and it’s
               very disruptive. A lot of attention is on municipal issues,” said Mr 
              Goh, citing the AHPETC court dispute.</p>
              <p>Agreeing, Singapore
               Democratic Alliance’s chief Desmond Lim said: “Parliament should have 
              multiple parties to check on each other, and be involved in 
              policymaking.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lim, whose poor showing in the Punggol 
              East by-election cost him a hefty election deposit of S$14,500, added 
              that he intends to contest in the upcoming election.</p>
              <p>“Just
               because you failed once, it doesn’t mean you won’t do better next time.
               People should have an open heart and mind, and see what the party can 
              offer in the coming election,” he added.</p>
