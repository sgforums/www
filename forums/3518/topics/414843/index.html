              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Senior 
              Minister of State for National Development and Education Grace Fu said 
              she was "more than happy" to stand for election in a single ward should 
              her party require her to. <br><br>She added she had been studying and 
              learning from more experienced party members in preparation for the 
              upcoming General Election.<br><br>Ms Fu, who's in the Jurong GRC, was 
              asked about the speculation that she would be contesting in a single 
              member constituency (SMC).<br><br>The PAP team in Jurong GRC was 
              uncontested in the 2006 General Election.<br><br>Ms Fu said: "We are 
              told to expect the unexpected. So we can be fielded, we may not be 
              fielded. <br><br>"We may be fielded in an SMC, we may be fielded in a 
              GRC. Whether we are fielded in an SMC or we're fielded in a GRC, we have
               to expect the instruction from the party".<br><br>Ms Fu, who spoke to 
              reporters on the sidelines of a community event on Sunday morning,  
              joined grassroots leaders and residents in an annual cleanup of Yuhua 
              estate.<br><br>She also planted a tree to celebrate Clean and Green 
              Singapore.<br><br>At the event, Ms Fu also announced that four blocks in
               the estate would be getting lift upgrading. <br><br>They are blocks 
              209, 210, 211 and 214 Jurong East Street 21.<br><br>Ms Fu said the Yuhua
               estate was relatively old, having been built in 1982. She added that 
              there were many elderly residents in the area.<br><br>As such, the lift 
              upgrading programme would be beneficial to the elderly who are less 
              mobile.<br><br>-CNA/wk</span></span></p>

              <p>Well take a look in this way, Grace is a minister. So, you cant have a cry-baby politican (Read: Politican, not minister). Just like you dont want a cry baby / this cannot do and that will die one as the leader in your camp / NS / project team etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, you cannot expect like "Mr / Ms XXX: I would never want to contest in SMC" (And the reason is because ...... [Insert your reasoning apart of the fear on losing the election])</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you say like that, you are going to boot out from the party, because</p>
              <p>1) You do not want an SMC, you abandon SMC voters</p>
              <p>2) Even if in charge of a GRC like Sembawang, Jurong or even Marine Parade, if tio contest, then the poll result will swing towards opposition because most people wont trust this politican right? If it is a walkover like Tanjong Pagar, then interestingly, that people will still talk bad things behind. Again, what if a long traditional walkover GRC tio contest?</p>
