              cronies stopped from hiking a free ride on the backs of GLCs and
              other Stats boards.<br> <br> In fact, LKY have to be brought for trial for crimes against
              humanities at an UN tribunal for arresting barisan sosialis members
              and other crimes. PAPist will have to be outlawed and all PAPist
              ministers have to be investigated for any misuse of power during
              office.<br> <br> We must at the crucial moment deliver the knockout punch straight
              to the old man LKY's balls, to make him remember that this country
              does not belong to him but belongs to our grandfathers,
              grandmothers, our mothers and fathers who shed blood sweat and
              tears to build this land from ground up.</p>
