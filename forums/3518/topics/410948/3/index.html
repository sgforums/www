              <p>look at THE CONGRESS AS IT IS TODAY. look at italy before mussolini with their PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION.look at the Weimar republic, WHY DID HITLER RISE TO POWER? WHY? Look at MALAYSIA AS IT IS TODAY. Look at FRANCE as it is today.</p>
              <p>I TELL U SOMETHING, all these failed because of the simple fact: there will never be unanimous agreement in the parliament. just look at the congress, look at why hitler rose to power. WHY? because of the existence of so many parties in the parliament, and well, it brought 'freedom' of speech and what else? indecisiveness and rampnat disaggreements. no proper governing since never once can a REAL policy be passed. frequent infighting, nothing done.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SO much talking with so much expression of different views and what? arguments, fights, but NO agreement on anything. why do u think malaysia cant get politicaly stable? because the parties CANT AGREE.</p>
              <p>why did hitler rise? because of what the retarded opposition claims to be good: proportional representation. no proper governing and just arguments, dragging germany straight into the Depression of 1929</p>
              <p>its in human nature. please for heaven's sake, think. even in australia, they also rule by one super majority ruling party and some other small opposition, so how different exactly r they from us? hmm?</p>
              <p>face it. proportional representation was a failure. stop trying to drag it back. the only thing good is the so-called 'freedom' of speech, but what else?</p>
              <p>look at all the success stories. Japan? also one-party system, since the democrats practically OWN the parliament, and look, within a space of decades, rose to rival USA. USA? declining now, terrible healthcare, lousy economy , all because the republicans block the democrats, the democrats block the proposals of the republicans. FACE IT. all the successful nations, one way or another all declare they have opposition parties, but how big? if u look closely like japan or germany(powerhouse of europe for decades), its the same story. theres one HUGE party controlling the parliament. the small opposition is there for the sake of it.</p>

              <p>look at all the success stories. Japan? also one-party system,
              since the democrats practically OWN the parliament, and look,
              within a space of decades, rose to rival USA. USA? declining now,
              terrible healthcare, lousy economy , all because the republicans
              block the democrats, the democrats block the proposals of the
              republicans. FACE IT. all the successful nations, one way or
              another all declare they have opposition parties, but how big? if u
              look closely like japan or germany(powerhouse of europe for
              decades), its the same story. theres one HUGE party controlling the
              parliament. the small opposition is there for the sake of it.</p>
