              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Opposition MP Low Thia Khiang has welcomed comments by Finance Minister 
              Tharman Shanmugaratnam that a strong opposition is good for the People's
               Action Party (PAP) and Singapore.<br><br>He also noted another positive sign - the coverage of opposition parties by the Singapore media.<br><br>For
               the breakfast crowd at the market and food centres, it is obvious their
               ward is likely to be contested in the General Election when they see 
              the opposition parties in the neighbourhood.<br><br>On Sunday, the Workers' Party team was at Chong Pang Market, which is part of the new Nee Soon GRC.<br><br>Two new faces were spotted - Yee Jenn Jong, a 46-year-old entrepreneur; and Angela Oon, a 32-year-old researcher.<br><br>However,
               there was no sign of the party's potential star candidate, Chen Show 
              Mao, who has degrees from Oxford, Harvard and Stanford universities.<br><br>Party
               Secretary-General Low Thia Khiang noted that there has been increased 
              coverage of the opposition so far, compared with elections in the past.<br><br>He said this is the right approach and hopes it will stay this way throughout the General Election.<br><br>But Mr Low stressed that the final assessment can only be made when the polls are over.<br><br>Mr
               Low, who is MP for Hougang, said: "We have made good progress in terms 
              of the behaviour of the media. In terms of media reporting, we have 
              better coverage...and I would expect we should be able to get across the
               message more effectively this time through the help of the media."<br><br>Mr
               Low also noted Mr Tharman's comments in a Channel NewsAsia forum for 
              political parties on Saturday night - the first televised debate in two 
              decades on hot button issues such as the cost of living and influx of 
              foreign workers.<br><br>Mr Tharman had said: "I think a strong opposition is good for the PAP, and for Singapore as well...."<br><br>Mr
               Low said this is a good sign for Singapore. He said: "Someone like the 
              Minister for Finance in the PAP has realised that a strong opposition is
               good for Singapore. I think that shows quite a shift in the PAP's 
              mindset, that they now see that a strong opposition is positive and good
               for the future of Singapore. I welcome that."<br><br>Mr Low said his party is working to strengthen its leadership core to give Singaporeans a strong opposition.<br><br>He
               said: "We want to deepen the leadership role and the leadership core so
               that Singaporeans will have more confidence in the Workers' Party as a 
              party. The Workers' Party is not just a one-man party, neither is it Low
               Thia Khiang's and Sylvia Lim's party. The Workers' Party is a party 
              with a certain leadership depth which can offer to safeguard the future 
              of Singapore."<br><br>Opposition parties are ramping up their outreach efforts across the island in the run-up to the election. <br><br>The
               National Solidarity Party made its rounds in the newly-carved 
              Mountbatten SMC, while Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong and his wife Lina 
              led the Singapore People's Party in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC, which the 
              opposition has never contested in. <br><br>The Reform Party continued to
               work the ground in the western part of the island, covering the markets
               and food centres in Chua Chu Kang and Hong Kah. Party leader Kenneth 
              Jeyaretnam said his team was out in force and that the party has gained 
              more members from its latest recruitment drive.<br><br>- CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              <div class="story_headline"><br></div>
              <div class="story_headline">A SECOND minister has welcomed a better slate of candidates presented by the opposition so far.
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo, speaking to reporters on Monday at a 
              Madrasah event in Aljunied, said: 'This will give Singaporean voters a 
              better choice.</p>
              <p>'It is important to have a credible opposition so that should the PAP
               turn corrupt or become flaccid or subjective, there's an alternative 
              that Singaporeans can go for.'</p>
              <p>Asked if the People's Action Party would change its strategy, given a
               better crop of opposition candidates, Mr Yeo said he could not speak 
              for the PAP as a whole, but for the Aljunied GRC, where he is the team 
              leader, 'it means that we will have to work even harder.'</p>
              <p>'It means that we can't take any voter for granted, whether it's a 
              senior citizen, a first-time voter, a brilliant scholar or an odd job 
              labourer,' he added.</p>
              <p>But in the end, it's for the voters to decide whoever standing in his
               constituency is able to convince them that he can represent them better
               and help improve lives, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Yeo is the second minister to state that a strong opposition is 
              good for PAP. Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said this at a 
              televised forum on Saturday night.</p>

              <p>i agree with Mr Low of WP that this election indeed there is shift towards more political freedom. we should give ourselves, political blogger a pat on our back as those lashes we dish out towards the ruling party has some effect on their future policy.</p>
              <p>but whether this freedom or extensive media coverage is prolong or shortlive is yet to be seen.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, i applaud PAP for it , for this past 1mth of media freedom.</p>
