              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong said when elected, the People's Action Party 
              (PAP) will have enough talent to form the nucleus of next generation 
              leaders.<br><br>At the party's conference on Sunday, six young party 
              members took to the stage to speak on what they wanted for their 
              country.<br><br>Party members have been told that they will have to work
               harder ahead of the next General Election (GE) as more seats are likely
               to be contested.<br><br>It's the clearest indication yet that the party
               has found itself a good slate of potential candidates. <br><br>As PM 
              Lee puts it, it is critical not just for the party but also for 
              Singapore. That's because the country's next prime minister and a core 
              team of leaders should be people in their 30s and 40s. <br><br>Speakers 
              approached by Channel NewsAsia were however coy about being flagged as 
              potential candidates.<br><br>"It is a serious commitment and everyone of
               us who's serious about contributing to the society must consider 
              carefully. But right now, I'm working in a constituency. I'm extremely 
              excited going about my branch work, and this is what I joined the party 
              for," said PAP member Desmond Choo.<br><br>The 32-year-old deputy 
              director from the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) has been active 
              in grassroots since 2005, but joined the party only in January this 
              year.<br><br>He has been helping Tampines residents alongside National 
              Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.<br><br>Mr Choo said: "It is about 
              getting as close to the ground as you can get… If there are problems on 
              the ground, you see it. If there are policies that don't work, you see 
              it, and you give that immediate response. <br><br>"And for me it's an 
              opportunity to put what I believe in into action. I believe in helping 
              the people, that youths should go beyond just words, to go down to the 
              ground and do it."<br><br>Younger party members said they found their 
              calling in the service of the community.<br><br>32-year-old lawyer 
              Vikram Nair, who's been helping Law Minister K Shanmugam at the Chong 
              Pang ward in Sembawang, is one. <br><br>"In many ways I've enjoyed 
              Singapore at its best - good education, good job. But what I realised is
               that there are a lot of other people who are struggling to get by day 
              to day. And at the MPS (Meet-the-People Sessions), you meet some of the 
              poorest people in Singapore and those who have the most difficulties, 
              and you realise you can help them. I think it's quite important that 
              just because you are doing well, you can't let others fall behind," said
               Vikram Nair, PAP member. <br><br>For some, it was the belief in core 
              fundamental values that hold Singapore together.<br><br>40-year-old 
              cardiologist Dr Abdul Razakjr spoke of how his father rose from a humble
               background, and that success in Singapore is not about "fate", 
              "birthrights" or "privileges".<br><br>He said: "From him, I learnt (a 
              lot). He made the best of what he had and he did not wallow in 
              self-pity. Fundamental values remain unchanged, we need a meritocratic 
              society where real opportunities to excel exists, regardless of race, 
              language and religion."<br><br>Dr Abdul Razakjr has been active at the 
              PAP's Jurong Central branch division.<br><br>When asked about their 
              reactions to the ruling party's preparations, the opposition parties 
              said they are also recruiting.<br><br>Secretary-General of the National 
              Solidarity Party, Goh Meng Seng told Channel NewsAsia that recruitment 
              has been steady. He added the party is in a good position to contest 7 
              Group Representation Constituencies (GRC).<br><br>Mr Goh added younger 
              members in their 20s and 30s have also stepped up to the plate and some 
              will be fielded at the next GE.<br><br>"We're now at the final stretch, 
              which is fixing the teams according to the boundaries. Our position all 
              along is to field as many candidates as possible. Singaporeans deserve a
               chance to vote but there are uncertainties because the boundaries are 
              not out," he said. <br><br>Secretary-General of the Reform Party Kenneth
               Jeyaretnam said his party is prepared for elections.<br><br>"We are 
              proud of the small number of candidates that we do have. They are all 
              devoted to the struggle for democracy - a democracy aspiring to 
              security, happiness and prosperity for all Singaporeans. We still need 
              more candidates, time to prepare the candidates currently waiting in the
               wings, and funds for the campaign," he told Channel NewsAsia. <br><br>Observers
               said the ground may be sweet on the back of good economic growth.<br><br>But
               that may also pose a challenge to the PAP.<br><br>"I think when the 
              economy is doing well, Singaporeans may be more willing to give the 
              other parties an opportunity to see how they perform in Parliament. 
              There is also that greater desire for a variety of voices in 
              Parliament," said Eugene Tan, Assistant Professor, School of Law, 
              Singapore Management University (SMU). <br><br>The parties are now 
              waiting for the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee to release its 
              report, which will outline the number of GRCs, single-member 
              constituencies (SMCs) and their boundaries based on voter numbers.  <br><br>The
               committee was convened in October. <br><br>- CNA /ls</span></span></p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline2">PAP committee chaired by PM 
                  has interviewed more than 40 hopefuls</h1>
              <p>By 
                  																				Li Xueying, Political Correspondent</p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party is confident of presenting 'a first-class 
                  slate of candidates' at the next general election, which is due by 
                  February 2012.</p>
              <p>More than 240 potential election candidates have been 
                  invited for 'tea', and more than 40 have been interviewed by a committee
                   chaired by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
              <p>Disclosing the figures during the PAP's biennial party 
                  conference yesterday, Mr Lee, who is also PAP secretary-general, said 
                  the party 'will have enough talent to form the nucleus of the next 
                  generation of leaders' when the new candidates are elected.</p>
              <p>He did not say how many of those interviewed would be 
                  fielded, adding that he would continue looking for more.</p>
              <p>The party has traditionally replaced about a quarter of its 
                  MPs at each election, numbering between 20 and 25.</p>
              <p>The PAP has put in 'enormous effort' in hunting for 
                  promising candidates, not only in Singapore but also among those 
                  overseas, he said.</p>
