              <p>I guess what the dragon said about being the people servant is false.</p>
              <p>The tone of the rest of his croonies does not sound like a servant when words like "warn", "challenge" are used.</p>
              <p>All the voters should ask their individual MPs why they should vote for him or her.</p>
              <p>Show the people what they have performed for the past few years and not all RC and grassroot leaders have done for the people.</p>
              <p>You are a MP cos you are there to serve the people and not because you become a MIWs.</p>
              <p>If you are unable to prove your worth, then it is time to vote for the others.</p>
              <p>We have too many walkover MPs who have take things for granted.</p>

              <p>the warning is a usual persuasion tactic, which may be valid depending on the types and quality of oppositions....</p>
              <p>we should also be highly critical of the true intentions and commitment of the oppositions towards what is badly needed for singapore future political landscape....</p>
              <p>we should also then ask ourselves whether we are ready to make an intelligent and wise vote for the future...</p>
              <p>for me, i have made mine in the notion to mete out a little "punishment" </p>

              <p>There are too many critical questions on spending and honest mistakes unanswered.</p>
              <p>To expect the opposition to form a government for one election is impossible.</p>
              <p>But, they should be given a chance to prove their worth and to question the policies.</p>
              <p>Before the MIWs start attacking the opponents, they should do some self-examination of the "honest" mistakes that they have commited and the task and promise that they failed to deliver.</p>
              <p>We the true blood singaporean have given them enough time and opportunity to do their work.</p>
              <p>But, they have failed badly even in basic task of taking care of the people in their town.</p>
              <p>Being a MP is not just showing your face on family events and no where to be found when the people need your help.</p>

              <p>I agreed with FrogLeg that the old man will come up at certain time of the rally to instil "You will be finished if you dun vote for us" threat.</p>
              <p>That is what he is still around for this time as the present team are basically a bunch of clueless and blind croonies who are riding on past credits.</p>
              <p>What they have not done for the past few years are the reasons why we are suffering from drop in standard of living and salary.</p>
              <p>I dun think they know what the problems that they have caused as they are not close to the ground and they are too arrogant to see that they are the cause of the problem.</p>
              <p>That is why the people are always being blamed for complacent and fussy when things happen.</p>
              <p>If that is going to be the case for the next 4 years, I will agreed that it is time for a cheaper, better and faster team to take over.</p>
              <p>The old team is too damn expensive, too damn arrogant and too damn slow.</p>
              <p>They only wake up once to be your MP every 4 years when there is election.</p>
