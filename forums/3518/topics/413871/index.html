              <p>Nah, I'd rather go through the 2 years full, can learn a lot more things that you can't learn in uni (the leadership and survival skills part, not the take weapon 'bang bang', chiong sua part), and still be able to apply to society.</p>
              <p>For point 1 that you've mentioned, there are a lot of males who still get well-paying jobs despite the 2-year delay; It's all about your ability (and of course, the availability of the job lah, but you'll still be fighting for it with many other hopefuls that aren't your age, so it doesn't really make a difference if NS duration was reduced).</p>
              <p>Besides, we still get paid during NS. Some may see it as a form of 'financial assistance' from the government, for them to earn sufficient allowance for further studies and whatnot (not to mention the $3000 bonus after we ORD)</p>
              <p>AND, imagine what the 'lao jiaos' who had 'suffered' throughout NS would say if we had a reduction in NS duration; they would also have to right to say that "it's not fair".</p>
              <p>However, politics are ever-changing, so I don't know what will be happening in the future. For all you know, some people in the government may concur with what you've suggested and actually modified NS ._.</p>

              <p>If the above proposals are ever accepted, then below are some of the proposals that should go with it:</p>
              <p>1) Abolish annual IPPT</p>
              <p>2) Cut reservist to 5 years from 10, and make them all high key, and increase the number of days they can call you up a year from 40 to 60 days, and make all ICTs high key, meaning they should last in excess of 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>3) For active NSmen, they should be entitled to $12000 in annual income tax relief to the end of their cycle, up from $3000, on the basis they have done their ICT for that financial year, otherwise the $1500 still applies.</p>
              <p>There, I am satisfied now.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
