              <p>Minister for Information, Communications and the Arts (Mica), Mr Lui Tuck Yew, 49, has said that he and his team had alerted the Police over a confrontation they had with a member of the public while on their campaign trail.</p>
              <p>Writing on his Facebook page yesterday evening, the PAP candidate for the four-man team at Moulmein-Kallang Group Representation Constituency, called it the “most nasty moment of our campaign so far.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lui wrote that a resident, who had claimed to be an ardent Opposition supporter and a member of the management committee, was threatening him and his team, shouting vulgarities at them.</p>
              <p>Mr Lui did not say where exactly this took place but said the resident had accused the 10 of them of trespassing, “calling the PAP government the worst (more vulgarities) government in the world.”</p>
              <p>Mr Lui added that they had explained to him that a resident had invited them in but the man was not convinced.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Lui: “He just wasn’t interested in any explanation. I certainly hope that even our most ardent PAP supporter would not resort to such behaviour when he encounters the opposition.</p>
              <p>“Just so that this episode would be placed on record, we alerted the Police. Hopefully, this will be the first and last of such encounters.”</p>

              <p>let me say of something of a kind of verbal confrontation tat really went ugly in a nick of time</p>
              <p>It all happened at e MRT station (I'm not going to name it of where it occured) over e fricking simple bag check.</p>
              <p>The idoitic commuter refused to get e bag checked and started verbal argument w/ e security guy.</p>
              <p>Ended up in a nick of a sec, pushing started. He still pushed and bargained his way thru w/ e SMRT station staff.</p>
              <p>Actually that guy ought to have been restrained, handcuffed and detained. For all I might know, there's something suspicious w/ his bag really.</p>
              <p>End of the day, never ever get into confrontation w/ any people.</p>

(They are reversed in order below). I have only deleted my name/addresses and Mr Lui's address for the sake of privacy in the event that you may wish to forward this to your own friends. I trust you will not use this email to "flame" (hope I used the term correctly), but instead to educate and perhaps generate informed discussion.<br><br>I am sending my friends this because I feel that it is important that you hear what happened to me personally, and how Mr Lui reacted to me during what I thought was a simple, agreeable conversation. Those of you who know me well know that I do not go around deliberately antagonising people or creating trouble of any kind. So the flow of the conversation that took place left me shocked, and I must admit, sad. Mr Lui explains his "disengagement" in his reply attached below. I will leave you to read the whole story and the two emails and then come to your own conclusions.<br><br>First, the background to this whole incident.<br><br>I have been a resident of Moulmein my whole life, and not once have I ever had the chance or privilege to vote. So you can imagine how excited I was when I realised that there may be a strong possibility that Moulmein would be contested this time round. Prior to Mr Lui being the walkover MP, our MP was Mr Khaw Boon Wan. If Mr Khaw had still been our MP, I would most likely have voted for him as Mr Khaw had made his presence felt strongly in Moulmein, even at a social level, and it had always been a very reassuring presence. Mr Lui, on the other hand, has not had much of a presence.<br><br>So, on a recent walkabout in Moulmein, I happened to have what I thought at the time, was the privilege, to meet Mr Lui and get to know him better. He started off...</p>

Our houses will be confiscated and the PRC and foreign nationals will take over our houses. We will be beaten and starved and subject to human experiments. Even our gold teeth fillings will be added to the PAP reserves. After finishing our usefulness, the PAP will gas us with cyanide to create a new Singapore with the new IMMIGRANT PRO-PAP SUPER-RACE. All locals who are against PAP will be wipped out. I think we better appeal to the US govt to invade Singapore and save us before these atrocities happen.</p></div>
