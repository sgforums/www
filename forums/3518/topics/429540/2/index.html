              <p><span class="postbody">Wow an update on this episode from another website by the condo resident:
              <br> Reproduced from 3in1kopitiam:
              <br> <a href="http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/...am&amp;msg=49800.1">http://forums.delphiforums.com/n/mb/...am&amp;msg=49800.1</a> <br> <span style="color: red;">Kojak,
              <br> <br> I am the one who told porno Lui off.
              <br> <br> Here are the details. I suggest u leave out my details and condo name:
              <br> <br> Condo has only 19 units so we do not have security. However access 
              is only by activating an intercom from the main direct to the resident u
               want to visit. The gate is than opened by the resident from a switch in
               his home after he satisfied that the person visiting him is bonafide. 
              This is to keep non residents and unauthorised visitors out. We had some
               breakin and we are very security consoius since we don't have a guard 
              or cameras.
              <br> <br> Yesterday don know how a whole bunch of about 15-20 PAP entourage 
              walked into the compound of the condo unannounced like they own the 
              place and started spreading apround and knocking on the doors of the 
              residents annoying the residents.
              <br> <br> This was at about 1pm. I only know about this when 2-3 persons 
              dressed in all white and carrying brochures strated shouting "hellO 
              Hello thru my open door.
              <br> <br> I was shocked and asked who they were. They said they werer on PAP walkabout and wanted to talk to me.
              <br> <br> I am an MC member and got really mad and shouted at then " Who gave you permission to come in. I want to speak to your MP"
              <br> <br> They cld not answer me and started running away down the stairs. I 
              followed them shouting who is your MP. I want to speak to him.
              <br> <br> I ran after them and caught up with them as they just about half way
               leaving the estate and still in the compound of the estate.
              <br> <br> I confronted the minister who acted very fierce with me. I asked who
               gave him permission to come .He said "resident' and could not tell me 
              who. In any case it is not a license to go all over he estate. I shouted
               at him saying he was trespassing and he needed to have MC approval. 
              That i was MC member and no one asked for approval.
              <br> <br> He repliled " i know you are not pappy with PAP government so no need to be like that and extended his hand to shake mine".
              <br> <br> I said I will not shake his hand and shouted to him to get out of 
              the esatte . I followed up by saying this was the worst goverment and 
              hoped he will be voted oput.
              <br> <br> He turned rund and his whole bunch of people quickly ran out of the 
              estate. As he was leavung I heard hi say " Did nayone of you record down
               the conversation"
              <br> <br> I am not sure he called the police or not. No police have contacted me yet.
              <br> <br> Meanewhile the condo mgt corpoation is issuing a notice to all 
              residnents not to allow any piolitcal parties to enter the compound and 
              to remind them that they need to get MC approval.
              <br> <br> I want to refute a few things:
              <br> <br> a. I never made any threats, I pur[osely stood some distance and put
               my hands behind my back to ensure no accusations. i did repeatedly 
              shout at them to get out as they were trespassing. I think they know 
              that.
              <br> <br> b. The so called vulgaritries they refer to were words like "lousy", "useless", "bloody"
              <br> <br> c. I felt more threatened as there were 15 or so of them looking at 
              me menacingly just cos their MP kene questioned vigorously.

              <p>haha there i told you..farker lui. PAP thinks they're boss. Lim Hwee Hua did a walkabout at my flat 12 years ago. Her entourage was like about 10 people?!?! And her minders would come up to the doors before she could so that the resident would be standing there when she arrives. I wasn't in the least interested and said sorry not keen....the minders gave me a surprised look, "No?!, no questions for the MP?" I just smiled and waved them away.</p>
              <p>Who the fuck they think they're?</p>
