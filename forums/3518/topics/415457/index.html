              <p><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/11/16/three-new-political-dynamics-that-may-influence-the-outcome-of-the-next-general-election/">http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/11/16/three-new-political-dynamics-that-may-influence-the-outcome-of-the-next-general-election/</a></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/imagesCAEBSLXM.jpg"></a>I am  glad to read from many socio-political blogs that the forthcoming election will be fiercely contested by opposition political parties.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One sure certainty is that there will be lesser walk-overs as compared to previous elections whereby the ruling party is  handed over power almost on a platter when opposition parties could not find enough candidates to field for election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I have also read that Kenneth Jeyeretnam of Reform Party is fielding candidates to contest  in  at least three GRCs, This can only be good news for Singaporean voters – many of whom never have the chance to vote at all.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">More importantly, Kenneth has being a breath of fresh air for the opposition politics, which unfortunately  is known more for its ineptitude and inefficiency.  He has single-handedly brought hope and optimism to opposition politics in Singapore. Only time will tell if he can be mentioned in the same calibre as  his father -  the late J B Jeyeretnam.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One gets the feeling that this election will be a watershed one – both for the ruling party and Singapore as a whole. Some have even boldly  predicted that our country will never be the same again after this election. Even though the opposition may not be able to topple the ruling party from power, it will definitely make much headway in our local politics and act as a strong alternative.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I have voted in three other elections consecutively but have never felt the ground  shifted so much.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The mixed emotions felt by the NTU student during the recent  SM Goh Chok Tong’s  public forum must have jolted the ruling party out of its’ senses  as the population struggled to come to terms with a heavy foreign presence unseen before since independence in 1965.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">More significantly, many citizens questioned the need to defend a country that is populated by temporary foreign residents who come in and  make their quick exit  after accumulating  sufficient  benefits  during their short stay here.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Foreigners the main push factor for alternative votes</span></strong></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/foreigner-workers.jpg"></a><span style="color: #000000;">Very clearly, the  main push factor for majority of citizens  to vote otherwise   is   the extreme discomfort  associated  with the huge influx of foreigners allowed into our country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Our Prime Minister’s regular  rhetoria that ushering  in foreigners with open arms will help bring jobs to our country remains largely unprovened.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, foreign professionals   have competed  fiercely for jobs with our local citizens  in all sectors and they have consequently helped pushed  up housing prices. Our locals face re-employment pressure in all possible  hiring positions – senior management, middle management, lower middle management, junior executive among others.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many displaced executives – retrenched two years ago during the financial crisis – are now   more ready to  cast their votes against the ruling party as they have seen  how  their livelihood  has  been severely  threatened by the government’s open-door globalisation policy. There are  not enough  solid evidences to prove that by welcoming in more foreigners, the local population will ultimately benefit.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">On the contrary, we see how many highly educated experienced PMETs struggle to find jobs and often if they found one,  its a junior position that carried lesser pay compared to their previous jobs.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Such swing votes coming from a displaced population  could help the opposition candidates capture at least one GRC as the best opposition performance in Aljunied GRC  during the previous election, showed a loss of only 6%. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Workers’ Party’s Chairman Ms Sylvia Lim has also excelled in her non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) role and many voters may decide to give her a chance to be legitimately elected as  their Member of Parliament (MP).</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many of these swing voters may also  be loyal PAP supporters  as their basic needs were met all along  and the future seems bright. It will be silly to vote against the ruling party who has helped them achieve so much in life even though they have weak human rights record and freedom of speech is mostly curtailed..</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Now,  they felt betrayed by a government who has brought in so many foreigners  and denying them the basic right to make a living for their families.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Some also suffered from the ill-effects of prolonged unemployment resulting in bankruptcy, forced home re-possession by banks and family’s  breakup.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, many Singaporeans see no real future for themselves especially if they have  reach the crucial middle-aged  segment of their life whereby jobs are scant once they are being  retrenched.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Contractual work arrangements have also rendered long-term work stability a foregone conclusion among our  ageing executives. High business cost and a lack of entrepreneurial aptitude have  prevented many jobless executives from venturing out of their working-life comfort zone.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Voters are smart people and they will want  take a chance on an alternative if given the choice. Singaporeans are are considered very pragmatic voters and their loyalty will shift if their standard of living and livelihood  have being compromised.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">I have listed three  new political  dynamics in play and they may significantly influence the outcome of this  coming general election:-</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">1. Popularity  of socio-political websites</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">We have seen the recent  phenomenal rise in popularity of  socio-political websites and this has mainly benefited the opposition parties.  Many netizens have switched to viewing articles posted on such sites as they refuse to believe anymore on the reportings  of our state-controlled newspapers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, Mr Gerald Giam, a candidate for Workers’ Party, has used his blog -geraldgiam.sg to showcase his political views to his supporters on a regular basis. He enjoys a total readership of a few thousand readers daily.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Without the facility of a blog, Mr Giam is unlikely to enjoy such prominence as the state presses will not give him much  space in their columns.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The state-controlled press – long suspected to be the propanganda mouthpiece of the ruling party, suddenly  faces strong competition from our alternative online media – all run by volunteers without any proper funding.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Articles posted on socio-political websites are known to be more balanced and transparent but they are generally  critical of the government policies.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">That is probably the reason why New Temasek Review is in the news lately and they have  to change their website name from Temasek Review to New Temasek Review as a result of  a website name  infringement charge laid by Temasek Holdings.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The huge popularity enjoyed by social-political websites is  unprecendented and the governm</span><span style="color: #000000;">ent has not been successful in tapping on this new channel of communication.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">They can control the presses but its another matter to monitor and curtail information put up by  bloggers  using overseas IPs and web hosts. The government can threaten and even haul them to the police stations for interrogation but they can’t control all of them without suffering a backlash on our already-rotten freedom of speech record.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact,  the government has to close down their own PAP Youth website as it is populated by anti- government comments – definitely a big slap to their face.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The two most popular socio-political websites: The Online Citizen and New Temasek Review have enjoyed daily  readership figures  in the tens of thousands and they could  hugely influence  how people will vote in the next election as most of their articles are pro-alternative.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Though the state  has always believed to have control the press, not many can deny that socio-political blogs belong to the  voice of the common  people.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">More importantly, they have become a focal point for voices of dissent to gather together and in unity people find strength and courage to speak out even though its all hidden behind a moniker.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Most socio political blogs also provide sufficient air time for opposition figures to showcase their views and abilities  – a luxury which has  all along been denied  by our state-controlled presses.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">A lack of  open channel to voice out their frustration has invariably helped political blogs to flourish as netizens gather online as a show of strength, Many also use this communication channel to vent out their frustrations by posting anti-government comments.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The fact that our socio-political blogs have enjoy such  immense popularity shows that there is a large group of people out there who is feeling displaced and frustrated and have nowhere or no one to turn to for redress.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">2. Resurgence of opposition politics</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There is also a huge unprecedented  interest in opposition politics. Young people have joined opposition parties in droves and many are ready to even  stand for election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many are capable well-educated citizens who want to do more than just cast a vote.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">They are probably in their early 20s to late 30s , university-educated and more significantly have not seen the intimidation  tactics of the current regime – used by the ruling party to deter people from joining opposition politics with good effect.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">People in their early 40s to late 50s have seen how the ruling party chastised voices of dissent  so much so that they are very cautious to have any association with any  opposition voices.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Those who dare and want to join a opposition party in the past has to back away as their family members pleaded with them, some on bended knees,  not to do so for the sake of their family members and careers.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Their fear  is understandable as opposition candidates hardly win in an election and they have to face the adverse consequences of their decision which may  affect their livelihood. For the sake of the family, many potential candidates have turn  away to be opposition candidates.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">However, many young people  have  seen the  pathetic state of  our opposition politics and wanted to do something  active on their own to spark a political reformation.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many young people  have   thrown caution to the wind as  they could not take the stifling political environment anymore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Some of these candidates  have just returned from abroad and  after been influenced  by democracy-driven values overseas are more ready to push for  political changes in our country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In the past, opposition party candidates were known to have been sued after election  and some have fled abroad to escape  lawsuits filed against them by the ruling party.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is however heartening to know that lawsuits were not filed against anyone standing as a candidate against the ruling party during the last election and it is hope that this will be the norm in the future.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The resurgence of opposition politics  can only spell hope for those who yearn for political reform in our country – thanks mainly to our young citizens  who have walk the talk and want to do something to spark  changes for our country.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>3. </strong><strong>Bad News All The Way</strong></span></p>
              <p><a href="http://www.transitioning.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/floods.jpg"></a></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Since the last election in 2006, bad news have followed the city state like a plague. From regular floods hitting the island state  to the infamous terrorist escape of Mas Selmat, Singaporeans have never seen so many unnatural events happened within a short period in their life time.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is as if such calamities  were waiting to be unfolded  and they have been hiding all along somewhere waiting  for the right time to explode.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">We were given an early warning  of things to come when the financial crisis hit us badly in 2007/8 - jn fact we have yet to    fully recover from the downturn even though our GDP has reached skyrocketing proportions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many of the retrenched were high-level executives unlike the previous recession in 2000/1 period when many rank-and-file workers were laid off.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The same  maligned manufacturing sector continued to revamp and to reduce cost, many manufacturers  have  moved to cheaper locations in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many retrenched executives still remained jobless till today  as the whole industry  has completely  transformed and many found difficulty transitioning  to a new career despite all kinds of upgrading programmes in place.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Their obsolete skillsets, high expectations  and matured age were challenges that could not be resolved easily. The influx of foreigners have worsened their plight.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">More negative news followed when Temasek Holdings, our state-controlled sovereignty investment giant, revealed that their losses ran into the tens of billions.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">There were also critical reports from foreign presses stating that our investment strategies were flawed and we bought into toxic banking stocks when many fund houses were selling.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For example, we bought a stake in the Australian childcare’s ABC Learning Centre for close to $1 billion dollars only to find the childcare giant collapsed few months later.  Much of the investment has gone down the drain.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Singaporeans were shell-shocked as all along they have trusted the government to be prudent on investing   the country’s reserves. There were cries for more transparency in Parliament but the government remained tight-lipped on their investment portfolio and strategy further frustrating the general population.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Things got worse for the government when terrorist  Mas Selamat managed to escape from a light-security detention centre  three years ago. The irony of it all was the fact that Mas Selamat – a limping unfit prisoner, has managed to remain uncaptured for many months despite an island-wide manhunt search before the Malaysian authorities nabbed him in nearby Johore.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The way the government explained away its incompetence and subsequently laid the blame  on junior subordinates, resulting in their dismissal, have angered many netizens.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many are also dissatisfied with how  ministers could escape scoff free and refused to take  full responsibility  for blunders committed in governance.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">More seriously, many now feel that  such monopolistic style of governance is the  result of a  one-party dominated Parliament and this may be a big push factor for many  to vote for more opposition voices during the next election.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Even the sky did not spare the island state from  when flash floods regularly threatened the country’s  first-world image. The floods were an embarrassment to our country’s famed  superb insfrastructure and top-notch  business  efficiency image.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many netizens took it as a sign from the heavens to chastise our country for opening the door to vices generated from our two integrated resorts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">News of prostitution, money laundering, cheating, corruption, gambling addiction took centre stage as our country comes to terms with two mega-size casinos at its doorsteps.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The growth-at-all-cost slogan of the government does not go down well with many people as the social costs were just too great.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The introduction of the two mega resorts have not really translate into direct job opportunites for the general population – as promised by the Prime Minister. Many citizens felt cheated by a leader who is only concerned with growing the country’s wealth without really showing concern on how to  spread the benefits to the general population.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, many of the jobs generated are service-related and employers prefer to hire foreigners for their low cost and service-orientaed nature.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Many people now suspect that the government has now lost its plot to re-chart the ship that is sailing aimlessly in unchartered waters for the past few years.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Having tried their hand at pharmaucetical,  bio-technology, wafer manufacturing and other high-tech industries, the government could not really steady the ship and provide clear direction on the right way to sail.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Though GDP figures are on the rise and  unemployment has dipped, the journey remains turbulent and uncertain for many.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">In fact, there is already talk of a technical recession for the latter part of this year as the US and Europe  unemployment rate remains high – around 7.5%.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The recent demise of Mrs Lee Kuan Yew has also given  rise to speculation that strongman MM Lee Kuan Yew may not contest  the next election as he is still grieving and lost the combative willpower.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Losing MM Lee for the next election is like not having Pele on the Brazilian football team.  His mere  presence in political rallies have  won votes especially  from those  in  the age group of 50s – 70s. His huge influence on any election is undeniable and his absence now will likely help swing some votes to the opposition.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The recent high-profiled court case against the British author Mr Alan Shadrake has also not endeared the government to a young population who is concerned about the poor freedom of speech and human rights record here.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Singapore has just gone through a turbulent  five-year period and many people, who are affected in one way or another by either the influx of foreigners or the recent financial crisis, will have no hesitation to shift their support to the opposition this time round.</span></p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Conclusion</span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The ground has certainly shifted against the ruling party during this turbulent period and many citizens can sense that change may soon arrive.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">It is almost certain that the ruling party will suffer a drop in majority votes even though they have a large contingent of civil servants and newly-converted foreign-breed citizens rooting for them.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">They could account for at least 10% of the voting  population – a 100,000-strong civil service and roughly 30,000 new citizens parachuted in.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Most political analysts foresee a very tight election this time round with some  GRCs decided by a mere single-digit votes.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">One or more GRCs may fall to the opposition as voters have more push factor to vote for an alternative party having suffer directly from the policies of the government.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">Unless the ruling party could implement significant changes in the near future, we may see the emergence of a two-party governance – long hail as the hallmark of a true-blue democratic country.</span></p>

              <p>THe thing about SG is that everything started to go downhill from 1999 onwards. Right now, a regime change is needed to invigorate the moribund atmosphere and stem the rot. Either that or PAP rules only as a minority government.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A shame that the GRC system discourages independents from running. Non-party candidates are better able to deliver on their election promises if voted in, as they have no obligations to any major party line.</p>
