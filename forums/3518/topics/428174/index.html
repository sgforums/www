              <p>http://satayclub.net/2011/04/andrewkuan_i_will_do_what_is_right/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Former Group Chief Financial Officer of JTC Corporation Andrew Kuan 
              says he will do “what is right and appropriate” if he is elected into 
              Parliament, adding that he will be not have to toe the line of any 
              political party and will thus be able to reflect his honest views.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Kuan is expected to stand as an independent candidate in the single-member ward of Joo Chiat, where he grew up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“If elected, I will be an independent MP with independent views,” 
              said Mr Kuan in an interview with The Satay Club. “I will not be 
              constrained by any party ideology or party whip. Therefore, I will stand
               up and speak out in favour of whatever is beneficial to the residents 
              of Joo Chiat, as well as in the national interests of Singapore.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Kuan says that he wants to place his focus on the municipal issues
               affecting Joo Chiat, such as “parking, mosquito problems, drainage 
              matters” as well as “seeking better ways to meet the needs of elderly 
              residents”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He says that residents of private homes in Joo Chiat should receive 
              “fair and equitable treatment” from the PUB, as they are not receiving 
              the same subsidies as HDB flat-dwellers at the moment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“Many Joo Chiat residents are retirees and have been living here for 
              decades. They deserve to get the same subsidies,” said Mr Kuan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the topic of the public furore that surrounded his bid to stand as
               a candidate in the Presidential Election in 2005, Mr Kuan says that he 
              was the victim of “allegations of no sense”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>During the lead-up to the election, former JTC chairmen Lim Neo Chian
               and Chong Lit Cheong, as well as board member Ben Kwek, said that Mr 
              Kuan had performed poorly in his role as Group CFO. Mr Kuan says that he
               attempted to rebut these allegations by making available his Annual 
              Performance Appraisal, in which he was said to have “exceeded 
              expectations” by Mr Chong, the Reporting Officer, himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Kuan also says he received a pay increment and a bonus in the same
               year, and so he could not possibly have performed as poorly as his 
              accusers allege.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He declined to suggest any reasons as to why they might have made the
               said allegations, choosing instead to focus on stating that the 
              allegations themselves had “no sense”.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Kuan was eventually deemed to be ineligible to contest the 
              Presidential Election, resulting in incumbent S R Nathan getting a 
              walkover.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Turning his attentions to the contest in Joo Chiat in the upcoming 
              General Election, Mr Kuan says that his election manifesto can be summed
               up using the acronym CARE – standing for “Clearer Accountability, 
              Responsibility and Equality for a better Joo Chiat”.</p>
              <p>--</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Andrew also posted comments on the post, saying he has done '25 walkabouts' in Joo Chiat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should he stand as a candidate there or give way like Chia Ti Lik?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think he has no chance of winning.. no independent have ever won before</p>

              <p>vote an independent voice into parliament or root for a party with stronger power base? I think the latter sounds more logical if they are to be heard in parliament. He alone is not going to get the subsidies for Joo Chiat residents.</p>
              <p>The way I see it....this fella....di siao only. He's gonna dilute the votes and.....send JC back into PAP's cradling arms.</p>
