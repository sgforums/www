              <h1 class="storyheadline2">The Online Citizen asks PM to reverse decision or to explain gazette move</h1>
              <p>By 
              																				Jeremy Au Yong</p>
              <p>SOCIO-POLITICAL blog The Online Citizen (TOC) said on Friday that it 
              will comply with recent government requests to register, but only if it 
              fails in its appeal to the Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>It has written to Mr Lee Hsien Loong to ask that the 
              decision to gazette the site as a political association be reversed, or 
              if not, for the decision to be explained.</p>
              <p>A statement put up on the site yesterday evening announced 
              that it will submit the particulars of its editorial team to the 
              Registry of Political Donations and Media Development Authority (MDA) if
               that is the only way to continue existing.</p>
              <p>'If registering is what it'll take to continue our 
              contribution to Singapore, we'll do it and send a clear message that we 
              will not be intimidated into exiting the arena of public discourse,' it 
              said in a statement signed by its acting chief editor Joshua Chiang, 35,
               and co-founders Choo Zheng Xi, 25, and Andrew Loh, 43.</p>
              <p>TOC indicated it would be willing to submit the names of up to four members.</p>
              <p>But first, it intends to wait for the Prime Minister's response.</p>

              <p>The garbrament like to arrest people whenever they feel like it and then throw them to the kangaroo judges to rob them of money, the TOC have to step up to the challenge but their reporting will become more muted, and I doubt Leong Sze Hian will want to feature anymore articles there.</p>
              <p>TOC will overstepped the everchanging garbrament boundaries soon and the garbrament will try to demonise TOC.</p>
              <p>It's the same thing that always happen to people that takes a different stance from the garbrament, although TOC might want to continue, but I rather they forget it, it's not worth getting arrested, locals have no power to save them at all, cannot demostrate, and even if they ask for donations to help fight the kangaroo judges, very few will step forward.</p>
              <p>They, at least, earned the warth of the dumb PM, which really means that TOC have been more effective in acheiving at least some of their aims.</p>
              <p>The Shit Times have been made to look like a seasoned liar, together with the garbrament which really don't fool locals and not even PRs and foreigners. That's why PRs and foreigners also want to earn enough and just retire back home.</p>
              <p>No one in their right mind will think that Sinkapore is a proper country, it is a slave trap, enslaving hapless poor citizens to toil for the Lee Empire.</p>

              <p>THE police confirmed with The Straits Times on Wednesday night that 
              website The Online Citizen (TOC) has been told to apply for three 
              licences for its fundraising event scheduled this Saturday.</p>
              <p>Said the police in a statement issued: 'In response to media
               queries, police confirm that The Online Citizen was asked to provide 
              details of its intended event and advised accordingly, to apply for the 
              requisite permits where necessary.'</p>
              <p>TOC had announced on its site on Tuesday, that it plans to 
              hold its fundraising event - billed as 'TOC Cassetted, Not a Political 
              Party' - on Saturday.</p>
              <p>Later, on the same day, the police contacted the site's 
              maintainers, saying they were required to obtain three licences before 
              they would be allowed to go ahead with the event. This request was also 
              documented on the website itself.</p>
              <p>The licences TOC was told to apply for, are the Public 
              Entertainment Licence, the House To House and Street Collections 
              Licence, and a notification to conduct a lucky draw under the house 
              gaming rules licence.</p>
              <p>TOC said on its website its fundraising party would feature a
               live performance, games and a lucky draw. The planned live performance 
              is a set by a three-piece acoustic band, The UnCassetted. All three 
              lucky draw prizes are worth less than $30 each.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Online Citizen is not a passive website which simply hosts social or 
              political commentaries by individuals, says Law and Home Affairs 
              Minister K Shanmugam.<br><br>He adds that the Attorney General's 
              Chambers has advised the government that The Online Citizen is a 
              political association within the meaning of the provisions of the 
              Political Donations Act.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam was speaking in Parliament on Monday.<br><br>Nominated
               MP Viswa Sadasivan had wanted to know the principal considerations for 
              the government's decision to gazette The Online Citizen as a political 
              association.<br><br>Replying, Mr Shanmugam explained that the website 
              provides coverage, commentary and analysis of political issues and also 
              organises on-line and off-line campaigns to change legislation and 
              government policies.<br><br>The Minister assured the House that 
              declaring The Online Citizen (TOC) as a political association will not 
              impede its freedom of expression.<br><br>Mr Shanmugam said: "It has no 
              impact on any activity TOC wishes to do and that is critical. So 
              whatever netizens or others may think, look at what the consequences 
              are. The consequences are.....TOC cannot receive foreign donations and 
              anonymous donations of over S$5,000."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>
