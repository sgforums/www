              <p>While going to the hawker centre for lunch today, some opposition 
              members were selling their newsletters. Without hesitation, I bought one
               and carry it to order my noodles and rice for the family.</p>
              <p>When 
              they see the newsletter on the table, all the friendliness that they 
              used to gave me turned into cold shoulders. No more the usual hello or 
              how are you?</p>
              <p>And when my neighbours that usually greet me, now just turn away as if we are plague.</p>
              <p>They
               complained all the time but become strangers when I put an opposition 
              newsletter on the table (not even reading!). I just bought a talisman 
              that see what true colour my friends and neighbours are. They are 
              seedless, hopefully you are not one of them.</p>

              <p>That's is my personal experience. Perhaps I'm the only person that buy that newsletter. It should give the opp their limited success in my ward at least.

              <p>just noticed this thread...</p>
              <p>and just cant help feeling sad regarding the state of political apathy of many of our people... its like opposing the pap or the mere association with opp parties = lawsuit against you, or that your livelihood will be threaten....</p>
              <p>in recent times i noticed the strong anti-pap statements in this forum and in sites like temasek review and toc.. and i thought that perhaps a sort of political awakening is dawning on sg.. and that we are beginning to make our voices heard above the elitism that defines our policies...</p>
              <p>but sadly when i saw this thread, i realize that perhaps the political awakening is only at its very initial stage and that many are too deep in slumber to awake.. i mean, how many supporters are there really in all these websites? hundreds?  but how many people are there in the general population that are like the hawkers that lau bakkwa encountered, who are politically apathetic and even afraid, and who do not hear or see the messages in temasek review and toc?  thousands perhaps??</p>
              <p>opp parties..... what is your election strategy to reach these people? for these hawkers in lau bakkwa's case, it is the "elderly respected hawkers" in these hawker centres that you must find to act as your "informal champions"... these are the guys whom theother hawkers may look up to, and who are influential.... they are the ones who you must find, and who can help you preach your message.... do you have these champions? how many do you have? are all the "hawker centres" and "food courts" covered, or how many have been covered? </p>
              <p>....when it comes to contesting any ward... the nos. of people who frequent and who are active in the toc and temasek review are the minority... the majority are those who do not go online to these sites.. and who are so far... not convinced about your political agenda and your credentials... are you reaching out to these people? how are you doing it?</p>
              <p>your message cannot be the rhetoric about having an opposition voice in the parliament.. it must be about specific and practical issues that strike a cord with the people.. the rising costs of living, of transport, of housing, of medical care....the lack of welfare, the alienation that they are feeling... bring out specific examples... real life examples... have real life champions, who have dropped out of the system and who have been left out by the elistist policies, to supplement your points...</p>
              <p>just recently... egypt witnessed an unprecedented grassroots movement for a fair government and political system.. they were fighting for political freedom and for social freedom... various opposition movements and parties united without any claer leader, but for a common purpose... they are all seeking for the same freedoms and opportunities that have been denied them for years...</p>
              <p>what about sg? how do you intend to reach out to the people? what will be the rallying factor? i hope the opp parties can comment...</p>

              <p>have a look at the Straits Times, how the reporting is mostly based on the hawkers which seems to fully support the PAP.</p>
