              <p>2006 Election aftermath</p>
              <p>What do you think was on voters minds when Lee Hsien Loong decided to increase the GST to 7% and increase ministers pay shortly after he was given a strong mandate the 2006?  When he campaigned for a strong mandate in 2006, his message was he will take care of the poor, look after Sngaporeans and address the widening income gap. But the moment he got into office his priority was to increase GST and increase his ministers' pay.<br><br>Now that it is election time he is saying the same things again - that he will take care of Singaporeans and help those in need.  These is only one intelligent line (and countless unintelligent ones) I remember from George Bush:</p>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><em>"If you fool me once shame on you. If you fool me twice, shame on me..." - George Bush</em>.</div>

              <div style="text-align: center;">With more and more foreigners coming in and taking over our <strong>job, housing and university places</strong>, only a fool will sit by and continue to vote for PAP which supports the foreigner policy so vigorously.</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">It has come to the point that we need to wake up the PAP or we Singaporeans will eventually get outnumbered by foreigners. Jobs are lost to foreigners. (wait till you get retrenched)</div>

              <p>Seriously, dont understand why anyone would vote for PAP.</p>
              <p>There are so many issues:</p>
              <p>Foreigner policy, High HDB cost, CPF, National service (ICT, RT, IPPT), ERP, Squeezing on mrt, mas selamat, floods, high minister pays, MP's lack of empathy (Other mp will tell you to go see your mp and you will never see your own mp), lack of jobs, university places, housing. Even the ministers are threatening us with our votes.</p>

              <p>Advantage of voting for opposition.</p>
              <p>1) PAP will start fearing for votes in the future elections. PAP will start to introduce better policy for us unlike in the 2006 election where they promise this promise that but turned out increase GST, increase ERP and increase their own paycheck.</p>
              <p>2) PAP will at least slow down the huge influx of foreigners who are taking away our jobs, housing and university places. Right now, foreigners already account for 40% of  our population. Anything more, we should call this place 'foreignapore'.</p>
              <p>3) Oppositions this time round are good and credible. Most of them understand our predicament and needs. They will provide much needed fresh voice into the parliament.</p>
              <p>4) More gst offset packages on the way if we vote for opposition. When pap is afraid, they will dish out more goodies, tax rebates and it can only be good for us.</p>
              <p>5) Show that we have integrity and will power. We will/must not be intimidated by threats.</p>

              <p>PRIME Minister Lee Hsien Loong's apology to Singaporeans
               for mistakes made in the past five years is refreshing and reassuring 
              ('PM says sorry'; yesterday).</p>
              <p>He also emphasised that the People's Action Party (PAP) 
              adopts a different style in working with a new generation of 
              Singaporeans compared with Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>This is good to know.</p>
              <p>However, I have noticed that in the current hustings, it is 
              the PAP which is consistently hitting below the belt and not campaigning
               the way a new generation of Singaporeans will appreciate.</p>
              <p>It started with Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, who is contesting 
              Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, questioning if his rival Singapore Democratic 
              Party (SDP) candidate had a gay agenda.</p>
              <p>Subsequent instances followed: Senior Minister Goh Chok 
              Tong's personal and unwarranted remarks about his former principal 
              private secretary and now SDP candidate Tan Jee Say (Holland-Bukit Timah
               GRC); and Minister Lim Hwee Hua's (Aljunied GRC) salvo against rival 
              Workers' Party secretary-general Low Thia Khiang, questioning the 
              accounts of Hougang Town Council without showing proof.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo (Aljunied GRC) also claimed that Mr Low has abandoned the residents of Hougang who voted for him.</p>
              <p>The simple retort would be that several PAP MPs have also 
              shifted ground for the current General Election, including Mr Baey Yam 
              Keng, who moved from Tanjong Pagar GRC to Tampines GRC.</p>
              <p>Trust Singaporeans to make the right choice. We hope we do 
              not see the PAP resorting to desperate measures when the party gets 
              rattled, when the opposition has by and large campaigned with restraint.</p>

              <p>Flooding is not really a big issue for me. It happens to many country. And even when they said the wrong things like "this is a flood that only comes in once every 10 years". Okay i can forgive that since once in a while, you say something wrong, make mistake.</p>
              <p><br>What i cannot forgive is:<br>1) Mas selamat escape and no official apology was given.</p>
              <p>2) Liars.</p>
              <p>2006 Election aftermath</p>
              <p>What do you think was on voters minds when Lee Hsien Loong decided to increase the GST to 7% and increase ministers pay shortly after he was given a strong mandate the 2006?  When he campaigned for a strong mandate in 2006, his message was he will take care of the poor, look after Sngaporeans and address the widening income gap. But the moment he got into office his priority was to increase GST and increase his ministers' pay.</p>
              <p>What i cannot tolerate is</p>
              <p>1) MP's lack of empathy</p>
              <p>2) Easy PR policy for foreigner.</p>
              <p>Knew this PRC guy who studied in NUS on FULLY PAID scholarship. FREE lodging, FREE allowance, FREE tuition fees.<br><br>Only 'bond' he had to serve was to work in SG for 3 yrs. No need to be any specific coy. Just need to work in SG for 3 yrs.<br><br>After just 1+ yrs, he packed his bags and went back to China to work for an international bank.<br><br>I can't even afford to stay in the uni's hostel and experience uni hostel life. Yet this guy gets to come here FREE EVERYTHING and then pat his backside and went off to China just like that.<br><br>I'm a 2nd class citizen in my own country!!!! I feel betrayed, forsakened and used... best of all... I feel a stinging pain in my backside...<br><br>Edit : Just to add, he was AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN a PR when he grad<br><br>Being treated like second-class citizen at my own country.</p>

              <p>Opposition can indeed do a good job in their town council, Hougang is one of them i can say that pride is taken to clean the town and maintain it unlike some GRCs like Marine Parade...<br>Now the worry is SGreans fall prey to PAP's i am sorry tactic and vote for ruling elite as there will use cooling day to scare SGreans again that SG will fall into disrepair if PAP is not in power</p>

I thing George Yeo mentioned something about a more caring PAP,what the people need is a more caring Government and because PAP is the Government it must be be forced into coalition. for a good change</p>

The logic behind it is simple. If a teacher marks an exam paper, she will place a cross next to the answer that is wrong.
