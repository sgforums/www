              <p>With the coming election tipped to swing against his governing party, the founding leader, <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Lee+Kuan+Yew&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></a>, who is 87, has signalled his intention to continue in office.</p>
              <p>Speaking with a slight slur and looking his age, Lee posted his message in a low-key video that answered a burning question in almost every <span id="lw_1303807630_2" class="yshortcuts">Singaporean</span>'s mind — and a few foreigners, as well.</p>
              <p>"I'm happy to be still representing <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Tanjong+Pagar&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #005790;">Tanjong Pagar</span></a>," Lee said, referring to the constituency that he first won 56 years ago.</p>
              <p>It was posted inconspicuously among other candidates' messages on the People's Action Party (PAP) website without an accompanying story.</p>
              <p>The pro-government press gave it scant prominence, and many Singaporeans first read about it in a <em>Yahoo! </em>news report.</p>
              <p>This means that if re-elected — as he will likely be — Lee will retain his record as one of the world's longest surviving leaders, although as an "adviser" to the Cabinet.</p>
              <p>Lately, the elderly <span id="lw_1303807630_4" class="yshortcuts">politician</span> has stayed out of the public limelight, speaking less and less, raising speculation that he may be preparing to step down.</p>
              <p>The low-key treatment was probably by design.</p>
              <p>"I think they want to project the retention of the 87-year-old Lee as a non-story at a time when other top leaders are retired," said a long-time PAP watcher.</p>
              <p><strong>Fading relevance</strong></p>
              <p>At any rate, it seems that the importance of whether Lee stays or goes has become less important, overtaken by Singapore's fast-changing politics.</p>
              <p>The electorate is changing; so is the PAP itself, so Lee — because of his health and age — is no longer very important to many people.</p>
              <p>The election (Polling Day: 7 May) is shaping up to be one of the hottest in decades that threatens to shake up the powerful PAP that Lee co-founded.</p>
              <p>A gradual build-up of public unhappiness is contributing to this.</p>
              <p>Years of excessive intake of foreigners that threatened white-collar jobs and depressed salaries of middle-class Singaporeans — as well as fuelled high inflation — are creating strong resentment in <span id="lw_1303807630_3" class="yshortcuts">the republic</span>.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans are worried about the future of their children and their country.</p>
              <p>The PAP is not facing defeat, not in this election anyway, far from it. It will undoubtedly retain its mandate to govern for another five years.</p>
              <p>The party probably has enough momentum of past — even brilliant — successes to let it win this election, especially with Lee around. The next one, well, that's another story.</p>
              <p>With nine days of campaigning from noon of nomination day (27 April), people are gearing for an erosion of popular support for the government.</p>
              <p>In 2006, the PAP won 66.6 percent popular votes and 82 out of 84 seats. The total votes are almost certain to drop (some say it's possible to dip below 60 percent).</p>
              <p>But under Singapore's "first-past-the post" system, it will be much harder to win many more seats.</p>
              <p>More worrying for 59-year-old Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is the prospect of losing the hearts and minds of youths, who are less accepting of his policies.</p>
              <p>Some analysts believe that this is one of the reasons why his father, MM Lee, wants to stay on despite his health.</p>
              <p>"He wants to ensure the PAP, with a large crop of new, inexperienced candidates, does not falter during its crucial self-renewal," a grassroots leader told me.</p>
              <p><strong>Still appreciated</strong></p>
              <p>That he intends to serve an 11th term in Parliament is welcomed by a section of the population, especially the elderly, that feels indebted for his role in building today's Singa­pore.</p>
              <p>"The older voters may be happy and feel a strong sense of comfort that he's still there," said a political think-tank researcher.</p>
              <p>One admirer wrote: "MM Lee, I salute you for what you and your team had done for Singapore. Without doubt, the PAP team put nation before self."</p>
              <p><em>Heart Sense</em> said: "Dear Mr Lee, you are a great man of our nation and many Singaporeans have gained their success and prosperity from your earlier policies."</p>
              <p>Both admirers, however, said they felt that his successors were generally less capable and as a result quality of life had declined.</p>
              <p>The younger generation, which has no first-hand knowledge of Lee's past achievements, blames him for much of today's woes and wants him to retire.</p>
              <p>Immediately after Lee announced he would contest, a popular website polled readers for their views.</p>
              <p><em><span id="lw_1303807630_5" class="yshortcuts">Temasek</span> Review</em> said that 499 out of 574 respondents — or 78 per cent — opposed his decision.</p>
              <p>Two main reasons given for wanting him to quit are, firstly, to let the younger leaders to take over, and, secondly, they don't like his mega-high salary.</p>
              <p>The other 16 per cent say he should continue.</p>
              <p>One was <em>Angie</em>, who penned: "I want Mr Lee to continue to be the MP and stay as long as he can. Without him, we will never be able to enjoy what we have today."</p>
              <p>Since his wife's death, Lee seemed more conscious of his own fallibility.</p>
              <p>Asked by an American journalist, "So, when is the last leaf falling," Lee replied: "I can feel the gradual decline of energy and vitality. And I mean, generally, every year when you know you are not on the same level as last year. But that's life."</p>
              <p>For this election, knowing his past, he is likely to campaign hard for his son's — and PAP's — victory, his health permitting.</p>
              <p>Given his stature, he will likely be able to pull in a number of votes from Singapore's conservatives who fear sudden changes.</p>
              <p>But his ageing body and mind will weaken his role in the next five years, if it lasts.</p>
