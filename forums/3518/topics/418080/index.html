              <div class="kicker">NEW PAP CENTRAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE</div>
              <h1 class="storyheadline">Mah absent from PAP's CEC</h1>
              <p>THE ruling People's Action Party (PAP) on Wednesday announced the 
              make-up of its highest decision-making body for the next two years, a 
              period which will include the upcoming general election.</p>
              <p>The line-up of the 18-member CEC is the same as in 2008, 
              except that Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam has replaced Mr 
              Mah Bow Tan.</p>
              <p>Mr Shanmugam became a Cabinet minister in May 2008, five 
              months before the 2008 party elections.</p>
              <p>All the CEC members in the side report were elected during a
               PAP conference on Nov 29, with the exception of Mrs Lim Hwee Hua and Dr
               Vivian Balakrishnan, who were co-opted after the election. They scored 
              the 13th and 14th highest number of votes.</p>
              <p>Meeting on Wednesday, the CEC co-opted another four members -
               Mr Gan Kim Yong, Dr Ng Eng Hen, Ms Indranee Rajah and Mr Teo Ser Luck.</p>
              <p>The party's other internal appointments for the 2010 term 
              remain largely the same, with one notable change: Mrs Josephine Teo 
              takes over from Mr Lee Yi Shyan as head of the sub-committee for 
              external relations. The sub-committee handles the party's links and 
              interaction with other political parties from around the world.</p>
