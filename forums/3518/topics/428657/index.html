              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : 
              Education Minister Ng Eng Hen has warned of a possible freak result if 
              Singaporeans vote the opposition into power in the coming polls.<br><br>He said that the opposition must look to form an alternate government, and not just offer alternative voices in Parliament.<br><br>Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng took issue with the opposition sharing candidates.  <br><br>They were speaking at the launch of Heights Park in Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency (GRC) on Saturday.<br><br>After
               meeting with residents at the opening of Heights Park, Education 
              Minister Ng told reporters that voters need to ask themselves who will 
              best serve their needs.<br><br>He said Singaporeans should only vote for
               the opposition if they believe the opposition can run the country 
              better than the People's Action Party (PAP). <br><br>Dr Ng said: "Every 
              election, it is never about just alternative voices in Parliament, 
              because your vote is very powerful and for every General Election you 
              are deciding on who runs the country. If it is just for alternative 
              voices, the NCMP scheme allows for that, you can raise anything you want
               in Parliament.<br><br>"But as the opposition parties have clarified, 
              that is not their intent. In fact, they want to - Workers' Party have 
              said they want to block constitutional amendments, they want enough 
              seats in the house not just to provide alternative voices, but really 
              their goal is to form an alternative government - to become the 
              government."<br><br>One of the points in the Singapore People's Party 
              manifesto is that the government must be held accountable for any 
              security lapses. To this, Mr Wong said he had already dealt with this 
              issue in Parliament.<br><br>He said: "I spent one hour detailing what 
              the Committee of Inquiry found, and spent the next two hours answering 
              questions from all the MPs - those who were interested in asking 
              questions. Mr Chiam (See Tong) stood up and asked me a question, and he 
              asked whether the police considered using tracker dogs to track down Mas
               Selamat.<br><br>"That is his only question for me in Parliament, where I
               spent two hours answering questions. So I made a full public account of
               it. So if he now says that is not enough, why didn't he stand up then 
              and ask more questions."<br><br>Asked to respond on Mr Chiam's comment that sharing of candidates shows opposition unity, Mr Wong disagreed.<br><br>He
               said: "So it means that all the opposition parties have the same 
              philosophy, same principle, same values? By his comments, from what you 
              just read to me, that must be the meaning of it. Well, if that is the 
              case, why so many different parties, why not have one?"<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Seems like they a bit fidgety that this year it seems that the mood on the ground is not as welcoming as before and the alternative parties have been coming out in force and the new generation of voters are more vocal.<br><br>Might not actually translate into a "freak" election result... you must remember a significant amount of the population remains politically apathetic who see Singapore's current state as their lot and have bought the whole "only one party can give us stabilty" bogeyman. Or of course the more conservative and local-media fed generation that will still traditionally vote for the incumbent party.<br><br>Also there's an additional buffer of thousands of new citizens who benefit from the liberal immigration policies who would naturally want to vote incumbent. All these translate into some "insurance" the ruling party can fall back on given they have by far, largely failed to capture the hearts and minds of the internet generation. <br><br>In the long run though, it is clear the PAP job in gaining support among the newer generation is a lot less of a cakewalk as it had in the past few decades. Their poor choice of young candidates also sends out the wrong message... rather then picking a passionate, radical people with strong views of how the country can be run and who represent party renewal and relevance to the new voters, they instead chose pretty much those who would not disturb the status quo and meekly agree with the party line, flying in under the wings of the GRC system... this in my opinion in the long run will be a stragetic mistep for them. <br><br>The movers and shakers of Gen Y are not going to the party and they're going to feel it in the long run when more and more of them start settling down, buying overpriced houses and go into the workforce to compete with the imported FTs... all in all I can say that the old tricks are starting to lose effectiveness...<br><br>Ironically this is a good thing for the PAP if they step up to the challenge, if they wake up their idea and realize that the new generation is a lot smarter and will not take to be treated like sheep and be coddled or affected by the Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt tactics that have been used. Will they be able to make the change or will they just fall flat because too many parties have too many vested interests in the status quo that they are reluctant to change? Only time will tell.<br><br>All I can say is, it is almost certain their mandate among true-blue, born in Singapore and served NS Singaporeans will almost certainly be reduced. They can try to top up the loss by attempting to redefine Singaporean by importing loyal citizens from other countries, but they is only a stopgap.<br><br>So yes, they have reason to be cautious.</p></div>

              <p>this election will tell the PAP, people are fedup with foreigners issue and cost of living in Spore goes up, esp the HDB issue.</p>
              <p>it wont cause them to lose power, but they will see it as a protest vote against their policies. if they continue at this rate, the next election in 2016, they may lose more than a few single seats and GRCs, but not necessarily to the extent of unable to form government.</p>

              <p>I don't think they are foolish, they can see the writing on the wall that Singaporeans are not too happy with some of the runaway policies implemented in the past few years. The so called "reversal" of some of the policies are election mitigation efforts.<br><br>I have no doubt they will remain in power, or retain a majority in parliment. What they are afraid of is having a greater mandate pass to the opposition which will indicate that their job will be harder to justify and do, and also that they can't keep ignoring the alternative views anymore, they won't lose their jobs but will most certainly need to run for their money, which given how incredibly high their salaries are, they ought to face some real challenges at work.</p>
              <p>All this talk about one-party being best for Singaporeans is contigent on the notion that the party itself has the best interests for Singaporeans first and foremost. <br><br>We only hear half of the story. They say that having a one-party system allows policies that benefit Singaporeans to be easily passed.<br><br>They are leaving out the fact that a one-party system also allows policies that do not benefit Singaporeans to be easily passed.<br><br>And the fact that they don't adress that makes me feel that they are not really adept at forming their arguments, which makes it hard for me to vote for somebody who does not seem to know their own case very well.</p>

              <p>1) Rat race: The PAP proclaims they hope to instil some form of US style of education whereby critical thinking is instilled as part of the education system. Hence, smaller classes being advocated.</p>
              <p>However with the rat race w/ more foreign students, how is it going to be possible now?</p>
              <p>2) Work load: I've realised compared to the old days, students are learning way more things at e younger age.</p>
