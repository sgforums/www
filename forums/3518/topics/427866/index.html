              <h3 class="date_story">I REFER to Mr Benjamin Chow's letter ('About Chen: Time will tell'; 
              yesterday). Mr Chow has cast aspersions on Mr Chen Show Mao, questioned 
              his motives and concluded his letter with 'only time will tell'.</h3>
              <p>I agree that many things in life are proven by time. There 
              is a famous adage in Chinese, lu yao zhi ma li, ri jiu jian ren xin 
              (just as it takes a long journey to know the strength of a horse, it 
              also takes time to know a person's real heart'). However, why does this 
              apply only to Chen Show Mao and not to new candidates of the People's 
              Action Party as well?</p>
              <p>Show Mao has been in contact with the Workers' Party (WP) since 2007.</p>
              <p>He has participated in WP's ground outreach such as (party 
              publication) Hammer's sales and other party functions. He is not 
              returning only when 'the pickings are ripe' as the writer alleged.</p>
              <p>Show Mao's decision to come home and stand for election as a WP candidate should be seen in a positive light.</p>
              <p>There is no certainty that he will win the election. He is 
              at the peak of his career and has nothing to gain being on an opposition
               ticket.</p>
              <p>We are glad we are able to attract good people today and provide a credible choice to the voters.</p>
              <p>Show Mao's decision has helped raise the political interests of many Singaporeans including those based overseas.</p>
              <p>It also stirred an 'apolitical 50-year-old native citizen' to write to the Forum Page.</p>
              <p>This is indeed the positive impact Chen Show Mao has generated.</p>

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Chen Sow Mao has done his share for Singapore</h1>
              <p>MR CHEN Show Mao does not need to explain his decision as his actions 
              have spoken louder than words ('About Chen: Time will tell' by Mr 
              Benjamin Chow; yesterday). His resume alone is an answer but more 
              importantly, it raises some issues our country currently grapples with.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen served national service although he was not obliged 
              to. Unlike Mr Chow and me who were born, bred and remain rooted in 
              Singapore, Mr Chen was not born and was not wholly nurtured by 
              Singapore. And yet, he chose to serve. What more do we need to ask of 
              him?</p>
              <p>We remember that NS was harsher then, the allowances thinner
               and yet, the records show Mr Chen served with distinction at the 
              highest level possible. We have serving members of political and high 
              office, including a People's Action Party new candidate, who became 
              Singapore citizens but did not serve NS.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen was the top student of his batch but never got to 
              study the course of his choice nor was he given a scholarship. If he was
               given his choice of study (medicine), he would have probably spent the 
              next 10 years studying and training here.</p>
              <p>He was also not given a Singapore scholarship even though he
               showed academic and leadership qualities (he was president of an 
              elected student council).</p>
              <p>We have only ourselves to blame for not rooting this talent 
              in Singapore but rather forcing him to go out into the world to make a 
              name for himself, which he did.</p>
              <p>Again, as we struggle with issues such as bond-breakers and
               foreign talent with no affinity for Singapore, we do have more pressing
               questions to ask before we start trying to question someone coming back
               with no reward in sight.</p>
              <p>The Singapore opposition politician's life is a hard one, 
              with nothing to gain and everything to lose - with a record that shows 
              only sacrifice for Singapore with very little else in return.</p>
              <p>I dare say the facts show Mr Chen in this respect to be 
              whiter than white. Instead of questioning Mr Chen's motives, we have 
              other more urgent matters to resolve.</p>
