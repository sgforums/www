              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : Health 
              Minister Khaw Boon Wan has said Singapore will be selecting its fourth 
              generation leaders in the coming General Election.<br><br>He said succession planning is one of the strategies of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).<br><br>Mr
               Khaw said a party that is able to keep reforming and relating to the 
              needs of a new generation of voters is one that can sustain for a long 
              time.<br><br>Mr Khaw was speaking during a visit to Sembawang GRC on Sunday morning.<br><br>While
               some Sembawang residents were taking part in an Emergency Preparedness 
              programme, grassroots leaders were making their rounds in preparation 
              for the coming General Election.<br><br>Sembawang GRC will now have five MPs, instead of six, after Singapore's electoral map was redrawn. <br><br>Two
               divisions - Chong Pang, led by Law Minister K Shanmugam, and Canberra, 
              led by Dr Lim Wee Kiak - have been carved out to form Nee Soon GRC.<br><br>Mr Khaw said the changes were not unexpected and would not affect their election strategy.<br><br>He
               said: "The changes are within our expectations, so in fact, in our 
              planning, even two months ago, we have already formulated such a 
              scenario, and then we have restructured our committee, assuming such a 
              change.<br><br>"We already miss them, but if both constituencies, on 
              contest, we win back, that will allow us, as a team again, to work 
              together, even though we are in two separate GRCs. So combining the 
              resources of 10 very strong MPs, I think we will be able to work even 
              better for the residents in the north."<br><br>Mr Khaw said the redrawn 
              boundaries would also cut down waiting time for residents attending the 
              weekly Meet-the-People sessions. He said MPs in Sembawang GRC currently 
              see up to 90 people on average each at their weekly Meet-the-People 
              Sessions, while MPs at other wards typically attend to up to 50 
              residents each time.<br><br>Two potential candidates also made their 
              appearance - 32-year-old lawyer from Norton Rose, Vikram Nair; and 
              34-year-old commodities trader from American financial services firm 
              Morgan Stanley, Ong Teng Koon, who is the son of MP for Nee Soon 
              Central, Ong Ah Heng. <br><br>They have been involved in grassroots activities for the past few years. <br><br>Mr
               Khaw said he hopes to stay on in Sembawang GRC and gave a hint that the
               neighbouring Nee Soon GRC would be led by Mr Shanmugam, who is in 
              charge of Chong Pang ward.<br><br>Mr Khaw said: "Incumbents will always 
              want and hope to be able to stay on where they are because we have spent
               now - at least for some of us - at least five years bonding with the 
              people, and it is always very unsettling to move to another place.<br><br>"I
               am quite sure Mr Shanmugam will want to stay on in Chong Pang too, just
               as myself in Sembawang. The team to be led by Mr Shanmugam - if the 
              party decides to field him there 0 will be a very strong team."<br><br>Mr
               Khaw revealed some of his plans for Sembawang, which include the Home 
              Improve Programme and more cycling tracks that would give residents the 
              convenience of cycling to work.<br><br>Mr Khaw also said he has not seen
               much opposition activity in Sembawang GRC, but added that Chong Pang is
               a popular place for parties to meet people.<br><br>It has been some 10 
              months after Mr Khaw had a bypass surgery and he said he has recovered 
              and is ready for the General Election.<br><br>He said: "I exercise at 
              least four times a week, usually five times. Each time, I run 4.5 
              kilometres...So we are ready for action."<br><br>He also said he fully expects every seat to be contested, adding that this would be good for everyone.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>
