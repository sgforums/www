              <p>THE People's Action Party (PAP) chairman Lim Boon Heng said on Monday 
              that a key issue that the party will fight the coming election on is the
               kind of future Singaporeans want for themselves and their children.</p>
              <p>'Given the environment surrounding Singapore and the 
              competition it faces, what kind of future do we want?' he said at the 
              unveiling of the party's third batch of candidates at the PAP 
              headquarters on Monday afternoon.</p>
              <p>Responding to reporters' questions on the PAP's manifesto for the coming election, he said it would be released 'in due course'.</p>
              <p>In the 2006 election, the manifesto was released on April 15, three weeks before polling day on May 6.</p>
              <p>The latest new faces include the first Malay-Muslim 
              candidate and the youngest PAP candidate among the total of nine 
              introduced so far.</p>
              <p>The trio are Mr Zainal Sapari, 46, an educator; Ms Tin Pei 
              Ling, 28, an Ernst &amp; Young consultant; and Mr Gan Thiam Poh, 48, a 
              banker with DBS.</p>
