              <p>Mr Baey, who is also the deputy managing director of public relations firm, Hill and Knowlton (Singapore), was referring to the policy of revising electoral boundaries before the country goes to the polls on <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=singapore%27s+nomination+day&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Nomination Day</span></a>.</p>
              <p>Comments by <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=george+yeo&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Foreign Minister George Yeo</span></a> last month hinted that the next General Elections could be held “by the end of this year”.</p>
              <p>Singapore is currently divided into 24 electoral divisions, comprising 15 <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=group+representation+constituency&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs)</span></a>, and nine <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=single+member+constituency&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">Single Member Constituencies (SMCs)</span></a> but the government announced earlier this year that more changes can be expected ahead.</p>
              <p>In the past, local opposition parties have also claimed the boundary review report is released without giving them sufficient time to formulate their campaign strategy.</p>
              <p>In the 2001 General Elections, the revised boundaries were released about one week before Nomination Day. In 2006, they were announced about 7 weeks before.</p>
              <p>But the 39-year-old Baey was quick to dismiss the timing and policy of the boundary report and that any changes would hand the ruling party an unfair advantage.</p>
              <p>“Boundary changes are inevitable in every election in any country and with more SMCs and smaller GRCs, there will be more changes to boundaries this time,” he said.</p>
              <p>“But if you look at the incumbent MPs, most are PAP MPs, so actually the PAP might have more to lose,” he explained.</p>
              <p>Mr Baey, who is married with three kids aged 6 between 10, also said that if the boundary changes are seen to be really unfavourable to certain parties, the voters can make their voices heard.</p>
              <p>He said, “I think voters will see it and they will use their votes to express their unhappiness if they feel it’s unfair.”</p>
              <p>Turning his attention to the introduction of the <a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=cooling+off+day&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"><span style="color: #334499;">“cooling off day”</span></a> — a 24-hour period before polling day in which no political parties can campaign or hold rally speeches – he said it would allow voters to think through their decision carefully before going to the ballot box.</p>
              <p>“As a voter, I will welcome that because it allows me more time to think through, to cast a vote that is based on more rational thinking,” he said.</p>
              <p>Hear Mr Baey’s thoughts on the electoral boundary changes as well as the upcoming General Elections.</p>
