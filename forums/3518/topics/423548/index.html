              <h2 class="posttitle">RP Press Release on the departure of nine members</h2>
              <p><span class="left">Posted by theonlinecitizen on February 23, 2011</span></p>
              <p><strong>PRESS RELEASE 23/02/2011</strong></p>
              <p>The Reform Party www.thereformparty.net.</p>
              <p>I can confirm today the resignations as reported in the Press.</p>
              <p>I have no wish to air the Party’s internal matters in public but I 
              have seen previously how untruths left unchallenged get repeated and 
              embedded. I am making this statement as it is in the best interests of 
              the Party and its ordinary members to get the facts out there. I believe
               transparency is the best course of action right now.</p>
              <p>The Reform Party will be smaller because of the resignations, it is 
              true. But we had over 110 members and will come out of this stronger and
               firmer of purpose as a result.<br> We have just had a period of our most successful outreach activity ever.
               Our walkabout team is larger, more united and more determined than at 
              any time in our history. Last night the team RP outreach support 
              reported that roughly 50% of the residents canvassed said they would 
              vote for RP.</p>
              <p>We had the first women’s wing of any opposition political party, a 
              rally which attracted 400 people in heavy rain and are about to launch a
               new integrated digital media platform. We have a new blog on economics,
               sonofadud.com which has been quoted in the media across the world and 
              we have launched our first podcast.</p>
              <p>This coming Sunday we have a joint walkabout planned with Mr Chiam 
              and SPP and tonight a large group of us will attend the PKMS 50 year 
              Jubilee party.</p>
              <p>According to the report in Main Stream Media this group have cited 
              personal differences as a reason for resigning. But if that were the 
              case why would they not come to the mediation table? The timing of this 
              departure, its highly co-ordinated and planned manner and the way the 
              individuals then went to the Press, hardly seems an appropriate response
               to personal incompatibility.</p>
              <p>It has the hallmark of an action designed to do maximum damage to The
               Reform Party and gain maximum publicity for the political careers of 
              the individuals involved.</p>
              <p>In fact far from being personally intractable there was an offer from
               me on the table to step aside from the SG position and to give Tony Tan
               or whoever wanted it, my full support in that role. I did this as I 
              firmly believe that no individual, no matter what his or her paper 
              qualifications, should be more important than The Party and its stated 
              goals. In fact without the duties of SG I would be free to work on my 
              own campaign.<br> The facts are Tony Tan resigned from CEC on 13th December 2010 and became an ordinary member.</p>
              <p>On 10th February 2011 the CEC, excluding the SG, held a meeting. The 
              Chair invited prospective candidates to attend the meeting. Alec Tok 
              declined to attend. Four other prospective candidates did take up the 
              invitation. Two were allowed in the meeting and for reasons which are 
              not clear the CEC took a vote which resulted in another two being barred
               entry.</p>
              <p>The two who were barred became aggrieved and wrote a letter of complaint.</p>
              <p>The crux of their complaint was:</p>
              <p>ï‚· that they had been invited but then barred by a vote.</p>
              <p>ï‚· That some candidates were allowed in and others kept out.</p>
              <p>ï‚· That they had witnessed, whilst being kept waiting, two prospective
               candidates give packets of money ( Ang Pow) to one of the CEC .</p>
              <p>The vote of the CEC member who received the Ang Pow had an impact on 
              the decision of the meeting as to whether to admit them. They returned 
              home and wrote some angry letters of complaint to The Chair and to the 
              CEC..</p>
              <p>There is no suggestion here that there was any causal connection 
              between the money given and the resulting vote. The SG did not attend 
              that meeting and he did not write the letters of complaint. But the 
              members did raise a legitimate complaint and ask questions that needed 
              answering.</p>
              <p>Subsequently the SG was made aware of the letter of complaint and 
              spoke to the recipient who admitted to receiving $400 from the 
              candidates.</p>
              <p>The SG recommended that the Party deal with the complaint and answer 
              the questions raised. The CEC refused to answer the complaints or to 
              hold an enquiry. The candidates and 4 CEC members resigned.</p>
              <p>I do not see that we can demand transparency and accountability from 
              the government if we do not demand it from ourselves. The Reform Party 
              believes in Change and democracy. Our stated aim is to form an 
              alternative government whether that takes 10, 30 or a hundred years. 
              There is a group within the Party who don’t believe in Change. They feel
               our best route would be to propose only minor tweaks and to aim for an 
              NCMP seat.</p>
              <p>Those of us who go on outreach several times a week have witnessed a 
              sea change on the ground and a Tsunami of democracy is currently 
              sweeping the Middle East and Africa. History will show the Reform 
              Party’s message of change to be the prevailing one.</p>

              <h2 class="posttitle">TONY TAN AND HAZEL POA RESPONDS TO RP’S PRESS RELEASE</h2>
              <p><span class="left">Posted by theonlinecitizen on February 23, 2011</span></p>
              <p>In response to the Press Release from the Secretary-General of the Reform Party, we wish to clarify the facts as follows:</p>
              <p>1)      Tony did give an “Ang Pow” to a CEC member which was meant 
              for his children as it was Chinese New Year.  He did the same thing last
               year during Chinese New Year with exactly the same amount.  There is 
              absolutely no bribery involved.  We gave out a lot of “Ang Pows” during 
              Chinese New Year and had not thought this was something that needed 
              explaining.</p>
              <p>2)      We did not announce our resignations to the media.  The media
               received the information from their sources and sought us out.</p>
              <p>Our stand has been and still is, that we will try our best to 
              minimize any harmful effect to the Reform Party arising from our 
              departure.   As the Secretary-General has pointed out, the Reform Party 
              is a lot larger than the small number of us who have left.  It has many 
              talented and passionate members and has made tremendous progress in its 
              short history.  In the short one year plus that we have been in the 
              Reform Party, although we have our disagreements, we have also seen the 
              SG’s drive and dedication.  Since we cannot achieve agreement, we do not
               wish to be in his way.  The Reform Party has an election to prepare 
              for, and further speculations are not constructive.  If he is elected to
               Parliament, we are sure he will serve his constituents with the same 
              degree of dedication he has shown.</p>

              <h2 class="posttitle">RP EXODUS – Opposition comments</h2>
              <p><span class="left">Posted by theonlinecitizen on February 23, 2011</span></p>
              <p>In the wake of an increasing number of members’ departure from the Reform
               Party, TOC contacted the opposition parties for comments pertaining to 
              this situation.</p>
              <p>Both the Socialist Front (SF) and the National Solidarity Party (NSP) said that they did not have knowledge of the nine members’ plans to leave beforehand.
               Both party leaders namely Mr Chia Ti Lik (SF) and Mr Goh Meng Seng 
              (NSP) also confirmed that none of the nine members approached them 
              before or after their departure from RP.</p>
              <p>When queried if their parties are interested to invite the departed 
              members over to their party now that they are not members of any 
              political parties, they had this to say:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“As I told Straits Times, our NSP policy is that we 
              provide a platform for the opposition movement. Our doors are always 
              open for people to come and go. I believe that they are a group of 
              people who are really interested in public service in the opposition, so
               I wish to see how we can accommodate them. I’ll be happy to hear what 
              their needs are and find a way to work together.”</p>
              <p>- <strong>Goh Meng Seng, NSP party leader</strong></p>
              </blockquote> <blockquote>
              <p><strong>“</strong>I am open to anyone joining the 
              Socialist Front as the party has principles which are established for 
              the good of Singapore. My doors are open.”</p>
              <p>- <strong>Chia Ti Lik, SF party leader</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>Dr Chee Soon Juan</strong> of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) responded to TOC’s interview as such:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>“It is not appropriate for us to comment on the matter at
               this point. We just want to encourage all oppositionists to concentrate
               on the contest against the PAP.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>TOC has also confirmed that Mr Gilbert Goh is now officially with NSP. He just joined the party this week.</p>
