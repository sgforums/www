              <p><strong>Jeyaretnam hits back at former members<br> He accuses them of staging mass walkout for publicity and to damage Reform Party </strong></p>
              <p>By Kor Kian Beng</p>
              <p>Reform Party chief Kenneth Jeyaretnam (second from left) with former CEC
               members (from left) Tony Tan Lay Thiam, James Teo and Justin Ong in 
              2009. At least nine, and by some accounts 'close to 20', members have 
              quit the party. -- ST FILE PHOTO<br> <br> REFORM Party (RP) chief Kenneth Jeyaretnam yesterday hit back at a group
               of former members who resigned recently, accusing them of staging the 
              mass walkout to inflict 'maximum damage' on the party and to gain 
              'maximum publicity' for their own political careers.<br> <br> He also refuted the reasons given by the breakaway group - that they had
               quit the party because of personal differences with him, and that they 
              had found it difficult to work with him.<br> <br> If that was the case, he said, they should have sought mediation with him before quitting.<br> <br> 'The timing of this departure, its highly coordinated and planned manner
               and the way the individuals then went to the press, hardly seems an 
              appropriate response to personal incompatibility,' he said in a press 
              statement.<br> <br> The statement came a day after a mass resignation involving at least nine, and by some accounts 'close to 20', members.<br> <br> They included five members of the party's nine-member central executive 
              committee (CEC): treasurer James Teo, 51; organising secretary Jeisilan 
              Sivalingam, 41; youth wing chief Justin Ong, 25; and CEC members 
              Jeannette Aruldoss, 46, and Tony Tan Lay Thiam, 41, a former government 
              scholarship holder.<br> <br> Others included Mr Tan's wife, Ms Hazel Poa, 41; freelance writer 
              Samantha De Silva, 27; dentist Gan Theng Wei, 35; advertising executive 
              Nicole Seah, 24; and career counsellor Gilbert Goh, 48.<br> <br> Mr Goh had joined the party just two weeks ago.<br> <br> Ms Poa, appointed the spokesman for the group, confirmed the 
              resignations on Monday after she was contacted by The Straits Times.<br> <br> Going by interviews with Mr Jeyaretnam and other party sources, the 
              resignations came in the wake of a CEC meeting on Feb 10. Several 
              non-CEC members who were prospective election candidates were also at 
              the meeting.<br> <br> Mr Jeyaretnam's explanation for the resignations is that he called for 
              an inquiry into the conduct of four members who were at the meeting, 
              which he himself had not attended.<br> <br> He said he had received a complaint from two members at the meeting who 
              said they saw two other members - who were prospective candidates - 
              giving hongbao (red packets) to one of the CEC members.<br> <br> The CEC member who received the money cast a vote that resulted in the 
              two members who complained being barred from entering the meeting.<br> <br> 'There is no suggestion here that there was any causal connection 
              between the money given and the resulting vote,' Mr Jeyaretnam said, but
               he added that the complaint was legitimate.<br> <br> Apart from Mr Jeyaretnam who is the secretary-general, the remaining 
              three CEC members are chairman Tan Tee Seng, and members Mohammed 
              Affendy Abdul Rahim and Andy Zhu.<br> <br> Other sources close to the party, however, say that the resignations 
              stemmed from interpersonal conflicts caused by Mr Jeyaretnam's 
              leadership style and personality.<br> <br> He was said to have criticised members openly at meetings, behaviour which several former RP members said they found offensive.<br> <br> The internal strife nearly boiled over last year when several members 
              threatened to quit. Last-ditch peace talks prevented the exodus then - 
              until this week.<br> <br> But Mr Jeyaretnam yesterday rejected allegations of him being a 'personally intractable' leader.<br> <br> He said he had offered to step down as secretary-general and to 'give Mr
               Tony Tan or whoever wanted it, my full support in that role'.<br> <br> Other party sources, however, said neither Mr Tan nor anyone else wanted the post. Mr Tan himself declined comment.<br> <br> Ms Poa said yesterday that the hongbao given to the unnamed CEC member 
              came from her and her husband Tony, but 'there was absolutely no bribery
               involved'.<br> <br> She said the hongbao was meant for the children of the CEC member who 
              was often unemployed and that this was the second year they had given 
              him hongbao.<br> <br> 'We give out a lot of hongbao during Chinese New Year and had not thought this was something that needed explaining,' she said.<br> <br> Ms Poa also said the breakaway group does not want to comment further on
               what had happened as it wants to minimise damage to the party arising 
              from their departure.<br> <br> She added: 'In the one year that we have been in the party, although we 
              have our disagreements, we have also seen Mr Jeyaretnam's drive and 
              dedication.<br> <br> 'Since we cannot achieve agreement, we do not wish to be in his way. The
               party has an election to prepare for, and further speculations are not 
              constructive.'</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: The mass resignations from the Reform Party (RP), 
              which have cast a dark shadow over RP's preparations for the coming 
              General Election (GE), was due to a tussle for party chief Kenneth 
              Jeyaretnam's position, according to Mr Jeyaretnam himself. <br><br>It 
              also involves a S$400 hong bao (red packet), which was given to a 
              central executive committee (CEC) member who was involved in a decision 
              to bar certain prospective election candidates from attending a meeting.
               <br><br>After media reports emerged of the departures of nine RP 
              members, including five CEC members, Mr Jeyaretnam laid out on 
              Wednesday, the circumstances leading to the resignations in a three-page
               statement in the name of "transparency". <br><br>Contacted by 
              MediaCorp, Ms Hazel Poa, who was among the group who resigned, confirmed
               that her husband, Mr Tony Tan, had indeed given the hong bao to a CEC 
              member.<br><br>But the couple stressed in a statement that "there was absolutely no bribery involved".<br><br>She
               explained that the hong bao was meant for the CEC member's children for
               the Lunar New Year and that the couple had done the same thing last 
              year.<br><br>-</span><a class="path" href="http://www.todayonline.com/">TODAY</a><span>/wk</span></span></p>

              high-flyers with condos, be they be families with good income, be
              they be those who still think Third world country people cannot
              surpass us. They are just blinded by their own world and cannot and
              are unwilling to see, to see what others are suffering, to see who
              is the perpetrator, for the perpetrator ruled over everything,
              whose pact with this perpetrator, we all have.</p>
              <p>To break this contratct would mean the demise of your own
              seeming perfect happy little sanctuary.</p>
              <p>When this conract is broken, when you open your new found eyes
              and see, everything is ugly, the perpetrator is nothing but a devil
              that even nightmares shudder to conjure.</p>
              <p>Be careful, for those who think Third World country people are
              beneath us, their will power will be enough to plunge this country
              to mediocrity. THink carefully and see carefully.</p>

              <p>I don't understand why a person have to serve the Japs under WWII,but if he is being forced to, with families being threaten then yes, he have to serve, but that does not take away what he is doing is still wrong because that will cause other peoples to suffer, ie he becomes a spy for the Jap, reported a few house of anti-Japanese people. The Japs comes and shot up the place including children and old people, the the crime for the traitor still stays with him, inspite of him being forced to be a tritor becuse his families are being hld at gun-point by Japs,</p>
              <p>What being in this world is, simply that individual choices could be made but, the causality that follows is one that people have to worry again. This makes a unified singular thought to unify people hard. The harm inflicted to ownself will make many be a traitor if under duress from the Japs.</p>
              <p>While WWII is a horrible event that leaves many without choices as our rulers then was ineffective British that severely underestimated the Japs.</p>
              <p>We, citizens are by birth rights, effectively and morally in charge of the destiny of this country and we have to vote the people who is using this country for their own selfish means out, if not, events will degenerate and peaceful means will not be effective anymore. At present, we can still try within a certain amount of purpose to right the wrongs, but if past a certain threshold, things will spin out of control, and by that time, even the veil laid by PAP will be gone and the fake sense of sercurity that held things in places will be lost and all gloves will be off.</p>
              <p>Vote the opposition to arrest the projection future unpleaseant events that will take place, vote out PAP now or risk an even worst fate than economic doldrums.</p>
