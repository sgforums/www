              <p>PEOPLE'S Association (PA) chief executive director Yam Ah Mee will step down later this year when he retires from public service.</p>
              <p>   He told The Straits Times last night that his term as a public service leader would expire then, and the move had been planned some time ago.</p>
              <p>   The Public Sector Leadership scheme, which started in 2000, places limits on how long top civil servants can serve in key posts.</p>
              <p>   This ensures a continuous flow of talent to the top.</p>
              <p>   Mr Yam, 56, added that his departure was not related to the recent case involving former MP and Speaker of Parliament Michael Palmer and ex-PA staff member Laura Ong. He was responding to a Shin Min Daily News report which quoted unnamed sources saying his impending exit was linked to the saga.</p>
              <p>   Mr Yam said: "The rumour is totally unfounded. I want to clarify that I am not resigning and my decision to retire from the Administrative Service has nothing to do with the incident.</p>
              <p>   "I can't imagine where they got the information from."</p>
              <p>   On Dec 12, Mr Palmer announced at a media conference that he had quit from his public posts after admitting to an affair with a PA staff. Later the same day, PA identified the woman as Ms Ong. This led to observers asking if employee confidentiality had been breached.</p>
              <p>   It prompted PA deputy chairman Lim Swee Say to say a few days later that the association had thought long and hard on whether to identify Ms Ong to the media.</p>
              <p>   Mr Lim, who is also a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, said then that he had discussed the matter with Mr Yam and other senior staff.</p>
              <p>   Mr Yam said last night that his move from PA was planned before the Palmer-Ong saga broke out. He intends to join the private sector but has not finalised his plans.</p>
              <p>   Prior to joining PA, he was chief executive of the Land Transport Authority, and before that, the Ministry of Transport's deputy secretary.</p>
              <p>   Mr Ang Hak Seng, currently chief executive of the Health Promotion Board, is touted to take over as PA's new head.</p>
              <p>   Mr Yam, who shot to fame in the 2011 General Election as returning officer, will assume the same role for the Punggol East by-election on Jan 26.</p>

              <p>That commenter posted something really interesting: '<em>Even I knew that the WP was going to rebuff the offer. Indeed, we were all already saying so on the SDP page.</em><em style="line-height: 1.231;">There is only one reason and one reason only: We have long acknowledged the WP's of its arrogance towards the other opposition parties.'</em></p>
              <p>Har? Simi WP arrogance? If anything, that comment smacks of downright arrogance.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Sounds more like </span><em style="line-height: 1.231;">'We just shot ourselves in the foot, and we're now in denial mode, trying to convince ourselves and everyone that we're not as dumb as we unintentionally made ourselves to be'.</em></p>
