              <p><strong>By LEE SEOK HWAI<br></strong>TAIWAN CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TAIPEI - Up to 150,000 Taiwanese took to the streets of Taipei
              yesterday in protest against the "useless" administration of
              President Ma Ying-jeou amid lacklustre economic growth and
              misgivings over the island's increasingly cosy ties with China.</p>
              <p>   In the largest anti-government protest since Mr
              Ma's re-election last year, they demanded the resignation of
              Premier Sean Chen, whose Cabinet has proposed or introduced a slew
              of unpopular policies, including a capital gains tax and an
              electricity rate hike.</p>
              <p>   The protesters also demanded a halt to the sale of
              the island's most popular media outlets to pro-China businessmen as
              they made their way through the main roads of Taipei beginning at
              2pm.</p>
              <p>   "Sorry, I didn't win the election, and now the
              people are suffering," opposition leader Tsai Ing-wen, who remains
              popular despite her loss to Mr Ma in last year's presidential
              election, said on a stage in front of the presidential office where
              the protesters gathered at the end of the march.</p>
              <p>   Taiwan's growth slowed to about 0.95 per cent last
              year, according to local think-tank estimates, while unemployment
              remains stuck at over 4 per cent.</p>
              <p>   "President Ma ought to be ashamed for forcing the
              people onto the streets as a result of his incompetence," said Ms
              Tsai. She was the headliner of a who's who list of Democratic
              Progressive Party (DPP) stalwarts, including former premier Frank
              Hsieh and former vice-president Annette Lu, who turned up at the
              rally led by party chairman Su Tseng-chang. Seen as a likely
              candidate for the 2016 election, Mr Su called on Mr Ma to step
              down.</p>
              <p>   "We want a new Cabinet, new lawmakers, and a new
              President," he told the crowd after listing a litany of problems,
              including high unemployment, a growing income gap, rising costs of
              living, and what he called a monopoly of the media by pro-China
              businesses.</p>
              <p>   A consortium of four Taiwanese companies is seeking
              to buy Hong Kong-based Next Media Group's print and television
              business in Taiwan, including the top-selling Apple Daily and Next
              Magazine, for a total of NT$17.5 billion (S$740.6 million).</p>
              <p>   One of the businessmen, Want Want China Times Group
              president Tsai Shao-chung, also owns China Television, satellite
              channel CtiTV and newspapers Want Daily and China Times. All are
              seen as friendly to Beijing.</p>
              <p>   Mr Ma's ruling Kuomintang last Friday rejected an
              anti-monopoly media law proposed by the DPP, calling it hasty and
              ill thought-out.</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Su: "Step by step, the Chinese Communist
              government is invading our island, our households, our brains."</p>
              <p>   Mr Ma, whose popularity has dropped to 13 per cent,
              spent the day marking the 25th anniversary of the death of former
              President Chiang Ching-kuo. He declined to comment on the rally
              when asked.</p>
              <p>   But presidential spokesman Fan Chiang Tai-chi said
              last night that the Ma administration was already working to
              address the issues highlighted at the protest. He called on the
              opposition to stop the "internal struggle" and offer constructive
              solutions instead.</p>

              <p><strong>By JEREMY AU YONG<br></strong>ASSISTANT POLITICAL EDITOR</p>
              <p><br>AS OF yesterday afternoon, less than 24 hours before Nomination Day, all signs still pointed to the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) becoming one corner of a five-cornered fight in Punggol East.</p>
              <p>   Just hours earlier, it had sent a representative to the Elections Department to pick up political donation certificates. And for one week prior, it went through all the motions of a party intending to contest. It did a walkabout, distributed fliers, called press conferences, and even went through the normal dance with the media where it would hint but not confirm its choice of candidate.</p>
              <p>   Even after the Workers' Party (WP) introduced Ms Lee Li Lian as its candidate, making it plain that there would be no grand opposition compromise, SDP maintained it was staying in the race.</p>
              <p>   Then, just after 4pm yesterday, when everyone was waiting to hear whom it would field, it said, well, no one. In effect, the SDP stepped up to the precipice, stared down the abyss, and blinked. In so doing, it may have done real damage to its reputation. No amount of public relations spin can help a party making a full U-turn in one week come out looking like a hero.</p>
              <p>   Questions have been raised about its credibility, given the way it had promoted its candidates, saying it would back down only after seeing whom the WP fielded. So having done so, did it find its own candidates wanting?</p>
              <p>   Yet, this climb-down might be the best option it had, given the circumstances. This was the common sense option and SDP deserves some credit for having the wisdom to know when to fold.</p>
              <p>   Despite the embarrassment it has already suffered online, it can reclaim some goodwill from opposition supporters who all along wanted to see a straight People's Action Party-Opposition contest.</p>
              <p>   In contrast, if it had gone ahead to fight, it would be making a bold claim that it could usurp the WP's hold in a ward where WP's candidate had previously gained 41 per cent of the vote.</p>
              <p>   Netizens had been urging SDP to stay out of the race. The call grew more critical when the party then made the mistake of announcing a radical "joint campaign" proposal. It suggested that the SDP and WP back a single SDP candidate. Then, if the candidate won, WP could run the town council, while the SDP would take up the seat in Parliament.</p>
              <p>   The move was roundly dismissed, prompting Dr Chee Soon Juan to say a day later that the plan was "misinterpreted".</p>
              <p>   It thus headed into Nomination Day being seen in some quarters as a spoiler running a troubled campaign. Its chances of doing well had narrowed even before it introduced a candidate. And so it did the sensible thing by not introducing one.</p>
              <p>   Consider if it chose a different path: If the party ended up doing poorly and also diluting enough of the opposition vote to give the PAP an easy win, its reputation would have taken a far bigger hit.</p>
              <p>   Not only would it draw the ire of opposition supporters, but it would also lose whatever standing it had among opposition parties. Its strength at the next opposition pow-wow would be severely diminished with the WP having evidence that it can come up against SDP anywhere and trounce it. In the end, Punggol East was never SDP's battle. By walking away, it can return to fight another day.</p>

              some quarters as a spoiler running a troubled campaign. Its chances
              of doing well had narrowed even before it introduced a candidate.
              And so it did the sensible thing by not introducing one.</p>
              <p>   Consider if it chose a different path: If the party
              ended up doing poorly and also diluting enough of the opposition
              vote to give the PAP an easy win, its reputation would have taken a
              far bigger hit.</p>
              <p>   Not only would it draw the ire of opposition
              supporters, but it would also lose whatever standing it had among
              opposition parties. Its strength at the next opposition pow-wow
              would be severely diminished with the WP having evidence that it
              can come up against SDP anywhere and trounce it. In the end,
              Punggol East was never SDP's battle. By walking away, it can return
              to fight another day.</p>
