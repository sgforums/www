              SINGAPORE: Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean has urged voters of Punggol East to compare what the People's Action Party's (PAP's) candidate has to offer against what the other candidates in the by-election have for the ward.
              
              Mr Teo said PAP's Dr Koh Poh Koon will work hard for residents and deliver the plans he has in mind to make Punggol East a better place.
              
              Mr Teo, who was speaking to reporters after meeting parents and children at a kindergarten in Block 124, Rivervale, on Tuesday morning, was also asked for his views on how the campaign is shaping up.
              
              He described it as a keenly-contested campaign, which Dr Koh and the PAP are taking very seriously.
              
              Mr Teo said the party will reach out to every voter and wants to ensure that it serves residents well.

              A TRIBUTE TO A SMALL GUY BY ANDREW LOH
              
              My little tribute to the â€œsmallâ€� guy whom everyone seems to be making fun of.
               
              I donâ€™t know Desmond Lim very well, although I did interview him for GE 2011 at his office. What I do know is that he gave 14 years of his time to the Potong Pasir Town Council (PPTC), and to the Singapore Peopleâ€™s Party (SPP).
               
              At PPTC, as I understand it, he was more or less Chiamâ€™s right-hand man. Or at least he was very much involved in the running of the TC.
               
              â€œThose who know me know that over the past 14 years,â€� Desmond once said, â€œI have devoted all the time, energy and money to working for the Potong Pasir Town Council and the Peopleâ€™s Party. After my office hours, on public holidays and weekends, I would be working for them. I was even on call to help solve problems that happened during the wee hours of the night. All these I did without any incentives and rewards.â€�
               
              14 years is a long time. Many of us would not even give 14 minutes to causes we say we believe in.
               
              And during those 14 years, with contribution from people like Desmond, Chiam â€“ and by extension, the SPP and the opposition â€“ could keep their presence in Parliament.
               
              So, donâ€™t diss Desmond. He has every right to contest the by-election. He may not speak as well as you, or be as politically astute as you feel he should be, but it is quite evident â€“ from his years of work â€“ that he does want to serve and indeed he has.
               
              And for that, he deserves encouragement, not ridicule â€“ for he has played more of a part in keeping the opposition going than many of us who are laughing at him.

              <p>I have to disagree with the last line written by Andrew Loh:</p>
              <p><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"><em>And for that, he deserves encouragement, not ridicule – for he has played more of a part in keeping the opposition going than many of us who are laughing at him.</em></span></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p>If he really wants to keep the opposition cause alive, he should stay out of this by-election. Any political observer worth his salt knows that he is almost certain to lose heavily, along with his deposit.</p>
              <p>As KB and I have pointed out, assuming that he's thinking rationally, the only reason he has for running in this by-election is to trip up WP. Surely he knows that a strong WP would hurt his party's chances more than a strong PAP, and so a 16k investment is cheap in the long run if WP loses. How can it be said that he is keeping the opposition going when he is actively trying to wreck it?</p>
              <p>Heck, if he really wants to further his own cause, he should have signed up for public speaking classes before posting those incoherent and unintentionally-funny videos.</p>
              <p>It doesn't matter if your policies are sound or you have determination in spades.... if you can't make people understand what you're talking about, or you make people laugh at you, no one is going to take you seriously.</p>
