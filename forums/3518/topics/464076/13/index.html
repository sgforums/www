              <p>REPORT: <strong>ESTHER NG, KOH HUI THENG<br>and AUDREY TAN</strong></p>
              <p><br>IN A span of 20 months, Singapore will have seen four elections, starting with the General Election in May 2011, the President Election a few months later in August, the Hougang by-election on last May and now the Punggol East by-election.</p>
              <p>   This works out to an election every five months.</p>
              <p>   Municipal issues concerning Punggol East residents are somewhat the same as in the Hougang by-election: amenities, cleanliness, transport. (See report on page 6.)</p>
              <p>   On the national front, it's also the cost of living, transport, population growth, jobs, foreign workers - the same issues raised during the General Election.</p>
              <p>   Like Hougang residents, Punggol East voters will be voting for the third time.</p>
              <p>   Might they be tired of elections?</p>
              <p>   "No, I'm not tired. It is our job to do this and their job to help us. Without us they wouldn't know what's going on. This is the part we have to play, there is nothing to be tired of," said resident Muhammad Yazid, 22, who moved into Punggol East five months ago.</p>
              <p>   "It's not every day that things happen so it's not something to complain about. The campaigns and rallies are just the standard process of'elections," said Mr Yazid, a technician.</p>
              <p>   Another Punggol resident Dennis Tan, 60, who is self-employed and a resident of Punggol East for 14 years, said: "We don't' tired at all. We're happy. Happy that we have another choice."</p>
              <p>   A resident who declined to be named said it was "a bit tiring" to vote three times within two years, but admitted that in spite of the inconveniences, the by-election was something his family saw as a chance to tell politicians what they wanted in their estate.</p>
              <p>   Academics The New Paper interviewed said election fatigue would also depend on whether the residents preferred the status quo or wanted change.</p>
              <p>   Said sociologist Tan Ern Ser, an associate professor at National University of Singapore (NUS), it would be a "chore" for those who are quite happy with the status quo.</p>
              <p>   However, for those who are hoping for a change of party, or to put some pressure on the ruling party, having another election means another chance at pushing for their preferred party or voicing their concerns, said Prof Tan.</p>
              <p>   NUS political science lecturer Bilveer Singh said the electorate stands to gain a lot when parties come round promising to do a lot for them.</p>
              <p>   Indeed, Punggol East resident Winston Sanchez, 57, a store receiver, said that he looked forward to what the parties had to offer.</p>
              <p>   He said: "If there's something we are not happy about, we can get someone who can give us a better deal.</p>
              <p>   "I'm happy with the by-election because hopefully something will change. Because only when something like that happens, they will open their eyes and make changes," he said.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: large;">Expensive</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   But apart from Punggol residents, are Singaporeans as a whole suffering from election fatigue?</p>
              <p>   For the. civil servants and government agencies, yes, and it is expensive for the Government to organise," said Prof Singh.</p>
              <p>   However, Prof Singh who lives in the adjoining precinct of Punggol, said that there was interest in the by-election among Singaporeans in general.</p>
              <p>Punggol East maybe tucked in one corner of the island, but Singaporeans as a whole are talking about the by-election, said political observer Mano Sabnani.</p>
              <p>   "Just the other day when I was taking the train, I overhead two young people talking about the by-election.</p>
              <p>   "I'm not sure if they were Punggol East residents, but I would say that ever since the last General Election, there's been heightened interest in politics among Singaporeans," he Said.</p>
              <p>   However, political commentator Eugene Tan, a law lecturer from the Singapore Management University said election fatigue could have set in among some of the electorate as the "same issues (from the last General Election) were carried forward and there seems to be no change in direction by the PAP and WP".</p>
              <p>   These issues were cost of living, income gap and immigration, he said</p>
              <p>   Former National Solidarity Party's secretary-general Goh Meng Seng also agreed that these same issues have "been recycled" in this by-election.</p>
              <p>   Said Mr Goh: "Unless candidates are creative enough to explore new issues, the Punggol East by-election will be really boring."</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>REPORT: <strong>ELIZABETH LAW</strong></p>
              <p><br>WHAT has a "sheikh" (right) on a three-wheeled motorcycle and a bunch of disappearing documents have in common?</p>
              <p>   Nomination Day, believe it or not.</p>
              <p>   They were part of a grin-inducing sideshow yesterday by two wannabe candidates before the serious business of nominating the candidates for the Punggol East by-election could begin.</p>
              <p>   Shortly after 10.30am, a loud chugging sound could be heard, and a three-wheeled scooter appeared along Rivervale Link soon after.</p>
              <p>   Hardly anyone caught it the first time, but the rider went past two more times - just in case anyone missed his dramatic entrance.</p>
              <p>   On the bike was a man in a long white robe and a sheikh's headscarf.</p>
              <p>   The storage compartments on the sides of his scooter had the word "Police" on it and a red warning siren was perched between the handles.</p>
              <p>   His appearance came as no surprise to media gathered outside North Vista Secondary School.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-large;">Parrot man</span></p>
              <p>   It was businessman Zeng Guoyuan, 59, better known as "parrot man" at previous election events.</p>
              <p>   This time, he ditched the bird for the headgear.</p>
              <p>   Mr Zeng failed to stand in last year's Hougang by-election and the 2011 General Election, but was at the nomination centre to submit his papers for the Punggol East by-election.</p>
              <p>   Walking into the school alone at about 11 am, he said he had left his parrot at home. He then went into the school hall to submit his nomination papers.</p>
              <p>   Less than 20 minutes later, he came out the same way, wearing a bib in protest. He said election officials had rejected his application because of a "past incident", but did not say what it was, adding that to compete would be a<br>waste of money.</p>
              <p>   "It'll be $14,500 gone, immediately," he said, taking out the cash in $1,000 bills to show the media.</p>
              <p>   Another candidate wannabe was also unable to stand for election because of paperwork.</p>
              <p>   Private tutor Ooi Boon Ewe, 71, was the first to make his way into the school assembly hall at about 10.45am.</p>
              <p>   He has tried to contest in every presidential election since 1999, and also unsuccessfully tried to contest in the last three general elections.</p>
              <p>   But he left in a huff when officials said he could not stand without a donation certificate, which he said had "gone missing".</p>
              <p>   "It's all in my house, someone in the house. Someone in the house must have kept it, doesn't want me to be a candidate," he said at a bus stop outside the school.</p>
              <p>   He initially blamed his wife for hiding the document because he claimed she did not want him to stand, but he tried to retract his statement later in the evening when The New Paper spoke to him at home.</p>
              <p>   Unlike the two men, the four confirmed candidates had their paperWork all in order.</p>
              <p>   Dr Koh Poh Koon of the People's Action Party (PAP) was the first to arrive just after 11 am, when nomination officially started. He was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean and a group of about 30 supporters.</p>
              <p>   There was a round of applause from the group before Dr Koh, Mr Teo and a handful of supporters entered the nomination centre.</p>
              <p>   Mr Desmond Lim of the Singapore Democratic Alliance was the next to approach the school, but he waited at the gates for about 15 minutes.</p>
              <p>   When asked if he had enough people, he said he had enough people, but was waiting for two more people "out of respect".</p>
              <p>   Candidates filing their nomination papers had to have at least six supporting names, including the proposer, seconder and at least 4 assentors.</p>
              <p>   Mr Lim was quickly followed by Mr Kenneth Jeyaretnam of the Reform Party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: x-large;">Chanting</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   The last to arrive was Workers' Party (WP) candidate Lee Li Lian, accompanied by party chairman Sylvia Lim.</p>
              <p>   A group of about 50 supporters followed and could be heard chanting the party's name as Ms Lee entered the school compound.</p>
              <p>   Meanwhile, party supporters had gathered in the school field, with the WP ones being the most vocal. They alternated between chanting the party name and singing songs in Hokkien.</p>
              <p>   As the scorching afternoon sun beat down, one woman fainted.</p>
              <p>   Pasir Ris GRC MP Dr Janil Puthucheary went to the woman's assistance.</p>
              <p>   He said: "I saw a group of people standing around so I went over together with Alex Yam (Chua Chu Kang GRC MP) and we assisted where we could.</p>
              <p>   "When she got better, we took her outside together with about four to five of her friends, where her father came to pick her up," he said.</p>
              <p>   Dr Puthucheary said the heat must have got a bit too much for her to bear, adding. that she was "quite young".</p>
              <p>   The candidates have until next Thursday to campaign before Punggol East goes to the polls on Jan 26.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 48pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Rising costs worry residents</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: x-large;">Main concerns include amenities, transport and cleanliness</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>REPORTS: <strong>KOH HOI THENG</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DEPENDING on the candidate you speak to, it's either democracy that needs fixing or Rivervale Plaza. Reform Party's (RP) Kenneth Jeyqaretnam and Workers' Party (WP) Lee Li Lian have indicated they will be campaignirfg on national issues.</p>
              <p>   But Dr Koh Poh Koon of the People's Action Party (PAP) and Mr Desmond Lim of the Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) are focusing on municipal issues.</p>
              <p>   What's on the minds of the Punggol East residents?</p>
              <p>   The New Paper interviewed residents last week to get a sense of the hot-button issues in the ward.</p>
              <p>   Engineer Sham Mohd Noor, like many of the 122 residents interviewed, said cost of living is No. 1.</p>
              <p>   "The cost of living is getting very high, even transport (fares) are going up. Everything goes up, but never comes down," he lamented.</p>
              <p>   But Mr Sham said that doesn't mean ruling out local issues too.</p>
              <p>   "Both national and municipal issues are important What happens on the national level, for example, living costs, will affect my family expenses.</p>
              <p>   "Immediate issues like neighbours' noise also affect our environment So all issues, whether national or municipal, have to be addressed," he added.</p>
              <p>   Be they national or local, the lines are blurred, said political commentator Eugene Tan. After all, broad national issues have very local effects.</p>
              <p>   "Things like costs of living are very real. The impact of higher grocery prices and electricity bills is more immediate and people feel the pinch."</p>
              <p>   Added Prof Tan, a Nominated MP and Singapore Management University law lecturer: "When you're in the sandWiched group that's aspiring to move up the socio-economic ladder and are ineligible for financial assistance that the bottom 20 per cent get, you'll feel it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: large;">Types of homes</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Six in 10 homes in the ward comprise five-room and executive HDB flats, as well as private apartments.</p>
              <p>   Most of the flats today were built after the PAP's General Election win in 1997, The Straits Times reported.</p>
              <p>   Punggol East was part of the Pasir Ris-Punggol Group Representation Constituency before the 2011 General Election.</p>
              <p>   Real estate prices in the young estate have gone up since then as demand rises.</p>
              <p>   A four-room build-to-order flat sold for around $250,000 in the early days, said Mr Lee Sze Teek, senior manager for training, research and consultancy at property firm Dennis Wee Group.</p>
              <p>   In the last quarter last year, the transacred price for a four-room resale flat was between $400,000 and $500,000, an increase that "is in line with HDB resale price index change", he added.</p>
              <p>   Private home owners have also seen quite a "substantial price increase" for their property, said Mr Alan Cheong, senior director of research and consultancy at Savills Singapore.</p>
              <p>   The average transaction was between $600 and $700 psf five years ago. Today, property near the MRT station can command up to $1,000 psf, while those further away fetch about $850 psf.</p>
              <p>   Mr Sham lives in a five-room Rivervale flat with his wife, a designer, and three girls. The family has a maid.</p>
              <p>   He bought the flat for about $250,000 in 1998. But Mr Sham has no plans of cashing in on his profitable real estate. He said: "I'm comfortable living here. My workplace and my daughter's school are nearby. I also don't want to take up a loan (to service the purchase of a new flat)."</p>
              <p>   Still, he feels squeezed by rising prices.</p>
              <p>   Mr Sham and his wife, a dual-income couple, spend at least $3,000 on essentials like food, transport and education. That's a quarter of their $12,000 monthly income.</p>
              <p>   Resident S. Toh, who is in her 50s, took issue with high health-care costs. The mother of four said she ended up paying $150 when her three children suffered gastric flu in November.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; color: #ff0000; font-size: large;">Dusty</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Clinic assistant Pauline Jee, 41, was upset at Rivervale Plaza's slow upgrading works.</p>
              <p>   "The construction is taking so long and it makes the whole area very dusty. As a result, my mother-in-law doesn't want to go to the market there any more," the mother of three said.</p>
              <p>   On Sunday, Dr Poh said upgrading works at the plaza will be ramped up after Chinese New Year.</p>
              <p>   Madam Tee also pointed to the lack of amenities like education centres and playgroups for young children.</p>
              <p>   PAP's Dr Koh and RP's Mr Jeyaretnam have said they would raise these concerns.</p>
              <p>   Calling the electorate more educated, more vocal and more demanding, Prof Tan said voters would be on the lookout for viable alternatives, "regardless of whether it's the ruling party or opposition".</p>
              <p>   Added Institute of Policy Studies' senior research fellow Gillian Koh: "As a voter, I would be looking for political leaders with courage.</p>
              <p>   "They need to explain how the different challenges listed play out against each other, and how there just aren't easy answers that fix all of them at the same time."</p>
              <p>   Mr Sham and the 31,000-plus voters in Punggol East will make their opinions known when they go to the polls on Jan 26.</p>
