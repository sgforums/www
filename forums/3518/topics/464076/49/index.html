            <div class='col-md body'>Dr Koh Poh Koon, the former candidate for PE by-election, yeap I remember him clearly. I had stood next to him during the scoping procedure. Well, he was cool headed not anxious and bad tempered unlike some other surgeons I knew of. He was quite new back then and he just came out on his own to practise his medical profession. During the endoscoping procedure, while at the sametime observing for any possible POLIP in the intestines I had realised that he had some difficulties in moving in the scope tube within the colons all the way to the end. So, I had asked him whether he needed some assistance in applying some pressure on the abdomen of the patient to press down the scope and refrained it from tangling within the patient's colon. Initially, he had refused and after awhile he requested me to help him to apply pressure on the patient's abdomen. After the scoping procedure, he thanked me and I smiled at him. In my opinion, as a surgeon, he will make a good doctor...as a politician...I really don't know for sure. I had assisted him a couple times before I left.</div>

              I have thought that both RP and SDA would have split the votes to the opposition. Indeed, I was wrong. The desire for a two corner fight was far greater than I expected.

              Well, looking at the final result of the by-election in PE, even after totalling up their number of votes and should it go to PAP, WP candidate would have won too. However, what most important was RP and SDA presence prior to polling day. They have in a very special way brought up the right questions to the residents of PE about their power to vote and change the outcome. RP and SDA presence had make a great difference to the minds of the PE residents. Without their presence, the by-election result could have been quite different I think. At the end, PE residents have to choose the strongest opposition party to overcome the possibility of PAP winning the by-election. Yeah, I really appreciate the presence of RP and SDA in PE by-election.

                  Well, looking at the final result of the by-election in PE, even
                  after totalling up their number of votes and should it go to PAP,
                  WP candidate would have won too. However, what most important was
                  RP and SDA presence prior to polling day. They have in a very
                  special way brought up the right questions to the residents of PE
                  about their power to vote and change the outcome. RP and SDA
                  presence had make a great difference to the minds of the PE
                  residents. Without their presence, the by-election result could
                  have been quite different I think. At the end, PE residents have to
                  choose the strongest opposition party to overcome the possibility
                  of PAP winning the by-election. Yeah, I really appreciate the
                  presence of RP and SDA in PE by-election.</p>

              Someday CSJ would make a good MP in other constituency. He is good as his words but its a matter of time.....like perhaps when in 2021 GE...He had decided to back off knowing that other opposition parties like RP and SDA were definitely going to contest...I'm sure leaders of opposition parties had spoken to one another before nomination day closed. Three oppositon parties contesting would have been more than enough to right the minds of PE residents.

At some point of time, well, you can say that I wasn't in Singapore when that incident took place and I was out of touch of Singapore political news. Well, with that said, how about KJ from RP, who betrayed who? WP betrayed KJ or KJ betrayed WP. The way I see it, KJ would have been a good asset to WP too.

              <p>and by his actions here in this by-elections, attempting to use his father's name and memory to garner votes, his blatant attempt to torpedo the chances of WP, the way he speaks down on people and also the flippant way he dismisses everything no matter what was brought to him says a lot..</p>
              <p>besides, nearer to home where i live, he was told to bugger off by the residents when he attempted to hijack a residents' meeting about an enbloc in Clementi for his own political purposes during the general elections...</p>
              <p>gut feeling is that i can't trust him... and if he attempted to destroy the WP chances by throwing away the deposit, it shows that he's not constructive but destructive in order to further his personal ambitions... that's not good for anyone much less the country</p>
