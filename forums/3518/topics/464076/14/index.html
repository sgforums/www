He added that he later received another "credible threat of violence".<br><br>He said the threats were posted publicly on <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://www.facebook.com/kjeyaretnamRP">his Facebook page</a> in recent days since Nomination Day on Wednesday, as well as directed at him <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://twitter.com/KenJeyaretnam">on Twitter</a>, but have since been taken down.<br><br>"It's caused considerable distress to my son," he added. <br><br>During the 11-minute standing interview, Jeyaretnam also clarified that these threats issued to him and his family are separate from an incident of cyber-bullying that he said was linked to his son's Twitter account. To this, he said police in London are investigating the incident, and requested that the public refrain from "escalating" the incident further.<br><br>After spending several hours at the Sengkang Neighbourhood Police Centre earlier on Friday, Jeyaretnam said he did not want to speculate who the people behind the threats to him and his family were, but noted that "there obviously are certain people who... intended to disrupt our campaign".<br><br>He said he and his party continues to be "very focused" on his campaign, however. <br><br>"We are very focused... and we are confident that our expertise on economic issues at the national level, plus our knowledge of the grassroots and local issues makes us the best-placed among the four candidates," he said.<br><br>Jeyaretnam first made mention to the threats during a walkabout at Rivervale Mall on Thursday, when he told reporters that his 16-year-old son, Jared, received "a threat" via Twitter.<br><br>"We have received tantamount to death threats and there are comments attacking my son and even that something awful will happen to my wife and son on Facebook and Twitter,” he said.<br><br>“I’m not worried. These are people who scared to come out from behind their keyboards but it has been very upsetting to my son,” he added.<br><br>When asked for further details of the nature of these threats, the 53-year-old former hedge fund manager said they were “general threats to cause harm to the family.”</p>

Singapore</em> saw a few tweets exchanged between <a style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%40smrtsg&amp;src=typd">Twitter handle @smrtsg</a> and Jared, who just turned 16 earlier this week. <br><br>These were subsequently clarified to possibly be linked to the incidence of "cyber-bullying" referred to by Jeyaretnam in his statement on Friday evening.<br><br>In one tweet dated 16 Jan, @smrtsg tweeted and called Jared a "bad ass" like his "bankrupted grandfather" only "slightly fairer and less hairy" -- a reference to JB Jeyaretnam, who was previously the Workers’ Party leader until 2001 and was the first opposition politician to gain a seat in Parliament in 1981.<br><br>Another tweet by the same handle a day earlier also wished Jared "happy birthday" but also said "don't be like your father". The elder Jeyaretnam then interjected, accusing @smrtsg of harassing his son. <br><br>It's not clear who is behind @smrtsg but on its profile page, <a class="account-group js-user-profile-link" style="color: #5d4370;" href="https://twitter.com/smrtsg">SMRT (Feedback) ‏</a><span class="username js-action-profile-name"><br><br>@smrtsg</span> described itself as a "parody, role-playing account" and "all tweets posted by us should not be taken seriously or as a factual reference". <br><br>In a Facebook post on Tuesday, Jared acknowledged the Twitter comments and posted a screencap of the conversation with the caption, "Mad trolls in Singapore are <span class="userContent">trying to bring the fight to me... lol".</span><br><br>In response to <em>Yahoo! Singapore</em>'s request for comment to Jeyaretnam considering filing a police report, @smrtsg said via Twitter, "We know the law so we found his claim hilarious and a waste of time".<br><br>On claims the wife and son are very upset, the response was: "It's just '<em>wayang</em>'. His son replied to us and he didn't seem upset. It's not gonna stop us from trolling about him nonetheless."<br><br>The elder Jeyaretnam, who is running under the campaign slogan "No more broken promises", has been the subject of online criticism from those who believe he will split the opposition votes come Polling Day on 26 Jan.<br><br>Meanwhile, the party says it's coming up with a five-year plan for Punggol East. This includes improving facilities and setting up a free legal clinic. <br><br>Jeyaretnam said he also received feedback bus services in the area were poor and that access to the LRT stations need to be improved. He did not reveal how much the five-year plan will cost and that details are being worked out at the moment.<strong><br><br>RP apology</strong><br><br>RP also apologised on its official Facebook page on Thursday for the “recent tone of posts”.  <br><br>The party had earlier criticised PAP candidate Dr Koh Poh Koon for walking past Jeyaretnam while he was being interviewed on Wednesday, without acknowledging his by-election opponent.<br><br>However, while Jeyaretnam was talking to reporters at the foodcourt at Rivervale Mall on Thursday afternoon, Dr Koh dropped by to have lunch after his own walkabout in the area.<br><br>Both men shook hands.</p>

              PM Lee, in his first walkabout in Punggol East since by-elections
              were announced, said voters need to bear this in mind when they go
              to polls. <br>
              <br>
              "Ultimately, choose the person who can serve you well in Punggol
              East and also broadly in Singapore," he said to reporters after a
              short 15-minute walkabout around Rivervale Plaza.<br>

              he wins come Polling Day next Saturday.<br>
              <br>
              "But I told him his first priority is to fight and win in PE, win
              the support and trust of residents," said PM Lee, who was
              accompanied by Acting Minister for Social and Family Development
              Chan Chun Sing and other party members. <br>
              <br>
              "When he is ready, and when I judge he is ready... I will be
              appointing him to a suitable political office but we will decide
              what, later on." <br>
              <br>
              Dr Koh did not accompany him for the walkabout as he was meeting
              residents elsewhere in the area, but both met earlier in the
              morning during a breakfast meeting at the PAP Punggol East
              education centre.<br>
              <br>
              PM Lee also assured residents that the upgrading works at the
              much-troubled Rivervale Plaza, which has beset by construction
              delays after the main contractor went bust, will be done by the
              middle of the year.</div>
