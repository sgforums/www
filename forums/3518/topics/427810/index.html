I can't imagine the pain of losing one's child at that age. <br><br>However, I am struck by the contrast and similarity between these 2 cases. In one case, BG Yeo has a young son diagnosed with leukemia, and the Sohs also have a young daughter diagnosed with leukemia too. One family carries on life with no noticeable financial burden, and the other family is in effect bankrupt and chased after by creditors and have to sell their home.<br><br>BG Yeo is a wealthy man, we all know this, and d</span>e<span style="color: #1d1b11;">spite the ability to get cheap medical care in </span>S<span style="color: #1d1b11;">ingapore for his son (such as $8 heart bypass surgeries available only to ministers like him), he chooses to send his entire family (all 5 of them) to Memphis Tennessee to live there for 9 months while his son undergoes medical treatment there. I am not even going to guess what the cost is. And while there, he renovates his house into a sterile environment for his son, yet another $1 million spend there easily. <br><br>The heartlanders Soh in the meantime, using </span>S<span style="color: #1d1b11;">ingapore doctors and hospital (because the govt. tells them they are best in medical field in the region) runs up a $400K medical bill, and still the daughter dies. I guess that BG Yeo did not get the memo that he was already living in the country that has the bestest facilities and doctors, and decided to take his son to the US. The S</span>o<span style="color: #1d1b11;">hs have spend literally every dollar they have to save their daughter, just like any forumer reading this would have done. They have even sold their home and yet its not enough to cover the bills. They will be made bankrupt soon. And no govt. agency, hospital or doctor can or is willing to save them. Even the evil doctor cut her bill in half and then to zero for the Sultan of Brunei's sister. But not applicable if you are just a normal citizen.<br><br>Sad to say, in </span>S<span style="color: #1d1b11;">ingapore, this is not the exceptional case at all. From personal experience, I have friends and relatives that have incurred 6 figure medical bills despite all the plethora of supposed insurance, and financial aid plans available according to the PAP. Wooden Goh used to say repeatedly that no one will be left behind in S'pore's economic success. I beg to differ, many people <em>are</em> being left behind and they are not on the lower spectrum either. They are regular people, not poorly educated or jobless. <br><br>What happened to the principle that all will receive the same medical care? Since when has it been OK for a servant of the people like BG Yeo to say local medicine is not good enough, I go to the US? If the Sohs could afford it, I am sure they would have gone to Memphis too, and maybe the BG and the Sohs could have been neighbours.<br><br>Herein lies <span style="color: #ff0000;">the deception</span> that Khaw, Mah and the other have played on the </span>S<span style="color: #1d1b11;">ingapore people.</span><br><span style="color: #1d1b11;"><br>1) <span style="color: #ff0000;">health care is affordable.</span> No it's not, ask the Sohs and thousands like them.<br>2) <span style="color: #ff0000;">U can monetize your flat for your retirement.</span> Not if you or your spouse or child has a serious illness, in which case, u will do just like the Sohs and sell your flat to pay for the medical costs. What are the odds that a serious illness will happen to you or someone in your family before the age of 65 yr?. Its high, so good luck to you if you are relying on your flat to fund your retirement.<br><br>What does it say about a country with hundreds of billions $ in reserve, multi million dollar ministers and politicians, shiny new high rise, fantastic govt. buildings, politicians who go overseas for medical treatment and </span>F<span style="color: #1d1b11;">rench cooking, and all this cannot save one little girl's family from financial ruin. If you still think u want to vote for the PAP, u have rocks in your brain. Just remember, </span><span style="color: #c00000;">TODAY IT WAS THE SOHS, TOMORROW, IT COULD BE YOUR FAMILY.</span><span style="color: #1d1b11;"> Just like that.</span></span><br></span><span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI','sans-serif'; color: #1d1b11;" lang="EN-US"><br></span></strong></strong></strong></p>
