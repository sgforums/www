              <p>In the 1970s, our forefathers have done the right thing for us -- vote out those ministers and MPs who did not benefit the people.  As a result of this good karma, we have a prosperous Singapore.  Now in 2011, are you going to selfishly think of your own housing value and upgrading, or are you going to think of your children's future?  If you think of your children's future, then you should make sure bad ministers and MPs are not voted back into the parliament.  Please do Singapore a favor and make sure ministers like Mah Bow Tan do not get back into parliament and continue to damage you and me.</p>
              <p>It is not about how strong the opposition team in your GRC is.  It is not about whether you will get your covered walkway.  If you have to walk frustrated every day, even the covered walkway will not make you happier.  It is ALL about making sure bad ministers and MPs do not return to parliament to harm people.  Remember this!  Please!</p>
