              <h4>Dr Puthucheary, who was born in Malaysia, has lived here since 2001 and became a citizen in 2008. His father is a founding member of the PAP who defected to form the opposition Barisan Sosialis. -- ST PHOTO: CAROLINE CHIA</h4>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DR JANIL Puthucheary become a Singapore citizen just three years ago but believes his newly-minted status is not an obstacle to how he can continue to contribute here.</p>
              <p>Turning around a question put to him on whether he was Singaporean enough to represent voters, he said: 'The question is not where we come from. The question is who is going to be prepared to stay and fight and make this country what it will be, what it can be. I'm that person. I'm staying, fighting, I'm fully invested.'</p>
              <p>The senior consultant at the Children's Intensive Care Unit at KK Women's and Children's Hospital, made clear in comments on Monday that the decision to take up citizenship was not by accident.</p>
              <p>Multiculturalism and meritocracy were major factors, said Dr Puthucheary, 38.</p>
              <p>Born in Malaysia, he attended secondary school in Britain. After graduating from the medical faculty of the Queen's University in Ireland, he pursued post-graduate training in Belfast, London and Sydney, before settling here in 2001.</p>
              <p>'Ours is not a perfect society. We have not and may never reach the ideals that we're aiming for. But I passionately believe that we are far further along that road than any other place that I can think of,' he said, noting the drive here to integrate communities further.</p>

              <p>'No, not at all. Certainly my father never expressed any anger or rancour so I could not express any anger for that. It was something that... happened in the long history that we were told about. It wasn't something that we lived with or we knew of ourselves.'</p>
              </li>
              <li><em>Can Singapore have a two-party system of government?</em>
              <p>'It's the job of the PAP to be elected as often as possible and get as many of its candidates in Parliament. Whether there's a viable two-party system depends on what else is put up for Singaporeans to choose from.'<br><br>Source:<a rel="nofollow"><br>http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_647803.html</a></p>
