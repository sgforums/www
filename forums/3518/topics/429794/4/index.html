              <p>The GRC System was always designed to shackle and hinder the opposition from having any meaningful contest. Through repeated gerrymandering, this system ensures the opposition cannot have any meaningful say in the parliament regardless of the overall votes they secure because it does not work on a proportional representation basis. If it wasn't meant to ensure total fascist dominance, it was in place to at least ensure the erosion of its parliamentary presence was slowed.</p>
              <p>However, the significance of this win is vital - as was proven when JBJ took down Anson in 1981, the fascist's complete hegemony was over. Hopefully, this signals the start of something similar for other GRC's in the years ahead. Doing it again is always easier than doing it the first time.</p>
              <p>More importantly, this is sweet revenge for Francis Seow (Eunos in 1988), Mohamed Jufrie (Eunos in 1991), Tang Liang Hong and JBJ (Cheng San in 1997) - all running under WP - who all came within a whisker of winning a GRC albeit running against a bunch of thugs who campaigned on the basis of skullduggery, plain deception and intimidation in an era long before alternative sources of news were available as freely as they're today.</p>
              <p>More importantly, a critical factor that is showing encouraging signs is the perpetual increase of popular votes for the opposition. While this is not necessarily translated into parliamentary seats, this trend should continue to persist with younger generations coming to the fore in 5 years' time (and subsequent elections thereafter) who are better exposed to alternative sources of media.</p>
              <p>If this trend proves sustainable, then it is surely only a matter of time before the opposition makes even more significant inroads in terms of presence in parliament for it will simply be impossible, regardless of the extent of gerrymandering imposed, for the fascists to maintain its current level of dominance if its popular vote continues to dip - there is, after all, a fairly strong (albeit not a perfect) correlation.</p>

              <p><br>What's wrong?</p>
              <p>That's my point. 40% voted for opposition (compared with 25% in 2001 and 34% in 2006). Is that not an increase?</p>
              <p>For the sake of argument, suppose you had 100% voting for the opposition. Is it remotely possible the fascists could even win a single seat, regardless of how they gerrymander (it doesn't matter if you had a mega GRC of 87 v 87 or 87 SMC's)?</p>
              <p>As mentioned earlier, the GRC system prevents the erosion of parliamentary seats for the fascists because this system does not ensure proportional parliamentary representation based on the popular vote.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, if the popular vote for the opposition continues to increase going forward in a similar way it has over the last decade, isn't it logical that the opposition can only win more seats in the future? All said and done, the opposition's parliamentary seats will still not be proportional to the popular vote because the correlation between these two aren't perfect - at best, they're moderately strong.</p>

              <p><br>You're plain deluded. If the parliamentary seats reflected anywhere near the popular vote, you should have approximately 33 opposition voted into parliament.</p>
              <p>For the record, the popular vote does not include the 5 uncontested seats. Did you not know that? So why are you factoring that into the popular vote?</p>
              <p>And for the record, my example still holds if we assumed an 82-seat parliament. You could still end up with 81-1 in favour of the fascists.</p>

              <p>Marine parade a bloody fight, PP kaylong win, Hougang is a clear signal that people may not always want a change. looking at the results we see the pecentage of lightning team's wins going down year after year! its what we tell the gahmen after year after year of prices and foreign trashes goig up.</p>
              <p>now we really have to look at the new immigrants. if more comes in and have the power of one vote each in tehir hands, oppositons wins can become vevn hard for future elections!</p>

              <p>40% of singaporeans voted for the opposition but PAP takes 81 out of 87 seats. Tks to the GRC system. You can be sure that PAP will think of more ways to perpetuate their political hegemony. They have about 700 polling stations this time round....new polling stations unheard of in GE 2006 have sprung up this election. So there you go, PAP have already planned long term.....see which cluster of blocks voted against them in more detail and then the usual gerrymeandering.</p>
              <p>In fact, Aljunied GRC had 29,000 voters siphoned off to AMK GRC, so WP's margin might have been bigger had it not been for that.</p>
              <p>Not bad huh, pay the elections dept big money to come up with creative ideas so that PAP stays in power.</p>
              <p>So the 60% of you who have voted PAP, I hope the inflation, foreigners, and transport issues don't come back to bite you. Complain and complain but still root for the problem haha. In fact, let's wait and see. I don't think much will change. When politicians say they will listen to you, take it with a pinch of salt. What's more it's PAP in their ivory tower saying that lol.</p>

              <p>It looks like this could potentially be the start of the evolution of a 2 party system in Sg.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I foresee that the other opposition parties will not make too much inroads in terms of winning seats in parliament in the near future.  The WP on the other hand has established itself as a brand name opposition party for now with this GRC win and the most logical thing is to continue growing from here onwards.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One, they should continue to attract better quality new candidates to grow the party.  Two, they should consider talking to the better performers from other opposition parties in this election to entice them to join the WP.  It's a win win situation for alternative parties. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If you analyse it, I think this was the best possible result for Singaporeans, Singapore, WP and PAP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singaporeans - more alternative voices in parliament. (vs zero opposition)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore - little or no change in terms of foreign investments,  economic fundamentals, life in general. (vs a shock result of losing say 25% of seats to opposition)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WP - continued growth of party.(vs zero opposition)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP - Minimal loss of just 1 GRC and 1 SMC. (vs shocking loss of 2 or more GRCs)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The incumbent party better start listening otherwise, they will lose more GRCs the next time round as even their heavyweight ministers like WKS, MBT, SM only managed mid 50% wins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>A brunch of MIW took over Chua Chu Kang GRC and what do they offer?? Nothing...past 5 years I only saw my MP Zagy once which was 2 weeks before nomination day trying to get votes at Lot 1 macdonald. What have they done?? All the carrots come only when NSP comes and contest CCK GRC.</p>
              <p>The more you say about WP the more happier I am to see George Yeo leaves and to add on people like LHH and CP as they forget that they have heart. That's why they lost.</p>

              <p>Anyway, all of you must have stayed tuned to last night's CNA. The reporting this time is more balanced than 2006. However, did you all notice a lot of repeats? The same interviews with the same people over and over again. And they ran out of ideas that they had to broadcast the repeat of the unrest in syria. Then Otelli Edwards touched on the hot issues of the GE...such as foreigners, cost of living, housing prices etc.....all very skin deep! Very superficial mention. No interviews of the people in the stadiums and streets either....I think they are afraid of "live" gaffes, something which may prove embarassing if someone says something unfriendly.</p>
              <p>Somehow, I felt this was an insult to the singaporean's intelligence lol. Al Jazeera can do better anytime. The people in there must be either morons or yes men.</p>
              <p>Oh what saved the night was the Returning Officer, Yam Ah Mee. He walked up to the rostrum 23 times in the same posture, same expression and same tone. "Pursuant to Section 49, Paragraph A......" hehehe. He's my hero.</p>
