                                      thing you wanted to do after you became a

              <p>Tin Pei Ling: <strong>The greatest regret is that I didn’t
                                      manage to bring my parents to Universal Studios before then,
                                      because I, I foresee that in the upcoming days, it will be very
                                      busy.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Er.. and because I have been in the grassroots, I
                                      understand that the schedule for MPs.. the commitment is very
                                      high.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>So er.. at the moment, I’m not sure whether er.. when..
                                      how soon can I bring my parents to Universal Studio because I did
                                      promise them that I want to bring them there.. cos my mom is like,
                                      quite excited over it.<br></strong></p>
              <p><strong>So, um, I, I guess er, when there is a time, I
                                      would, I would like to bring them.. there. Actually all this time
                                      my.. my parents are very important to me. So...I must say I’m glad
                                      that before this, I managed to bring them to Italy.. where my..
                                      it’s somewhere that my father has always dreamed of going. So after
                                      so many years of er.. working so hard to raise the family, I
                                      managed to fulfill that wish.. and ......... I feel very great

              <p>Is this the kind of quality candidate that Marine Parade GRC is

              <p>A speech is something that can be crafted beforehand with
                                      assistance. But Tin Pei Lin's replies to impromptu questions will
                                      surely have to be a true depiction of her own egg-headed
                                      standing.<br> <br> What annoyed me most was that an unprepared candidate, could
                                      potentially be getting a cushy salary (the figure of S$15000 was
                                      thrown around on the internet) which is basically taxpayers money,
                                      when there are people out there far more qualified in their
                                      vocations who are only paid a fraction of that. I know a couple of
                                      people who I would love to see as candidates – Au Waipang and
                                      mrbrown for their intelligence, wit and most of all, compassion.
                                      Tin Pei Ling is getting into parliament simply by teaming with Goh
                                      Chok Tong.</p>

              <p>To add salt to my wounds, the management had the cheek to make a direct comparison of me to a foreign co-worker , if he don’t claim OT pay why should I??<br>+++++++++</p>
              <p>TS, I understand how you feel about your current position you are in as the above sentence you posted. I am too in your situation, maybe much much more worst than you. Yes my manager love to compare us with foreign workers, something like your salary can employ 5 indonesian workers to do your jobs.</p>
              <p>Constandly threaten you and never give a damn on your salary increnment.</p>
              <p>But come to think of it, we cannot blame the govt for this matter as it is between the employee and employer problems. If you have such a employers, you or others or me will be suffer in silence and salary will be stagnant.</p>
              <p>That is what many workers are facing now, managers want to cut cost, cut your low salary, threaten you, make you on your toes, make you work long hours, triple mulit-tasks jobs and yet still not satisfied.</p>
              <p>What can the govt do? Maybe the gove should tell employers not to treat sporean workers like this. But will employers listen?</p>

              <p>To add salt to my wounds, the management had the cheek to make a direct comparison of me to a foreign co-worker , if he don’t claim OT pay why should I??<br>+++++++++</p>
              <p>TS, I understand how you feel about your current position you are in as the above sentence you posted. I am too in your situation, maybe much much more worst than you. Yes my manager love to compare us with foreign workers, something like your salary can employ 5 indonesian workers to do your jobs.</p>
              <p>Constandly threaten you and never give a damn on your salary increnment.</p>
              <p>But come to think of it, we cannot blame the govt for this matter as it is between the employee and employer problems. If you have such a employers, you or others or me will be suffer in silence and salary will be stagnant.</p>
              <p>That is what many workers are facing now, managers want to cut cost, cut your low salary, threaten you, make you on your toes, make you work long hours, triple mulit-tasks jobs and yet still not satisfied.</p>
              <p>What can the govt do? Maybe the gove should tell employers not to treat sporean workers like this. But will employers listen?</p>
              <p>NO.</p>

              <p>My dog damn employer love to compare us with foreign workers.</p>
              <p>Why can you do while they can?</p>
              <p>That is why many workers are force to work long hours, no or little ot pay. And tripe muilt tasks jobs too. With little or no increnment and bonuses.</p>
              <p>And to add more salts, the cost of living, bills, whatever you name it, it put lots of burden and heavy load on our shoulders to bear....</p>
              <p>...if we want to trace the root of the problems......by rewinding backward.....foreign wokers come in and able to work and blended in our society with cheap salary.</p>

              <p>Finally, barely two days before the polls the PAP admitted that they need to "reform"! </p>
              <p>The past 2 years have been marked by numerous policy failures on the domestic front.  People have been providing feedback but it took so long for you to figure it out? ARe your policies really soundly and rigorously debated in parliament?  Or are they just rubberstamped? </p>
              <p>Are they out of touch or what?  WHat happened to your vaunted "grassroots" organisation. </p>
              <p>Please stop just monitoring the GDP meter, stop listening to the sycophants, the careerists and the yes men.  Start listening to the people!  You may think they can easily be replaced by foreigner but remember every 5 years they get to have a say on whether you get to work for them</p>

              <p>If they do not deliver, you are free to vote them out. (Note: This is what the MIWs have said during the beginning of the election).</p>
              <p>As more truth are being uncovered, the awakening and shocking reality hurts most of us.</p>
              <p>Money taken from us are invested on $500 chairs and YOG and with no reasonable and logical explanation given.</p>
              <p>The old and disadvantaged are not all taken care and under-privilleged are sometimes being takan by uncaring elite when they approached for help.</p>
              <p>As for giving them a third chance, please stop being naive that they will be sorry and improve their system.</p>
              <p>If you dun take charge of your country, the foreigners will take care of your job, your bus, your MRT, your house and your voting rights.</p>
              <p>Your kids will have a unfair advantage of debt when they graduated from local university.</p>
              <p>While your tax money are used to sponsor the livelihood and school fees of foreigners, they graduate with no debt to pay and no reservist, no IPT, no RT and no IPPT.</p>
              <p>Not forgetting they will be issued their citizenship and return to their homeland to work, at the same time, earning passive income through renting their HDB flat to their comrade.</p>
              <p>This is already happening at the moment cos you choose not to take responsibility for your home land.</p>
              <p>If you continue to ignore your rights to your home land, you will have to move to Johor to live cos you cannot afford the housing here.</p>
              <p>At that moment, regret and repent will be useless cos you given some one another chance to recover and make you a Low Class Citizen.</p>
