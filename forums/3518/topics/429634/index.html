              Have you ask yourself why the people now distrusted and are disappointed with the PAP??
              The PAP government always bragged about our world class education system which has produced many talents for the various business sectors for the last 50 years.....
              Then why our very own Singaporeans have difficulties to secure good employment???Are we not less hungry as compared to these foreign talents???
              The answer is a BIG NO !
              The continued calls from the PAP government to Singaporeans on the need of staying competitive in wages have lead to many business given the opportunity to exploit us with unreasonable low wages jobs.
              These foreign talents are willing to accept these low paid jobs as the amount is still many times more than what they could get back in their native countries  for the similar natured jobs. 
               We have our roots and families here. Whether you like it or not, we all have heavy financial commitments (high cost of housing, high cost of healthcare, high cost of education for our children....etc). 
              I like to share my own experience here......
              I am in my mid 40s now, my last drawn salary was about S$3000/mth (as of 31Dec 2010). Do you know I was drawing the same amount for the last 10years despite changing a few companies??
              I used to work for a Japanese MNC (well known for their TVs) last year.  Despite having a clause stated in my employment contract , which allow me to claim $10/hr for each OT hrs  I worked, the company plainly refused to honour this clause. For your information, almost every working days (for a period of 9 mths), I had stayed back for 4-5 hrs daily to clear the outstanding workload. I even went back on many Saturdays to work.   Am I not hungry for this job??
              To add salt to my wounds, the management had the cheek to make a direct comparison  of me  to a foreign co-worker ,  if he donâ€™t claim OT pay why should I??
              And there is no channel  for me to lodge a complaint of grievances simply my job position is considered an executive position and MOM is not in the position to help me at all.
              I wish to remind all Singaporeans reading my posting to do some soul searching and ask themselves this â€“
              Do you want a government which really take good care of its citizens, listen to the plight of its citizens and extend a sincere helping hand, will stand and protect the interests of its citizens  with great responsibilities 
              OR
              
              A government which pay its PM &amp; Ministers with multi-million dollars salary yearly, refuses  to see and hear the plights of its citizens, continuously undermine the interests of its citizens , credit itself at the first instance  if everything is going smoothly for the country and also at the first instance blame uncontrollable global factors/reasons if situation turn worse and at their wits end?
              
              On  7 May 2011, cast your votes wisely and sensibly. Thank you.

              I don't believe this is truly 100% the government's fault... The problem is that we went directly from 2nd world status to a 1st world status too fast...
              
              Many people still have a 2nd world mentality of getting a job and earn your money. In the government's effort to continue modernizing Singapore, they forgot about these people. An ideal 1st world country, we will have our citizens running MNCs and having high paying managerial or specialized jobs to afford the cost of upkeeping Singapore and leave the low paying jobs to the foreigners. But this not the case.
              
              Our education system focus on how to be a good worker and follow orders but in a 1st world country, we need to be innovative and learn how to get money from other countries into Singapore. But our citizen lack this know how. As such, the foreigners are taking the low paying jobs coz our citizen are not willing to work for them and foreign talents are brought in coz many of our citizens are not qualified for these Â hi paying jobs.
              
              What the government need to do is to change our education system so that to cultivate the younger Singaporean minds to learn how to make money so that one day we will have a Singapore version of Apple or Sony bringing income into Singapore.

              <p>i never trusted politicians.. they are first and foremost, scumbags and dregs of humanity...</p>
              <p>but here, the MIW made me hate them more and more over some issues which pissed the hell out of me... i'll list a few:</p>
              <p>Lim Hng Kiang when he was Health Minister many many years ago was reported in the newspapers (the straitjacket times no less!) that he regretted the "loss of $300,000" when KK had to save the life of a premature baby.. KK refused to treat the baby until the parents could dole out $60,000 for a deposit, all because the parents went to Mt Alvernia to deliver the baby.. Mt Alvernia didn't have the equipment to save the baby which only KK had.. and tried to get KK to admit the baby.. in the end Mt Alvernia actually came up with the $60,000 to admit the baby in KK!!!</p>
              <p>Lim Hng Kiang was lamenting the "loss of $300,000" because that was the cost of "keeping a premature baby alive"</p>
              <p>a few years ago, the current Health Minister said something about "if you cannot afford care for the elderly, you can put them in JB where the nursing homes are cheaper... if that's not callous and uncaring, what is?</p>
              <p>GST is to "help the poor"</p>
              <p>Goh Chok Tong telling people to "keep it clean" then saying that NSP is "No Substance Party"</p>
              <p>Lau Lee's wife is taken ill, SIA flies them back, the journalist interviews them, writes word for word what Lau Lee says which shows that he's divorced from reality, the PMO pulls the journalist and editor in and both are demoted...</p>
              <p>Cynthia Phua and the police report against a low-IQ man who she lambasted verbally.. and lost his temper...</p>
              <p>there are much much more from them....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not to say that the opposition have fared better... they have their share of despicable behaviour too... like backstabbing and other political bullshit...</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>LKY's daughter wrote in the Straits Times a few years back something like: Why spend money to separate conjoined twins because they have no utility to society.</p>
              <p>PAP is a near-fascist party. They believe in eugenics like Hitler did so LKY promoted marriage of graduate men to graduate women to produce clever offspring who can contribute to the economy (eugenics is a ludicrous theory). The disabled are chucked to one side because they are of no use to the economy. The frail and elderly are dumped into a block of flat in Toa Payoh out of sight and mind because they can no longer add to GDP. Those less frailed elderly are told to migrate to Johor Bahru because they can no longer add utility to the economy.</p>

              <p>LKY's daughter wrote in the Straits Times a few years back
                      something like: Why spend money to separate conjoined twins because
                      they have no utility to society.</p>
              <p>PAP is a near-fascist party. They believe in eugenics like
                      Hitler did so LKY promoted marriage of graduate men to graduate
                      women to produce clever offspring who can contribute to the economy
                      (eugenics is a ludicrous theory). The disabled are chucked to one
                      side because they are of no use to the economy. The frail and
                      elderly are dumped into a block of flat in Toa Payoh out of sight
                      and mind because they can no longer add to GDP. Those less frailed
                      elderly are told to migrate to Johor Bahru because they can no
                      longer add utility to the economy.</p>

              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong apologized on Tuesday for government lapses under his watch.</p>
              <p>While his apology may have been unexpected, reactions to it were 
              fairly predictable. Straits Times Deputy Review Editor Chua Mui Hoong 
              called the apology a “very good first step”. Opposition parties, while 
              welcoming the apology, emphasized that it only showed the need for more 
              opposition in Parliament to hold the government accountable. More 
              cynical opposition supporters decried the apology as “too little, too 
              late”, with some dismissing it as a mere electioneering tactic.</p>
              <p>I welcome a show of humility from PM Lee, but whether that translates
               into subsequent government action to change their own attitudes and 
              rectify errors remains to be seen.</p>
              <p><strong>Mr Wong Kan Seng stopped short of apologizing when Mas Selamat 
              escaped in broad daylight. Dr Yaacob Ibrahim never came close to 
              apologizing for the inadequate flood control system which allowed 
              monsoon rains to ruin businesses and cause millions of dollars worth of 
              damage. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew took back his remarks on the 
              Malay-Muslim Community, but also stopped short of an unequivocal 
              apology. Then, a few days before polling day, the Prime Minister 
              apologizes to Singaporeans not once, but twice at a lunch time rally. 
              You cannot blame people for being cynical at PM Lee’s apology. Talk, as 
              they say, is cheap.</strong></p>
              <p>While PM Lee acknowledged that his administration has made some 
              blunders, he took pains to stress that those mistakes which have lead to
               soaring HDB flat prices and overcrowding were made in an attempt at 
              seizing economic opportunities as they presented themselves.</p>
              <p>He spoke, for instance, about Integrated Resorts (let’s call them 
              casinos, shall we?) which have changed the Marina Bay skyline but which 
              have also lead to problem gambling. He also spoke about the vigorous 
              economic expansion in the past couple of years which has brought 
              prosperity but which has also lead to an influx of more foreigners, 
              soaring home prices, and overcrowding.</p>
              <p>PM Lee asked Singaporeans to bear with his administration as they are trying their best to fix the problems.</p>
              <p><strong>But Mr Lee did not mention what changes would be made to existing 
              government policies to solve the problems of overcrowding and rising 
              prices, and assuage voters’ concerns over the influx of foreigners.</strong> <strong>He only asked Singaporeans to accept his apology, in other words, to give him a blank cheque.</strong></p>
              <p>That is the heart of the problem. The PAP knows it has gone wrong, 
              but it has made no attempt at putting things right. In his lunchtime 
              speech, PM Lee said that he was running the show in a different style 
              from MM Lee, but he also said that he is taking Singapore in the same 
              strategic direction as before. Of what benefit is it to Singaporeans to 
              witness a change in style but not a change in substance?</p>
              <p>The PAP must show that it is willing and able to address 
              Singaporeans’ concerns and put things right. There must be concrete 
              action, not mere rhetoric. There must be a genuine attempt to engage and
               listen to alternative views, even if they come from the opposite side 
              of the political aisle. Otherwise, PM Lees’s apology will only be seen 
              as a rare act of humility that comes only in the heat of election 
              campaigning, but which evaporates the moment the votes are tallied.</p>
              <p><strong>And despite such admissions of mistakes made, PAP ministers such as 
              Wong Kan Seng, Mah Bow Tan, Raymond Lim and Yaacob Ibrahim all receive 
              an 8-month bonus this year. Shortcomings, it seems, come with financial 
              rewards, nonetheless.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>As for the Prime Minister himself, he will be earning more than $25 
              million the next five years – while he tries and “do better” in his job.</strong></p>
