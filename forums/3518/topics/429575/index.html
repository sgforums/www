              <h2><span id="Political_career" class="mw-headline">Political career</span></h2>
              <p>Ong's political career spanned 21 years. He was a <a title="Members of the Singapore Parliament" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_the_Singapore_Parliament">Member of Parliament</a>, <a title="Cabinet of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_Singapore">Cabinet Minister</a> and <a title="Prime Minister of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Singapore">Deputy Prime Minister</a>, before he resigned to become the first elected <a title="President of Singapore" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Singapore">President of Singapore</a> in 1993.</p>
              <p>Ong began his political career through his involvement in <a title="Grassroots" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grassroots">grassroots</a> activities in <a title="Seletar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seletar">Seletar</a>. He was then introduced to the then-Prime Minister <a title="Lee Kuan Yew" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew">Lee Kuan Yew</a>.</p>
              <p>The <a title="People's Action Party" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People%27s_Action_Party">People's Action Party</a> (PAP) soon fielded him as a candidate in Kim Keat in the 1972 <a title="General election" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election">General Election</a>. His first political appointment came just three years later when he was made <a title="Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_Information,_Communications_and_the_Arts">Senior Minister of State for Communications</a>. At that time, Ong pushed for the development of the <a title="Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Rapid_Transit_%28Singapore%29">Mass Rapid Transit System</a> (MRT), the largest construction project in Singapore's history. His 
                  next challenge came on the labour front, when he became the <a class="mw-redirect" title="Secretary General" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_General">Secretary-General</a> of the <a title="National Trades Union Congress" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trades_Union_Congress">National Trades Union Congress</a> (NTUC) in 1983. Ong was diagnosed with <a title="Cancer" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer">cancer</a> of the <a title="Lymphatic system" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphatic_system">lymphatic system</a> in 1992. He became Singapore's first elected President a year later, 
                  and it was a presidency marked by many charitable projects, which 
                  touched the lives of many Singaporeans. Ong stepped down as President at
                   the age of 63.<sup id="cite_ref-cna_1-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-cna-1"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In January 1986, Ong sanctioned a <a title="General strike" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_strike">strike</a> in the shipping industry, the first for about a decade in Singapore, 
                  without telling the cabinet. He said that he did not inform the cabinet 
                  or the government because they would probably stop him from going ahead 
                  with the strike. There was a major corporate and cabinet backlash 
                  against his decision; however, the strike lasted only two days, and a 
                  deal was struck.<sup id="cite_ref-asiaweek_4-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-asiaweek-4"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <div class="thumb tright"></div>
              <p>During his tenure as the <a title="Ministry of National Development (Singapore)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministry_of_National_Development_%28Singapore%29">Minister of National Development</a>, Ong was a proponent and advocate of the Mass Rapid Transit system. He later became the 2nd Deputy Prime Minister in 1985.</p>
              <h2><span id="Presidency" class="mw-headline">Presidency</span></h2>
              <p>Ong ran for the presidency in 1993 under the PAP's endorsement. He ran against a reluctant <a class="new" title="Chua Kim Yeow (page does not exist)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chua_Kim_Yeow&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Chua Kim Yeow</a>,
                   a former accountant general, for the post. A total of 1,756,517 votes 
                  were polled. Ong received 952,513 votes while Chua had 670,358 votes, 
                  despite the former having a higher public exposure and a much more 
                  active campaign than Chua.</p>
              <p>However, soon after his election to the presidency in 1993, <strong>Ong was 
                  tangled in a dispute over the access of information regarding 
                  Singapore's financial reserves. The government said it would take 56 
                  man-years to produce a dollar-and-cents value of the immovable assets. 
                  Ong discussed this with the accountant general and the auditor general 
                  and eventually conceded that the government only had to declare all of 
                  its properties, a list which took a few months to produce. Even then, 
                  the list was not complete; it took the government a total of three years
                   to produce the information that Ong requested.<sup id="cite_ref-Window_5-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-Window-5"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup></strong></p>
              <p>In an interview with <a title="Asiaweek" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asiaweek">Asiaweek</a> six months after stepping down from presidency,<sup id="cite_ref-SgWindow_6-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-SgWindow-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> <strong>Ong indicated that he had asked for this audit based on the principle 
                  that as an elected president, he was bound to protect the national 
                  reserves, and the only way of doing so would be to know what reserves 
                  (both liquid cash and assets) the government owned.</strong></p>
              <p>In the last year of his presidency (1998) Ong found out through the 
                  newspapers that the government aimed to submit a bill to Parliament to 
                  sell the <a title="POSBank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSBank">Post Office Savings Bank</a> (POSB) to <a title="DBS Bank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBS_Bank">The Development Bank of Singapore</a>.
                   <strong>The POSB was, at that time, a government statutory board whose reserves
                   were under the president's protection, this move was procedurally 
                  inappropriate and did not regard Ong's significance as the guardian of 
                  the reserves; </strong>he had to call and inform the government of this 
                  oversight. In spite of this, the sale proceeded and the Development Bank
                   Of Singapore owns POSBank and its name to this present day.<sup id="cite_ref-SgWindow_6-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-SgWindow-6"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Ong received an Honorary Appointment of <a title="Order of St Michael and St George" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_St_Michael_and_St_George">The Order of St Michael and St George</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" title="Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II_of_the_United_Kingdom">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in 1998.<sup id="cite_ref-Knight_7-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-Knight-7"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Ong decided not to run for a second term as president in 1999 partially due to health reasons.</p>
              <h2><span id="Death" class="mw-headline">Death</span></h2>
              <p>Ong's wife, Ling Siew May, died in August 1999 after a cancer 
                  relapse. Ong died later on February 8, 2002, at the age of 66, from <a title="Lymphoma" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymphoma">lymphoma</a> in his home at about 8:14 pm <a title="Singapore Standard Time" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore_Standard_Time">SST</a> after he had been discharged from hospital a few days earlier.</p>
              <p><strong>Among the five former presidents who have died, Ong is the first president who did not receive a <a title="State funeral" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_funeral">state funeral</a>. He received a state-assisted funeral instead.<sup id="cite_ref-TheOnlineCitizen_8-0" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ong_Teng_Cheong#cite_note-TheOnlineCitizen-8"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></strong></p>

              <p>Ong Teng Cheong was a hokkien that had popularity with the public, this triggered the inferiority complex of Lee Kuan Yew who is a hakka peranakan.</p>
              <p>So Lee Kuan Yew withdrew his support of Ong Teng Cheong. He became wary and jealous of Ong Teng Cheong.</p>
              <p>In the history of Singapore, we can say that no one really supported Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>That is why Lee Kuan Yew can only resort to threats and intimidation to rule.</p>

At that time, we did not know who would be the successor to Lee. We finally made the decision to pick Goh Chok Tong. He agreed on condition that I agreed to be his number two. So I was the second DPM; he was the first DPM. In 1988, Lee asked Goh to take over, but he was not ready. He said: two more years. So two years later, he took the job.</span></span></p>

              <p>Despite these economic misfortunes, the Peranakan community’s investment in English education and their empathy with the British were, once again, rewarded amply.</p>
              <p>They continued to play a leading role in the public life of post-war Singapore.
              Their prominent representatives included Tan Chin Tuan, T W Ong, C C Tan , Sir Han Hoe Lim, Thio Chan Bee and Lim Yew Hock, the one-time Chief Minister of Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even after Singapore attained its independence in 1965, those with Peranakan roots carried on their long and distinguished record of public service into the present time.</p>
              <p>Among the eminent personages are Dr Wee Kim Wee, Dr Goh Keng Swee, <strong>Dr Tony Tan</strong> and the late Dr Ee Peng Liang.</p>
