              <p>The PAP media is trying to portray him as a gracious loser, in the hope that next election he can win back Aljunied GRC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But seriously deep down in his heart, he is cursing the people of GRC, wishing that they suffer under the hands of WP. And he is also hoping that WP would fail big in Aljunied GRC so that he could win it back easy the next time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Afterall didn't MM say that Aljunied GRC will be made to repent if they vote in opposition? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Was such air time given to opposition candidates who lost? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh yeah!</p>
              <p>Not to mention the selfish and shallow nature of these PAP supporters, they vote for what PAP won't take away from them, issues like buses, upgrading and other benefits PAP can provide for them. All these are <strong>local district issues</strong>, they have <strong>sidetrack the major national issues</strong> like foreign immigrants, sky rocketing HDB prices, over crowding of the public transport system, high inflation, etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>We all sit in this big bus called Singapore, we all pay the same fares, but it seems like some passengers are getting first class treatement (e.g. massage, cocktail, bird's nest) from the driver, while others are being shoved into a squalid area near the toilet and made to sit on the floor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this bus we ride call Singapore, everybody is equal, except some are more equal than others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Is the PAP using the GRC system to perpetuate their hold on power?</p>
              <p>Will they be telling us "This GRC has the PM, so don't vote against the PAP." And so they go and place a Cabined minister in every GST and tell the people that it is not wise to vote against them and lose them.

              <p>If the Aljunied caper happens again at the next GE. Lets say East Coast GRC won by WP, and out goes Raymond Lim, Lim Swee Say, will they then declare that the GRC is an honest mistake and should be ended.</p>

              People in Marine Parade voted PAP because of GCT, not because of TPL. TPL is just a trouble maker trying to hide behind the backs of the more credible MPs to gain popularity and votes, and eventually victory.
              I guess even GCT himself deep inside is so embarrassed and unhappy about this TPL.
              
              Sadly NSP is not a strong party yet. If Nicole Seah is in WP and contesting in MArine Parade, sure win the GRC, even by margins.

              Reminds me of those hamsters in the pet shops. Need to give them food before they can perform tricks for you.
