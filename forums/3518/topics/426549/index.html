              <p>(From left) PAP introduced three more candidates:  Mr Edwin Tong, Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Ang Hin Kee. -- PHOTOS: PAP</p>
              <p>THREE more candidates were introduced by the People's Action Party 
              (PAP) on Wednesday, bringing the total number of PAP new faces so far to
               12 in the coming general election.</p>
              <p>Of the three, two are lawyers: Mr Edwin Tong, 42, and Mr 
              Vikram Nair, 33. The third is Mr Ang Hin Kee, 46, who is the chief 
              executive of the National Trade Union Congress' Employment &amp; 
              Employability Institute (e2i).</p>
              <p>The candidates were introduced at the party's HQ by 
              Education Minister Ng Eng Hen, who is also the party's Organising 
              Secretary (Special Duties).</p>
              <p>In his opening remarks, Dr Ng said that with more residents 
              and rising expectations of economic progress, it was 'critical to bring 
              in new able candidates who can continue strong, capable Government'.</p>
              <p>The search for these candidates were extensive, and carried out for more than four years, Dr Ng said.</p>
              <p>More than 260 individuals were considered. After many 
              meetings, assessments and feedback from other activists and MPs, the 
              selection was narrowed down to more than 20 people.</p>
              <p>Thousands of man-hours were spent on this task by senior 
              members of the party, Dr Ng said. 'For every cup of tea candidates 
              drank, we drank 10 more to find the best brew,' he added.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng said such exhaustive efforts were necessary in order 
              to offer citizens 'the best possible team to preserve what we have and 
              take us forward into the future'.</p>
              <p>In their introductory remarks, all three candidates spoke of
               the need to meet the concerns of Singaporeans from all walks of life.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Ang: 'I want to see individuals with different needs
               and abilities being given more options and different pathways to have a
               better life.'</p>
              <p><strong>Two lawyers and E2i chief</strong></p>
              <p>The three new PAP candidates introduced to the media on Wednesday are:</p>
              <p><strong>Edwin Tong Chun Fai</strong></p>
              <p>'We have a responsibility to preserve the core values on 
              which Singapore's success has been built, and ensure that every 
              Singaporean shares in that success.'</p>

              <p>'I enjoy the company of grassroots leaders and volunteers.

              <h1 class="storyheadline">Four essential qualities to be a good MP, leader</h1>
              <p>by Yen Feng</p>
              <p>IN ITS extensive search for candidates to field in the coming polls, 
              the People's Action Party looks for four essential qualities to be a 
              good MP and government leader.</p>
              <p>Education Minister Ng Eng Hen, who is also the party's Organising Secretary (Special Duties), said the candidates must:</p>
              <p><strong>Be an activist.</strong></p>
              <p>They must be committed to serve and are grounded in 
              reality. They must also have the ability to put plans into actions to 
              serve the people.</p>
              <p><strong>Have a heart for Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>While the candidates do not have to agree with the party's 
              policies, they must believe that Singapore can improve, and are able to 
              connect with the hopes and difficulties of Singaporeans</p>
              <p><strong>Have guts for Singapore</strong></p>
              <p>Candidates must be committed and stay the course, not wilt 
              under pressure and succumb to populist sentiments. They must be able to 
              think long-term.</p>
              <p><strong>Be trustworthy</strong></p>
              <p>As MPs and office holders, as people in positions of power 
              and influence, candidates must be trusted to always make the right 
              decision for the good of Singapore and never for personal gain.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng, who introduced three more new PAP candidates to the 
              media on Wednesday afternoon at the party headquarters, said the PAP 
              held nearly 200 tea sessions with over 260 individuals over the last 
              four years.</p>
              <p>He said the candidates were assessed over a period of time, 
              some for years, which saw them changing jobs, getting married, pregnant 
              and through deliveries, said Dr Ng.</p>
              <p>After thousands of man-hours spent on these exhaustive efforts, just over 20 candidates were selected.</p>

              <h3>Mar 30, 2011 - Straits Times</h3>
              <p>by Yen Feng</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/image/20110330/stcombo-30.jpg" alt="" width="330" height="200"></p>
              <p>(From left) PAP introduced three more candidates: Mr Edwin Tong,
                  Mr Vikram Nair and Mr Ang Hin Kee. -- PHOTOS: PAP</p>
              <p>THREE more candidates were introduced by the People's Action
                  Party (PAP) on Wednesday, bringing the total number of PAP new
                  faces so far to 12 in the coming general election.</p>
              <p>Of the three, two are lawyers: Mr Edwin Tong, 42, and Mr Vikram
                  Nair, 33. The third is Mr Ang Hin Kee, 46, who is the chief
                  executive of the National Trade Union Congress' Employment &amp;
                  Employability Institute (e2i).</p>
              <p>The candidates were introduced at the party's HQ by Education
                  Minister Ng Eng Hen, who is also the party's Organising Secretary
                  (Special Duties).</p>
              <p>In his opening remarks, Dr Ng said that with more residents and
                  rising expectations of economic progress, it was 'critical to bring
                  in new able candidates who can continue strong, capable
                  Government'.</p>
              <p>The search for these candidates were extensive, and carried out
                  for more than four years, Dr Ng said.</p>
              <p>More than 260 individuals were considered. After many meetings,
                  assessments and feedback from other activists and MPs, the
                  selection was narrowed down to more than 20 people.</p>
              <p>Thousands of man-hours were spent on this task by senior members
                  of the party, Dr Ng said. 'For every cup of tea candidates drank,
                  we drank 10 more to find the best brew,' he added.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng said such exhaustive efforts were necessary in order to
                  offer citizens 'the best possible team to preserve what we have and
                  take us forward into the future'.</p>
              <p>In their introductory remarks, all three candidates spoke of the
                  need to meet the concerns of Singaporeans from all walks of
                  life.</p>
              <p>Said Mr Ang: 'I want to see individuals with different needs and
                  abilities being given more options and different pathways to have a
                  better life.'</p>
