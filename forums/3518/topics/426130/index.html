              <p>OPPOSITION leaders are not so 'small-minded' as to contest GRCs just 
              for the sake of building a legacy, said Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong 
              yesterday.</p>
              <p>The 76-year-old is the latest opposition leader to weigh in 
              against Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng's remarks on Wednesday, 
              questioning the motives of opposition parties.</p>
              <p>DPM Wong had said that there were opposition leaders who 
              wanted to contest GRCs in order to leave a legacy as the first party to 
              win a GRC, or to use it as a tool for leadership renewal. That, he said,
               was not what polls should be about.</p>
              <p>'Is it about the interest and missions of political parties 
              or an individual's interest to create a legacy or to make history?' he 
              asked.</p>
              <p>The comments seem to be directed primarily at Mr Chiam and 
              Hougang MP Low Thia Khiang. Mr Low is mulling a GRC bid while Mr Chiam 
              had said as early as last year that he was planning to contest the 
              five-MP Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC led by DPM Wong.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, Mr Chiam stressed that legacy-building had 
              nothing to do with his GRC bid: 'It (a legacy) was never in my mind at 
              all.' He added: 'We are not that small-minded.'</p>

              <p><strong>The makeshift cubicle that served as the office for Mr Chiam's Meet The People sessions for the past 27 years</strong></p>
              <p><span class="left">Posted by theonlinecitizen on March 25, 2011</span></p>
              <p>by Andrew Loh</p>
              <p>Seeing Mr Chiam See Tong up close is inspiring. Anyone who thinks 
              that age or the two strokes he suffered in recent years have dented his 
              spirit would be highly mistaken. The veteran opposition politician is as
               stout-hearted as he has always been.</p>
              <p>As I waited for him to end his Meet-The-People session on Thursday at
               Block 121 in Potong Pasir, I was struck by the sight of what must now 
              be legend – that singular table sited at a corner of the void deck, 
              partitioned for privacy by aluminium panels into a makeshift cubicle.</p>
              <p>That’s where Mr Chiam has conducted his MPS for 27 years.</p>
              <p>The ruling People’s Action Party (PAP) – that is, the Government – 
              has refused to provide offices for opposition Members of Parliament 
              (MP). PAP MPs conduct their MPS’s at the air-conditioned offices of its 
              PAP Community Foundation (PCF) kindergartens premises. And since 
              opposition parties do not have their own chain of kindergartens and 
              their MPs are not of the PAP, the PAP would say it is thus not 
              appropriate to have opposition MPs use the PCF spaces.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam’s void deck cubicle is truly a symbol of how utterly petty our politics is, as played out by the ruling PAP.</p>
              <p>As a Singaporean, I am ashamed that we would treat an elected Member of Parliament this way.</p>
              <p>But Mr Chiam is unfazed.</p>
              <p>“If a person … really wants to be an MP,” Mr Chiam says, “he can work
               the ground and he can show himself to the people – that he is 
              hardworking and he is for the people. I think he will get elected that 
              way and show that he is a true representative of the people.”</p>
              <p>And as such, Mr Chiam does not believe in the Non-constituency MP 
              (NCMP) scheme. “I don’t believe in going into Parliament by the back 
              door,” he says. “[The] NCMP is not really elected by the majority of 
              Singaporeans. It is a token of the PAP.”</p>
              <p>I was curious about what the veteran politician thought of the six 
              new PAP candidates unveiled so far. “They look very impressive on 
              paper,” Mr Chiam says. “They have to win the hearts and minds of the 
              voters, isn’t it? And that is a difficult task because it takes time. 
              You can’t [befriend] a person overnight.”</p>
              <p>Turning to his health, I asked if he is able to withstand the rigour 
              and stress of an election. “Well, you must remember I was a sportsman in
               my early days,” Mr Chiam says.  “I was a school swimmer. And when I say
               school swimmer, I mean school swimmer,” he says with evident pride in 
              his voice, “because I’m from ACS (Anglo-Chinese School).  It’s somebody 
              to be a school swimmer in ACS. You must be strong and fit.”</p>
              <p>Those who still doubt his physical ability should visit Bishan-Toa 
              Payoh on Sunday where he will be conducting his walkabout, Mr Chiam 
              says. “Then you see whether I am fit or not,” he added. He is expected 
              to lead a team to contest the area in the elections in his bid to win a 
              Group Representation Constituency (GRC) – something which no opposition 
              party has achieved so far.</p>
              <p>Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC is helmed by Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan 
              Seng. Mr Wong on Wednesday had questioned the opposition’s intention in 
              wanting to win a GRC. He asked if this was to satisfy personal ambitions
               and questioned if the opposition winning a GRC has anything to do with 
              benefiting Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>“Is it about the interest and missions of political parties or an 
              individual’s interest to create a legacy or to make history?” Mr Wong 
              asked. Mr Wong also challenged the opposition to reveal their candidates
               early so voters can scrutinize them.</p>
              <p>“Most of Singapore already know the candidates of the opposition,” Mr
               Chiam says. “Opposition like to talk a lot. They inadvertently reveal 
              the names of their candidates. I think everybody knows who is standing 
              at Bishan Toa Payoh. In fact I announced my candidacy about a year ago. 
              How can you say that we did not reveal?”</p>
              <p>Mr Wong seems to have alluded particularly to Mr Chiam when he asked 
              if the opposition’s reasons for wanting to win a GRC was so that its 
              candidates could leave a legacy – a personal ego trip rather than out of
               consideration for the future of Singapore.</p>
              <p>“We are not so small-minded,” Mr Chiam says. “Our purpose is mainly 
              to expand the opposition. At the moment as you know opposition only has 
              two MPs in Parliament. PAP has 82. If the opposition captures a GRC, 
              that will be a big psychological blow to the PAP. It’s no longer an 
              impregnable fortress.”</p>
              <p>And Mr Chiam added: “Any step that the opposition does that dents the PAP is one step forward for the voters.”</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam remains just as sharp as he ever was.</p>
              <p>Perhaps Mr Wong should be more concerned about his own legacy. 
              Besides going down in history as the minister who let a limping 
              suspected terrorist escape – not once, but twice – Mr Wong has only won 
              in one election, despite having contested six General Elections in total
               so far.</p>
              <p>His first and only victory was at his very first election – in Kuo 
              Chuan SMC in 1984. After the Government introduced the GRC system in 
              1988, Mr Wong has had five walkovers.</p>
              <p>What a contrast to Mr Chiam’s six consecutive contests and victories!</p>
              <p>History indeed will remember Mr Chiam as one who went about quietly 
              in his work in serving the people, in spite of the odds and the 
              mountains he has had to climb, put in his way by a ruling party which 
              apparently holds an elected representative of the people in little 
              regard – if he is not of their ilk.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam’s legacy is, really, that of humility and steely 
              determination. He has contested in eight General Elections. Won six of 
              them – and going on his ninth. As far as I know, no other MP in 
              Singapore’s post-independence history has such a record of six 
              consecutive outright wins.  Not even Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew 
              (five).</p>
              <p>So, Mr Chiam has nothing else to prove to anyone, least of all to Mr Wong.</p>
              <p>He does not need to win a GRC, in my opinion, for his name to be 
              remembered. Indeed, his 27 years of service is testament enough. Yet he 
              continues to serve despite his physical condition.</p>
              <p>But perhaps what is most inspiring to me is that Mr Chiam’s example 
              shows that serving the people does not have to include multi-million 
              dollar paychecks and posh or ostentatious surroundings.</p>
              <p>All it takes, really, is a bit of heart.</p>
