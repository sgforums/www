              Flooding of Orchard Rd was troublesome and disruptive yes, but can be fixed.  Even we don't tell them to fix it, they will fix it because they cannot have major shopping belt in such mess.  
              
              The other stuff.  They may know about the problem, but are they facing it and seeing it from the point of view of ordinary Singaporeans?  No.  They sit on their high horses and live in their ivory towers and they are only dangling some carrots now because it's election time.  After elections, you sure they will care two hoots about us?
