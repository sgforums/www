               one would be unwise not to wonder why under the direction of successive
               PAP Prime Ministers, the PA has settled upon awarding titles of 
              'grassroots adviser' upon partisan premise: PAP MPs in the case of 
              elected ones, but PAP loosing candidates as in the case in opposition 
              held constituencies.<br> <br> Has the Prime Minster of Singapore hijacked the PA, a statutory board, 
              turning it into his own private fan club? Is the Prime Minister aware 
              that he shouldn't pervert the high standards of conduct that the 
              Singapore Civil Service strives to abide by, such as: <em>"Remaining 
              completely neutral in all political matters and matters of public

              another and to the government.</span>"</em><br> In regard of the concept of the 'government', readers would be well advised to understand the concept of <strong>'Separation of powers'</strong> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers">wiki</a>]: <em>"The
                 separation of powers is a model for the governance of a state. The 
              model was first developed in ancient Greece and came into widespread use
               by the Roman Republic as part of the unmodified Constitution of the 
              Roman Republic. <span style="color: red;">Under this model, the state is divided
                 into branches, each with separate and independent powers and areas of
               responsibility so that no one branch has more power than the other 
              branches. </span>The normal division of branches is into an executive, a legislature, and a judiciary. ..."</em><br> Wikipedia also elaborates the term <strong>'Government'</strong> at [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government">link</a>] as <em>"Each
               successive government is composed of a specialized and  privileged body
               of individuals, who monopolize political  decision-making, and are 
              separated by status and organization from the  population as a whole. 
              Their function is to enforce existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws">laws</a>,
                legislate new ones, and arbitrate conflicts via their monopoly on  
              violence. In some societies, this group is often a self-perpetuating or 
               hereditary class. In other societies, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracies">democracies</a>, the political roles remain, but there is frequent turnover of the people actually filling the positions. </em><em>In
               most Western societies, there is a clear distinction between a  
              government and the state. Public disapproval of a particular government 
               (expressed, for example, by not re-electing an incumbent) does not  
              necessarily represent disapproval of the state itself (i.e. of the  
              particular framework of government). <span style="color: red;">However, in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> regimes, there is not a clear distinction between the regime and the  
              state. In fact, leaders in such regimes often attempt to deliberately  
              blur the lines between the two, in order to conflate their own selfish  
              interests with those of the polity.</span>"</em><br> <br> It is thus perhaps the fault of the PAP, in it's profligate drive 
              towards maintaining political hegemony to view parochially, the 
              definition of 'government' thus perverting the original purported role 
              of the PA, from one of building the community into that of cementing PAP
               political hegemony- a siphon of subvention for PAP's partisan 
              grassroots activities and a wedge to hijack the relationship between an 
              opposition MP and his constituents.<br> <br> I think that the PAP, in its unscrupulous efforts at fixing the opposition (<strong>'PM Lee says countries worldwide respect and admire Singapore's proven system'</strong> [<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krtGW-xUSH4&amp;#t=1m10s">YouTube/@1m10s</a>]),
               has besides discrediting itself for fouling the integrity of the civil 
              service, also very much betrayed the right of each and every Singaporean
               to seek independent and diverse political representation through 
              democratic elections.<br> <br> Quoting <strong>'Grassroots Organizations should stay non-partisan'</strong> [<a href="http://www.temasekreview.com/2009/11/03/grassroots-organizations-should-stay-non-partisan/">TR, 03Nov2009</a>][<a href="http://thenewsynewsblog.blogspot.com/2011/01/1109-grassroots-organizations-should.html">alt site</a>]: <em>"..<span style="color: red;">Using
