              <p>my paper</p>
              <p>SOME netizens have been speculating that the People's Action Party (PAP) may lose its hold on power, with some even predicting its downfall at the next election.</p>
              <p>Many also say that the influx of foreigners will be the deciding issue that will push fence-sitters to cast their vote for the opposition.</p>
              <p>Bread-and-butter issues have always been the top factor behind Singaporeans voting for the PAP.</p>
              <p>Constituents will cast their votes for the party if it provides work for the people and makes them feel they are being taken care of.</p>
              <p>However, some Singaporeans, especially those aged between 40 and 60 years, have found themselves displaced by foreigners who are younger and cheaper to hire.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties are trying to capitalise on such issues and have been aggressively trying to recruit candidates for the next election.</p>
              <p>Some are also hoping that at least one group representation constituency will fall to the opposition.</p>
              <p>However, while many voters would like to see more opposition members in Parliament, they do not want a total change of government.</p>
              <p>The opposition parties' performance has been subdued at best.</p>
              <p>With Mr Chiam See Tong (Potong Pasir) and Mr Low Thia Khiang (Hougang) the only opposition MPs, it is hard for Singaporeans to see what the opposition can do for them.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties cannot work together and there is still in-fighting within parties.</p>
              <p>They are small groups aiming for just a few seats in Parliament.</p>
              <p>All the bad publicity could dent their credibility.</p>
              <p>If they are unable to get their act together, how can Singaporeans be confident that they will do well in Parliament?</p>
              <p>Some Singaporeans also compare the Government's candidates, who are usually scholars, with those fielded by the opposition during elections.</p>
              <p>If there is going to be any change to the country's political environment, well-educated Singaporeans need to join the opposition.</p>
              <p>That being said, candidates' academic credentials do not guarantee that they can connect with the ground.</p>
              <p>It takes a lot of heart to be a leader.</p>
              <p>I would rather have an MP who is a taxi driver and can speak for the common people than a well-educated one who cannot really understand the issues on most citizens' minds.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans want to feel that they voted for the right candidate during an election, regardless of his or her party.</p>
              <p>They would rather spoil their vote then vote for an opposition candidate who is not up to the mark.</p>
              <p>Hence, the performance of a candidate while stumping for the polls is crucial.</p>
              <p>His or her chances of winning more votes rest on the ability to inspire confidence and speak eloquently.</p>
              <p>The opposition needs to find innovative ways to let Singaporeans know what they have done and can do for them.</p>
              <p>Unless the opposition makes an effort to reinvent itself, the ruling party will win at least the next few elections.</p>

              <p>The problem with singaporeans is that they want more oppositions in the parliament but they do not want their constituency to be the one run by oppositions... They are worried about lots of things. Like the possibility of their HDB flats being reduced to slums should oppositions come into power etc...</p>
              <p>If everybody has this kind of mentality..It would be difficult for the Alternative Party to make any substantial inroad into the parliament...  </p>
