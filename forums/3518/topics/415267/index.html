              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Minister 
              Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has said that whether he stands in the next General 
              Election or not will depend on his health and the Prime Minister's 
              decision.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee has been taking care of Tanjong 
              Pagar constituency since it was a single-member ward in 1955.<br><br>Tanjong
               Pagar is now a Group Representation Constituency (GRC) covering a vast 
              part of central Singapore including areas like Moulmein, Tanglin and 
              Tiong Bahru and is helmed by six PAP MPs.<br><br>It is one of the big 
              GRCs, with a voter base of 148,141 at the last General Election in 2006.<br><br>Now
               at 87 years of age, Mr Lee said his decision to stand in the next 
              General Election will depend on two things.<br><br>He said: "If I'm fit,
               I'm prepared to stand but whether I stand or not, it's up to the Prime 
              Minister."<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee and his PAP team may face 
              competition in the polls due by February 2012.<br><br>The Reform Party 
              has indicated it will contest Tanjong Pagar if it has enough candidates.<br><br>"Welcome.
               We'll contest them," said Mr Lee.<br><br>Since Tanjong Pagar became a 
              GRC in 1991, it has never been contested. <br><br>The last time Tanjong 
              Pagar was contested was way back in 1988 when it was still a 
              single-member constituency. <br><br>Then Mr Lee had faced off with 
              independent candidate Gnaguru Thamboo Mylvaganam. <br><br>Mr Lee had won
               about 80 percent of the valid votes.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee remains
               confident about his team's success.<br><br>He said: "You think they'll 
              win in the next election? You can sense the crowd, you can feel the 
              ground. I don't have to answer you." <br><br>With changes to the 
              Parliamentary Elections Act, the six-member Tanjong Pagar GRC may be 
              hived off as the new laws will pave the way for more smaller GRCs.<br><br>On
               the likelihood of any team member in the Tanjong Pagar GRC being asked 
              to helm a single-member constituency, Minister for Communications, 
              Information and the Arts Lui Tuck Yew said: "My team is looking forward 
              to it."<br><br>Earlier Saturday at a community event, Mr Lee urged 
              residents to hold on to their property.<br><br>He said part of 
              Singapore's success lies in its home ownership policy where every 
              Singaporean has the opportunity to own a home, which will appreciate in 
              value.<br><br>Minister Mentor Lee said: "So all those who own houses, I 
              urge you not to listen to the estate agents...and go and sell your flats
               because that's a stupid thing to do. You may sell it and not get a 
              rental flat for a long time and you cannot gain from a rental flat. Any 
              improvement to a rental flat goes to the government, so please remember 
              that."<br><br>One way the value of public housing is enhanced is through
               upgrading, such as the S$1 million project launched on Saturday. <br><br>The
               project will see covered linkways connecting eight blocks of flats to 
              the Tiong Bahru MRT station.</span></span></p>

              <p>The crowd is supportive cos they benefited from being there.</p>
              <p>If there are no benefit, no one would be there.</p>
              <p>They are there to score bonus points with the old man.</p>
              <p>The question should be "Should the old man be in the election since he is not doing his job but travelling around the world on the people expense ?"</p>
              <p>But, no one dare to question him and ask him to do his job.</p>

              <p>Who in their right mind would go sell their only HDB (it's not like we can buy 2 HDB apartments to trade) to rent in the open market? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You would only do that if you are cash strapped or you only have years left before you kick the bucket and you would like to have the cash now to go travel the world. In which case his advice doesn't matter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>He is already at the top and he will quit when he is in the top.</p>
