              <p><strong>Attention in next GE will be more spread out: George Yeo<br></strong><br><span class="update">By Patwant Singh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 05 Decembe</span><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span><br><br>SINGAPORE: Foreign Affairs Minister George Yeo thinks attention in the next General Election will be more spread out. <br><br>That
               would be unlike the 2006 polls where the contest for the Aljunied GRC, 
              where he led a 5-member PAP team against a team from the Workers' Party,
               became the centre of national attention. <br><br>Mr Yeo also thinks the opposition may have more potential candidates for the next General Election. <br><br>As to when the next polls may take place, <strong>Mr Yeo's guess: before the middle of next year.<br></strong><br>The next General Election is due before February 2012.<br><br>In
               the 2006 polls, Aljunied GRC was hotly contested and the PAP team won 
              narrowly - 56.09 percent of the votes against the Workers' Party's 43.91
               percent.<br><br>Mr Yeo was speaking on the sidelines of the Standard Chartered Marathon Singapore 2010 where he took part in the 10km race.<br><br>Mr
               Yeo said: "The important thing is: having won a mandate to carry out 
              promises, (you must be) true to them (voters) and to serve your 
              residents. I think those of us who have done so should feel quite 
              relaxed about it. In the end voters will decide right, it is a secret 
              ballot. And they will not judge you by what you do in the last few days 
              or last few weeks or even last few months.<br><br>"People are asking me:
               when are elections coming? I say, well not so soon, probably before 
              next half of next year but we don't know. PM (Lee Hsien Loong) keeps the
               cards very close to his chest but I think that is the way it should be.
               (Meantime), just do what you ought to do and have an attitude of 
              service, politics is a service industry. "<br><br>On whether he will use
               more of the new media, considering that a lot of the electorate will be
               younger and more savvy with it, Mr Yeo, who has an active Facebook 
              account, said: "I have been at it for many years, so I will continue 
              doing it. I don't think I will step up the activities because that would
               seem false or unnatural. I just do what I have done and I have many 
              friends who are quite comfortable at the pace. We keep up communication 
              in the social media. But it's been fun, Facebook and the Internet 
              generally."<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span><span class="update">r 2010 1650 hrs<br><strong><br>Source:</strong><a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1097363/1/.html"><br>http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1097363/1/.html</a><br></span></p>
