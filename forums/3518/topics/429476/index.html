              <p>You even asked us 3 questions which is stupid as you are crediting PAP with your points.</p>
              <p>"1)Are you better off today than you were 5 years ago? You're saying no but some people say its not the governments fault that you're not better of today. Because many things happen in this world <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">and many things did happen in the last 5 years. What the government can do is to help you better prepare for problems before they happen and after they happen, to help you better deal with them so that you will have hope for the future and in the future, you will be better prepared to deal with what problems may come."</span></strong> </p>
              <p>Excuse me Dr. Mao? Why is your approach to deal with our problems similar to PAP?</p>

              <p>"3) Do you think with the workers party representing you in parliament, providing the checks and balances and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">competition that you need,</span></strong> do you think you get better government policy?</p>
              <p>Hello? since when we willingly pay you to enter parliament just to create competition? If your job so easy, like that might as well get cheaper alternatives to replace you to represent us in parliament. You are supposed to ensure that the government policy change for the good not make it appear to us that its not possible yet even with your presence in parliament. If like that, might as well we force PAP to field only candidates specially chosen by us so that they become our voice in parliament.</p>
              <p>Btw, can somebody please check of this Dr. Mao is from PAP because of his stupid comments? If you are, please don't make us feel like fools. had enough!</p>

              <p>Hopefully workers party quickly get all these corrected for the benefit of supporters and potential ones. If we want positive changes for singapore, we must be thorough of what we deliver as speeches to the citizens and keep up to our promise.</p>

              <p>Hi Keen, sorry sir but never call a lady dude and don't think you will ever regard your female companions voice of opinions as barking. Nagging would be nicer, thank you.</p>
              <p>I just want Dr. Mao to get his facts right and not simply blurt out like the other side. Every vote counts and it must begin with giving us the right perspective through our speeches.</p>

              <p>When he asked are "you more hopeful today vs 5 years ago", he was asking a rhetorical question (a question to which you already know the answer), and trying to show that Singaporeans are more concerned now about various issues.</p>

              <p>Hi Keen,</p>
              <p>I just have the view that we should not have or should never use rhetorical questions approach. My reason to this is that not everyone would be able to capture the essence of the message being delivered. The simpler it is to understand our message, the more supporters we gain. Just my 2 cents worth and peace :)</p>
