              <p>1. first things first: germany DID not have one million ppl; Her population was easily at 40million. APPARENTLY you DONT know your history well enough to argue.</p>
              <p>2. u want to argue on his little dictatorship? fine then. firstly, the nazi party NEVER, let me repeat that, EVER had even a 50% dominance EVER in the parliament, egt it? despite the fact the millions turned up to cheer him like he was a king, in reality barely 44% of the electorate ACTUALLY supported him. HE DID NOT BECOME DICTATOR BY WINNING THE ELECTION. HE COULD NOT. he had to kill his own ppl and threaten the chancellor to become dictator. GET IT? have u not gotten my point or u just dont have a clue on who hitler even was?</p>
              <p>3. here's the thing: at rallies, millions show up cheering their heads off, but HOW MANY actually r supporter? HOW MANY ACTUALLY leave the rallies convinced? CAN U TELL? is that not the reason why we trust elections better than headcounts at the rallies? BECAUSE HEADCOUNTS ARENT EVEN ACCURATE.</p>
              <p>4. its not logical for ur claim on many turn up for hitler that's why he got the so-called majority vote u claim. READ UR HISTORY. FYI: the socialists were catching up, the commies were hot on his heels. NOT ONCEdid the nazi party ever receive 50% vote dominance.</p>
              <p>5.now u see the point here? so many ppl turn up to cheer and cheer, but if it is as u  say then, that 100% r supporters, why didnt hitler become dictator straight away in1930 then, instead of waiting four long years, and murdering his own childhood friend then? dun give me that little millions crap, cos ur claim is practically non-existent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. so many ppl turn up at the ralllies, but let me ask u this, every year in singapore, so many ppl attend the rallies, by opposition, but how many come and how many actually leaved convinced r two DIFFERENT things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7.now please, before u try to argue like a smart-aleck on hitler with me, go read it up first, cos ur claims r so shocking and illogical i almost laughed my teeth off:)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>1) That's why you were wrong in stating that the millions that turned up at Hitler's rally actually voted for him, he would have obtained 90% majority. You understand where your logic went wrong? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> On the other hand lots of people turned up for the opposition rallies, but still they didn't get the majority votes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> You are wrong again! Germany's population from 1933 to 1939 ranged from 66 million to 87 million depending on the borders and region you want to include. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) When you have 44% of the electorate, the rest being 15%, 20% and 21%, and so long as the other parties cannot get the majority to form government, he has the magical 51%, he will still have the overall say in government. Get it? You don't need 90% to be a dictator, Benito Musolini only did it with around 60%. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Maybe they are all PAP supporters going to opposition rallies. Our election process isn't even fair to begin with, with suprise polling day, gerrymeandering, total media control. It's easy for those who don't know how to think to be easily swayed by what they see on the media. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) How many times must you tell me things which I already told you? They did not receive 50%, but you don't need above 50% to form government if there is no opposition coalition to form an alternative government. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) How many times must I explain to you that the millions that turned up does not equate to 100% or 90% the population of Germany? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>I quote from your earlier post:  "<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">if the'millions' that turned up in hitler's rallies voted for him, he would have become dictator with a 90% dominance in parliament long ago</span></strong>, not needing to wait for years with underhand tactics."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6) It's anybody's guess, I guess you know the number of folks leaving the rallies convinced.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7) I am no smart aleck, but I am definitely smarter than you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One again millions that turned up for Hitler's speeches does not equate to 100% the population of Germany. One, two or three million that turns up for the speeches do not equate to 90% of the population. You need to get that thru that head of yours. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>once again, u just dun get it do u? how big exactly was the german electorate? how many ppl actually turned up for the rallies? more than enough to, if like u say, secure at least a 50% majority. the fact is, so many came, barely half voted. get it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI: lets put some facts out then, shall we? in total, the turnout for his rallies throughout germany easily reached close to 30 million for hitler. and what? he barely made it in the parliament to 50%. mussolini was different. NO, he did not achive power legally. YOU, my friend did not read up on ur history again, so whos the smart aleck? if u did read up on ur history, mussolini had huge crowds of followers everywhre he went, especially in the election rallies. GUESS WHAT? in 1920, his party barely got 23 seats in a 600 seat parliament. even 5 years later, NEVER ONCE, NO EVER ONCE, did mussolini ever get a 60% majority, so dun try to fool me with ur numbers.</p>
              <p>Mussolini, my dear friend also faced the same dillema. he had to either seize power illegally or wait decades for the electoral success(which by the way, failed all thwe way, no hope for even 30%), hence the march on rome, 1920, where he did NOT seize power legally thru wat u imagine to be an 'electoral' success. he did that thru force. even after he seized power, his new govt was allowed barely 14 fascists because wat? his so-called masses of supporters apparently didnt vote enough.</p>
              <p>dont u get it? a rally turout does not equall the real popularity of a party. WHY do u think they use a brilliant device called ELECTION? WHY? because an headcount on a rally turnout has proved time and again to be inaccurate. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And again, both hitler and mussolini commanded national reputation and popularity in their rallies from millions upon millions of spectators. who voted? barely half.</p>
              <p>i dunno, logic missing here? u even got ur facts on mussolini wrong again. :)</p>

              <p>once again, u just dun get it do u? how big exactly was the german electorate? how many ppl actually turned up for the rallies? more than enough to, if like u say, secure at least a 50% majority. the fact is, so many came, barely half voted. get it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI: lets put some facts out then, shall we? in total, the turnout for his rallies throughout germany easily reached close to 30 million for hitler. and what? he barely made it in the parliament to 50%. mussolini was different. NO, he did not achive power legally. YOU, my friend did not read up on ur history again, so whos the smart aleck? if u did read up on ur history, mussolini had huge crowds of followers everywhre he went, especially in the election rallies. GUESS WHAT? in 1920, his party barely got 23 seats in a 600 seat parliament. even 5 years later, NEVER ONCE, NO EVER ONCE, did mussolini ever get a 60% majority, so dun try to fool me with ur numbers.</p>
              <p>Mussolini, my dear friend also faced the same dillema. he had to either seize power illegally or wait decades for the electoral success(which by the way, failed all thwe way, no hope for even 30%), hence the march on rome, 1920, where he did NOT seize power legally thru wat u imagine to be an 'electoral' success. he did that thru force. even after he seized power, his new govt was allowed barely 14 fascists because wat? his so-called masses of supporters apparently didnt vote enough.</p>
              <p>dont u get it? a rally turout does not equall the real popularity of a party. WHY do u think they use a brilliant device called ELECTION? WHY? because an headcount on a rally turnout has proved time and again to be inaccurate. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And again, both hitler and mussolini commanded national reputation and popularity in their rallies from millions upon millions of spectators. who voted? barely half.</p>
              <p>i dunno, logic missing here? u even got ur facts on mussolini wrong again. :)</p>

              <p>30 million turnout for Hitler's speeches? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Which stadium current or past can accomodate that capacity? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The world's current biggest stadium is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rungrado_May_Day_Stadium">Rungrado May Day Stadium</a>, it can take in a capacity crowd of 150,000, if you cast some "magical spell" a la Harry Potter to increase the capacity by 10 times, you will still only have 1.5 million. 30 million? What are you smoking? Maths fail? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times-Roman; font-size: small;"><em>"Mussolini’s first move was to bring an end to the years of weak coalition governments. By the Acerbo Law of 1923, the party gaining the greatest number of votes would win two-thirds of the parliamentary seats. It was not obvious at this time that the fascists would benefit from this law. His next move was to transform the legalised Blackshirts into the Volunteer Militia for national Security (MVSN). Its members swore allegiance to Mussolini not to the king. He encouraged the MVSN to use violence and intimidation during the election campaign of April 1914 so that the result was a victory for the fascists. <strong>They secured 64% of the votes and their two-thirds majority."</strong></em></span></p>
