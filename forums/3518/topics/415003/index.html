              <p>Why Singapore voters can't be bothered to turn up at PAP elections rallies?</p>
              <p>If opposition organises a political rally during elections, Singaporeans will turn up, but if PAP organises a political rally during elections, most people can't be bothered to show.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>

              <p>The PM got it right when he said there's a lot of hoo haa at opposition rallies but majority will still vote PAP. 66.6%....there are a lot of those who will vote PAP but go to such rallies simply because they have never felt such an atmosphere before.</p>
              <p>And I truly thank them because the PAP has implemented so many wonderful policies since 2006.</p>

              <p><br>which is exactly my point isnt it? u jus cant compare rallies with popularity(REAL one). just look at hitler. not his political stand, but his election campaigns. millions upon millions amass at his rallies, but in reality, barely 40% of the elecorate actually supported him. get it?</p>
              <p>in the reichstag(parliament), his nazi party couldnt get even 45% majority, and yet his rallies amassed millions of screaming crowds. get the logic?</p>

              <p>Hitler's rally popularity resulted in him coming out tops in the polls, though he did not have the 50% majority (which could be the result of having too many parties). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Strange thing in Singapore is, the rally popularity in opposition is extremely good compared to PAP, but opposition still didn't win the majority seats in parliament. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe the opposition should conduct an exit poll to better understand how the electorate voted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>You don't need 90% dominance in parliament to be a dictator, you can do so with only 66.6% of the electorate. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>The population in Germany back then wasn't a million, so how do you justify that the million equates to more than 50% of the population? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's logical, not many turned up for rallies for those parties opposed to Hitler's Nazi Germany, that's why Hitler got the majority vote. But then many turned up for the opposition rallies in Singapore, but the opposition didn't get the majority vote, that's why something in the electoral process is screwed here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>If all Singaporean kaypo, then they would have also gone to the PAP rallies to kaypo. But why is the turnout for PAP rallies so low.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I heard from folks that those people who attended the PAP rallies are those from the grassroots, they specially charter buses to fetch these grassroots people to the rallies. If you look closely at the PAP rally participants (in the pictures above), you will notice that a majority of them wear white, whereas those that attend the opposition rallies has no distinct dress code. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Let me contribute.</p>
              <p>The reason for such a massive turnout at opposition rallies is coz half or even more of the attendees are not even from the constituency thats under contest!</p>
              <p>When i was at the WP hougang rally in the last GE , hordes of people came but who are they? take me for example , my ward was a walkover . I drove from the west all the way to the north east just to support and listen to WP. standing beside me , the person in front , the person behind were all not from hougang SMC.</p>
              <p>But this time round , my ward is under contest from RP , i dont have to travel that far anymore to lend my support :)</p>

              <p>1. first things first: germany DID not have one million ppl; Her population was easily at 40million. APPARENTLY you DONT know your history well enough to argue.</p>
              <p>2. u want to argue on his little dictatorship? fine then. firstly, the nazi party NEVER, let me repeat that, EVER had even a 50% dominance EVER in the parliament, egt it? despite the fact the millions turned up to cheer him like he was a king, in reality barely 44% of the electorate ACTUALLY supported him. HE DID NOT BECOME DICTATOR BY WINNING THE ELECTION. HE COULD NOT. he had to kill his own ppl and threaten the chancellor to become dictator. GET IT? have u not gotten my point or u just dont have a clue on who hitler even was?</p>
              <p>3. here's the thing: at rallies, millions show up cheering their heads off, but HOW MANY actually r supporter? HOW MANY ACTUALLY leave the rallies convinced? CAN U TELL? is that not the reason why we trust elections better than headcounts at the rallies? BECAUSE HEADCOUNTS ARENT EVEN ACCURATE.</p>
              <p>4. its not logical for ur claim on many turn up for hitler that's why he got the so-called majority vote u claim. READ UR HISTORY. FYI: the socialists were catching up, the commies were hot on his heels. NOT ONCEdid the nazi party ever receive 50% vote dominance.</p>
              <p>5.now u see the point here? so many ppl turn up to cheer and cheer, but if it is as u  say then, that 100% r supporters, why didnt hitler become dictator straight away in1930 then, instead of waiting four long years, and murdering his own childhood friend then? dun give me that little millions crap, cos ur claim is practically non-existent.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6. so many ppl turn up at the ralllies, but let me ask u this, every year in singapore, so many ppl attend the rallies, by opposition, but how many come and how many actually leaved convinced r two DIFFERENT things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>7.now please, before u try to argue like a smart-aleck on hitler with me, go read it up first, cos ur claims r so shocking and illogical i almost laughed my teeth off:)</p>
