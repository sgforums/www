              <div class="entry-content" style="font-size: 1.2em; line-height: 1.8em; text-align: justify; color: #444444; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The biggest sign midway through the recent election campaign that the People’s Action Party knew it was in trouble was when none other than the prime minister himself said “sorry” twice at a rally held in the financial district on 3 May 2011.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">But if you look carefully at what he said, the errors he admitted were errors of execution or implementation. Nowhere did he concede that any of his government’s policies were wrong or had caused suffering. His promise to “do better the next time” was one of smoother implementation of the same policies, not of changing course.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a style="color: #2277dd; text-decoration: none; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;" href="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pic_201105_42.gif"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4292" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 5px; float: left; display: inline; max-width: 100%; padding: 4px; border: 1px solid #cccccc;" title="pic_201105_42" src="http://yawningbread.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/pic_201105_42.gif?w=101&amp;h=300" alt="" width="101" height="300"></a>Furthermore, the specific examples he apologised for were accidents or acts of God that were poorly responded to, such as the escape of Mas Selamat Kastari or the flooding of Orchard Road. The big issues  — widening income gap, immigration and preference schemes for foreigners, public housing pricing policy that contains an inherent bias towards escalating prices — he hardly touched on in any substantive way.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">I suggest you read the Straits Times article (at left) again and see for yourself.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">It was also noticeable that as far as I know, no cabinet minister echoed PM Lee Hsien Loong’s words in the days following. Most of them kept their heads down. As I have told several reporters who asked me for an opinion, I do not know whether</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(a) this was an election tactic or genuine on the prime minister’s part, nor</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(b) the promise “not to lord it over people” will not be forgotten once the election passed, nor</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(c) other ministers will block him from carrying out any meaningful reform, even if Lee was personally sincere about it.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">To mean anything, these words have to be backed by action. I think the following ten-point plan should be the minimum proof of sincerity:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The First Manifesto</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">1.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Drop the following ministers from the new cabinet to be formed: Vivian Balakrishnan, Wong Kan Seng, Mah Bow Tan, Lee Kuan Yew</span></strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">2. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Halve ministerial salaries immediately.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">3. Publish the full accounts for the Youth Olympic Games.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">4. Henceforth publish the transactional prices at which the Housing and Development Board pays the Singapore Land Authority for land.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">5.<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> Henceforth peg selling prices of new public housing as follows:</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(a) smaller flats pegged to the mean of the 3nd decile of houshold income;</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(b) mid-sized flats pegged to the mean of the 4th and 5th decile of houshold income;</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">(c) larger flats pegged to the mean of the 6th decile of household income.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">6. Complete all urban rail projects on time and initiate construction of two more metro rail lines by the end of the next parliamentary term.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">7. Promise to achieve a reduction of the Gini coefficient of household income of Singapore citizen households to 40 by the end of the next parliamentary term, with a longer-term Gini target of something in the mid-30′s. The Gini coefficient of household income is a measure of the income gap between the rich and the poor and a reduction of the Gini coefficient means the shrinking of this income gap; effectively it means lifting people out of poverty and addressing the problems of an escalating cost of living. There are multiple ways of doing this; the exact tools can be left to the government to decide so long as the target is achieved.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">8. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No increase in the total population (citizens + permanent residents + foreigners) by more than 0.5 percent per annum</span></strong>.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">9. Abolish group representation constituencies and create a new, independent Elections Commission with rules as to how to draw up electoral boundaries that are compact and topographically sensible and with voter population in any constituency not to vary by more than 10 percent from the mean of all constituencies.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">10. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Repeal the Internal Security Act.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">The above are what I think will be needed to mollify widespread frustration, and banish scepticism that the apology is just an election gimmick. But do not mistake the ten points for what will satisfy me. These alone will not be enough to win me over. I will want another ten more:</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Second Manifesto</strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">11. Introduce proportional representation for at least one-third of the seats in Parliament.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">12. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Require all members of parliament to work as such (and as heads of respective town councils) fulltime, except if they take up political appointments in government.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">13. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lower the candidature qualification requirements for the presidency.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">14. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publish accounts of our sovereign wealth funds.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">15. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Detach all magistrates,  judges and judicial officers from the Executive branch; locate them in a separate Judicial branch overseen by an independent commission responsible to its charter and  the President; the commission to have the power to appoint judges. All Supreme Court judges should have fixed tenure to retirement age and no judge shall have renewable terms or term extensions as is presently the case.</span></strong></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">16. Set up a comprehensive healthcare safety net</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">17. Abolish the death penalty</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">18. Abolish the Societies Act</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">19. Abolish all censorship, leaving only a rating system in place; abolish collateral controls (e.g. venue licensing, good-behaviour bonds) that make certain rating classifications censorship in all but name; and last but certainly not least,</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 13px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 13px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">20. Repeal Section 377A of the Penal Code, and inscribe into the constitution guarantees for non-discrimination on grounds of gender and sexual orientation, in accordance with United Nations human rights standards.</p>

              <p>No wonder you lot are feeling the squeeze of hyper-inflation when you need to compete with cheap foreign labour on third world wages for overpriced "public" housing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Ironically, if your grossly overpaid leaders are actually enjoying $700, 000 "condominium subsidies" and still having need to resort to frivolous defamation lawsuits (incidentally, the quantum awarded is actually more than sufficient to buy the condo at the original, undiscounted price <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> ) to suppress the release of such information to the public, is it any wonder why they are too disconnected from reality to understand your woes? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

Why should this case not be handled like any other case? It was time to stand up to Lee Kuan Yew and say ‘No,’ although he’s very important and his power is awful.

Our ideals, our passion hasn’t changed. But our policies have been updated, our approach has shifted, our style has changed. You know MM’s style. He tells it like it is. When he tells you something, you know exactly what he is thinking and what he is talking about – straight from the shoulder — no ifs, no buts, solid hard talk.</p>

And we discuss this often in cabinet, and MM says why don’t you do things in a certain way. Proceed, its important, critical for Singapore. And we say, yes we understand,</span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"> but please let us do it our way, because we are different from you, and I think Singaporeans – it’s a different generation from the Singaporeans</span></span></strong><span style="color: #202020;"> who worked with you and built this Singapore in the 1950s, in the 1960s and ‘70s.

              <p>Limiting foreigners to 0.5% per annum will not be done unless it is
              put into the constitution in BLACK n WHITE. If Lee Hsien Loong simply
              VERBALLY PROMISES to limit foreigner intake to 0.5%, PAP will secretly
              import more and more foreign talent without publicising it.</p>
              <p>PAP
              thinks that granting near-instant citizenship to foreign talent will
              guarantee them votes in the next election. I can tell u that this idea
              will backfire.</p>
              <p>Once foreign professional citizens from China and
              India find that their salary or living conditions no longer lucrative,
              they will use their Singapore citizenship to find better pastures in
              another country. Perhaps they even know of better pastures in the
              countries they come from and they will return to their country a
              millionaire holding a Singapore passport to show off to their
              compatriots.</p>
              <p>In the same way, this goes for naturalised angmo foreign
              professionals. Besides all that, with the angmo's ingrained notions of
              'human rights', do you think they will vote for PAP dictatorship?</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">There is nothing like someone who has been born and raised in Singapore</span></strong>.
              Most natural born Singapore citizens have an indescribable emotional
              sentiment that instinctively tells them that Singapore is their home
              and their only home.</p>
              <p>No foreigner can fill this role.</p>
              <p>If
              PAP just promises verbally to limit foreign talent, you can be sure
              they will import even more foreign talent. Never trust PAP.</p>

              <p>You are correct, the operation of the Ministries must be set out by laws of Parliament. Like every developed country in the world. Otherwise they can do what they want.</p>
              <p>Quote Cherian George,</p>
              <p>First of all, the opposition's presence in the next Parliament still
              amounts to less than 7 percent of elected seats. This is at most a
              speed bump, not a barrier, on PAP's road to writing or rewriting laws.
              Besides, life in Singapore is not just shaped by statutes. It is also
              governed through subsidiary regulations and administrative decisions
              that don't go through Parliament. As observed decades ago by political
              scientist Chan Heng Chee, ours is a political system designed to give
              maximum leeway to the executive branch.</p>

              <p>I dont't understand what you mean. CCL <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> Promenade.</p>
              <p>NEL is not going anywhere near Promenade, DTL only.</p>
              <p>If you ask me DTL is already at Bukit Panjang, should stretch it a few meters to CCK.  Take the strain off NSEWL, which I don't believe will improve much after the upgrades.</p>

              <p><br>tat's why ops details not many ppl know.</p>
              <p>The plan is to make e CCL a real circle by linking HBF with Bayfront &amp; Promenade, leaving Dhoby Ghaut - Promenade a spur line. But right now I dun think it makes sense to build either.</p>
              <p>Well, there's e BPLRT. It also helps to better utilised both LRT directions, right now I believe it's pretty bias where trains are packed to CCK, empty into Bt Panjang.</p>

              <p>BPLRT is time-wasting, slow, low capacity and breakdown prone. I believe linking DTL to CCK is very logical, after Gali Batu it can follow the KJE to CCK.</p>

              <p><br>In fact if you noticed the Int layout at Promenade, it resembles City Hall &amp; Raffles Place. So defintely there's another cross interchange planned w/ DTL.</p>
              <p>Well, the thing is since there's BPLRT and loading is pretty lobsided for now, make full use of it.</p>
              <p>The maintenance goes all well with the poor design.</p>
