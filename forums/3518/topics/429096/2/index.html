Cast your vote wisely. Before you cast your vote, just ask ourselves some of these questions:- 1- Where in the world can so many citizens own their own house and at a very young age? 2- How can we afford to buy the best gadgets, the biggest slim TV, the biggest fridge, the expensive cars and many others? 3- How many country where their citizens can afford and have the freedom to travel as often as they like? 4- Why all the children have the chance to go to school to be educated? 5- Why our friends and relatives don't need to work abroad as labourers or as maids? I travel often and I can feel a see the good life we have here in Singapore. My oversea friends envy the big and comfortable HDB flats we have, the nice enviroment we live in, the nice school our children go to, and many other nice things we have here. Cast your vote wisely, vote for our future, vote for our children's future. If the opposition is able to offer us a better future, go ahead and vote for them. Don't support them to oppose just for the sake of opposing. Remember, talk is cheap. Are they able to see us thru crisis? Are they able to accumulate plenty of reserve for emergency? Are they able to create jobs and retain job in economy downtourns? Are they able to mantain the safe environment we enjoy? And many many more good things in life we have now? I will vote for PAP here. But if they don't perform for the country, for the people, then I will vote them out in the next election.</p></div>

              <p>I don't see the need to see my MP every now and then. What I prefer to see is what they have done for the people. I would prefer them to be busy with what they are supposed to do and not just going round to shake hands. If I have a problem I know where to look for him, at the meet-the-people session. Cast your vote wisely. Before you cast your vote, just ask ourselves some of these questions:- 1- Where in the world can so many citizens own their own house and at a very young age? 2- How can we afford to buy the best gadgets, the biggest slim TV, the biggest fridge, the expensive cars and many others? 3- How many country where their citizens can afford and have the freedom to travel as often as they like? 4- Why all the children have the chance to go to school to be educated? 5- Why our friends and relatives don't need to work abroad as labourers or as maids? I travel often and I can feel a see the good life we have here in Singapore. My oversea friends envy the big and comfortable HDB flats we have, the nice enviroment we live in, the nice school our children go to, and many other nice things we have here. Cast your vote wisely, vote for our future, vote for our children's future. If the opposition is able to offer us a better future, go ahead and vote for them. Don't support them to oppose just for the sake of opposing. Remember, talk is cheap. Are they able to see us thru crisis? Are they able to accumulate plenty of reserve for emergency? Are they able to create jobs and retain job in economy downtourns? Are they able to mantain the safe environment we enjoy? And many many more good things in life we have now? I will vote for PAP here. But if they don't perform for the country, for the people, then I will vote them out in the next election.</p>

              <p>Because its one of those farking cards that says they came to see you but you were not around. The night Sam Tan did his walk around radin mas, those living in that area not being around reported getting the same farking cards.
