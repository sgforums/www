              </p><p>According to the Election Dept, it said that tracking is only in theory, may or may not be able to track. Have not try yet since the first election.</p>
              <p>Anyway, do you how much manpower is needed to try out this theory. This election alone alot of manpower needed. You think they are going to waste 1000 staff to sift through millions of voting slips. Where are they going to do it, need a big open space and lots of transportation also. All this just to find out who you or your family or friends voted for. Must be crazy right. Would you do it yourself logically?</p>
              <p>The appropriate way is to use computation like you do in school or University to derive an estimation. The number of voters in a constituency is fixed. The percentage of votes is also known. The boundary of the constituency also known. From the estimation, it will give you a map segmented by constituencies and their boundary. There would some with better percentage and some lower. Just redraw the boundary base on these estimates you would be assured a balance spread of voters. That's why you see there is always changes in boundary. Don't believe just check with your friends, some don't even know which constituency they belong to as it keep changing.</p>

              <p>As expected :) For a political tsunami to really happen, crowds have to throng stadium rallies in the region of 30-50 thousand. If you see a few thousand people attending an opposition rally, then you knw there's no hope liao.</p>
              <p>No wonder PM was so confident of a good showing. They had 80 out of 82 seats in parliament prior to this, now they still have 80 seats, albeit out of 87. It's an outright victory for them despite their loss. And PM has the highest mandate out of any GRC, so it's a sweet victory for him still. No complaints for me....I pretty much expected it. And as a resident of Aljunied, it can only be good news cos both PAP and WP will be fawning all attention on us.</p>
