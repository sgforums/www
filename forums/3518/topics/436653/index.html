              Leopards and spots by Siew Kum Hong http://siewkumhong.blogspot.com/
              
              It is as if the PAP is determined to prove that leopards cannot change their spots. The People's Association can try its best to spin the truth, but the latest revelation from the Workers' Party completely destroys any plausible deniability that could possibly be left.
              
              The Workers' Party's revelation has to be read to be believed, but in a nutshell, the HDB had the brazen nerve to lease some prime spots for grassroots events - apparently previously by the PAP-controlled Aljunied Town Council - to the People's Association. This was done quickly after the General Elections, on 27 May and 13 June, and apparently without any announcement or publication anywhere. On 15 August, the PA informed Sylvia Lim, Chairman of Aljunied-Hougang Town Council, that "bookings by WP will not be allowed".
              
              This is offensive on so many levels. The HDB needs to explain why it did what it did, and the timing for those actions. Why did it suddenly lease those areas to the PA, after the PAP lost Aljunied GRC, when those areas had previously been managed by the town council? Has it ever leased such areas to the PA in other constituencies ? What was the criteria for choosing those areas?
              
              As for the PA, this drives the final nail through its pretense of being a true grassroots organisation -- as opposed to a state-funded para-political organisation used as a mobilisation vehicle by the ruling party. If it was truly non-political, it would not issue a blanket refusal to lease these areas to the Workers' Party.
              
              Many will consider me naive, but I had hopes after the General Elections that the PAP would truly learn its lessons, and become a fair and just party truly focused on doing the right thing for all Singaporeans -- instead of working for the party's own narrow interests. I now see that that was too much to hope for.
              
              Before May 7, I had privately predicted that GE2016 would be Singapore's equivalent of Malaysia's GE2008, when the opposition tsunami rocked the long-time ruling coalition. I did not see that happening this year. After May 7, I thought that the PAP still had a chance of avoiding an opposition tsunami in the next elections.
              
              Well, let's just say that the PAP MPs and prospective candidates better have a Plan B in 2016, in case they lose. Many of them will likely need to use it.

              HDB abusing its power as land owner, says WP
              By Joanne Chan | Posted: 22 August 2011 2333 hrs
                	Workers' Party
                	
              
              	
               
              
              SINGAPORE: The Workers' Party (WP) has accused the HDB of abusing its power as land owner by transferring the management rights of 26 common areas from the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council to the People's Association.
              
              It also said that the PA has curtailed the ground presence of the elected WP MPs by warning residents who apply for permits to hold events at these sites not to invite the elected WP MPs or risk having their applications turned down in subsequent years.
              
              The WP took over the town council from the ruling People's Action Party (PAP), following their win at the General Election in May.
              
              In a statement to the media, WP chairman Sylvia Lim said the town council received an email from HDB on June 21, informing them of a list of sites to be excluded from their management.
              
              This included 26 sites which had previously been managed by the former Aljunied Town Council under the PAP, said Ms Lim.
              
              She noted that "no background nor rationale was given for the decision".
              
              Ms Lim said many of the sites are strategically located, being hard courts or amphitheatres which are highly suitable for organising social activities.
              
              She said the Aljunied-Hougang Town Council also wanted to explore the joint use of the sites with the PA. However, an email from PA dated June 15 indicated that "booking (of the sites) by WP will not be allowed", said Ms Lim.
              
              Ms Lim also said residents of Paya Lebar who applied for permits to hold the lunar Seventh Month events at the sites were told verbally that they could not invite the elected WP MPs or risk their applications being turned down in future.
              
              However, the former PAP MPs are not under such restraints as they are invited as "advisors" to the grassroots organisations. Ms Lim said such actions would give PAP candidates a ground advantage and permanent presence in advance preparation for the next elections.
              
              Responding to media queries, the HDB said it adjusts its list of sites managed by a town council from time to time and this is based on legitimate requests from relevant agencies or civic organisations.
              
              HDB said in this case, PA requested tenancy for the sites to organise community activities. The request was approved as PA had been using the sites frequently, added HDB.
              
              Also responding was the PA which said the practice of leasing public spaces for community activities is not new, nor is it peculiar to Aljunied GRC. It added that the Citizens' Consultative Committees under the PA may rent various sites across Singapore for community activities.
              
              The PA reiterated that it is non-partisan and does not allow any political party or MP to hold activities on PA premises or other facilities managed by the PA. And this applies to all political parties and MPs, including the PAP.
