              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : Several subsidiary rules under the Parliamentary Elections Act are coming into force from Friday.<br><br>The
               Chairman of the Law Revision Commission and Singapore's Attorney 
              General, Sundaresh Menon, made the announcement in the Government 
              Gazette.<br><br>According to the gazette notification, the rules coming into force are:<br><br>- the Parliamentary Elections (Malay Community Committee) Regulations<br><br>- the Parliamentary Elections (Indian and Other Minority Communities Committee) Regulations<br><br>- the Parliamentary Elections (Election Advertising Regulations) and <br><br>- the Parliamentary Elections (Registration Overseas Electors).<br><br>Under
               Singapore's election rules, at least one of the MPs in the group 
              representing a group representation constituency (GRC) must belong to a 
              minority racial community - either the Malay, Indian or other minority 
              communities.<br><br>By law, the President designates the GRCs whose MP must belong to one of these minority racial communities.<br><br>However,
               the number of GRCs that can be designated as those belonging to the 
              Malay community cannot be more than three-fifths the total number of 
              GRCs.<br><br>For the coming General Election, there will be 15 GRCs.<br><br>Those
               which must have a Malay community candidate are Sembawang, East Coast, 
              Pasir Ris-Punggol, Aljunied, Tampines, Marine Parade, Bishan-Toa Payoh, 
              Moulmein-Kallang and Chua Chu Kang GRCs.<br><br>Nee Soon, Ang Mo Kio, 
              Tanjong Pagar, Jurong, Holland-Bukit Timah and West Coast GRCs will have
               a candidate from the Indian and other minorities community.<br><br>Both committees are headed by prominent Singaporeans.<br><br>The
               latest gazette notification is yet another sign of the impending 
              dissolution of Parliament paving the way for Singapore's 14th General 
              Election.<br><br>Following the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee 
              Report, Singapore's next Parliament will have 87 wards comprising 12 
              single member seats and 15 GRCs.<br><br>There are some 2.35 million voters on the electoral register.<br><br>- CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>DETAILS of the two committees that will certify minority candidates in GRCs were released on Monday.</p>
              <p>Each five-member committee will confirm that candidates who claim to 
              be from the Malay, Indian and other minority communities are from those 
              racial groups.</p>
              <p>All 15 group representation constituencies (GRCs) must have at least 
              one Malay candidate, or a person belonging to the Indian or other 
              minority communities.</p>
              <p>The statement on the panels, released in the Government Gazette 
              online, is another indication that the General Glection might be

              <p>In the 2006 elections, committee members were made known one day 
              before the Writ of Election - which sets out Nomination Day - was 
              issued, along with the announcement on Polling Day.</p>
              <p>The committee members were nominated by the Presidential Council for Minority Rights and appointed by President S R Nathan.</p>
