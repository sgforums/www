              <p> To the United Nations, representing all of Humanity on Earth.</p>
              <p> Singapore is currently holding its 2011 General Elections. The nomination day is today, 27th April 2011, Wednesday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A group of 5 candidates consisting of independents are contesting the Tanjong Pagar Group Representative Constituency, against Mr Lee Kuan Yew and his team of 4 members from the People Action Party (PAP). 82 seats are confirmed to be contested these coming elections; however the 5 seats representing the Tanjong Pagar GRC are not.</p>
              <p> The 5-member opposition team, was disqualified because they had submitted their forms for nomination only late by 37 seconds. According to the law, it should be submitted between 11am to 12am. They submitted it at 12.00.37am. This is still within the time slot, as it does not specify clearly up to which nearest second. </p>
              <p>Please view the video attached on an account of what happened at the nomination centre held at Singapore Chinese Girls School. </p>
              <p>This is the account of what happened by the team that tried to contest there:</p>
              <p><a rel="nofollow" href="http://ge2011theonlinecitizen.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/toc-exclusive-why-sda-team-missed-deadline/"><span style="color: #0c739e;">http://ge2011theonlinecitizen.wordpress.com/2011/04/27/toc-exclusive-why-sda-team-missed-deadline/</span></a></p>
              <p>PAP has flouted other Elections Regulations, including displaying of their party flags all over Singapore. The Elections Department overseeing the elections is under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister Office. According to them, PAP did not flout the rule, as they were merely placing those flags at their branches. These branches are their PAP Community Foundation Early Childhood Education Centres and Child Cares. And the logos for these centres include the logo of PAP. And hence, flouting the law again, as they had displayed their party’s logo.</p>
              <p>Source of PCF logo: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_i9m7VUV5jcY/SXWRNSodcPI/AAAAAAAAATg/mWvd5dHBdrc/s400/community_PCF.gif"><span style="color: #0c739e;">http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_i9m7VUV5jcY/SXWRNSodcPI/AAAAAAAAATg/mWvd5dHBdrc/s400/community_PCF.gif</span></a></p>
              <p> There was also an incident of a PAP candidate, Sim Ann, that wrote she was unemployed on the nomination form, but according to the Ministry of Manpower, she is considered to be employed, as she was still on notice of resignation from civil service. The Elections Department decided to not to disqualify her.</p>
              <p> These are unfair elections proceedings in the Republic of Singapore, and the people of Singapore had come together to rally and raise election deposits for the contest at Tanjong Pagar GRC, and we are unfortunate that the state machinery has been used to the advantage of People Action Party, the ruling party for the past 40 over years since Singapore’s independence.</p>
              <p> We seek UN’s help in overturning the decision to disqualify the team that has tried to contest at Tanjong Pagar GRC against PAP’s team. We also require observation and supervision of fair elections in the Republic of Singapore.</p>
              <p> We hope in the name of humanity, the people of the world can come together to help this great nation achieve democracy through fair and honest elections proceedings.</p>
              <p> The polling day is on 7th May 2011, and there is not much time for intervention. We hope you take action on this as soon as possible.</p>
              <p> We, the people of Singapore, hope that you will let us exercise our power to vote for the politicians we want to represent us in the parliament.</p>
              <p> Thank you.</p>
              <p> From</p>
              <p>People of Singapore</p>
