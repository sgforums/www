              <h3 class="date_story">Apr 7, 2011- ST Forum</h3>
              <p>I REFER to Madam Monica Chia's letter, ('Rookie in single ward makes even less sense'; yesterday).</p>
              <p>What many people seem to have forgotten is that the group 
              representation constituency (GRC) was set up to ensure minority 
              representation in Parliament. The Government was rightly concerned that 
              voters might vote along racial lines. That would be disastrous for a 
              multiracial country like Singapore.</p>
              <p>Even though the GRC concept has its flaws, I am happy to 
              support it but up to a point. It is not meant for young people to sneak 
              into Parliament perched on the shoulders of a senior minister or any 
              other heavyweight minister. It would be an abuse of the system if we 
              allow it.</p>
              <p>Madam Chia pointed out that she would not vote for a young 
              candidate such as Ms Tin Pei Ling if she stands in a single-member 
              constituency because of her inexperience. But what about the candidates 
              from the opposition? Aren't they equally inexperienced?</p>
              <p>In fact, I would suggest that Ms Tin compete head-on with Mrs Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir.</p>
              <p>If Ms Tin wins in Potong Pasir, it will be a major blow to the opposition and will validate her capabilities.</p>

              <p>Mrs Chiam's a good woman trying to continue her husband's dream. She's definitely not tutored or nurtured to be a speaker or to be a politician, but thats what a good politician is, you do things from your heart for the people. I've heard only good things about her from friends and relatives living in PP. <strong>Actions speak louder than words.</strong> You can talk all day long about wanting to improve the life of the masses, and then when you get elected the next thing you do is open the floodgates for more FTs to occupy white collar jobs.</p>
              <p>TPL on the otherhand is the typical high IQ, low EQ politician which serves no purpose to the general population. There're already many incompetent politicians like her currently serving. Not to mention her dubious background makes her look like just another c***sucker. For someone with such good academic background, its frightening that she cannot relate to the problems of the low income. If such people can pass the hurdle to be politicians, its a case of the really capable people can't be bothered to join politics hence the need to make up the numbers with low EQ people like her.</p>

              <p><strong>GE: Are younger candidates ready?</strong></p>
              <p><span class="update">By S Ramesh | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 09 April 2011 1431 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: <span style="color: #ff0000;">People's 
              Action Party's (PAP) Chairman Lim Boon Heng said the party is close to 
              deciding whether the younger candidates it has been testing out will fit
               the bill in all the Group Representation Constituencies (GRC) and in 
              particular, Jurong GRC which he currently helms.</span><br><br>Speaking to the 
              media on the sidelines of the 25th anniversary celebrations of the PAP 
              Community Foundation in Jurong GRC, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr Lim said he does not rule out 
              surprises on Nomination Day, if necessary.</span><br><br>However, he said PAP is confident with the teams it is putting in place in the GRCs and the Single-Member Constituencies (SMCs).<br><br>For the coming general election, there will be 12 SMCs and 15 GRCs.<br><br>Mr
               Lim, who is also Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, remained 
              tight-lipped when asked if he would be moved to another GRC instead of 
              contesting in Jurong GRC, or if he would be the trump card for the PAP 
              if opposition MP Low Thia Khiang decides to contest a GRC.<br><br>Meanwhile,
               the National Solidarity Party (NSP) has indicated its interest to 
              contest in Jurong GRC and has announced its slate of candidates.<br><br>But Mr Lim said he hopes the NSP will let residents know their plans.<br><br>He
               added that all that has been heard of them is that they plan to live in
               Jurong and give 30 per cent of their MP allowance to help the 
              residents.<br><br>Mr Lim noted that in Jurong Central Division alone, S$1 million is raised for the benefit of residents each year.<br><br>"They
               (NSP members) are trying to convince the people that they are working 
              the ground but we know how hard they have worked," Mr Lim said.  <br><br>"I
               think they have made periodic visits to markets, occasional visits to 
              households, but it is only in the last few weeks that there is real 
              activity on their part. <br><br>"In contrast with what we do as serving 
              MPs, they are in their constituencies several times a week. We meet the 
              people every week and we attend many functions where we talk about 
              different policies which affect people. <br><br>"We talk about concerns that people on the ground may have with respect to their own locality. <br><br>"Therefore,
               the electorate would have to ask themselves during the campaign what 
              kind of people they want and how well you think they would serve the 
              people, what kind of commitment is evident."    <br><br>Also present at 
              the event on Saturday were two new candidates whom the PAP has already 
              introduced - Mr Desmond Lee and Mr David Ong -- as well as a potential 
              candidate who has been understudying in Jurong GRC, Mr Ang Wei Neng.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
