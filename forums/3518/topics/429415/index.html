              <div class="yom-mod yom-art-content">
              <div class="bd">
              <p>Singapore is a 
              nation of immigrants but its opposition parties are tapping into growing
               anti-foreigner sentiment among voters to win more parliamentary seats 
              in general elections on May 7.</p>
              <p>Foreigners are accused of stealing jobs, depressing wages and 
              straining housing, transport, schools, hospitals and other public 
              services, putting the ruling party on the defensive for easing 
              immigration rules in recent years.</p>
              <p>The People's Action Party (PAP), in power since 1959, is widely 
              expected to secure a comfortable majority but its opponents are hoping 
              to win far more than the two seats they held in the recently dissolved 
              84-member parliament.</p>
              <p>"Now every time I take the train, it feels like I'm in a different 
              country," 24-year-old opposition candidate Nicole Seah of the <span id="lw_1304217386_2" class="yshortcuts">National Solidarity Party</span> told a public rally on Thursday to boisterous cheers.</p>
              <p>"It is like taking a holiday. I don't even need to bring my 
              passport!" added Seah, an advertising professional who is the youngest 
              candidate in the polls.</p>
              <p>Singapore's population numbered 4.03 million in 2000, with 760,000 
              foreigners and the rest citizens and permanent residents, according to 
              government statistics.</p>
              <p>Last year, the population soared to 5.08 million with foreigners hitting an all-time high of 1.3 million.</p>
              <p>Singapore has long had a steady intake of foreigners but the 
              government markedly liberalised the admission of immigrants during the 
              economic boom from 2004-2007.</p>
              <p>With a birth rate far below what is needed to maintain population 
              levels, Singaporeans were told they needed "foreign talent" and young 
              immigrant families to keep the island economically competitive in the 
              long term.</p>
              <p>Sentiment began to worsen when the global economy collapsed in 
              2008-2009, and not even the record 14.5 percent economic growth in 2010 
              was enough to assuage Singaporeans' fears of being swamped by 
              foreigners.</p>
              <p>"They never asked us whether we wanted a huge increase in our 
              population," another opposition candidate, Vincent Wijeysingha of the <span id="lw_1304217386_1" class="yshortcuts">Singapore Democratic Party</span>, said at a rally on Thursday.</p>
              <p>"They never asked us if we expected such large numbers of people 
              working for such low salaries so that your salaries will also be pulled 
              down," he added.</p>
              <p>It's an ironic turn of events for a city-state founded on cheap 
              immigrant labour during British colonial rule, with most families 
              tracing their roots to <span id="lw_1304217386_0" class="yshortcuts">China</span>, India, Malaysia and <span id="lw_1304217386_7" class="yshortcuts">Indonesia</span>.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1304217386_6" class="yshortcuts">Reform Party secretary general Kenneth Jeyaretnam</span> said the poorest Singaporeans were the most affected by the presence of cheaper foreign labour.</p>
              <p>"The incomes of the poorest 20 percent of the population have 
              probably fallen by between 10 and 20 percent and this is all due to the 
              fact that we have an open-door immigration policy with no minimum wage,"
               said Jeyaretnam, who was a London-based financial executive before 
              plunging into politics.</p>
              <p>Eugene Tan, an assistant professor of law at the Singapore Management
               University, said it was not surprising that opposition parties were 
              milking the immigration issue.</p>
              <p>"It works up people very, very easily and it is something that you encounter on a daily basis," he told AFP.</p>
              <p>Kelvin Low, an assistant professor in the department of sociology at 
              the National University of Singapore, said the anti-immigration card was
               not unique to Singapore in the age of globalisation.</p>
              <p>"These are populist strategies undertaken to attract the attention of voters," he said.</p>
              <p>In reaction to the backlash, the government slowed the intake of 
              foreigners and reduced their social benefits, such as hospital and 
              school fee subsidies, while insisting that Singapore can never survive 
              without them.</p>
              <p>"By allowing in a controlled number of foreign workers, far from 
              disadvantaging our own people, we have created more good jobs for 
              Singaporeans and more opportunities in our economy," <span id="lw_1304217386_3" class="yshortcuts">Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong</span> said before the campaign began.</p>

These are jobs locals want to do, and the current govt is depriving us a chance to make a living by giving employers the option to choose between hiring a cheaper foreign talent, or a singaporean worker who is liable for reservist obligations and long long maternity leave.. <br><br>Clearly, a line has to be drawn.

              <p><br>the first thing when hiring a foreign talent is to look at his education, skills, experience, before an interview with him or her. remuneeration its up to eachcompany HR and finance to decide.</p>
              <p>however ther a re alot of policies, criteria in FT selections for the middle group that should be in place and constantly reviewed, refined, revised, tweaked so that only the worthy ones come here, not some very young and who come here and can even collect cardboxes to challenge jobs with our old people who cannot find work anymore. you can read all the media news and see them. now last minute howlain can come up with new proposeal to CREATE new jobs and opportunities for us - things they just always sing just change the lyrics a little. but we all know that the policies will do not good by chaging its presentation, initialy in word format now problably to ppowerpoint presentation. No! what we want is for them to roll out detailed plans on how they can fine tune, work at the ground level to ensure such policies work! if they don;t go as smmoth fine tune it from time to time. They alwasy say hippos got no concrete details on what they can do for the community add facilitis. come on bloody singapore is only 687km square.50 years still not enough to uopgrade everything? we seen it you just tear this one that one down and build new ones, change the soup never change the medicine. reason to hire more banglas dig upgraves and bury grave again! evey election use this upgarad ethat upgrade to sweet talk lick ppl asses. this type is like selling insurance, life policies with riders. anyone can see that. Voting oppos now is not about the vicnity and facilities now. 5 yrs won;t hurt. Its about getting more alternatives voices into parliament!</p>

              <p>perhaps you can also ask why she didn't take up citizenship much earlier, if she felt that much of a stake in Singapore, but only chose to take up citizenship just before joining the worker's party ... but my point is to illustrate the difference between someone whom I think has more of a stake in Singapore (Miss Oon), and someone I think who doesn't (Mr Chen).</p>

              <p>let's put it in another way ... suppose you migrated to australia, signed up for a short and peaceful stint in the ADF, but shortly afterwards disappeared for 30 years, back to singapore, to work ... and then go back to retire in australia 30 years later on the strength of your oz passport, still speaking with a thick foreign accent, and you decided too, you want to represent other australians in their parliament .....</p>
              <p>what kind of reception do you think you'd get ? ...how do you think the australians would receive you, honestly ? So why should Singaporeans lap it up when someone like that comes along, after 30 years, and try to be your elected political leader in our country ?</p>
              <p>I've said it before in other threads, if you imagine that chen show mao were to stand in this elections as a PAP candidate, the online flak he caught would have been so thick and furious ... but perplexingly, there's this ironic silence simply because he is an opposition candidate ?</p>

              <p>I shan't comment about Australia cos I don't really understand the politics there.  But I would say that I would look at the candidate's entire package.  Looking at Chen I think he makes a lot of sense when he talks, and he is really motivated to serve Singaporeans and the people of Aljunied.  I think that is the reason why the reaction to him has been very positive (go attend one of the rallies, if you have time)</p>
              <p>If Chen was rich, and didn't need a scholarship perhaps he wouldn't have needed to go overseas.  If my own parents were rich I perhaps don't need to care about this election.  But they are not, and I do.</p>

              <p><br>I think that's a bit naive and illogical.  U don't join a political party hoping to change it! Do you join the Communist Party hoping to move it away from communism!?</p>

              <p>I think Singaporeans deserve more than what they received in the
              past 5 years.</p>
              <p>I shan't comment about Australia cos I don't really understand
              the politics there.  But I would say that I would look at the
              candidate's entire package.  Looking at Chen I think he makes
              a lot of sense when he talks, and he is really motivated to serve
              Singaporeans and the people of Aljunied.  I think that is the
              reason why the reaction to him has been very positive (go attend
              one of the rallies, if you have time)</p>
              <p>If Chen was rich, and didn't need a scholarship perhaps he
              wouldn't have needed to go overseas.  If my own parents were
              rich I perhaps don't need to care about this election.  But
              they are not, and I do.</p>

              <p>let's be honest here, most people don't really give a shit who their opposition candidate is (save for a few resident lunatics like poh ah pak) and probably even less about opposition policies, but they are supporting the opposition this time around because the opposition is against the PAP.</p>
              <p>The opposition would do well to remember that the groundswell of support this time round is not so much as an affirmation of their candidates and policies, than a signal of protest against the PAP. And thinking voters would do well to remember also, like I said before, shit from any party is still shit, it'll be just as stupid to lap everything up and pretend it's chocolate just cos it's from an opposition party as it is to unthinkingly internalize everything the MIW says.</p>
              <p>There is always a third way .... not happy with the PAP ? don't vote for them ! ... not happy with silly opposition policies and candidates that's all flair and no substance ? don't vote for them either ! .... void and spoil your vote ! ....the PAP gets their wake up call .... and the opposition would know better than to send up any ah tur ah gau in 2016 ... so think carefully ... and not cut off your own penis just to spite a particular CB ...</p>
