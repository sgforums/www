              <p>let's be honest here, most people don't really give a shit who their opposition candidate is (save for a few resident lunatics like poh ah pak) and probably even less about opposition policies, but they are supporting the opposition this time around because the opposition is against the PAP.</p>
              <p>The opposition would do well to remember that the groundswell of support this time round is not so much as an affirmation of their candidates and policies, than a signal of protest against the PAP. And thinking voters would do well to remember also, like I said before, shit from any party is still shit, it'll be just as stupid to lap everything up and pretend it's chocolate just cos it's from an opposition party as it is to unthinkingly internalize everything the MIW says.</p>
              <p>There is always a third way .... not happy with the PAP ? don't vote for them ! ... not happy with silly opposition policies and candidates that's all flair and no substance ? don't vote for them either ! .... void and spoil your vote ! ....the PAP gets their wake up call .... and the opposition would know better than to send up any ah tur ah gau in 2016 ... so think carefully ... and not cut off your own penis just to spite a particular CB ...</p>

              <p>Actually, I do care about who my opposition candidates are.  If they cannot make it I won't vote for them.  But if they have the capabilities and the willingness to serve then we should vote for them</p>

              <p>my thinking is simple</p>
              <p>if you can accept what PAP have done then you vote for PAP</p>
              <p>If you believe tat opposition are required in the parliament to voice out your concerns then u vote for oppositions.</p>
              <p>Some PAPs are gud n some bad so do Oppositions - nobody or party is perfect</p>
              <p>so why dun we just let prove themselves and we can pick up the gud ones in the next election?</p>
              <p>Just state your criteria what a minister should be - patriotic, compassion, honesty...... blah blah blah</p>

              <p>of course, anyone has the right to advance him or herself overseas .... even right after getting his citizenship ...</p>
              <p>and every citizen has the right to stay away for 30 years, even new citizens, but if you think about it, would you neccessary want someone like that to be your political leader, your elected representive ? ...</p>
              <p>let's put it in another way ... suppose you migrated to australia, signed up for a short and peaceful stint in the ADF, but shortly afterwards disappeared for 30 years, back to singapore, to work ... and then go back to retire in australia 30 years later on the strength of your oz passport, still speaking with a thick foreign accent, and you decided too, you want to represent other australians in their parliament .....</p>
              <p>what kind of reception do you think you'd get ? ...how do you think the australians would receive you, honestly ? So why should Singaporeans lap it up when someone like that comes along, after 30 years, and try to be your elected political leader in our country ?</p>
              <p>I've said it before in other threads, if you imagine that chen show mao were to stand in this elections as a PAP candidate, the online flak he caught would have been so thick and furious ... but perplexingly, there's this ironic silence simply because he is an opposition candidate ?</p>
              <p>I think Singaporeans deserve better than this, I thought the WP has cleaned up their act and got rid of most of their fluff and deadweight since 2006, but foisting this man upon the electorate is a disappointing mockery ...... it would do well for all of us to remember than shit from any party is still shit.</p>
