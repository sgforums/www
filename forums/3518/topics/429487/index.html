              <p>The polling agent at the polling station is usually a <strong>volunteer member</strong> like<strong> you and me</strong> will check the name list for your name to confirm your presence. Don't worry they are not some secret agents, you probably have bump into them in the street or in the neighbourhood but could not remember. You can also volunteer yourselves as polling agents. During election lots of volunteers are needed, so if you are free and wants to do your part or national service for your country then goto to their homepage and register as a <strong>volunteer member</strong>. Of course you would be given different roles not necessary as polling agent.</p>
              <p>The counting officers, the ones that do the counting at the counting station are staff from various govt dept.</p>
              <p>During counting of votes at the counting station, members from the contesting Parties are present to witness the counting. Because the vote counting is done late in the evening after the last voter has cast his/her vote, the counting officers are usually very busy counting. The ballot box contains your voting slip along with thousands of other voters, no one knows which slip belong to you. Like Lucky Draw.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>And I saw somewhere that although they have a serial number on your polling card, the polling stations staff randomly tears off a balloting slip to you when you register to vote. <br><br>So it means they cannot track every single voter after all. The most they can find out is the percentage of people voting PAP / Oppositions in that few blocks of your polling station.</p></div>

              <p>Somehow, I feel that the more they reassure on this, the more it seems there are ghosts in there. And PAP does not want to come out and say our votes are secret.</p>
              <p>Just got to know a civil servant friend who says he will vote for PAP. He has been kpkb about PAP for years! And I bet there are many more.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, I know another senior civil servant who got promoted throughout, despite voting for opposition. So there you go.</p>
