              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE : The 
              ruling People's Action Party (PAP) team at Jalan Besar GRC has said it 
              is unfazed by any opposition threat at the upcoming polls, as it has 
              always been prepared for any challenge.<br><br>The ward has been 
              contested in the last three general elections and more recently, the 
              opposition National Solidarity Party has expressed interested in 
              contesting the area.    <br><br>Singapore's general election is due by 
              February 2012.<br><br>It was a resounding vote of confidence from the 
              Jalan Besar GRC team on their chances at the next general election as 
              they hosted Law Minister K Shanmugam on a ministerial visit on Sunday.<br><br>The
               PAP, helmed by a five-member team led by Environment and Water 
              Resources Minister Yaacob Ibrahim, won 69.3 per cent of valid votes at 
              the last general election in 2006, when it faced off a team from the 
              Singapore Democratic Alliance. <br><br>More recently, the opposition 
              National Solidarity Party has been seen walking the ground.<br><br>Demographically,
               Jalan Besar GRC is one of the oldest wards in Singapore. Half of its 
              residents are above the age of 50. It is also made up of many low-income
               Singaporeans. Ten per cent of public assistance cases in Singapore come
               from this area and 50 per cent of its residents live in rental housing.<br><br>So
               issues concerning the elderly and low-income residents dominated 
              Sunday's dialogue session.<br><br>Observers said such issues are 
              something that the opposition may ride on.<br><br>But its incumbent MPs 
              remain unfazed.<br><br>MP Lily Neo said: "I do not believe in people 
              just coming in just before elections to say 'hello' and then to 
              disappear for the next few years and then to not see them until the next
               election! That is not our policy. <br><br>"Our policy is not winning 
              elections but it is to win people's hearts to win people's confidence, 
              to show them that over the years, we can serve them well, and they know 
              that they have a team who they can trust, the team that will continue to
               serve them".<br><br>Law Minister K Shanmugam gave the team his vote of 
              confidence after touring the constituency.<br><br>He said: "The 
              opposition must make their calculations, and what you have is a very 
              strong MP, an MP who is extremely well liked and who is doing a lot, and
               I think the residents will ask themselves, 'Can anyone else do a better
               job?' I think they will be hard pressed to answer that question".<br><br>National
               Solidarity Party's Secretary-General Goh Meng Seng said his party has 
              been consistently present in Jalan Besar since 2001.<br><br>He said: "As
               far as we are concerned, we are pretty consistent on the ground. (For 
              example), we distributed rice and daily necessities last year."<br><br>However,
               he added that Dr Neo will prove to be a tough challenge, describing her
               as "the anchor" of the PAP team there.<br><br>Mr Goh said: "I think our
               chances will depend on several factors....(such as) whether Lily Neo 
              will step down, because among the MPs, I think she is the anchor, she is
               popular, well liked and she has - through her own compassion - done 
              quite a bit of good things there."<br><br>One of the latest initiatives 
              launched for residents in Dr Neo's ward is called the Family Improvement
               Social Help.<br><br>It aims to improve the lives of residents through 
              work programmes.<br><br>For example, the Chinatown Social Enterprise was
               set up to provide career opportunities for both elderly and needy 
              residents in the area. - CNA/ms</span></span></p>

              Minister Yaacob Ibrahim who is also an MP in the GRC said this to

               Secretary for Young PAP and a registrar with the Department of Medical 
              Oncology at the National Cancer Centre, has been volunteering in Dr Lee

              Dr Lee's ward...as and when there are volunteers who have emerged and

              of the MPs within the GRC. In this case, Dr Lee is the the most senior, 
              he's the best candidate for all of us to understudy," said Dr Yaacob.<br><br>In
               every election, the People's Action Party changes about a quarter to a 
              third of its MPs and at Jalan Besar GRC, the PAP team has said that it 
              was unfazed by any opposition threat and has always been ready for a 
              challenge.<br><br>Dr Yaacob said that as the minister anchoring the GRC,
               it was his duty to ensure that his team is well-prepared.<br><br>"The

               not, or whether I stand on Jalan Besar or another GRCs. It's up to the 
              PM to decide."<br><br>Dr Yaacob said his team is drawing up a new five 
              year plan to take the GRC forward and has as part of the process, been
