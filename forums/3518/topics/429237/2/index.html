              <p>Well, let me just reiterate for the umpteenth time..... He said to shift the FOCUS to services, never at one time did he say REMOVE manufacturing. So I wonder which part you didnt get. And now you talking about aerospace being involved when there are many other industries manufacturing that one can propose phasing out.</p>
              <p>So your second guessing, based on your groundless assumptions isn't helping this discussion either.</p>

              <p>Many manufacturing MNCs are here because we have an English speaking workforce <strong>and</strong> the salaries are low. Ten years ago, a production operator's pay is $1200. Today it hasn't changed much. The same can be said of the engineer's salary. Would it be any different for your children 20 years later when industry wide salaries around south east asia hasn't changed much? What would stop these MNCs moving to vietnam and indonesia when their govts are aggressively pursuing foreign investments?</p>
              <p>Answer: Singapore's continued focus on the manufacturing sector means that we would have to keep our salaries depressed and the import of foreigners from developing countries would do just that.</p>
              <p>Service industries are different. The labour required is more capital intensive rather than labour intensive. Wages are not as severe a factor as those in manufacturing. And in developed economies, services and luxuries are in more demand than in a less developed economy, hence the higher spending power in these sectors such as banking, tourism, entertainment, conventions, restaurants, retail etc etc etc. Salaries will gradually rise as result of this pull up factor. That's what happened in the UK in the 70s and 80s, when they ditched their focus on manufacturing and shifted instead to services. That's not to say that they dumped the manufacturing industry completely, it's about finding the right balance. If you look at developed economies around the world, they have moved from the era of industrial revolutions to service economies today.</p>
              <p>Even Taiwan, with giants like Acer, Asus.....S. Korea with Samsung, Hyundai etc have 60-70% of their economy steeped in the service sectors. So if Singapore we continue down this path, what kind of future do we want for our children? If we have children, that is...lol....given our low fertility rate.</p>

              <p>I believe Pappies with economic backgrounds would know about this but they have to toe the party line. Perhaps that's why many top performers in the private sector are spurning opportunities to join them.</p>
              <p>History has shown it.....developed economies have evolved into service economies. They have to evolve that way otherwise forever being stuck in a manufacturing focus is only going to go the way of developing economies....that is low salaries. And by saying service economies, it's not to say that 100% are service oriented. It's just that the focus is on services, with some percentage of it in other sectors. Hope everyone understands that. Europe has gone that way, so has America. S. Korea and Taiwan too......what more Singapore??</p>

              <p>ok then...lets all go wash lettuce and sweep floors for the
              service industries:)im sure as a chinese the moral is ...not to be
              a fantu,,,eat rice and make soil.seems like most folks are slowly
              losing their worth as salt!</p>
              <p>as jesus once said,"if salt has lost its taste then what good is
              that salt?"</p>

              <p>when we say service industries - majority really refers to the hotel, FB, retails etc. in manufacturing although it is to manufacture and make things, a lot of skills and knowhow is attached to it, required by it in order to function. service standards and skills is one of them, in addition, logistics, engineeering, R and D, construction - all are tagged to manufacturing! and believe me many in manufacturing are doing servicing work. to ask the manufacturing to fuck off the island is to kill off even more jobs!</p>

              <p>come on this SDP guys is really one hell of a cocooo.. no need the lightning team, i can pick any engineers or mangaers in my company they can iimediately tok the guy of the stage. we know who good people and politician should speeak. because many sgporeans work with bosses, engineers, seniors, senior managers, we even get to see our chairmans, CEO, GMs, blah blah title work and speak! this type should go parsat and sell koyo!</p>
