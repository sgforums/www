              <p>As expected his policy of reshaping this economy as service oriented is going to face a lot of resistance.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of singaporeans in the manufacturing sector and that includes the some of you. To hear Tan Jee Say say this is a great trepidation on your perceived future. If ever this thing is to be done, it shd be gradual....people's rice bowls have to be of top priority before the graduated orientation to a service economy.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans may not vote this guy due to his so called "drastic measures" but 10-20 years down the road, you will see that salaries of the manufacturing sector would not have increased very much. And don't be surprised if you're retrenched on a fat pay by your 40s and 50s due to the continued influx of foreigners. You get what you vote for. I just feel sorry for Singapore in the long term and it only vindicates why I've decided to move out in the first place.</p>
              <p>Up to this stage, there are still people saying that manufacturing shouldn't be phased out. In the first place, no one is saying it should be phased out.....just a restructuring of the economic pie lol.</p>
              <p>Reminds me of my friend who voted PAP in 2006 because he was afraid of being denied his first HDB. Then all the shit came, prices went up like hell and when I had a chat with him again, he said he wasn't the only one who voted PAP. Haha. You get what you vote for....when the engineer 10-20 years later is not earning much more than the engineer of today, and with a huge percentage of singaporeans in the manufacturing sector, the country's Gini coefficient is only going to get wider and wider. The country's basically screwed.</p>

              <p>go setup yer own company.i wuld rather stick with manufacturing as its easier for me.up to people and what they can do with accumulate knowledge.</p>
              <p>for me....manufacturing goes hand in hand with service side.u build a product.......u need boxes to package them..so u contact the sales people(service) in the packaging company..they liase with u and yer packaging gets delivered by their delivery drivers(service side)u get printers to see the blwed of the packaging.another liason person.</p>
              <p>then u package yer products and ship them worldwide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its all related,,,not one industry can do it alon by itself.</p>

              <p><br>thanks i read the part. i still feel tha moving the manufacturing sector out of the country is a bad move for now - real bad move. other pints he brought out may be feasible or logical. low cost ones are already booted out from singapore. high end ones should stay, course for manufacturing and engineering etc technical side should still exist in Singapore. we should have a diversified skill training and knowhow in our workforce, just like in parliament.</p>

              <p><strong>Leong Sze Hian /</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-37471" href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2011/05/attacking-tan-jee-say-why/tjs-2/"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-37471" title="TJS" src="http://theonlinecitizen.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TJS-300x190.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="190"></a>I
               refer to the articles “GE: “I didn’t propose closing factories   “, 
              says Tan Jee Say” (Channel News Asia, Apr 28) and  ”SM: Ex- aide’s 
              proposals easier said than done” (ST, Apr 25).</p>
              <p>Looking at the onslaught that is being thrown at my Rafflesian 
              schoolmate Tan Jee Say, from no less than more than half a dozen or so 
              Ministers – Goh Chok Tong, Lim Boon Heng, Lim Hng Kiang, Grace Fu, Lee 
              Yi Shyan, etc, I think it may be an understatement to say that to my 
              living memory, I don’t think any opposition candidate has ever garnered 
              such a rare honour of attention by the ruling Government.</p>
              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>Because I think Jee Say is arguably the most qualified and 
              experienced candidate ever fielded by the opposition in the history of 
              Singapore.</p>
              <p>In particular, his experience as Principal Private Secretary to 
              former Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, heading economic strategy at the 
              Economic Development Board and Secretary to Dr Albert Winsemius, the 
              Dutch economist who has been credited with being the architect of 
              Singapore’s economic development in our early years following 
              independance, in my view, throws to the wind what the ruling<br> Government has always been saying – that the opposition do not have the experience to form the Government.</p>
              <p>The ruling Government has also always said that the opposition is 
              abundant in rhetoric, but lacking in concrete policy solutions and 
              detailed plans.</p>
              <p>Well, Jee Say has published a 45-page plan for the future of 
              Singapore, with a focus on the urgent need to change our economic 
              strategies and policies.</p>
              <p>Has any ruling Government candidate ever come out with even a 20-page paper?</p>
              <p>The fact of the matter is that the ruling Government’s new batch of 
              candidates pales in comparison to the likes of Tan Jee Say and Chen Show
               Mao.</p>
              <p>Jee Say is also perhaps uniquely qualified in diversity, as he has 
              been in Government as well as the private sector, something which few of
               the ruling Government’s new candidates can boast of.</p>
              <p>More significantly, Jee Say is one of their own – a ‘member of the club’, so to speak.</p>
              <p>One does not need to be the ruling Government to see the danger of 
              the precedence – that Jee Say may be the catalyst that we have all been 
              waiting for all these years – one who would encourage other scholars, 
              civil servants, Members of Parliament, etc, to stand on the side of the 
              opposition.</p>
              <p>This is in my view, a crucial moment in Singapore’s history, as we 
              may be on the verge of taking the first steps towards being a real 
              democracy.</p>
              <p>After all, as Singaporeans, aren’t we all on the same side, whichever party we belong to or support?</p>
              <p>In my view, all this talk of a ‘freak election’ is utter nonsense, as
               no democracy can function without allowing the fundamental free vote of
               the people.</p>
              <p><strong>Statistical analysis</strong></p>
              <p>At this juncture, some of you who are reading this may be thinking – 
              this is quite unlike my writing style – no ‘statistical’ analysis?</p>
              <p>So, her goes …</p>
              <p>The attacks on Jee Say’s proposal to gradually shift the focus more 
              to services from manufacturing, may best be described as a “cheap shot 
              in the dark”, as Jee Say does not advocate in his paper, the abandonment
               of the manufacturing sector or for that matter manufacturing jobs.</p>
              <p>In fact, the statistics show that in recent years, the rate of growth
               of change in contribution to the economy, has come from the services 
              sector, relative to the manufacturing sector.</p>
              <p>For example, according to the report “Services sector expected to drive Singapore’s GDP in 2011″ (Channel News Asia, Dec 22):</p>
              <p><em>“Economists have said that next year, the services sector is expected</em><em> to drive growth in Singapore’s gross domestic product (GDP). Economists
               said the growth baton is expected to pass from manufacturing to 
              services next year”.</em></p>
              <p>The rate of change of growth for jobs growth has also made the services sector the top performer.</p>
              <p>According to the MOM’s Labour Market report 2010′ “For the whole of 
              2010, services contributed the bulk of employment gains (111,000), 
              almost double that in 2009 (55,600). Manufacturing employment declined<br> by 1,100, but this was much lower than the losses of 43,700 in 2009.</p>
              <p>Hence, with reference to Goh Chok Tong’s remarks that “implementation
               would not be such a breeze” – isn’t Singapore already now implementing 
              the gradual shift to services – thus, confirming Jee Say’s thesis?</p>
              <p>Mr Goh says: “There are 420,000 blue collar workers. Change the 
              collar colour to white and put them in education, health, IT, financial 
              sectors? Move to IRs (integrated resorts) perhaps?” Perhaps Mr Goh does 
              not know, but aren’t the bulk of training and re-training under SPUR and
               CET programmes already now more so in such services sectors, relative 
              to manufacturing?</p>
              <p>How many of these 420,000 blue collar workers are amongst the 500,000
               workers earning not more than $1,500, according to the 2010 Census?</p>
              <p>I am not an expert in economics like Jee Say, but I believe one of 
              the issues he raised in his paper, was that manufacturing’s reliance on 
              low-wage low- skilled foreign labour may have contributed to the low<br> wage of Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The above should address Minister Lim Boon Heng’s remarks, “Likewise,
               Mr Lim slammed Mr Tan’s suggestion to drastically reduce foreign 
              workers, noting that their presence in manufacturing has allowed<br> Singaporeans to get better-paid jobs”.</p>
              <p>How does the Minister then explain the declining real wages of the 
              approximately bottom 25 per cent of workers in the last 11 years or so?</p>
