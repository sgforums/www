              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"> <span>SINGAPORE: Singapore Democratic Party's (SDP) candidate for 
              Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC) Tan Jee Say 
              said People's Action Party (PAP) ministers have rewarded themselves 
              richly by paying themselves millions, despite areas in which they have 
              failed. <br> <br>Speaking at an election rally on Thursday evening, Mr 
              Tan said the PAP has run out of trump cards to roll out good policies to
               boost the economy. <br><br>Mr Tan added PAP ministers have lost their 
              moral compass when they supported the building of casinos which created 
              jobs but with high social costs.<br><br>He said there are other ways to 
              create decent jobs in healthcare and education without having to rely on
               foreign workers to fill manufacturing positions. <br><br>Mr Tan also 
              accused the PAP of distorting his proposals in an economic paper he 
              wrote on ideas to regenerate the Singapore economy. <br><br>"I did not propose closing factories and abandoning the manufacturing sector," Mr Tan said. <br><br>"What I said was that we should not promote manufacturing because it requires a lot of land and labour. <br><br>"But
               Singapore is short of land and labour. I am not against manufacturing. 
              Existing factories can continue if they are profitable, without 
              depending on new incentives from the government.<br><br>"You know, (for) Sembawang and Keppel, the Prime Minister has said 75 per cent of their workers are foreign workers. <br><br>"And Sembawang and Keppel occupy huge stretches of land. These are valuable land. Land beside the sea. <br><br>"(They are) what we call fore-shore land. Foreshore land is very important, very valuable. <br><br>"So
               this is expensive land, valuable land that we cannot afford to give to 
              industries that benefit foreign workers. Where do Singaporeans count in 
              their economic policy?<br><br>"We want to promote, we want to use our 
              land, limited tax incentives... promoting services sector such as 
              medical, health sectors, education, creative industries. Why do you need
               to subsidise rentals of factories?"<br><br>-CNA/wk</span> </span></p>

               Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Tan Jee Say said he was

              <p>Mr Tan was speaking to Channel NewsAsia during a 
              walkabout at Empress Road market with other SDP candidates from his team
               on Sunday morning.</p>
              <p>At a People’s Action Party (PAP) rally for the
               Marine Parade GRC, Mr Goh had pointed out that Mr Tan appeared to have 
              ’benefited’ from his previous appointment, and he wanted to make known 
              why Mr Tan left the civil service.</p>
              <p>In response, Mr Tan, who was Mr
               Goh’s Principal Private Secretary in the 1980s, said he had already 
              intended to leave the civil service at the end of his government bond, 
              but was persuaded to stay on in his position.</p>
              <p>This was when Mr Goh was Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
              <p>Mr
               Tan said it was never his mission in life to remain in public service 
              and after five years, he resigned with Mr Goh’s blessing.</p>
              <p>He added that he was surprised as Mr Goh had earlier stated he would not comment on any candidate outside of Marine Parade GRC.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan is contesting in Holland—Bukit Timah GRC on the SDP ticket.</p>
              <p>He
               also refuted Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew’s comment that he was not 
              ’qualified’ to speak on manufacturing, saying that he was trained in 
              economics and had experience in policy making during his time at the 
              Trade and Industry Ministry.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan added that his proposal to 
              shift Singapore’s reliance away from manufacturing has earned the 
              endorsement of industry players here as well as Lord Butler who oversaw 
              the United Kingdom’s economic transformation in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>

              <p>Well, let me just reiterate for the umpteenth time..... He said to shift the FOCUS to services, never at one time did he say REMOVE manufacturing. So I wonder which part you didnt get. And now you talking about aerospace being involved when there are many other industries manufacturing that one can propose phasing out.</p>
              <p>So your second guessing, based on your groundless assumptions isn't helping this discussion either.</p>
