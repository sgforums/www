              <p>I just returned from the SDP rally at Woodlands Stadium and I must
              say I AM VERY impressed by the speeches made by the SDP candidates.</p>
              <p>I am not saying this because I am anti-PAP. I am saying this from the
              bottom of my heart. I went to the rally expecting it to be lousy. To my
              complete surprise the candidates who spoke talked about PAP stading for
              the people initially. But PAP slowly lost their humanity and heart and
              their very soul left them the moment they became complacent and began
              to take the citizens for granted. The best speech was made by the
              Vincent guy (I forgot the sirname) whom PAP Balakhrisna accused of
              being gay.</p>
              <p>They said that PM;s half hearted apology was not sincere and was aimed at winning sympathy for PAP.</p>
              <p>Chee
              Soon Juan did not appear on stage and was not even mentioned bec I
              believe that after he was made a bankrupt, he can no longer standfor elections. But he contributed a lot to the SDP newsletter which my friend purchased.</p>
              <p>I
              was so impressed by their speeches. They are even better than speeches
              made by the Worker's Party. I am sorry I am not in Sebawang GRC bec I
              would have voted for them in an instant.</p>
              <p>I also felt sorry that
              only less than half the stadium was filled. It seems that Sembawang
              voters have already made up their mind that they will vote for Khaw
              Boon Wan. Which is a pity bec SDP fielded really quality candidates.</p>
              <p>If u r free, listen to their speaches on Youtube. I'm sure someonw will upload it by tomoro (Thursday, 5th May).</p>
