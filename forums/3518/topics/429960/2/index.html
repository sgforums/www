              <p style="text-align: justify;">Just today, <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_677471.html">news broke</a> that former DPM Tony Tan has not ruled out a presidential run to 
              succeed President SR Nathan. Although he did not say he might be running
               for President, he has refused to rule it out either. What should 
              Singaporeans make of his possible candidacy? To answer this question it 
              might be helpful to shed some light on his record on one specific 
              aspect.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">For over two decades, Dr Tony Tan oversaw university education as its <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/centennial/alumniawards/tky.htm">Minister-in-charge</a>.
               In the late 1990s, the Singapore government convened a panel, under the
               direction of DPM Dr Tony Tan to re-examine university admission 
              criteria. One of the pressing problems seen by the government at the 
              time was that Singapore’s low birth rate, in part caused by <a href="http://furrybrowndog.wordpress.com/2009/12/16/singapores-ill-thought-population-policy/">misguided eugenics population policies</a>, had resulted in fewer and fewer graduates entering universities. As reported in the <a href="http://furrybrownblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/06/more-graduates-needed/">Straits Times on 1st August 1997</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">* MORE GRADUATES NEEDED: Singapore will 
              not have enough graduates to service the economy in the year 2000, and 
              steps will have to be taken to boost the intake at the universities 
              here, while attracting more graduates from abroad as well, said Deputy 
              Prime Minister Tony Tan, who oversees university education.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The panel was set up in 1998 and held 
              its first meeting on 17th April 1998. Although Dr Tony Tan was not on 
              the panel, he was the minister overall in charge of it. Apart from the 
              projected shortage of skilled graduates,  one of the other reasons for 
              reviewing university admission criteria was to address the perception 
              that it was almost entirely academic based with no consideration for 
              extra-curricular achievements. The other, seemingly innocuous goal, was 
              to transform the local universities of NUS and NTU into world-class 
              universities.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Right from the start in 1998, Dr Tony Tan <a href="http://furrybrownblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/protecting-local-grads-will-not-solve-race-for-jobs/">had ruled out</a> that a policy which limits foreigners or protects Singaporean students and graduates was not on the table:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>One student had asked if the Government would implement 
              policies that would protect Singaporeans facing competition from 
              foreigners, for jobs as well as university places.</p>
              <p><strong>Dr Tan answered: “There is no way in which you are going to 
              be able to protect either Singaporeans or Singapore because we are a 
              small country.</strong></p>
              <p>“We don’t set prices. We are a price-taker, not a price-setter,” he said on Thursday.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">In a similar vein with Minister George Yeo, who rebutted MP Tan Cheng Bock <a href="http://furrybrownblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/27/expat-debate-bg-yeo-responds/">later in 1999</a> on grounds that Singapore should not adopt Singaporeans first policy 
              when it came to jobs, DPM Tony Tan was adamant that Singaporeans should <strong>not</strong> get preferential treatment whether competing for jobs or places in local universities.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Fast-forward a year later, when it was 
              becoming apparent that Singapore still needed more graduates to service 
              its economy lest economic growth slows, <a href="http://furrybrownblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/are-precious-local-talents-being-shut-out-from-nus-and-ntu/">a report appeared in the Straits Times</a> questioning if the government should increase the intake of university 
              students at local universities NTU and NUS due to an increasing number 
              of Singaporean students who were unable to qualify for local university,
               and had to resort to expensive educational opportunities overseas, the 
              vast majority of them being polytechnic graduates who had been shut out 
              of local universities without being told a good reason why (given the 
              non-transparent nature of university admission critierion):</p>
              <blockquote>
              <div style="text-align: justify;">Overseas education counsellors say 
              most Singaporeans go abroad because they cannot get into the local 
              universities and the bulk of them – about 60 per cent – are polytechnic 
              diploma holders. Some 65 per cent of those who went to British 
              universities last year were polytechnic graduates. The comparative 
              figures for Australia and the US were 80 per cent and 15 per cent 
              respectively. Another 20 to 30 per cent are A-level holders who do not 
              meet NUS and NTU admission criteria. The rest head overseas on 
              scholarships.</div>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To make matters worse, it was becoming 
              apparent that Singapore was losing talent because of this overseas brain
               drain. Taking the case of <a href="http://furrybrownblog.wordpress.com/2011/06/08/are-precious-local-talents-being-shut-out-from-nus-and-ntu/">Tan Teck Chuan</a>:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">After completing his national service, 
              he joined Ngee Ann Polytechnic where he began his winning streak, 
              sweeping more than 10 book prizes, a scholarship and the first Tay Eng 
              Soon gold medal for outstanding work as a diploma student in building 
              services.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Then came decision time. He could wait 
              for another eight months and try for a place at the National University 
              of Singapore or the Nanyang Technological University.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">If he clinched a place, it would mean 
              studying for another four years as he would not be allowed to skip the 
              first year because his polytechnic course was not considered relevant.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">His other option: Go to Cardiff University and aim for an honours degree in two years.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">NUS and NTU do not reveal how they 
              calculate the entry points for polytechnic graduates, but Mr Tan knew 
              that besides his polytechnic grades, his O-level results and work 
              experience would be taken into account. <strong>On that basis, he did not rate his chances highly.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, he had a firm offer from Cardiff, one of the top five universities in mechanical engineering in Britain.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The choice was clear, but the two-year stint in Wales did not come cheap though – $60,000 to be exact.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">At the end of it all, Teck Chuan said that he wished he had a chance at local universities:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Although he appreciated the value of the
               overseas exposure, Mr Tan told Insight he wished that Singapore had 
              given him and others like him the opportunity to pursue tertiary 
              education here – at less cost to himself and his family.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“People ask me why was I not satisfied with a poly diploma. But let’s face it, in Singapore, what counts is a degree.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“And by the end of my poly course, <strong>I
               knew I had the ability to do a degree in two or three years, so I don’t
               see why I don’t deserve that shot at a university degree – right here 
              at home</strong>.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To be clear, Teck Chuan was not just one
               out of a few Singaporeans who missed out opportunities at local 
              universities. The articles goes on to say that UK universities usually 
              found that Singaporeans were model students:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Officials of Leeds, Glasgow, Leicester 
              and Loughborough Universities note that Singaporeans are model students 
              who pass with first class or second-upper honours.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">The University of Glasgow alone had 20 
              first class and 40 second-upper class honours among the graduating batch
               of Singaporeans last year.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <h1 style="text-align: justify;">Tony Tan’s role</h1>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Here is where DPM Tony Tan’s role came 
              into play. DPM Tan said that while more graduates are needed to keep the
               economy going  (a shortfall of graduates was expected even if NTU and 
              NUS increased their intake), but that increasing the intake was <strong>ruled out</strong> for fear that it might “lower their standards” and cause them to become
               “unmanageable”. His solution? Part of it was to instead increase the 
              intake for foreign students from overseas so as to retain education 
              standards, done probably in part to ensure NUS and NTU were seen as 
              world class education institutions which foreigners would flock to:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Deputy Prime Minister Dr Tony Tan 
              revealed in Parliament that projections by the Ministry of Trade and 
              Industry indicated that Singapore needed 17,000 graduates a year to 
              service its economy.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">With an intake of about 10,000 or 11,000 to NUS and NTU, there would still be a shortfall.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>He ruled out expanding the intake at NUS and NTU, saying that it could lower their standards</strong> and cause them to become unmanageable “mega-universities”.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The better options were to increase the number of tertiary-level institutions and recruit students from overseas.</strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In other words, if one is looking to 
              blame any minister for the huge influx of foreign students in local 
              Singapore universities and the huge brain drain of polytechnic graduates
               who leave for overseas university education (who are unfairly penalised
               due to consideration of ‘O’ Level grade), DPM Tony Tan appears to be 
              the minister responsible.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In his quest to ensure the Singapore 
              economy had enough graduates to keep it going and while also trying to 
              boost local university standards and international appeal, DPM Tony Tan 
              set in motion the policy which discriminated against local students in 
              favour of foreign students who, in some apparent cases are not able to 
              qualify for their own country’s competitive university entrance exams.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Is this not a clear case of putting 
              foreign students ahead of locals? All in the name of boosting the image 
              of NUS/NTU over that of the locals. To make matters worse, CPF money 
              cannot be used for education overseas. Polytechnic students who had to 
              go overseas or resort to expensive college education through distance 
              learning have DPM Tony Tan to thank for putting foreign students 
              overseas ahead of locals.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">It would not be the least bit suprising 
              if it eventually emerged that DPM Tony Tan was the brains behind the 
              policy which explicitly invites foreign students fully sponsored by the 
              Singapore government (and its taxpayers) to study in NUS/NTU and offers 
              them a PR (without the obligation of National Service) upon graduation. 
              Such an ill thought policy marginalises local talents and swells the 
              ranks of non-committed PRs who are in Singapore only as a stepping stone
               to overseas universities. Here’s <a href="http://www.mycarforum.com/index.php?s=936dee283b2c90e14d9f53cc121682ed&amp;showtopic=2663008">an account</a> by a forumer of how such a reverse-discriminatory policy worked.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Now DPM Tony Tan says he might run for President. Well when the voting comes, Singaporeans should keep in mind the above.</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">.</p>
