              <p>Personally, i think out of the 4, tan cheng bock should get the least votes or in any case, he cant win so you can rule him out if you want your votes to be useful.</p>
              <p>Then out of the 3, dr tony tan is pro-pap and pro-government. Voting him in is same as voting for pap. You love the way things are now.</p>
              <p>Or you can vote for tan jee say. But this guy i must say is a bit extreme and introduce  things like phase out manufacturing (though he really clarify to be not so) and to disband temasek holdings. Attack PAP openly.</p>
              <p>Last, but not least, tan kin lian. He seems to be more objective and also more proactive than the rest of them. Also the only one willing to donate salary if elected. He lost in some investments but he won in a lot more too. Attack mainly wrong policies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am leaning towards tan kin lian. People might want to support or point out some criticisms about him.</p>

This time, it is to pick the country's head of state.<br><br>The Elections Department is emphasising the dignity of the office at stake. As such, it is pulling out all the stops to make sure the voting and counting process on August 27 will go smoothly.<br><br>Besides sending out more election officials to facilitate the polls, the Elections Department is also hoping to shorten the time it takes for voters to cast their vote.<br><br>It said that along with the crucial identification documents like NRIC or passport, voters should also bring their poll cards to the polling stations to facilitate checks by election officials so as to shorten the waiting time.<br><br>Those who do not receive their poll cards in the mail for any reason can now print it out for themselves.<br><br>The Elections Department has introduced a new service on its </span><a class="path" style="color: #0066cc;" href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/">website</a><span> which allows voters to print out their poll cards.<br><br>Voters can also head to the community centres or the Elections Department to get help in printing out their poll cards.<br><br>On Polling Day, voters will be issued a ballot paper at the polling stations.<br><br>The ballot paper will have all four candidates' names, photos and symbols printed on it in black and white. Voters should mark an "X" in the empty box next to their choice.<br><br>Measures have also been put in place to ensure that the votes of the blind will be kept secret. A stencil with cut-out boxes will help them mark the ballot paper on their own.<br><br>There will be 781 polling stations across the island - located at schools, community centres and void decks.<br><br>The votes will be counted at 162 counting centres when voting closes at 8pm on Polling Day.<br><br>The last time Singaporeans went to the polls to choose a president was 18 years ago in 1993. Results of that election only came out in the early morning of the next day, at 3.30am. <br><br>While the Elections Department is hoping Singaporeans will not have to wait that long this time around, it is still expecting it to be past midnight before the results are announced, that is if there is no recount needed. <br><br>In the 1993 election, there were 1.6 million voters and two candidates. This time, there are four candidates and 2.27 million votes to be counted.<br><br>Channel NewsAsia will be broadcasting a special coverage of the Singapore Presidential Election Results from 10pm on August 27.<br><br>CNA/al</span></span></p>
