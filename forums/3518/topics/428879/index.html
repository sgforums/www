              <p>AS AN older citizen, I am uncomfortable about the presence of former government scholarship holders in the opposition.</p>
              <p>To me, it seems as if they are abandoning their parents who paid for their excellent education.</p>
              <p>Yes, one could argue that these candidates were in fact supported by taxpayers and will now serve all Singaporeans, and not only the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>But, are they really sincere about helping Singapore achieve a better society by joining the opposition?</p>
              <p>Can they effectively check the Government or will they create more fighting or quarrelling like the parliamentary sessions in Taiwan?</p>
              <p>Aren't there enough ways of giving feedback to the Government?</p>
              <p>I can contact my Members of Parliament any time; I don't even have to make an appointment and can e-mail them when I need help.</p>
              <p>It takes time to know these scholar opposition candidates and I wonder if I should risk the four to five years it will take to know such a candidate's ability, and compromise national progress.</p>
              <p>A better answer for me is not to vote them in for this General Election and see if they continue contributing.</p>
              <p>I would even apply my answer to the Workers' Party's star candidate, Mr Chen Show Mao.</p>
              <p>I would like to see if he really relocates his family to Singapore, as he has told the press he would, if he fails to win the election.</p>
              <p>A candidate like Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim is too academic for an average voter like me. She makes good speeches but rarely champions a voter's bread-and-butter needs.</p>
              <p>A good MP to me must not only act as a check on the Government, but also serve the ground and offer effective solutions to the Government.</p>
              <p>I would prefer a few good opposition MPs than many who are merely interested in the glamour of being in the opposition in Parliament.</p>

              <p>Dear Madam Ho,</p>
              <p>So, you mean scholarship holders cannot have different views or disagree with the government.</p>
              <p>So, you need 5 years to test the sincerity of these opposition candidates ?.</p>
              <p>So, it is perfectly for you that PAP Tin Pei Ling and the two children of the former Barisan Soscialis MPs need not be tested for 5 years for their sincerity ie voters should just vote in these PAP candidates without testing for their sincerity hor.</p>

              <p>Madam Ho,</p>
              <p>You are of the old generation who has been warned time and time again by the incumbents that alternative parties will destabalise the Singapore economy.</p>
              <p>However young people now do not even care if alternative parties happen to destablise Singapore and change Singapore from a first class country to a second class country. This is because of their new liberal philosophies and their innate ability to take risks, not forgetting that they are fed up with PAP's glorious treatment of foreign talent which makes legitimate Singaporeans 2nd class citizens in their own country. And being young, they have the option to migrate.</p>
              <p>If locally born youngsters are now 2nd class citizens in Singapore, then it would make no difference if they are 2nd class citizens in UK, Canada, US. (ps. not australia bec australia is a low class country).</p>
              <p>Hence the young of the new millenium are not influenced by the threat that alternative parties will destabilise Singapore. The new young generation are willing to take a chance on alternative parties.</p>

              <p>But, as my schedule are alway full, you have to be quite lucky to see me face to face.</p>
              <p>Another way to see me face to face is to volunteer your service as a grassloot leaders so that you can also rub shoulders with my body guards.</p>
              <p>But, it will only take place during national day dinner and some festive events where I am cordially invited as the GUEST OF HONOUR.</p>
              <p>Or else you can catch my handsome face on the TV or the big banner that will be displayed in your town during festive days.</p>
              <p>Regards,</p>
              <p>Your ever-arrogant "servant" for two weeks only.</p>

              <h1>Opposition's scholar candidates a worry</h1>
              <p>&lt;!-- by line --&gt;&lt;!-- end by line --&gt;&lt;!-- end left side bar --&gt;</p>

              <p>AS AN older citizen, I am uncomfortable about the presence of former government scholarship holders in the opposition.</p>
              <p>To me, it seems as if they are abandoning their parents who paid for their excellent education.</p>
              <p>Yes, one could argue that these candidates were in fact supported by taxpayers and will now serve all Singaporeans, and not only the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>But, are they really sincere about helping Singapore achieve a better society by joining the opposition?</p>
              <p>Can they effectively check the Government or will they create more fighting or quarrelling like the parliamentary sessions in Taiwan?</p>
              <p>Aren't there enough ways of giving feedback to the Government?</p>
              <p>I can contact my Members of Parliament any time; I don't even have to make an appointment and can e-mail them when I need help.</p>
              <p>It takes time to know these scholar opposition candidates and I wonder if I should risk the four to five years it will take to know such a candidate's ability, and compromise national progress.</p>
              <p>A better answer for me is not to vote them in for this General Election and see if they continue contributing.</p>
              <p>I would even apply my answer to the Workers' Party's star candidate, Mr Chen Show Mao.</p>
              <p>I would like to see if he really relocates his family to Singapore, as he has told the press he would, if he fails to win the election.</p>
              <p>A candidate like Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim is too academic for an average voter like me. She makes good speeches but rarely champions a voter's bread-and-butter needs.</p>
              <p>A good MP to me must not only act as a check on the Government, but also serve the ground and offer effective solutions to the Government.</p>
              <p>I would prefer a few good opposition MPs than many who are merely interested in the glamour of being in the opposition in Parliament.</p>

              <p><br>Quite upset these type of voters, how to walk the ground if you are not a MP and how to provide effective solutions to the government in Parliment as NCMP and also a WP member. Never will PAPAYANS will ever take WP or even other opp suggestion. Those ex-scholars and ex army doc chooses opp for one simple reason is to be a moral person rather than money grabbing.....</p>
