              <p>Madam Ho,</p>
              <p>You are of the old generation who has been warned time and time
              again by the incumbents that alternative parties will destabalise
              the Singapore economy.</p>
              <p>However young people now do not even care if alternative parties
              happen to destablise Singapore and change Singapore from a first
              class country to a second class country. This is because of their
              new liberal philosophies and their innate ability to take risks,
              not forgetting that they are fed up with PAP's glorious treatment
              of foreign talent which makes legitimate Singaporeans 2nd class
              citizens in their own country. And being young, they have the
              option to migrate.</p>
              <p>If locally born youngsters are now 2nd class citizens in
              Singapore, then it would make no difference if they are 2nd class
              citizens in UK, Canada, US. (ps. not australia bec australia is a
              low class country).</p>
              <p>Hence the young of the new millenium are not influenced by the
              threat that alternative parties will destabilise Singapore. The new
              young generation are willing to take a chance on alternative
              parties.</p>

              <p>AS AN older citizen, I am uncomfortable about the presence of
                      former government scholarship holders in the opposition.</p>
              <p>To me, it seems as if they are abandoning their parents who paid
                      for their excellent education.</p>
              <p>Yes, one could argue that these candidates were in fact
                      supported by taxpayers and will now serve all Singaporeans, and not
                      only the People's Action Party.</p>
              <p>But, are they really sincere about helping Singapore achieve a
                      better society by joining the opposition?</p>
              <p>Can they effectively check the Government or will they create
                      more fighting or quarrelling like the parliamentary sessions in
                      Taiwan?</p>
              <p>Aren't there enough ways of giving feedback to the
                      Government?</p>
              <p>I can contact my Members of Parliament any time; I don't even
                      have to make an appointment and can e-mail them when I need
                      help.</p>
              <p>It takes time to know these scholar opposition candidates and I
                      wonder if I should risk the four to five years it will take to know
                      such a candidate's ability, and compromise national progress.</p>
              <p>A better answer for me is not to vote them in for this General
                      Election and see if they continue contributing.</p>
              <p>I would even apply my answer to the Workers' Party's star
                      candidate, Mr Chen Show Mao.</p>
              <p>I would like to see if he really relocates his family to
                      Singapore, as he has told the press he would, if he fails to win
                      the election.</p>
              <p>A candidate like Workers' Party chairman Sylvia Lim is too
                      academic for an average voter like me. She makes good speeches but
                      rarely champions a voter's bread-and-butter needs.</p>
              <p>A good MP to me must not only act as a check on the Government,
                      but also serve the ground and offer effective solutions to the
                      Government.</p>
              <p>I would prefer a few good opposition MPs than many who are
                      merely interested in the glamour of being in the opposition in
                      Parliament.</p>

              <p>Rhodes Scholars are not government scholars. Chen Show Mao was a Rhodes scholar and anyone who is smart enough will know that it is a scholarship which is offered by OXFORD, not the government. The money is generated by Rhodes Trust not Singaporean taxpayers.  Oxford doesn't give a bunch of self serving twats scholarships.</p>
              <p>So not to worry , Mdm Ho, we can see who fed you ....obviously you are that stupid and so is the person/newspaper publisher who posted your brainwashed letter.</p>

              <p>Hi Mdm Ho,</p>
              <p>I am not sure you heard the results for Aljunied GRC, since you only hear what you want to hear. Some people hear only good things, but you are even more selective. I just remembered your nice letter and hope you have the candidates that you like.</p>
              <p>In the mean time, your PAP candidates will be able to respond to your emails more quickly quickly, since they are more free now.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,</p>
