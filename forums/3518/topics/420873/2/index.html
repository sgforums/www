              </div>
              <p><br>The old man has finally said it. He has predicted PAP’s rule of 
              Singapore will come to an end one day. We believe it will be sooner than
               later. The General Election 2011 is around the corner. And as in 
              previous election times, we have begun hearing and seeing the ruling 
              party’s pitch increasing in volume and frequency through the state<br> controlled media.</p>
              <p>In all of the past election years the Singapore public had been 
              cajoled, fooled and promised a better life and improved standard of 
              living. HDB dwellers were promised millions of dollars of upgrading 
              works in their estates provided they voted for the PAP. Of course the 
              money was not coming out of the PAP’s pockets. It was from the taxes and
               revenues collected by the government. There will be more carrots thrown
               to the voting public as the days draw nearer. The timing of the GE is 
              planned such that the goodies will be cast to the public with the hope 
              that the “daft” Singaporean will be overwhelmed and in true Confucian 
              deference, vote for the master.</p>
              <p>The state media is going on overdrive with the news and interviews 
              and pictures of the octogenarian MM grinding a threatening message that 
              the people better vote the ruling party candidates or face imminent 
              destruction of the system and country. But all these shenanigans will 
              not cut ice with the people who have suffered enough and seen 
              injustices, broken promises and shoddy leadership.</p>
              <p>The issues that have riled Singaporeans over the past decade cannot 
              and will not be easily rationalized and excused. Let us revisit some of 
              these issues and refresh our  inds on why we should not be fooled into 
              believing the news that is being spewed out in the local state media.</p>
              <p><strong>1. The widening income gap and Cost of Living<br> </strong>The ruling party’s penchant for harping on the GDP is just 
              unbelievable. The local media trumpet the 14.7% GDP growth for 2010 as 
              if everyone in Singapore has struck gold. In reality, who has seen 
              income growth? The median wage of the working  opulation of Singapore is
               in 2009 was $2,400. That means more than a million  workers get $2,400 
              or less per month. If each of these workers had to maintain a family of 3
               or 4 members, one can see how stretched the bottom half of the 
              population are to meet just their daily necessities. Woe to them if they
               or their family members get sick and need medical attention. Singapore 
              has a very large income gap – thanks to the government’s policy of 
              importing cheap labor that has depressed the wages of a large segment of
               the population.</p>
              <p>In 2010 there were a total of 464,400 or almost 30 per cent of all 
              active CPF members, earning less than $1,500. As the data excludes 
              self-employed persons and inactive CPF members (those who did not have 
              at least one employment CPF contribution paid for him for the current or
               any of the preceding 3 months), if we include these persons, the total 
              number of people earning less than $1,500 could well be more than half a
               million. Singapore has a 3rd world wage structure and the biggest 
              income gap among developed countries. For the bottom 30% whose wages 
              have remained more or less stagnant for the past 10 years, their quality
               of life has simply deteriorated.</p>
              <p><strong>2. Cost of Living<br> </strong>Inflation is currently at 3.8% and MAS says it will hit 5% in 
              the months to come. Nominal incomes of low-wage earners have hardly 
              grown in the past 10 years even as inflation has spiked significantly. 
              What our wages or income can buy these days are slowly are being 
              whittled away, and paring our shopping behavior to bare essentials. Can 
              the half a million workers in the bottom 30% of the wage table really 
              enjoy the purported GDP benefits as touted by the ruling party? Which 
              consumer essentials have not risen in price? In fact retail prices of 
              all consumer goods have increased at between 5% and 10%. And things are 
              going to get worse with oil and commodity prices moving upwards.</p>
              <p>Of course the media will boast about workfare and how it helps needy 
              Singaporeans. Does it really put food on the table? Two-thirds of it, if
               a worker is eligible, will end up in his CPF which by the way is 
              becoming more and more elusive as withdrawal dates are moved back. The 
              average workfare recipient gets only $80 a month. But surely our 
              economic goals cannot be to keep a large segment of the population just 
              above subsistence level? I believe that workers should be paid decent 
              wages. What is so good about an economic system in which workers work 
              full time jobs but cannot make enough for decent living?</p>
              <p>The high cost of living coupled with low wages and reduced domestic 
              purchasing power condemns the average Singapore worker to an 
              ignominious, monotonous and stressful working life. Singapore workers 
              have to work harder to earn the same amount of money and save for a 
              longer period to purchase the same product. People just across the 
              causeway get more bang for their ringgit than we with our strong dollar.
               In 1991, Goh Chok Tong promised Singaporeans the “Swiss standard of 
              living” within a decade. Twenty years later, we have a living standard 
              which is closer to Russia than Switzerland.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Singapore’s Purchasing Power<br> </strong>This brings us to the question of how much is our money worth 
              these days. Despite the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s attempt to let
               the Singapore dollar appreciate gradually over other currencies, the 
              same Sing dollar buys only a fraction of sugar, cotton, rice, HDB flats,
               fuel and utilities compared to 10 years ago. In reality, the Sing 
              dollar has lost real purchasing power.</p>
              <p>Mercer has ranked the republic as the world’s 10th costliest city, 
              even more expensive than Hong Kong (11th), New York (23rd) and London 
              and Amsterdam (both ranked 27th). The property hunt pushed up prices of 
              resale HDB flats by 40% in the last three years, and by 3.8% in the last
               quarter. In the more expensive private sector, the jump was even 
              sharper – by 7.1% in the last four months of 2009. Moody’s Investors 
              Service said that mortgage lending was accelerating at a rate that made 
              Singapore more susceptible to a property bubble than Hong Kong or South 
              Korea.</p>
              <p>According to the report Singapore ranks 43rd in terms of wages. 
              Singapore came in 42nd for purchasing power which is wages relative to 
              the cost of living and Kuala Lumpur is 2 places ahead of Singapore. 
              Singapore is behind Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei and Hong Kong. In 2006 
              Singapore workers have a purchasing power index of 54.9 (using New York 
              as the base=100), today that figure has fallen to 40.6. According to 
              Credit Counseling Singapore, in the past 3 months, the total consumer 
              debt in Singapore reached $150B. This figure consists of $111B housing 
              debt and $40B in the form of credit card, car and unsecured loans. It 
              noted that the roll-over credit card debt has grown to a record $4B and 
              the number of credit cards issued in Singapore has reached 6 million a 
              figure that translates to roughly 6 credit cards for every eligible 
              person with annual income above $30K.</p>
              <p><strong>4. Housing Issue<br> </strong>Between 1990 and 2009, HDB housing prices increased 400% as a 
              result of the so called Asset Enhancement Scheme. The very mission of 
              HDB changed from one of affordability to one of asset enhancement. 
              Obviously some genius knew that CPF monies were burgeoning beyond the 
              intended aim and so a plan had to be devised to reduce the savings which
               would have earned substantial interest payments. The original aim of 
              CPF contributions was to ensure a retirement nest egg. But tweaks were 
              introduced to enable withdrawals for investments and other expenses. 
              Approved investments which were touted by local banks to have earned 
              more interest ended up with investors losing potential interests.</p>
              <p>Household debt has grown briskly – mainly on account of bigger home 
              loans – to $198 billion in Q3,2010 up 10.7 per cent from a year ago 
              fuelled mainly by cheap housing, vehicle and investment loans. Concerns 
              about Singapore’s credit lines has been raised by the Asian Development 
              Bank (ADB), as real-estate lending accounts for more than half of total 
              loans in the banking system. At 51 per cent of advances, 
              Singapore’s banking sector’s exposure to property is the highest among 
              the nine major economies of East Asia. According to the ADB’s Asia 
              Economic Monitor, this is in contrast to 9 per cent in South Korea, 15 
              per cent or less in Indonesia and the Philippines, and below 20 per cent
               in Hong Kong, Thailand and China.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Ageing population and retirement financing<br> </strong>Today most households are on mortgage of 20 to 30 years. A 30 
              year mortgage plan will force Singaporeans to sell their flats for 
              retirement! This is because their dwindling CPF balance will not be 
              sufficient to meet their expenses upon retirement. By allowing HDB 
              prices to increase, these future retirees could then fund their 
              retirement by selling off their HDB flats at high prices and 
              downgrading. This would solve their retirement financing and the 
              government doesn’t need to take care of these aged folks. For those 
              can’t downgrade even if they wanted to, the option given to them is to 
              obtain reverse mortgage or if eligible, obtain a Lease-Buy Back from the
               HDB. If one dies while still servicing the reverse mortgage, then the 
              beneficiaries have to make good the outstanding payments to the 
              financial institution. In the case of LBS, the flat reverts to the HDB.</p>
              <p>One out of every seven HDB flat owners have problems paying their 
              mortgage loans. This seems to be what the statistics have revealed. Last
               year, the HDB visited 60,000 flats which had problems paying their 
              loans and gave financial counseling to 35,000 households. This is 14 per
               cent of the estimated 420,000 HDB loan mortgages – or one<br> in seven.</p>
              <p><strong>6. Medical Costs<br> </strong>Medical cost has escalated sharply in the past 4 years. 
              Minister Khaw had this to say about the massive increase in medical 
              cost: “The bottom line : We have good high-standard public hospitals 
              that areaffordable because of the 3Ms” – Minister Khaw Affordable? It 
              reminds us of what Minister Mah said – housing is still affordable after
               prices jumped by 60% in 2 years. As for the 3Ms, it is full of holes. 
              Many self-employed individuals don’t have Medisave, hundreds of 
              thousands are not insured and for you to get Medi-fund you have to 
              exhaust all your savings, live in a home and have little or no income to
               pass the criteria for receiving Medifund. Many people don’t know what 
              is going on until they get seriously ill ….then it is too late. There 
              many holes and gaps that people can fall through.</p>
              <p>Take Medishield, many people are still on Basic Medishield. Basic 
              Medisheld has limited payout for hospitalization/surgery that is now 
              insufficient for the ‘catastrophic illnesses’ because hospitalization 
              cost has escalated. Enhanced Medishield requires co-payment amount th at
               you have to make before Enhanced Medishield will pay you. Many 
              patients, especially those with early cancer, found out the hard way 
              that certain illnesses require many short hospital stays and you end up 
              paying more than a few tens of thousands. To solve this one needs to 
              purchase a rider to cover the co-payment amount – which is another crack
               in the scheme that people are not aware of.</p>
              <p>When Minister Khaw had a heart attack and needed surgery, he paid $8.
               Many poor people will pay much more than $8 when they get hospitalized.
               In our system, the richest in our society like Minister Khaw pay less 
              than the poorer members because they can afford better insurance that 
              requires very high annual premiums, that certainly are beyond the poor 
              Singaporean’s means.</p>
              <p><strong>7. Massive Influx of Foreigners<br> </strong>When ordinary Singaporeans stand in the voting booth, they will
               ask themselves 2 questions, “Is my life better than it was 4 or 10 
              years ago? Will my children’s lives be better 10 years from today?”….in 
              the coming months, the one truth that will emerge is you cannot earn 
              people’s votes by making their lives worse….and this truth will soon 
              dawn on the PAP!</p>
              <p>Today, almost 40% of people living in Singapore are foreigners. Who 
              doesn’t feel the negative impacts of the sudden increase of so many 
              types of foreigners jostling for the limited spaces in our MRT trains, 
              buses, shopping areas, food centers, markets, beaches, void decks and 
              walkways? What about the sleaze brought about by the increasing numbers 
              of prostitutes who are on work or student permits plying their trade and
               construction workers loitering near our homes?</p>
              <p>Most new residents have no idea about the Singapore culture , its 
              rich ethnic multiplicity that has brought about a seamless diffusion in 
              the way Singaporeans go about their everyday lives. As a result of the 
              variegated backgrounds of Singaporeans, the evolution of racial and 
              religious celebrations into a true blend of inter-related tolerance and 
              understanding over a long period of time but with the basic belief that 
              this is the country they will live and die in. In 10 to 20 years time, 
              we will be outnumbered by the foreigners who bring with them their own 
              values, motivations, political aspirations and idiosyncrasies. Is this 
              what we want for our children and their children?</p>
              <p>Slowly but surely, this government will pander to the needs of the 
              diverse foreign residents. We are seeing this happen – 10 million 
              dollars being spent to integrate the new residents is only the start. In
               the past we were told we need foreigners for their special skills. Then
               we were told we need foreigners to create jobs for Singaporeans. We 
              have also been told that foreigners are here to take up jobs that 
              Singaporeans do not want. Now the latest reason for increasing the 
              foreign influx is our fertility rate is low.</p>
              <p>So importing foreigners and over-populating our little island is 
              likely going to make it worse – importing foreigners using low fertility
               as an excuse is going to plunge us into a disastrous vicious 
              cycle….disastrous for locally born Singaporeans who will diminish in 
              numbers but perhaps acceptable to the PAP government that sees Singapore
               as Singapore Inc so it doesn’t matter to them where workers come from 
              so long as GDP grows.</p>
              <p><strong>Conclusion<br> </strong>Recently the MM called Chee Soon Juan and the late JB 
              Jeyaretnam ‘duds’. It was a cheap shot! He knew they were not in a 
              position to sue him. Chee and JBJ are not duds. “The 82 people put in 
              place by his selection system who allowed GST to be increased, 
              ministers’ pay to reach the highest on the planet, foreign influx to be 
              so massive, and rejected the idea of minimum decent wage for 
              workers….these people are the real duds.” (taken from recent blog, sorry
               I can’t quite recall who).</p>
              <p>The PAP government believes it deserves the highest salary in the 
              world. But the performance of some, if not all, of its ministers is 
              apparently dismal. One needs only to recall Whitley Centre, Bedok SMRT 
              depot, Orchard Road floods, Temasek/GIC losses, public housing fiascos, 
              just to name a few. None of the mistakes were admitted, much<br> less any apology tendered.</p>
              <p>Bill Clinton, a few years back, warned about people who believe they 
              possess the ‘absolute’ or ‘hard’ truths because it can lead to actions 
              and decisions that are extreme and detrimental to human society..</p>
