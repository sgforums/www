              <p><br>Let me share with everybody about this sensitive topics on cpf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As we know, malaysian cried fouled over the cpf withdrawal right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I saw two cases where these 2 man reached 60 (I couldnt remember the age) and eligible to withdraw the money but once money draw out, they will not be able to work in spore anymore. Right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>These 2 men draw and closed the cpf and return back home to malaysia. Of course after change to myr, one got more than myr $30k. He was happy to get that fat amount of money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that, he sat at home do nothing, just like retired person. But then the money dry up fast and now trying to look for job in his hometown that can pay only about myr$1k per month which is by any standard hard to get by. (malaysian daily products are in fact, expensive).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He want to come back to spore to work, but then unable to cos he already closed his cpf.</p>

              <p>If we are not happy with the state of affairs or if we prefer a 
              change, it is then our choice to do the right thing and to make the 
              change rather than pointing fingers at PAP.</p>
              <p>PAP has made sure that
               the climate here is not conducive for the opposition parties to 
              flourish. This is quite normal for a ruling party wanting to stay in 
              power absolutely. But absolute power corrupts absolutely. It is the 
              responsibility of the citizens to ensure there is check and balance in a
               democratic system.</p>
              <p>Fear is a normal human feeling. So far PAP has
               been able to play the fear card very well. We are now a more mature 
              society. I think the element of fear will gradually be fading away.</p>
              <p>In
               the past, although our opposition parties did not give PAP a real 
              challenge, but I can observe that they were able to apply pressure to 
              influence some government policies. Without the presence of oppositions,
               we would in a worst situation today.</p>
              <p>Singapore is now at a 
              turning point. LKY will soon be a figure of the past. I can anticipate a
               period of great change ahead of us.<br> Singaporeans must realize what 
              their priorities are. We have to get the priorities right in the first 
              place. To do so, we have to:</p>
              <p>1.	 looking at both short term and long term;<br> 2.	moving away from blaming and accountability, but learning to think about the roots of the problems we are facing;<br> 3.	avoiding reacting to what are happening around you, but trying to create new opportunities;<br> 4.	thinking beyond having, but embracing being and becoming.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The
               coming election is of paramount important to all. The outcome is going 
              to map the direction of the post-LKY era of Singapore. A Singapore 
              without check and balance, a Singapore without a multi-party system is 
              not a real democracy. Singapore will certainly be a more gracious 
              country without PAP dominating in almost every aspect of their lives. 
              Stronger opposition parties will force the PAP government to be more 
              consultative and equitable, to be more caring and sincere.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I am 
              confident that the people of Singapore know what to do because it is not
               going to affect them alone but also the destiny of their children.</p>
