              <p>There is a large portion that are not voting due to walkovers. They can be supporters or curious citizens to see what the oppositions have to offer. The effect may not be immediate but when these non-voters are given a chance to vote next round, the impression last.</p>
              <p>As always, the fun factor is important. A good campaign not only works at the spur of the moment.</p>

              <h5>Sent by <em>Aaron Seah</em></h5>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“For a person who runs a million-dollar charitable 
              organisation, $600,000 is peanuts as it has a few hundred millions in 
              reserves.” – Mrs Goh Chok Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“If you don’t include your women graduates in your 
              breeding pool and leave them on the shelf, you would end up a more 
              stupid society…So what happens? There will be less bright people to 
              support dumb people in the next generation. That’s a problem.” – MM Lee 
              in 1983</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Save on one hairdo and use the money for breast screening.” Lim Hng Kiang</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Only 5% are unemployed. We still have 95% who are employed.” – Yeo Cheow Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Retrenchment is good for singapore . If there is no retrenchments, then I worry.” – SM Goh</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“We must encourage those who earn less than $200 per 
              month and cannot afford to nurture and educate many children never to 
              have more than two… We will regret the time lost if we do not now take 
              the first tentative steps towards correcting a trend which can leave our
               society with a large number of the physically, intellecually and 
              culturally anaemic.” – MM Lee in 1967</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Contrary to public perception, the White Horse 
              classification is not to ensure that sons of influential men gets 
              preferential treatment. Instead it is to ensure that they do not get 
              preferential treatment.”- Cedric Foo. (This is really insulting our 
              intelligence)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I give you an example: you put out a fun podcast, you
               talk about ‘bak chor mee’; I will say “mee siam mai hum”, then we 
              compete.” PM Lee Hsien Loong (How profound)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I don’t think that there should be a cap on the 
              number of directorship that a person can hold.” – PAP MP John Chen who 
              holds 8 directorships<br>.<br>“It’s not for the money because some of 
              the companies pay me as little as $10,000 a year.” – PAP MP Wang Kai 
              Yuen who holds 11 directorships.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“We started off with (the name) and after looking at 
              everything, the name that really tugged at the heartstrings was in front
               of us. The name itself is not new, but what has been used informally so
               far has endeared itself to all parties.” – Mah Bow Tan on the $400,000 
              exercise to rename Marina Bay as Marina Bay .</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Having enjoyed football as a national sport for 
              decades, we in Singapore have set ourselves the target of reaching the 
              final rounds of World Cup in 2010.” – Ho Peng Kee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I would want to form an alternative policies group in
               Parliament, comprising 20 PAP MPs. These 20 PAP MPs will be free to 
              vote in accordance with what they think of a particular policy. In other
               words, the whip for them will be lifted. This is not playing politics, 
              this is something which I think is worthwhile doing.” – SM Goh</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“If you want to dance on a bar top, some of us will 
              fall off the bar top. Some people will die as a result of liberalising 
              bar top dancing; a young girl with a short skirt dancing on it may 
              attract some insults from some other men, the boyfriend will start 
              fighting and some people will die.” – Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for 
              Community Development, Youth and Sports</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“People support CPF cuts because there are no protest outside parliament.” – PM Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Singaporean workers have become more expensive than those in the USA and Australia .” – Tony Tan</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“No, it was not a U-turn, and neither was it a reversal of government policy. But you can call it a rethink.” – Yeo Cheow Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">” I regret making the decision because, in the end, 
              the baby continued to be in intensive care, and KKH now runs up a total 
              bill of more than $300,000 ” – Lim Hng Kiang, regretting the decision to
               save a baby’s life because KKH ran up a $300,000 bill</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Without the elected president and if there is a freak
               result, within two or three years, the army would have to come in and 
              stop it.” – MM Lee Kuan Yew</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Please do not assume that you can change governments.
               Young people don’t understand this” – Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew, 
              post-2006 General Elections</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?” – Dr Vivian Balakrishnan<br>“People
               could buy frozen food instead of more expensive fresh food” “They could
               opt for house brand goods, which cost less than others. ” – PM Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Based on figures provided by ComfortDelGro , 
              Singapore ’s biggest taxi operator, cabbies are pocketing about $11 more
               a day, earning about $318.” – Mr. Raymond Lim</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“GST hike is to help the poor.” – PM Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“‘I mean, we are different. This was a lapse, what to do, it’s happened.” – PM Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘You know, the cure for all this talk is really a good
               dose of incompetent government. You get that alternative and you’ll 
              never put Singapore together again: Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together
               again…and your asset values will be in peril, your security will be at 
              risk and our women will become maids in other people’s countries, 
              foreign workers.’<br>- MM Lee – Justifying pay hikes for Singapore ministers, The Straits Times, 5 April 2007</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘This should never have happened. I am sorry that it has.’ – Wong Kan Seng</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Lim Swee Say:<br>Every month, when I receive my CPF 
              statement, I feel so rich and the best part is, I know the CPF money 
              won’t run away. CPF will still be around for a long, long time to come. 
              Not only is it earning good interest, my capital is protected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Leaving the best for last…<br>“Right now we have Low 
              Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We can deal with them. Suppose 
              you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members in Parliament. Instead of spending
               my time thinking what is the right policy for Singapore , I’m going to 
              spend all my time thinking what’s the right way to fix them, to buy my 
              supporters votes, how can I solve this week’s problem and forget about 
              next year’s challenges?” PM Lee Hsien Loong, 3 May 2006.</span></p>

              <p>Although I have always respected our founding father Lee Kuan Yew 
              since childhood, there are times when I vehemently disagree with him 
              when his remarks are hurting.<br><br>Taken from National Geographic [<a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text/3">http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2010/01/singapore/jacobson-text/3</a>]:<br><em>Over
               time, the MM says, Singaporeans have become "less hard-driving and 
              hard-striving." This is why it is a good thing, the MM says, that the 
              nation has welcomed so many Chinese immigrants (25 percent of the 
              population is now foreign-born). He is aware that many Singaporeans are 
              unhappy with the influx of immigrants, especially those educated 
              newcomers prepared to fight for higher paying jobs. But taking a 
              typically Darwinian stance, the MM describes the country's new subjects 
              as "hungry," with parents who "pushed the children very hard." If native
               Singaporeans are falling behind because "the spurs are not stuck into 
              the hide," that is their problem.</em><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If I lose because spurs 
              are not stuck into my hide, fair enough. However, if I lose because I am
               carrying an unfair burden on my back, then that is another matter. We 
              native Singaporeans carry the burden of National Service and as a result
               get discriminated by employers who favor foreigners who do not go 
              missing in action year in year out. Is it fair for these foreigners to 
              enjoy a competitive advantage over us in the job market because of the 
              sacrifice native Singaporeans make to our nation?</span></span> Is this good for the 
              long-term Total Defence of the nation with morale among our soldiers 
              draining? Shouldn't the government take some steps to share the burden 
              among native Singaporeans and free-riding new citizens, PRs who are 
              benefiting from the security we provide but need not lift a finger 
              towards National Defence? Should we, say, raise taxes on them to share 
              the burden?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">If my parents feel that I am not 
              good enough and have to adopt new children to run the family business, I
               respect that. However, they should not impose on me the extra burden of
               protecting the family assets while the adopted kid enjoys similar 
              privileges and get the same asset share in the will.</span></span> There must be some 
              differentiation over the sharing of the fruits. I have been with the 
              family right from the start. Opportunistic late-comers to the party when
               the going is good should not be expected to have the same privileges as
               the earlier ones who were with the family when prospects were 
              uncertain. Yes, reward these opportunists for their contribution but not
               to the extent that they free-ride on the earlier, loyal ones.<br><br><span style="color: #339966;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The
               family will fall apart if parents do not treat the children fairly. 
              Unfair division in the will is a leading cause of family disputes..</span></span></p>

              <p>Nice to see so many possibly young people waking up to see wat the ruling party is like. The battle is now the votes of the young VS the votes of the uncles &amp; aunties.</p>
              <p>For the young , seriously , hardly any future for you or your children as in time to come , this country WILL be dominated by aliens.</p>
              <p>For every oppostion vote given by the young , there will be at least 3 or 4 illiterate , non internet savvy , 'highly dependent on Wan bao kind of aunty and uncle voting for  FAP'.</p>
              <p>But your voice as a learned &amp; educated person can sway these people , talk to your parent's friends , uncles next door &amp; aunties at the market, those u know la of coz. And also your parents , your siblings , your cousins , your uncles , your aunties.</p>
              <p>From a general view , votes from the new citizens &amp; the aunties and uncles if left unaffected will most definitely return the FAP to power again. So start doing something now , things might just change.</p>

WHY? because they r incompetent. they cant agree on anything, they have different aims, they DONT KNOW what they want for singapore. all they do is appeal to the few grouses of singaporeans.     :)</p></div>

              <h5>Sent by <em>Aaron Seah</em></h5>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“For a person who runs a
              million-dollar charitable organisation, $600,000 is peanuts as it
              has a few hundred millions in reserves.” – Mrs Goh Chok
              Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“If you don’t include your
              women graduates in your breeding pool and leave them on the shelf,
              you would end up a more stupid society…So what happens? There will
              be less bright people to support dumb people in the next
              generation. That’s a problem.” – MM Lee in 1983</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Save on one hairdo and use
              the money for breast screening.” Lim Hng Kiang</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Only 5% are unemployed. We
              still have 95% who are employed.” – Yeo Cheow Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Retrenchment is good for
              singapore . If there is no retrenchments, then I worry.” – SM
              Goh</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“We must encourage those who
              earn less than $200 per month and cannot afford to nurture and
              educate many children never to have more than two… We will regret
              the time lost if we do not now take the first tentative steps
              towards correcting a trend which can leave our society with a large
              number of the physically, intellecually and culturally anaemic.” –
              MM Lee in 1967</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Contrary to public
              perception, the White Horse classification is not to ensure that
              sons of influential men gets preferential treatment. Instead it is
              to ensure that they do not get preferential treatment.”- Cedric
              Foo. (This is really insulting our intelligence)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I give you an example: you
              put out a fun podcast, you talk about ‘bak chor mee’; I will say
              “mee siam mai hum”, then we compete.” PM Lee Hsien Loong (How
              profound)</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I don’t think that there
              should be a cap on the number of directorship that a person can
              hold.” – PAP MP John Chen who holds 8 directorships<br> .<br> “It’s not for the money because some of the companies pay me as
              little as $10,000 a year.” – PAP MP Wang Kai Yuen who holds 11
              directorships.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“We started off with (the
              name) and after looking at everything, the name that really tugged
              at the heartstrings was in front of us. The name itself is not new,
              but what has been used informally so far has endeared itself to all
              parties.” – Mah Bow Tan on the $400,000 exercise to rename Marina
              Bay as Marina Bay .</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Having enjoyed football as a
              national sport for decades, we in Singapore have set ourselves the
              target of reaching the final rounds of World Cup in 2010.” – Ho
              Peng Kee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“I would want to form an
              alternative policies group in Parliament, comprising 20 PAP MPs.
              These 20 PAP MPs will be free to vote in accordance with what they
              think of a particular policy. In other words, the whip for them
              will be lifted. This is not playing politics, this is something
              which I think is worthwhile doing.” – SM Goh</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“If you want to dance on a bar
              top, some of us will fall off the bar top. Some people will die as
              a result of liberalising bar top dancing; a young girl with a short
              skirt dancing on it may attract some insults from some other men,
              the boyfriend will start fighting and some people will die.” –
              Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Community Development, Youth and
              Sports</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“People support CPF cuts
              because there are no protest outside parliament.” – PM

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“No, it was not a U-turn, and
              neither was it a reversal of government policy. But you can call it
              a rethink.” – Yeo Cheow Tong</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">” I regret making the decision
              because, in the end, the baby continued to be in intensive care,
              and KKH now runs up a total bill of more than $300,000 ” – Lim Hng
              Kiang, regretting the decision to save a baby’s life because KKH

              want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?” –
              Dr Vivian Balakrishnan<br> “People could buy frozen food instead of more expensive fresh food”
              “They could opt for house brand goods, which cost less than others.
              ” – PM Lee</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">“Based on figures provided by

              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">‘You know, the cure for all
              this talk is really a good dose of incompetent government. You get
              that alternative and you’ll never put Singapore together again:
              Humpty Dumpty cannot be put together again…and your asset values
              will be in peril, your security will be at risk and our women will
              become maids in other people’s countries, foreign workers.’<br> - MM Lee – Justifying pay hikes for Singapore ministers, The

              the best part is, I know the CPF money won’t run away. CPF will
              still be around for a long, long time to come. Not only is it
              earning good interest, my capital is protected.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Leaving the best for
              last…<br> “Right now we have Low Thia Khiang, Chiam See Tong, Steve Chia. We
              can deal with them. Suppose you had 10, 15, 20 opposition members
              in Parliament. Instead of spending my time thinking what is the
              right policy for Singapore , I’m going to spend all my time
              thinking what’s the right way to fix them, to buy my supporters
              votes, how can I solve this week’s problem and forget about next
              year’s challenges?” PM Lee Hsien Loong, 3 May 2006.</span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>In the past Sinkapore is a poor country, the PAPist have nothing to lose by governing Sinkapore, besides that, Sinkapore was thrown out from Malaysia, so there's something to prove but now all the PAPist wants is money, tell me how much more working years worth of money are we suppose to present to the fat pigs PAPist ? How much more CPF are we suppose to give? Don't forget if you grow old, your CPF don't have the required Minimum Sum you will have to top up or pledge half of your flat for that. That's a cool few hundreds of thousands of dollars when you retire, wages are so low now even day to day living will be hard if you are not those lucky ones to have high paying jobs. That's for now only. The PAPist likes to adjust the rules whenever they like. Watch them change rules again when they win the election.<br><br>In the past, the citizens does not own a living to the government, now, the government own our asses permanently. What's more our asses are even owned by FloorTraps, getting screwed and laughed at, What's more do you want? Say opposition no good, then? Got any other solution? Have, of course, emigrate, loh. For those young or earning quite well ones, just be careful your luck doesn't run out and your jobs and asses get screwed big time by FloorTraps.Just emigrate when young, must emigrate by late twenties or you are screwed.<br><br>Read this, next time even taxi drivers jobs also cannot find, ah, maybe if Floor Traps are kind, maybe, they will have Wash FloorTraps Backside jobs for you if you plead harder with your suck-their-toes skill and it pleases them.<br><br><br><strong>Singapore to open job market for its “FTs”</strong><br><br>http://www.temasekreview.com/2010/09/29/netizen-emails-george-yeo-to-enquire-about-india-asking-singapore-to-open-job-market-for-its-fts/<br><br>Quote from article:<br><br><strong>The additional list has to include chefs, physiotherapists, nurses, school teachers, nutritionists, professionals in entertainment and hospitality sectors</strong>,” said Amit Mitra, another Indian official.<br><br><br>I would only say if this election, cannot unseat PAPist, then if you are young , then please emigrate, then bring your parents there, don't leave them here to suffer, please.<br><br>I'm hon gan already, my backside already tear from all the government and FloorTraps screwings, the blood flowing like an open tap already, later can fill up Sinkapore River also.<br><br>Just think of it that way, thieves (PAPist) will not wait for policemen (Opposition) to be trained and then catch them. In life, there will be times when there is no choice at all, this is it, you can only vote for opposition and nothing else. Sinkapore is already a ticking timebomb and yet people still think they have a choice.<br><br>Sikapore was and is controlled by PAPist and they had and will continue to shape and control all your mindsets til the day you die, and you wouldn't even know it.They will toy you around because human rights and political freedom is non-existence in this hell hole, do you want changes or chains? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p></div>
