              <p>On a small Island there are only two human, one man named Ben and one
               lady named Des. They live happily until one day God put in another four
               young man into the Island. Now Ben have to compete with the other four 
              male to be with the lady. As Ben was older he lost Des to the four young
               man.</p>
              <p>He did not give up easily, he trained hard trying to fight 
              the four young man. Unfortunately, the four young man also train 
              themselve.</p>
              <p>In the end Ben not only lost Des, he was even screwed by the four young man.</p>
              <p>After
               4 years, the four young man was removed. Ben was happily jumping around
               thought that his chance was coming but he saw another four younger man 
              was put in to replace the other four young man. Now Ben was very much 
              older compared to these new comer.</p>
              <p>That it, Ben was tired mentally
               and physically, he gave up on all the upgrading and training. He just 
              bend down and let them screw. He understand that he can never make it as
               there will always be new young blood to replace these four.</p>
              <p>So we
               all are fuck up by PAP (acting as our god). No matter how much we 
              upgrade we can never compete with young people as we are getting older 
              every year. We have to take care of our old parents and children. These 
              new FTs do not have to worried about their familes they are here just to
               make money.</p>
              <p>VOTE THE TRAITORS AND THEIR PETS (like Ben and Des) OUT to HELL</p>

              <p><strong>NS enforces an artificial active 
              lifestyle and gets you accustomed to an above average calorie intake. 
              Once slaves leave NS, many fail to adjust their calorie intake down to 
              suit the normal sedentary lifestyle and they put on more weight than 
              they would have not they not served NS. Just look at professional 
              athletes after they retire, take Ian Thorpe for example, and you see the
               same kind of effect. That's why men are fatter.
              <br> <br>NS is also forcing men to put on weight in order to downgrade to 
              avoid the IPPT, it's a form of resistance and rebellion, SAF wants you 
              to keep fit, you do the opposite to defy them. If you are already 
              struggling during NS time, it only gets worse and worse as you get 
              older, instead of fighting the losing trend, you go the opposite 
              direction.
              <br> <br><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why would anyone want to keep fit in order to defend jobs for FTs? 
              When there's nothing worth defending, you do your utmost to ensure that 
              SAF is crippled, which not only includes damaging SAF equipment. The 
              more jobs Sinkees lose to foreign trashes, the more angry they become 
              and the less they want to defend Sinkeeland. </span></span><br> <br>In short, NS is the leading cause of male deaths by forcing them to damage their health and sending them to an early grave.</strong></p>

              <p>also got a point here, but then the cycle has to be broken before the further increase of the NSmen and MR people you're talking about demanding even more compensation,should they try to outsource NS.</p>

              <p>In singapore,</p>
              <p>1. There are many JLB top management team in 
              their late 50-60s. holding on to their turf ( see jack neo's movie on 
              government corporation for ideas)</p>
              <p>2. Now gov. encourages or wants to make it a law for retirement age to be extended to 68- serves these JLB well.</p>
              <p>3.
               Many 30s-40s. unable to "perform" due to the above and become 
              disillusioned. Many are also forced to "carryballs". For those unable to
               accept they either fall out of favour or have to leave the scene. <br>(Even
               the teaching profession is mired in controversies. ACS(I) bio teacher 
              must become a "comfort man" to the CEO ( Even schools use business title
               like CEO, CFO...stupid )</p>
              <p>4. Many lady bosses around especially in schools and statboards. Woman in leadership is akin to having a lady to pilot a 747.</p>
              <p>5.Private
               sector hires based on cost, not based on experience. They also practise
               age discrimination. Males above 35 are considered over the top and too 
              expensive. <br>-<br>6. Sinkie males are considered "tokenism" in many 
              MNCs- "Just to make up the numbers". Employers prefer their workers to 
              be non-NS liable.</p>
              <p>7. MNCs prefer not to transfer skills or give 
              important roles/functions to sinkies as a result. They also prefer to 
              bring in their own people from their host countries or from SEA 
              countries.</p>
