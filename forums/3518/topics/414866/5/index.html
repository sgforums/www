              </div>
              <p><strong>THE PAP AND HIGH HDB FLAT PRICES<br> </strong><br> The prices of the HDB flat have escalated by 300% for last 10 years 
              under PAP. Every 5 years term there will be an increase of 100 % on the 
              cost of the flat</p>
              <p>Year 2000 3 rooms Flat at $100K<br> Year 2005 3 rooms Flat at $200K (100%)<br> Year 2010 3 rooms Flat at $300K (200%)</p>
              <p>Year 2015 3 rooms Flat at $400K(300%)</p>
              <p>As you can see from the figures, the prices of the flat will be 
              increase 100%, 200% and 300% in 2015 every 5 years terms if PAP continue
               to be the ruling. Most people salaries are barely able to coup up with 
              the rate of the increased property prices and escalating high cost of 
              living.</p>
              <p><strong>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CPF AND THE HDB FLAT PRICES<br> </strong><br> They tie up the HDB flat pricing with your CPF money. How they do it?</p>
              <p>(a) High HDB flats prices (This already done by PAP to allow more foreigners and through speculation)<br> Mah Bow Tan made a statement saying that higher property prices is good for the people?</p>
              <p>(b) Delay on CPF Withdrawal Age to 65 (PAP already done).  From the 
              initial withdrawal age of 55 has been changed to 62.  From 62 has been 
              further delay to 65 in the recent years.  According to Lim Boon Heng, 
              the withdrawal age will again be delayed to 68.</p>
              <p>(c) From 1 July 2010, CPF Minimum Sum will be raise to $123,000 (this
               is 50% of the 3 room resale HDB flat) and will gradually increase to 
              link to the appreciation of HDB prices to lock our life long savings. 
               The excuse given that people are having longer lifespan. (This is 
              already done by PAP)</p>
              <p>Example: Minimum CPF sum and the HDB prices<br> Current price of 3 room resale HDB flat = S$300K</p>
              <p>If you sell your house at old age:</p>
              <p>50% ($150K) downgrade for living expenses and medical bills (actual net worth of your house)</p>
              <p>50% ($150K) lock up in the CPF Minimum Sum (govt piggy bank)</p>
              <p>On paper value; it appears that we will benefit from high property 
              prices. But we only get 50% when we sell the flat as the balance goes to
               the govt who take 50% of the profit for their own investment.</p>
              <p>(d) This will be the most dangerous stage as the old CPF scheme 
              converts to CPF life long annuity plan to control Singaporeans and the 
              money will be lost forever. (This has not been implemented as yet but 
              will definitely go through if they win in the election).</p>
              <p><strong>OLD CPF WITHDRAWAL SCHEME</strong></p>
              <p>Under the old CPF scheme, the spouse will get the CPF monies should the husband/wife passed away</p>
              <p>Example, you have $123,000 in your CPF account and the estate duties 
              is 10%.  Your spouse will receive $110,700 in the event when you passed 
              away. </p>
              <p><strong>THE PROPOSED NEW CPF ANNUITY SCHEME BY OUR GOVT</strong></p>
              <p>For the new CPF annuity plan, it is an insurance plan. Everybody put 
              $123K into the pool.  Let’s say retirement is 65 and pass away at 70 
              years old.  Under the old CPF scheme, the amount will be returned to my 
              spouse ($89,100 based on the monthly payout of $400 and after deducting 
              the estate duties of 10%).  But under the new CPF annuity plan, our 
              money will go back to the pool and lost forever even though we can 
              nominate the beneficiaries.  It is not clearly specified as the scheme 
              is very vague as to how much the beneficiaries will receive (it could be
               $1K or $10K up to our PAP govt’s discretion)</p>
              <p>This money belongs to us, there is something very fishy as to why our
               govt is so obsessed with our CPF monies?  The monthly payout of $400 is
               hardly enough in this high cost of living.  And if you die early, you 
              will not be able to enjoy your life long savings as all the money will 
              go back to pool/govt in 1 cycle.</p>
              <p><strong>WHY WE NEED TO HAVE A NEW COALITION GOVT TO RULE SINGAPORE</strong></p>
              <p>This is also very important in order to stop the increasing property 
              prices from enriching their ministerial salaries for the next 5 years, 
              otherwise everybody will lead a dog life. They will sure implement the 
              “CPF live long annuity plan to replace the old CPF withdrawal scheme”.</p>
              <p>In other words they will use the new scheme to convert your money to 
              become their money to control you. Everybody will work like a slave till
               death with no money to pay for the expensive medical bill at old age.</p>
              <p>If you complain about the high cost of living, they will take this 
              excuse to import more FT/FW because of fewer babies to increase their 
              income and GDP growth. Therefore we have to vote a new coalition govt 
              form by all alternative parties (except the fake opposition 
              wayang parties) to improve our quality of life till our ripe old age.</p>
              <p>Under the current system, no matter how hard we work, it is still not
               enough to satisfy the PAP govt. If we miss this opportunity, we will 
              never make it forever with the influx of the New Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>The elite will continue to rule the country because they have plenty 
              of money and in power, and the poor will get poorer and poorer as they 
              cannot compete with them. If you are greedy for the election goodies, 
              you will lose your soul and sell your life away. Our system needs to 
              reboot and revamp with new parties (coalition govt) with the repeated 
              errors and mistakes made by the PAP govt (no accountabilities and 
              transparency) and also to abolish elitism under the 1 party system.</p>
              <p> <br> That is why this election is very critical for every citizen to decide 
              the type of fate and future they want. “To have a new life or to be a 
              walking dead”.</p>

               used to be PR five years ago before I converted to be a citizen. 
              Meanwhile I have strong ability at Japanese and Chinese (I am not a 
              mainland Chinese) as I was trained and educated in this two languages 
              but I have no strong ground in English as I never gone through education
               system of Singapore.My whole families converted to be Singapore 
              citizen.Since then, I lost my job. My full time job taken by dependent 
              pass holder &amp; EP holders.</p>
              <p>I forced to take up part time job and lived apart with family by 
              studying overseas for two years.My partner’s job was taken by foreigner 
              too, he is on contract job until next July.</p>
              <p>I have got a job after coming back from overseas, the working place 
              located in Singapore, but they laid me off two months later as my pay is
               too high for them and I am not a Japanese.</p>
              <p>How ridiculous the reason given to me, the whole section are only 
              filled with Japanese people.Young Japanese like to take up an overseas 
              position with pretty low pay just for fun. And as I know some of the 
              Japanese companies in Singapore hiring 100%(EPs &amp; PR,some only EPS 
              holders) their own people. They treat Singapore like their home. Money 
              flow in to our country, we should feel happy right?? Government always 
              persuades us to sacrifice for the nation.</p>
              <p>Am I thinking too much?Sometimes I am really depress( as I cant 
              accept myself out of job or working part time.Not sure whether it’s a 
              pride problem.And also I am worrying about the future of my nephews and 
              my son”s though I am still very young.</p>
              <p>If VOTE PAP OUT could change the environment, I would vote for it!</p>
              <p>I am not good at handling frustration and depression caused by 
              outward environment, but hope to share with you the following statement 
              which can comforting me sometimes.</p>
              <p>Matthew 6:34<br> “So don’t worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today’s trouble is enough for today.</p>
              <p>Cheers for today.</p>

              <p>The is the vicious cycle of the policies to import foreigners to

              <p>Those smarter foreigners who has converted, will take it as a 
              springboard for future migration to a more developed country with 
              freedom, comfortable life style and social security.</p>
              <p>The expectation for a new citizen is to cast their vote for the 
              ruling party during election to thank for their policies and priviledged
               for them to become a Singaporean. On the other hand, the authentic 
              citizen has lost the faith and hopes that the damaging policies will 
              change soon, but expecting the worst instead.</p>
              <p>So, it is time for the new citizens to take turn to voice their 
              concerns and hardship, because it is too late to U turn for the decision
               made, unless you migrate again.</p>

You are considered a “talent” while Singaporeans are regarded as “lazy”, “complacent”, “lesser mortals”.</p>
              <p>2. Your chances of getting a job is much better than a Singaporean 
              since you are “cheaper”, though not necessarily “faster, better”.</p>
              <p>3. You can get a PR as short as 2 months, even without needing to serve NS! Where else in the world can you get such a deal??</p>
              <p>4. As a PR, you can buy a HDB flat with the govt’s grant, even if you are single and below 35 years of age.</p>
              <p>5. You can send your children to either a local or international 
              school, while Singaporeans are not allowed to attend international 
              schools unless given special permission by the MOE.</p>
              <p>6. You can get free scholarships without bonds, while many Singaporeans struggle to pay off their student loans.</p>
              <p>7. You have the best of both worlds, your homeland and here, 
              especially your homeland when in a time of crisis, while many 
              Singaporeans have no choice but to be stuck here.</p>
              <p>8. Your opinions about Singapore and Singaporeans will be in the 
              headlines while Singaporeans’ complaints about you take the backseat.</p>
              <p>9. You can diss Singaporeans all you want, and still the PAP will kiss your feet.</p>
              <p>10. Singaporeans will soon be at your mercy since the foreign population here at 40%, will in a short time, be the majority.</p>
              <p>(An interesting thing to note that as a PR, under HOTA (this includes
               all Singaporeans), your organs will be used for donation once you die 
              unless you opt out. But you’ve lived your life to feed off the benefits 
              this country has given you anyway, so who cares? You should be more than
               happy to!)</p>
              <p>This madness has got to stop.</p>
              <p>VOTE FOR CHANGE, VOTE PAP OUT!</p>

              <p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-33596" style="border: 0px none;" title="imagesCAZEBQ4P" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/imagesCAZEBQ4P.jpg" alt="" width="217" height="233">I
               will make it short and simple. I am a well travelled guy in my 40s, 
              having graduated with a masters in psychology from a prestigious US 
              university. I have lived in countries like Australia and UK.    What i 
              am going to tell u is not a conspiracy theory , This is a call , do not 
              be hoodwinked by the immigration policy. The real agenda is to make 
              locals dependent on the foreigners. The foreigners know it too, in fact 
              some did explained the scenario to me, including close friends who work 
              in stat boards who seem to agree.   </p>
              <p>How is this being done? The locals are currently 60% and the 
              foreigners are around 40% . The excuse is being low birth rate. But the 
              flawed immigration policy is contributing to even lower birth rates. 
              When the number increases to 60 % foreigners and 40 % locals, the impact
               is going to be disastrous.  Currently the integration between locals 
              and foreigners failed. It had failed in Australia and Germany.</p>
              <p>Why does one have to think it will succeed here even when the other 
              countries have some sort of policies to protect their own citizens from 
              the immigration impact . It is even worst here where foreigners do not 
              pay significantly higher taxes to support locals. We are heading towards
               a scenario where in the future , locals may have to marry foreigners , 
              give our homes to them, rely on them for job opportunities and put our 
              children in schools taught by them, work in companies where they are the
               bosses while not benefitting in any way,  . That’s the plan. Rest 
              assured new policies will be introduced to ensure that .    </p>
              <p>Do not be hoodwinked. They always had some social engineering  in 
              society for the last few decades to ensure compliance to authorities. 
              The immigration policy is one of them .  Do what is necessary to avoid 
              the scenario  before it’s too late.  </p>
              <p>It is about your own life and your children’s. Your country, your 
              birth rights. The group of locals who can help u , are the opposition , 
              locals  like u.     If u do not want to come to the streets ,  be 
              warned.</p>

              <p>A political party is only as good as its leaders are. The present PAP
               is a pale shadow of its former self and has ceased to be a political 
              party altogether.</p>
              <p>It is merely a political vehicle for a single man to govern the 
              country. No PAP member can ever hope to rise up in its ranks without 
              prior approval from this man.</p>
              <p>The PAP has been enjoying a “good life” for far too long without any opposition in parliament to check on it.</p>
              <p>Due to the lack of political competition, it has become complacent 
              with many of its leaders losing touch with the ground and forgetting 
              that they are put into power by the people in the first place.</p>
              <p>There is little accountability or transparency in Singapore’s present
               political system which resembles more like a third world dictatorship 
              than a first world democracy.</p>
              <p>All institutions of the state are controlled by the PAP directly or 
              indirectly such as the police, media, civil society, grassroots 
              organizations and trade unions.</p>
              <p>Repressive laws are put in place to curtail the civil and political 
              liberties of citizens under the guise of “public order and safety”.</p>
              <p>It is not a surprise that Singapore is described as a “textbook 
              example of a politically repressive state” by respected international 
              NGO Human Rights Watch recently in its annual report.</p>
              <p>The entire set-up is put in place to perpetuate the PAP’s rule 
              forever so as to prevent an alternative center of power from emerging to
               challenge it.</p>
              <p>Even Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong admitted himself that Singapore 
              is better off being dominated by a single party than multi-party 
              politics.</p>
              <p>Law Minister Shanmugam defended Singapore’s political system on the 
              basis that it needs an “efficient” government which makes fast 
              decisions.</p>
              <p>The stunning policy reversals made by the PAP recently is a testament
               to the failure of a rigid one-party system over-dependent on a 86 year 
              old “forecaster extraordinarie” to think out of the box, anticipate 
              future problems and to inspire an entire nation to follow its 
              leadership.</p>
              <p>Based on current policy trends and direction, the following stands a 
              higher chance of happening than PAP distributing our reserves to every 
              citizen if we were to allow the PAP to rule Singapore for another fifty 
              years:</p>
              <p><strong>1. Native Singaporeans will become a minority:</strong></p>
              <p>Due to the PAP’s liberal immigration and pro-foreigner policies, 
              foreigners now make up 36 per cent of Singapore’s population, up from 14
               per cent in 1990. Of the remaining 64 per cent who are citizens, an 
              increasing proportion are born overseas.</p>
              <p>The birth rates of native Singaporeans, especially the ethnic 
              Chinese, continue to decrease despite a slew of government incentives 
              introduced to encourage them to bear more children while the PAP has 
              promised only to “slow down” the inflow of immigrants.</p>
              <p>At the rate they are mass importing foreigners elsewhere to take up 
              Singapore citizenship, it is only a matter of time before native 
              Singaporeans fall below 50 per cent of the population. In fact the day 
              is not too far away.</p>
              <p>With Singaporeans becoming a minority in their own country, it will 
              become increasingly difficult for them to vote out the increasingly 
              unpopular PAP which is actively wooing PRs and new citizens by roping 
              them into grassroots organizations in a desperate bid to hang on to 
              power</p>
              <p><strong>2. Brain drain will accelerate:</strong></p>
              <p>According to figures from the Home Affairs Ministry, there are about 
              180,000 Singaporeans working overseas, many of whom are unlikely to 
              return.</p>
              <p>About 1,000 Singaporeans give up their citizenships yearly and the number is set to rise in the coming years.</p>
              <p>In an interview done by the Straits Times two years ago, more than 50
               per cent of youths interviewed had expressed thoughts of emigrating.</p>
              <p>Common reasons cited include stressful living conditions, lack of social security in old age and a repressive political climate.</p>
              <p>Contrary as to what the PAP would like to believe, the degree of 
              political freedom in a country is an important factor in keeping and 
              attracting world class talents, few of whom want to live forever under 
              the shadow of a totalitarian state.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, there is an increasing number of unhappy, frustrated and
               angry Singaporeans who are voting with their feet because they have 
              given up hope of voting the PAP out of office altogether.</p>
              <p>The PAP is replacing the talented Singaporeans who left with second 
              and third class “talents” from China and India which will surely 
              decrease the quality of our “stock” in the long run.</p>
              <p>How can Singapore expect to compete with China, India and its 
              neighbors when it is importing “inferior” talents from them while its 
              own talented people are emigrating in droves? The future of Singapore is
               becoming indeed bleaker and bleaker with each passing day.</p>
              <p><strong>3. Widening income gap between the rich and the poor:</strong></p>
              <p>Under PAP rule, Singapore’s income gap between the rich and the poor has widened considerably over the last two decades.</p>
              <p>Singapore now has the highest income gap among the thirty most 
              developed countries in the world due to the PAP’s lop-sided economic 
              policies which favor big businesses at the expense of ordinary citizens.</p>
              <p>It is widely acknowledged among economists that Singapore’s 
              phenomenal economic growth over the last few years is a result of its 
              open-door policies to foreign workers which help to keep labor costs 
              down thereby boosting the GDP growth figures artificially.</p>
              <p>The relentless influx of cheap foreign labor has depressed the wages 
              of ordinary Singaporeans which remain stagnant at $2,600 monthly.</p>
              <p>The PAP doesn’t seem to be concerned about the implications of 
              Singapore’s widening income gap as illustrated by Minister Mentor Lee 
              Kuan Yew’s reply to a question on it at a Kent Ridge Ministerial Forum 
              last year.</p>
              <p>He said that Singapore’s widening income gap is an “inevitable 
              consequence” of globalization and it mattered little so long the 
              government continues to create jobs for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>He forgot the fact that some jobs offer too low a pay to afford a 
              decent standard of living in Singapore and that Japan, South Korea and 
              Taiwan have been exposed to globalization too and yet they have a much 
              narrower income gap than Singapore.</p>
              <p>Singapore will soon become only a playground for the rich ruling 
              elites and foreigners while the poor continue to slog day in and out to 
              pay for the roofs over their heads.</p>
              <p><strong>4. More and more expensive HDB flats:</strong></p>
              <p>Due to limited supply of new flats and rising demand fueled by 
              immigration, the prices of HDB flats have sky-rocketed in recent years.</p>
              <p>Despite widespread frustration, worries and resentment on the ground, the PAP has refused to even acknowledge the problem.</p>
              <p>National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan continues to insist that 
              HDB flats remain “affordable” to ordinary Singaporeans though he 
              admitted that he was “caught off guard” by the recent spikes in prices.</p>
              <p>His deputy Senior Minister of State Grace Fu said the price 
              appreciation is a “good thing” for Singaporeans as it help “create 
              wealth” for them which can only be unlocked if they emigrate out of the 
              country.</p>
              <p>Law Minister Shanmugam claimed he had a “hunch” that Singaporeans are
               responsible for the sky-rocketing prices when it is the PRs who are 
              “spoiling” the market as admitted later by MM Lee himself.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said there is nothing his 
              administration can do to control prices in the resale market when all it
               needs to do is to increase the supply of new flats, housing subsidies 
              and income ceiling.</p>
              <p>At the rate the prices are going up, HDB flats will soon cost more 
              than $1 million dollars in the not too distant future thereby plunging 
              Singaporeans into greater debts.</p>
              <p>The PAP is unlikely to bring down prices because it will spark an 
              outcry among earlier buyers who have bought their flats at exorbitant 
              prices and hence prices will continue to go up in the future.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the wages of ordinary Singaporeans are unlikely to 
              keep pace with the increase in HDB flat prices and Singaporeans will 
              have to pay through their teeth for a 99-year old leasehold property 
              which do not belong to them in the first place.</p>
              <p><strong>5. Uncertain and insecure future, especially in old age:</strong></p>
              <p>Though Singapore is the second richest nation in Asia after Japan and
               its two giant sovereign wealth funds GIC and Temasek Holdings can 
              afford to lose billions of dollars of national reserves in failed 
              overseas investments, Singaporeans, its citizens enjoy few social 
              welfare benefits especially in public healthcare.</p>
              <p>Despite repeated claims by the PAP that public healthcare is 
              affordable to Singaporeans, there are increasing concerns on the ground 
              that their savings may be depleted by hefty medical expenses.</p>
              <p>Indeed there is a common saying among Singaporeans that “one can afford to die, but not fall ill in Singapore.”</p>
              <p>With stagnant wages, increase in cost of living and little savings 
              left after paying for over-priced HDB flats, Singaporeans from the 
              middle and lower income group face an uncertain and insecure future 
              ahead of them, especially in old age.</p>
              <p>There is no job security in Singapore. Regardless of one’s 
              qualifications, one can easily get replaced by a cheaper “foreign 
              talent” in their 30s, 40s or 50s and force to take up a lower-paying 
              job.</p>
              <p>There is no security in old age and unless one belongs to the top 10 
              per cent of the earners in Singapore, one is expected to work for as 
              long as it takes till the day they drop dead and die. Is this all life 
              is about?</p>
              <p>The Singapore government can well afford to increase spending on 
              social welfare to provide cheaper public healthcare and to assist the 
              needy, but has blatantly refused to do so.</p>
              <p>Is this the kind of life you want for yourself, your children and 
              grandchildren under another 50 years of uninterrupted PAP rule without 
              any checks and balances?</p>
              <p><strong>6. Viability of Singapore as a nation is becoming a suspect:</strong></p>
              <p>It took us 50 years to forge a common identity as Singaporeans, but 
              this good work done by past PAP leaders is being dismantled bit by bit 
              by the relentless influx of foreigners which has diluted Singapore’s 
              national identity.</p>
              <p>There is little time to integrate all the newcomers because too many of them have come within too short a period of time.</p>
              <p>As there are already substantial number of them in Singapore, they 
              tend to congregate among themselves instead of reaching out to other 
              Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>We are already seeing ethnic enclaves emerging in the HDB heartlands and the situation is likely to worsen in the future.</p>
              <p>With native Singaporeans leaving en masse and being replaced by 
              economic migrants from third world countries, the viability of Singapore
               as a nation is becoming a suspect.</p>
              <p>Singapore is becoming more like a playground for the rich and 
              connected and a hotel for the foreigners than a home for Singaporeans.</p>
              <p>When native Singaporeans are struggling daily just to make ends meet,
               it is difficult to expect them to have any sense of belonging to the 
              country.</p>
              <p>To compound matters, with China and India becoming more developed and
               prosperous, the brain drain is starting to reverse with Singapore 
              Chinese and Indians flocking there to work, live and retire.</p>
              <p>There is already a sizable Singapore community in the Pearl River 
              Delta region of China and the number will probably set to grow in the 
              coming years.</p>
              <p>As the PAP continues to build Singapore as an economic paradise for 
              big businesses, it has forgotten how human nature works: human beings 
              will always seek a better life and security is foremost on their minds 
              when they decide where to plant their roots.</p>
              <p>This will be where our country is heading to if we allow the PAP to rule Singapore for another fifty years.</p>
              <p>GIC and Temasek may still have billions of reserves in their kitties,
               but what significance do they have if we do not have a nation to speak 
              of?</p>

              <p>The odds of PAP winning big time have just been raised. The nine menbers that left Reform Party are important and key personnels, so the party's ambitions will be severely tested.</p>
              <p>With the possibility of Election being held in May, this is bad newe.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure whether they will join other parties, but time is running out so if other parties are imterested, please make a run for them if possible.</p>
