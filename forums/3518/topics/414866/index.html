              <p>As part of election strategy, it's important that we all know and be constantly reminded that what is exactly at stake.</p>
              <p>In addition of what i have posted in the last thread back in early part of this year, it appears that the view across forums are uninamious.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The wicked Familee Traitors and their 
              CCB running dogs will accelerate the importing of FTrash to 
              unprecedented level to ensure <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sporns will be forever be an insignificant
               minority in their own cuntry with their usefulness being used as human 
              shield for the Familee Traitors and their FTrash pets in war.</span> The Oppos

               the most ridiculous excuses. <span style="color: #ff0000;">FTrash will laugh at and trample even 
              harder on Sporns in the workplace and on the street.</span> The cost of living 
              will rise to crushing level as the FAPee CCBs let loose their unbridled 
              greed. Sporns will eventually become extinct, but not before their 
              children hate the ballessness of their ancestors for not even having the

              <p>And.....yes i strongly agree with that.</p>
              <p>As an NSmen myself, i feel indignated , having to protect those foreign trashes stable rice bowl thru NS and reservist, and yet getting laughed at and trampled by those people, and yet they give us attitude and arrogance problem, as if this is their homeland.</p>
              <p>In my workplace, my FT superior is a mad dog who keep on shouting at people for everything,even to extent of doing it at people in front of 100s of people.</p>
              <p>In my own opinion, if things stay status quo beyond this GE, he will be embolden to do more like say.....starting <strong>using his fist </strong>to get us in order?</p>
              <p>the above two paragraphs, i am making example out of my work situation.</p>
              <p>Brothers, Sisters, Uncles, Aunties,</p>
              <p>Do you want yourself or your future generations to be serfs and slaves under these FTs?</p>
              <p>Do you want your future generations to be subservient to the ungrateful MIWs and evil FTs?</p>
              <p>Do you want to be discriminated and despised in your own homeland for the future to come?</p>
              <p>Do you want those FTs forcibly intergrate us with their own way of life, erasing ours in the process?</p>
              <p>Do you want your children to be denied from schooling in favour of FTs?</p>
              <p>Do you want to pay and pay and pay and pay like shit while FTs here are having it easy while here?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>If you look at US and Japan, there isn't much choices and any way for them to really get out of their economy woes. Their political parties are interlocked tightly with all the rich people, just like the PAPist, very hard for them to make any changes that might impact big businessmen, it is a balance that they failed to implement. Citizens are mostly being led to a blind alley while the rich get rich and if something failed, they can get off easily (US financial meltdown). There is no one to represent the less well off, just like in Sinkapore, who will speak up and can have some ways to represent the 30% of Sinkapore population that are wallowing under the poverty line. The PAPist will not change and will not listen simply because they are not the ones that have to complete with others for flats, for jobs and for that soda can lying in between two old uncles savangering for metal to sell. They will not listen if you happen to fall into that poverty line. You die, your business, too bad.</p></div>

The elites will not be too bothered about who, how much and how the state of citizens are. They only need people to work for their businesses, thus a nonchalance attitude towards any Tom, Dick or Harry coming in to work. If the locals don't want 12 hrs, 6 days work, fine, lots of refugees from other third world country will come and take over. If locals don't want that job because of family commitment, fine, they will take over as well. If that salary can't even pay your bills, fine, they will take over as well. Who care? The rich elites aren't complaining, it is draft citizens only, who cares? These old and rusty original citzens will just go the way of the doodoo bird, any way and replaced by third world country newly converted hard working, cheaper, better and faster obediant worker to continue to let the rich elite to propsper, who cares?</p></div>
