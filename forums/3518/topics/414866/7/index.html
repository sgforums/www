              This was because Mr Lee Kuan Yew insisted that families, especially if 
              you were not among the elite, could have only two children.</p>
              <p>Fast forward to 2011. The same Mr Lee now laments that Singaporeans 
              are not reproducing quickly enough. With only 1.2 births per person, 
              Singaporeans cannot replace themselves. Our population decline did not 
              just emerge from out of the blue. It took years of relentless and 
              ruthless state intervention including, as in my mother’s case, punitive 
              measures to stop Singaporeans from procreating.</p>
              <p>Many couples, especially those in the lower-income and lower-educated
               groups, were pressed to undergo invasive, irreversible medical 
              procedures such as ligation and sterilisation to prevent them from 
              having more babies.</p>
              <p>The PAP then discovered that it had miscalculated spectacularly; our 
              birthrate was too low. We are the least fertile country in the world. 
              (Only two other places are less fertile than Singapore –- Hong Kong 
              (1.04) and Macau (0.91). But these are not countries, they are cities in
               China.)</p>
              <p>The Government is now desperately reversing course. Now Singaporeans are suddenly urged to have more than two children.</p>
              <p>This is the kind of political abomination – the playing with the 
              people’s lives by this Government – that Singaporeans have had to 
              suffer. Playing God is what the PAP has done and continues to do. It 
              does this by making policy based on personal whims and opinions, not on 
              research.<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Population too stressed</strong></p>
              <p>Today our fertility rate is still too low. We need at least 2.1 
              births per person. At this rate, experts calculate, our economy won’t 
              have enough people to sustain it.</p>
              <p>The Government is providing monetary incentives for Singaporeans to 
              produce more babies. Few seem to be biting. The reasons for younger 
              Singaporeans not to have children are two-fold: life is too stressful 
              and cost of living is prohibitive.</p>
              <p>It is clear that the lifestyle in Singapore where the PAP drives 
              Singaporeans on to achieve GDP growth is backfiring on the country. 
              People are recoiling.</p>
              <p>Take <a href="http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2011/01/14/experts-explain-spores-declining-birth-rate/">Ms Jean Heng</a>,
               30, a civil servant who says that life in Singapore is just too 
              stressful: “Work takes up a huge amount of time and I have no energy to 
              take care of kids. If I want to have kids, I would want to devote enough
               resources in terms of time and money.”</p>
              <p>Experts agree say that the high cost of living is a main reason for 
              couples shying away from raisin children. Professor Gavin Jones, a 
              sociologist at the National University of Singapore, says that the high 
              financial and opportunity cost deters young couples from having 
              children.</p>
              <p>With HDB flat prices going through the roof, how are couples starting
               off in life going to afford a home of their own? Without a home, how do
               you sart a family? Medical fees are escalating by the year and so are 
              eductaion costs. Public transport is a nightmare nowadays and buying a 
              car is insanely expensive.</p>
              <p>To have children, it is a must for both spouses to work in order to 
              meet with household expenses. Working parents have little time for their
               kids which begs the question: Why have children just to leave them 
              un-parented?<strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>The PAP doesn’t get it</strong></p>
              <p>So what does the PAP do? It opens the floodgates to foreigners so 
              that we can create an instant population that would give us the number 
              that the PAP wants to see. MM Lee, being the prime architect of this 
              system, now tells us that we need to <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1105496/1/.html">import younger immigrants</a>.</p>
              <p>This policy has destabilised the nation to the extent that Singapore 
              is no longer a country for Singaporeans. It has become an outpost for 
              all who want to come here to make money.</p>
              <p>This is how the PAP is dragging the country down the drain. It first 
              discourageous Singaporeans from having children. Then when it realises 
              that our population is shrinking it brings in foreigners to replace us.</p>
              <p>The PAP does all this with one and only one objective: To raise the 
              GDP at all cost which is the only way it can legitimise its autocratic 
              rule. Let’s not forget the raising the GDP directly raises the 
              ministers’ salaries. But increasing the GDP doesn’t mean making 
              Singaporeans richer.</p>
              <p>There are consequences if we continue to let the PAP rule Singapore 
              unchecked and these consequences will be horrendous for the nation. We 
              must stop the PAP before it’s too late.</p>

              </div>
              <p>Yesterday, I managed to contact an old friend. He still keeps his old mobile phone number.</p>
              <p>A couple of years back, he was a salesman, a real estate agent. Not 
              the top, nonetheless a decent salesman. He did get a couple of awards 
              here and there, some trophies like best sales, etc.</p>
              <div id="attachment_37364" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-37364" style="border: 0px none;" title="300px-JurongwestHDB" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/300px-JurongwestHDB.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225">
              <p class="wp-caption-text">Blocks of flats in Jurong West.</p>
              </div>
              <p>At that point of time, the property prices in Singapore was booming. 
              Especially with the Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats.</p>
              <p>People are willing to pay extra monies on top of the market valuation.</p>
              <p>A $30,000 above the valuation was a normal thing. As with any booming market, agents can make a good living.</p>
              <p>The commission rate was typically 2% for selling and 1% for selling.</p>
              <p>In Singapore, it was peculiar to get the same agent to do both the selling as well as buying houses for their clients.</p>
              <p>So the agent could have sold the house for $400,000 and get 2% and 
              from the family and look for another house for that same family and get a
               commission for it too.</p>
              <p>All in all, she would get 3% for buying and selling from the same 
              family. So if the total selling and buying is $700,000, she would get 
              $21,000.</p>
              <p>All she needed to do was to get 1 buy and sell a month, and she would be on easy street.</p>
              <h2>Changes</h2>
              <p>Things doesn’t always stay the same. The Housing and Development 
              Board or HDB (so-called government agency that provided “subsidized” 
              flat to Singaporeans) introduced a slew of measures to curb the runaway 
              prices of government “subsidized” flat. Besides that there were the 
              “loan” fixing and other underhand tactics too numerous to list here.</p>
              <p>To cut the long story short, what used to take only 1 working adult 
              10 to 15 years to pay off the mortgage of  a “subsidized” HDB flat; now 
              takes 2 working adults 30 years to pay it off.</p>
              <p>And by the time the couple hits “retirement”; their Central Provident
               Fund (CPF) savings are practically zero, though as a consolation their 
              flat is fully paid.</p>
              <p>And these retirees needed to work after retirement for their daily 
              bread. It’s not a pretty picture. Old man and woman, struggling to go to
               work with a very minimum pay (not minimum wage).</p>
              <h2>How it affected my friend</h2>
              <p>Because of the changes and other factors, the HDB property market dried up.</p>
              <p>During that time, when property prices were high, he bought a 4 room flat at an astronomical price of about $400,000.</p>
              <p>A lot of people at that time, believed that their property will 
              always go up. Coupled with a strong economy, people’s spending are more 
              exuberant.</p>
              <p>His sales plummet. For the past two years, he could not keep up with 
              the mortgage. The arrears snowballed until it became the equivalent of 
              more than a year’s mortgage.</p>
              <p>One fine day, HDB decided to reposes his flat.</p>
              <p>He did try to get a job. Unfortunately, he is a minority in Singapore.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>When the economy picks up, the minority is the last to be
               hired; when the economy is down, the minority is the first to be fired.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The companies are only offering the very minimum pay and not minimum wage. He couldn’t make ends meet.</p>
              <p>About six months ago, the HDB forcefully acquired his flat. His 
              family of 5 kids, 1 wife got kicked out by the provider of “subsidized” 
              flat.</p>
              <p>Some stupid hack would think: “What happened to the good income he earned when he was an agent?”</p>
              <p>As I said, only a stupid hack would ask that question.</p>
              <h2>Where is the family staying now</h2>
              <p>Here’s the kicker:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>He now rents an apartment in the neighboring country, Malaysia. Stays somewhere in Johor Bahru, Larkin.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>His monthly rent? Monthly about RM600. I told him he could get 
              cheaper if he rents a terrace house; the going rate is about RM300 to 
              RM400.</p>
              <div id="attachment_37363" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 250px;"><img class="size-full wp-image-37363" style="border: 0px none;" title="3346044534_8450010f54_m" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/3346044534_8450010f54_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180">
              <p class="wp-caption-text">Larkin, Johor Bahru, Bus Interchange</p>
              </div>
              <p>True, he told me. He doesn’t own a car and Larkin is a bus 
              interchange to Singapore. Every morning, his SINGAPOREAN kids take 
              service 170 to Singapore to attend school.</p>
              <p>And for himself? He told me he now works part-time as a driver.</p>
              <p>When someone tells you that they work part-time, you would probably 
              think it’s either 8:00am to maybe 12:00pm or 12:00pm to 5:00pm.</p>
              <p>That’s where you’re wrong. His part-time is from 10:00am to 9:00pm. I
               don’t know about you, that sounds like a full-time job to me.</p>
              <h2>Why didn’t he just stay in Singapore</h2>
              <p>After the forced selling of his house, he didn’t have enough money 
              for the down payment of another “subsidized” flat. He apartment was 
              forced-sold at a loss.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, he isn’t entitled to another HDB concessionary loan. He 
              has to get the housing loan from a bank (one of the changes that HDB 
              instituted).</p>
              <p>Banks would only loan money to rich people. His situation would be 
              defined as a significant credit risk. Furthermore with him being in the 
              middle age (50), nobody is willing to loan him money to be paid for the 
              next 30 years.</p>
              <h2>What about renting?</h2>
              <p>The HDB have a curious rule that states you can’t rent any flat from them for 30 months after you have sold your flat.</p>
              <p>For renting direct from HDB, the going rate is less than $100 a month.</p>
              <p>On the so-called open market or not directly from HDB (the owner of 
              the flat rents), the going rate for a room is about $400 to $600; a HDB 
              apartment from upwards of $1,500 and above depending on the size of the 
              flat.</p>
              <p>If the flat is close to a bus interchange or an MRT station, be ready to pay a premium for it.</p>
              <p>Relatives? You got to be joking. HDB flat is already way too small for a family, let alone for 2 families.</p>
              <h2>He’s not the only one</h2>
              <p>I’m sure there are other Singaporean economic refugees. I know of at 
              least 2 more. They can’t afford the daily living expenses here, rents a 
              place in Johor Bahru and daily commutes to Singapore for work.</p>

              <p>Slaves have to obey, we did it.<br> Slaves have to work long hours, we did.<br> Slaves have low salary, we did accept low wages.<br> Slaves have no time for family, we did.<br> Slaves cannot produce, we did.<br> Slaves childrens cannot have better life, we sacrificed.<br> Slaves childrens are no better than elites, we thought.<br> Slaves are Slaves are we?</p>
              <p>Look at Papies and Civil Service:<br> They make many babies.<br> They get bonuses, we hardly could get one.<br> They work 5 days a week while we do not.They implemented this policy,<br> for all Singaporeans. 5 day work week.<br> Lost of jobs, to FT.<br> New citizens, replacing us.<br> No minimum wages.<br> Inflation at it’s highest.<br> Many , many more issues, we can do nothing about it.</p>
              <p>Are we not SLAVES THEN?</p>
              <p>.<br> <strong>A Slave</strong></p>

              <p>if he did , and he cannot help, go fyuck him upside down!!!</p>
              <p>my stake at this election is just few times to walk or drive to polling station and vote for my freedom, media freedom, vote against draconian laws, vote against immigrants, vote against influx of hot money into singpore property, voet against ERP, vote against Casino, vote against elitism. vote against minsterial salary.</p>
              <p>i got so many reason to vote for opposition.</p>
              <p>I have no reason to vote for PAP.</p>

              <p>an more appropriate question to be asked is whether he had voted for PAP back in 2006, if so he deserved it.</p>
              <p>Anyway i have reasons NOT to vote for PAP.</p>
