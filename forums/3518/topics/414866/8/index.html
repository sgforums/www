              <p>I think Old Lee said something along this - so long ago can't remember the exact words but only meaning and intention.</p>
              <p>He said he intented to move sg away from voting based on personality to voting based on party representation.  Later enough, the GRC came into placed. <br><br>Any one can remember this? I believe this is the real reason for having GRC in the first place.</p>

              <p>I think this is true only in the old days, where opposition is really very weak and no one gives a hoot about them. PAP, at that time, wanted a large majority win to enhance their image and deflect off criticism of being a dictator party.</p>
              <p>Presently, PAP would  laugh and thank even vote-spoilers for helping them. As long as the vote is not going to the opposition, they will laugh all the way to our banks, open them and help themselves to more Kate Spades and whatever that tickles them. They will kneel over and laugh til an appendix operation is needed and that will be even cheaper than a heart by-pass that costs only $8.</p>

              <p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-38346" style="border: 0px none;" src="http://www.temasekreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/15138-300x235.jpg" alt="" width="300">An
               unemployed man got angry when he saw a party being held near his block.
               He flipped out, went over to the party and overturned 11 trays of food.
               The incident happened at the open area next to Block 546, Ang Mo Kio 
              Avenue 10 at about 6.30pm on 2 Apr 2011.</p>
              <p>The catering company, Stamford Catering, had just set up the buffet 
              for travel consultant Anna Tan when the incident happened. She organized
               the party, which was attended by 70 guests, to celebrate the birthdays 
              of her 2 children whose birthdays were 10 days apart.</p>
              <p>After the trays were overturned, the floor was splattered with fried 
              rice, curry chicken, vegetables, spring rolls, and other food items. The
               unemployed man tried to run away, but Mrs Tan’s husband and two workers
               from the catering company managed to prevent him from escaping. The 
              police were called.</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan described the man as medium-built and in his 40s. Mrs Tan said, “He did not panic at all, even when the police arrived.”</p>
              <p>The man repeatedly asked if he had injured anyone.</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan paid $460 for the buffet. Luckily for the Tan family, some 
              kitchen staff were still around and were able to prepare another seven 
              trays of food for them. The catering company was uncertain if they would
               bill Mrs Tan for the extra food.</p>
              <p>The police have classified the case as mischief and are investigating.</p>
              <p>The unemployed man later told Lianhe Wanbao that he had lost control 
              when he saw the trays of food in the party as he had only a bowl of 
              instant noodles for the whole day. He said, “I don’t know why I got 
              angry or why I did that. I also didn’t know how the family will react if
               I apologized to them personally so I hope to do it through the papers.”</p>
              <p>Mrs Tan had accepted his apology. “People might think that he did it 
              because we offended him. So I’m glad he has clarified the matter,” she 
              said.</p>
              <p>Clearly, as more Singaporeans are being replaced by cheap foreigners 
              and become unemployed, we are going to see more of such irrational acts 
              in our society keeping our police busy.</p>
