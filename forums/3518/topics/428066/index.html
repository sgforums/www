              </span></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; line-height: 19.0pt;   "><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">The PAP had finally
              introduced all the candidates a coupled of days ago, many of which, if not all,
              are great potentials and with capabilities. Unfortunately, in my view, there
              may be one, which can put the party's credential in question.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; line-height: 19.0pt;   "><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">The Straits Times reported
              on 15 Apr 2011, that one of the candidate (Ang Wei Neng, VP SBS Transit) had
              learnt the value of empathy from his son, which after all, may be a question.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; line-height: 19.0pt;   "><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">I understand from a friend
              who used to work in SBS Transit and specifically under his west district
              management, mentioned that all 7 of the Route Manager resigned during his
              tenure, and that is not inclusive of those who worked directly under him in the
              district HQ. As a comparison, none left during the same period at the East
              District.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; line-height: 19.0pt;   "><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">I believe that speaks
              volume of his management capabilities. Of course, it is not just abut his
              management capabilities in question, but also other areas of concern which i
              believe, those who had worked under him, can attest to some of those areas.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 16.0pt; line-height: 19.0pt;   "><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">I strongly believe that
              the candidates which all the parties put up, should not be just focused on
              career or academic achievements. These are just one part of the reflection of
              an individual's values, management capabilities and work ethics. All-rounded
              feedback about the individual should be gathered when parties are fielding
              their candidates. One good example is the tremendous good feedback from all
              levels of soldiers for the two ex-Generals (Tan Chuan-Jin and Chan Chun Sing)
              who have nothing but good words on their leadership qualities as well as values
              and ethics.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style=" font-family: Arial; ">I sincerely hope that in the running up to GE 2011,
              the selection of candidates must be done thoroughly especially on the values
              and ethics of the candidates as they are the same people who will be serving
              the people of the public.</span></p>

              <p>tot you are cos your login name is SBST (the usual short name for SBS Transit). :)</p>
              <p>But you are right, much politics in play and my friend finally understood why he did not act justly or choose to take hard actions on some issues which are obviously not right. And that could be for the fact that he knew he was entering politics...</p>
              <p>also seems like what the ST reported him as someone who learnt the value of empathy is not very empathetic in the way he treated his staffs in SBST.</p>
