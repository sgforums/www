              <p>Choose the right government who can provide you with the things
                  that you truly need to ensure survival and repopulate as Humans. I
                  would choose the current ruling government cos they have proven
                  themselves for providing me with a safe and stable environment
                  until I have the luxury to come to sgforums and post about it,
                  instead of digging through rubbish piles and drinking from
                  longkangs or even selling myself to prostitution for survival.</p>
              <p>I think it's a clear fact that our current government has given
                  Singaporeans so much luxuries that Singaporeans failed to realise
                  and appreciate their luxuries because they have been comparing
                  between themselves. I would like to ask Singaporeans to go compare
                  their lifestyles and environments and almost everything with people
                  in the world who are non-Singaporeans. So that they can learn how
                  to appreciate the luxuries they had enjoyed since they were born as
                  a Singaporean.</p>

              <p><br>kengkia, since you are aware that it is human nature to be insatiable, and it is common that such humans will find it difficult to obtain lasting happiness in their lives because they were insatiable. </p>
              <p>When is it going to be enough for seeking improvement to make a better lives for themselves? And how is it wrong to seek comfort by hiding in their comfort zone when they are contented and eventually tired and realised that such frustrations of seeking improvement is a never-ending vicious cycle in their lives?</p>
              <p>Talking about doing our descendants a favor, how many people do you know that are really genuinely doing everything they can for their descendants when money are involved? Isn't ensuring that happiness is provided on a daily basis to the descendants, should become the correct and desired way we should look after our descendants? Is money going to educate our descendants in any moral sense? Do we really want to teach and educate our descendants to worship money so that our sons would become fortune hunters and our daughters would become gold diggers?</p>
              <p>I think it is rude for the citizens to "audit" and criticised their government when their country is strong and stable, economy is good and profitable, environment is peaceful and developing. Take this example for instance, would you do that to your boss with regards on how he want to steer HIS company towards any directions he desired? You can try but you should be aware that you shouldn't because that company you are working for and belonged to, is NOT your company but it's HIS company. You are free to quit your job and move onto a better job where the boss is willing to listen to your criticism and "advice/complaint/gentle reminder". Would you end up jobless or would you find yourself constantly changing job?</p>
              <p>Improve yourself so that you will be useful to your boss and you may express your opinions when you are capable enough to be asked to do so. Otherwise, you are still the only person in this world who cares about your own advice and opinion and criticism, it is not going to affect your boss or anybody around you...nobody is going to take your advice and opinion seriously because you haven't earned your rights and place in your company or society.</p>
              <p>Focus on yourself and ensure that you earned your rights by making yourself important enough for your government to seek your exclusive opinion and advice. Otherwise, ask yourself why should your government listen to our advice and criticism when there are many more capable and important people out there ahead of you. Why should our advice and criticism matters particularly to your government?</p>
              <p>Many people would say we're talking terms and just being reasonable because the government "served" the people. I don't like to argue on that cos I believed the boss doesn't "served" his employees just because his employees worked for the company. People who thinks that they are important enough to demand other people's attention are just being plain unreasonable and rude and these people are insensible and do not have a place in their society and probably do not even know if they have a place within their society or not.</p>
              <p>I would encourage insatiable people or malcontent people with the government to earn their rights by becoming a politician themselves. Then I can agree with them when they are particularly concerned with how the country is being governed.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, they should focus on their future and really have genuine concern for their descendants and vote for the government who can provide them with the best future for them and their descendants.</p>
              <p>I would vote for the current ruling government and even though I know it is confidential, but I would give my support to the current ruling government because I have benefited and I enjoyed my environment and I like how my country has grown. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I hope my descendants can enjoy similar if not better future than me.</p>

                  attention are just being plain unreasonable and rude and these
                  people are insensible and do not have a place in their society and
                  probably do not even know if they have a place within their society
                  or not.</p>
              <p>I would encourage insatiable people or malcontent people with
                  the government to earn their rights by becoming a politician
                  themselves. Then I can agree with them when they are particularly
                  concerned with how the country is being governed.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, they should focus on their future and really have
                  genuine concern for their descendants and vote for the
                  government who can provide them with the best future for them and
                  their descendants.</p>
              <p>I would vote for the current ruling government and even though I
                  know it is confidential, but I would give my support to the current
                  ruling government because I have benefited and I enjoyed my
                  environment and I like how my country has grown. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I hope my descendants can enjoy similar if not better future
                  than me.</p>

              <p>Personally, I feel that the current ruling governement is not as great as the past because they lack of checks / accountability. Sure, the American banks are at fault for creating big financial turmoil, but they have checked over by their governement such that they cannot have more than some limit on their pay. How about our government? Because no one has the right to check / oppositions are not efficient, so the pay is either stay there or even increase when they have committed errors such as Town Councils losing funds etc. (Sure, everyone make mistakes, it is not like asking them to quit or out from power but more balance is needed)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The way I say is because I dont think the ruling government is going to do good for my descendants......</p>

              <p><br>I'm not from those era and I can imagine myself to be happy still provided my family and situation remained the same regardless of which countries or regimes I'm living in.</p>
              <p>I can tell you anyone can be happy no matter which regime or era they are living in, because happiness is really a mindset that we all have a choice to decide for ourselves. Try forcing a smile by practicising in front of a mirror, do that often and you can still smile your brightest during your saddest moments and you will be smiling for real and become happy before you know it. And you don't even need to go through much trouble to advise yourself to be happy.</p>
              <p>Happiness is really a very simple thing which everybody deserves to experience. If you find yourself deluded from happiness, then maybe it's a good time to observe happy people around themselves and ask why these people are happy?</p>
              <p>You can be insatiable but still be happy even though you do not possess happiness.</p>
              <p>What people truly need is to seek happiness and not just becoming happy.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think they will...people in power or at least imagined themselves in power always have this unavoidable fear for their lives. Fear that their lives will end in an instant if they are lucky, or die slowly if they are unlucky.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if all the people are unhappy with them, they could be easily poisoned when they go buy takeaway during their lunch or dinner or supper. I imagined they should all have breakfast at home and not at someone else's home.</p>
              <p>Either way, such invisible fears are impossible to eliminate completely and they are necessary to exist in order to ensure bad people do not have the luxury to sleep in peace and enjoy their air-con...that's only for bad people.</p>
