              <p>oh come on. these new candidates are put into rather safe district. reason being. most probably these areas are gonna have a walkover. therefore these new puppets are just being put there for the time being to social around with the citizens first before changing their area.</p>
              <p>i guess this is part of PAP's strategy. whos so dumb to put such an inexperienced young lady to be a representative for their area?</p>
