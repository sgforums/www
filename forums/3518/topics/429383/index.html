              <p>Given your argument, can we not say Dr Puthucheary had been benefitting from Singapore economy although he wasn't a Singaporean until some two years ago?

              <p>I'm not angry that Dr Puthucheary did not do his NS when he became a citizen. But  I'm angry that he had assumed his 10 years as a doctor is equivalent to be doing NS. This is an insult to all our local doctors who had fulfilled their NS. I'm proud that I too have done my NS for my country Singapore although I was just only a junior ranking soldier. I am willing to put my sons thru NS and to put them to perform their duties to Singapore in time of need. </p>

              <p>I don't think it takes much guts to be an opposition candidate this time round, the ground is so sweet for the opposition this time round many people are lapping whatever shit the opposition throws up.</p>
              <p>and I have nothing against FTs who come here to sink their roots and become PRs or citizens and put in a stake here. Infact, I think a certain renewal and rejuvenation is important for a dynamic society, not just a dynamic economy. But the important thing is that they must be rooted here. I did a comparision between CSM and his party running mate angela oon in another thread, true, angela is a malaysian who only got her citzenship only last year, but she's been here all the time, through good times and bad, so in this sense, she's rooted here and has got more stake in this country than CSM does, NS or no NS, remember, my ah tiong storeman friend also served his NS before farking off to australia on his shiny new red passport. </p>
              <p>And your last sentence is precisely my point, if he were a PAP candidate, most of the people who have been railing against PAP and their foreigner policies would have jumped onto CSM and buried him so deep .... but there is this deafening and ironic silence now ..... just because he is an opposition candidate ... people have often accused the PAP of making a mockery of them ... but I'm flummoxed when they swallow up everything when an opposition party does the same thing ... </p>

              <p>you're right, 10 years as a doc in Singapore doc may not be = 2.5 years as an army MO, but the difference between doc puthu, and worker's party angela oon, two candidates this time round who's gotten their citzenship within the last 2 years, is that both of them have spent more time in Singapore than CSM ever did, NS or no NS. I am suspicious of people who disappeared from long periods of time from singapore and then waltz back imagining they can represent the country and the people, be it CSM, wijaysingha or jeyaratnam. Being foreign born and disapppearing soon after getting his citizenship only reinforces this mistrust.</p>
              <p>Just as I have put it, imagine if these people were to come out as PAP candidates, would the reception for them been the same ? Double standards ? Anyone but a PAP man ? ... I am sure the thinking electorate can see the irony here ...</p>

              <p>I don't think it takes much guts to be an opposition candidate this time round, the ground is so sweet for the opposition this time round many people are lapping whatever shit the opposition throws up.</p>
              <p>and I have nothing against FTs who come here to sink their roots and become PRs or citizens and put in a stake here. Infact, I think a certain renewal and rejuvenation is important for a dynamic society, not just a dynamic economy. But the important thing is that they must be rooted here. I did a comparision between CSM and his party running mate angela oon in another thread, true, angela is a malaysian who only got her citzenship only last year, but she's been here all the time, through good times and bad, so in this sense, she's rooted here and has got more stake in this country than CSM does, NS or no NS, remember, my ah tiong storeman friend also served his NS before farking off to australia on his shiny new red passport. </p>
              <p>And your last sentence is precisely my point, if he were a PAP candidate, most of the people who have been railing against PAP and their foreigner policies would have jumped onto CSM and buried him so deep .... but there is this deafening and ironic silence now ..... just because he is an opposition candidate ... people have often accused the PAP of making a mockery of them ... but I'm flummoxed when they swallow up everything when an opposition party does the same thing ... </p>

              <p>you're right, 10 years as a doc in Singapore doc may not be = 2.5 years as an army MO, but the difference between doc puthu, and worker's party angela oon, two candidates this time round who's gotten their citzenship within the last 2 years, is that both of them have spent more time in Singapore than CSM ever did, NS or no NS. I am suspicious of people who disappeared from long periods of time from singapore and then waltz back imagining they can represent the country and the people, be it CSM, wijaysingha or jeyaratnam. Being foreign born and disapppearing soon after getting his citizenship only reinforces this mistrust.</p>
              <p>Just as I have put it, imagine if these people were to come out as PAP candidates, would the reception for them been the same ? Double standards ? Anyone but a PAP man ? ... I am sure the thinking electorate can see the irony here ...</p>

              <p>i concur, there's always two side to a coin but it still doesn't warrant anyone to tell anyone who holds a Singapore citizenship to leave. I may dislike the so call PRC "prostitute" who was given the citizenship but nevertheless, she is still Singaporean if she still wants to be eventhough  I think that the system flawed.</p>
