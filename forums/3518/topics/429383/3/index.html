              <p>peranakans term was coined by colonial british people long ago.they are different from the china chinese and neither were they malays or muslims. but they have been in malay archipelago for many genberations and think n talk differently from the china chinese.</p>
              <p>today.....most asian chinese in malay archipelago would be regarded as peranakans too.so all sporean chinese who love laksa,longtong,kuay teow etc are classed also under perankan group.they have been in the straits..they were born in the straits..they act differently from chinese...so all chinese sporeans are rightfully perankans in reality!</p>

              <p>I am not attacking peranakans. I am attacking Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>The problem with Lee Kuan Yew is that he is using a fake persona, posing as a chinese when he is in fact a hakka peranakan. And he has pursued policies that have weakened chinese culture.</p>
              <p>I think that is quite dishonest with Singapore people.</p>
              <p>And he had said that Singapore people won't approve of a non chinese prime minister.</p>
              <p>The problem is that both Lee Kuan Yew and his son are hakka peranakan babas.</p>
              <p>So what right has he to make such statements?</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew and Lee Hsien Loong, both of them are not chinese, they are hakka peranakan baba.</p>

              <h1>Deal Lawyer Chen Makes Initial Offering in Singapore Elections</h1>
              <div id="story_meta"><cite class="byline">By <span class="author">Andrea Tan</span> - <span class="datestamp">May 3, 2011</span> </cite></div>
              <div id="story_content" class="clearfix">
              <p>Chen Show-Mao, after years of advising on deals like <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=1288:HK"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (1288)</span></a>’s $22.1 billion initial share sale, has a new type of offering in the works: His opposition-party candidacy to join Singapore’s parliament.</p>
              <p>“We want to help you to ask the serious questions that will make our democratic system of government work better,” the head of Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell LLP’s Beijing office told more than 20,000 people in a suburban Singapore sports stadium in his first campaign speech last week before the May 7 elections.</p>
              <p>A victory by Chen, who is contesting as part of a <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://wp.sg/wpge/"><span style="color: #666666;">Workers’ Party</span></a> team in a district that elects five representatives as a group, would more than double the number of opposition seats in parliament. It would also oust <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/singapore/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Singapore</span></a>’s Foreign Minister George Yeo, who is leading the <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.pap.org.sg/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">People’s Action Party</span></a> candidates in the constituency.</p>
              <p>PAP co-founder Lee Kuan Yew has dubbed the 50-year-old lawyer a “celebrity” who hasn't lived in the country for decades and said voters will “repent” if they don’t elect the ruling party. The PAP’s 52-year stretch in government has made the country <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/asia/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Asia</span></a>’s <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2004.html?countryName=Singapore&amp;countryCode=sn&amp;regionCode=eas&amp;#sn."><span style="color: #0033cc;">richest</span></a> per capita.</p>
              <p>Opposition parties, which previously haven’t run enough candidates to prevent the PAP from returning to power on nomination day, are challenging 82 of 87 seats this year.</p>
              <p>While analysts including Lim Jit Soon, Nomura Securities’ Singapore research head, said they expect another clear victory for the PAP, which won 67 percent of the vote in the 2006 poll and all but 2 of the seats in parliament, they said a reduced popular vote could see some policy changes.</p>
              <h2>Reviewed Policies</h2>
              <p>“If the PAP achieves a significantly reduced popular vote it may look to review some of its policies like immigration,” Lim said in a strategy note titled ‘Times they are a-changin.’</p>
              <p>Foreigners make up 36 percent of <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.singstat.gov.sg/stats/keyind.html"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Singapore’s 5.1 million population</span></a>, up from 14 percent in 1990, boosting the economy and creating jobs for Singaporeans, the government says.</p>
              <p>Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last month that investments such as a new $3 billion memory chip plant built by <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/intel-corp/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Intel Corp</span></a>. and Micron Technology Inc. wouldn’t have been possible without foreign workers. Opposition parties have questioned if growth is being pursued at too high a cost by letting too many foreigners in.</p>
              <p>“How many hundreds of thousands of foreign workers to bring in every year is enough?” Chen asked in his April 28 rally speech to roars of approval. He declined to be interviewed for this story.</p>
              <h2>‘Success Story’</h2>
              <p>Chen himself is a “success story” of Singapore’s immigration policy, Law Minister K. Shanmugam said April 29. Chen <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19860730.2.55&amp;sessionid=d97578daf5e546fc92435afb6031722a&amp;keyword=chen+show+mao+national+junior+college+singapore&amp;lang=en&amp;token=singapore,national,show,college,junior,chen,mao"><span style="color: #0033cc;">came to Singapore from Taiwan</span></a> with his parents and younger sister when he was 11 in 1972. He has spent the last 30 years overseas.</p>
              <p>He graduated with an economics degree from Harvard, won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford and got his law doctorate from <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/stanford-university/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Stanford University</span></a> before joining <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.davispolk.com/lawyers/show-mao-chen/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Davis Polk</span></a> in <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/new-york/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">New York</span></a> in 1992.</p>
              <p>PAP leaders such as organizing secretary Ng Eng Hen have asked if Chen can identify with the aspirations of Singaporeans after spending most of his life overseas.</p>
              <p>“I’ve spent all this time abroad, but that doesn’t mean I stop being Singaporean,” he said when announcing his candidacy last week.</p>
              <p>Chen, who took Singapore nationality in 1986 after serving in the country’s army, said living elsewhere “enhanced rather than diluted” his sense of being Singaporean.</p>
              <h2>Dealmaker</h2>
              <p>Chen’s work at Davis Polk included advising <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=883:HK"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Cnooc Ltd. (883)</span></a> on its $18.5 billion bid for Unocal Corp. and the global IPOs of companies including <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=601398:CH"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Industrial &amp; Commercial Bank of China (601398)</span></a> Ltd., <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=601111:CH"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Air China Ltd. (601111)</span></a>, <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=600028:CH"><span style="color: #0033cc;">China Petroleum &amp; Chemical Corp. (600028)</span></a> and <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=762:HK"><span style="color: #0033cc;">China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (762)</span></a></p>
              <p>The American Lawyer magazine, a trade publication, named him one of its <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.law.com/jsp/tal/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202489614581"><span style="color: #0033cc;">dealmakers of 2010</span></a> for managing the Agricultural Bank IPO, which was underwritten by investment banks that included <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GS:US"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)</span></a> and <a class="web_ticker" title="Get Quote" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MS:US"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Morgan Stanley. (MS)</span></a></p>
              <p>“In the second half of my life, I would like to give something back to my country,” Chen said at his nomination announcement, adding that he planned to relocate his wife and three children to Singapore from Beijing regardless of whether he gets elected.</p>
              <p>Chen will be retiring from Davis Polk, Hong Kong-based partner William Barron said. “We appreciate all of his efforts at the firm and wish him all the best of luck.”</p>
              <h2>Public Service Culture</h2>
              <p>Davis Polk is a firm where public service has been part of the culture, said Anthony Root, who first met Chen when they opened the firm’s <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/hong-kong/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Hong Kong</span></a> office in 1993.</p>
              <p>“It’s a good thing for Singapore to have someone with his international experience, integrity and quiet wisdom offering to serve,” said Root, who now heads Asia for Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy LLP.</p>
              <p>Chen is putting a lot on the line, said Wilson Ang, a Singapore-based corporate lawyer who got to know him when both worked for different international firms in Hong Kong. “Politics is a rough and tumble game.”</p>
              <p>Two lawyers with Singapore law firms who previously ran as Workers’ Party candidates have been sued for defamation by PAP leaders. A third was fined for <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/tax-evasion/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">tax evasion</span></a> after the election.</p>
              <p>Tang Liang Hong, who contested the 1997 elections, was ordered to pay a record S$8 million ($6.5 million) for defaming 11 PAP members including then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/lee-kuan-yew/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Lee Kuan Yew</span></a>, the father of the current premier who led the PAP to eight <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.elections.gov.sg/elections_past_parliamentary.html"><span style="color: #0033cc;">election victories</span></a> before stepping down in 1990. The amount was later reduced to S$3.6 million.</p>
              <h2>Transparent Laws</h2>
              <p>Tang’s wife, who was named as a defendant in the lawsuits, was bankrupted and is still paying the debt, Tang said from <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/melbourne/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Melbourne</span></a>, where he now lives.</p>
              <p>The PAP says Singapore’s rules and laws are transparent and rejects suggestions that it uses defamation suits to dissuade political opposition.</p>
              <p>“It is a pattern because there is a pattern amongst the opposition leaders to accuse us of wrongdoing,” Goh said in a September 2003 <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/hardtalk/3138962.stm"><span style="color: #0033cc;">interview with the BBC</span></a>. “It’s a pattern for us to restore the harm that they have done to our reputation.”</p>
              <p>At his nomination announcement, Chen said he was aware of the need to be as careful as possible in formulating his public comments.</p>
              <p>Lee Kuan Yew, the oldest member of <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.cabinet.gov.sg/content/cabinet/index.html"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Singapore’s cabinet</span></a> at 87, has said the ruling party would accept the loss of the Aljunied district Chen is contesting. At the same time, he added that its voters have to accept the consequences of choosing a team including a “celebrity who has been away 30 years.”</p>
              <h2>‘Live and Repent’</h2>
              <p>“If Aljunied decides to go that way, well Aljunied has five years to live and repent,” he said, adding that property values in the district may fall with the PAP government prioritizing districts it wins for improvements.</p>
              <p>Singapore is tolerant and open enough for a voice like Chen’s, said Eduardo Ramos-Gomez, managing partner of Duane Morris LLP’s Asian offices.</p>
              <p>“He’s committed to the cause and believes that he can present a different dialogue and view to Singapore,” said Ramos-Gomez, who has served with Chen on <a title="Open Web Site" rel="external" href="http://www.law.smu.edu.sg/about_school/advisory_board.asp"><span style="color: #0033cc;">the advisory board</span></a> of the Singapore Management University School of Law since 2007 and was <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mexico/"><span style="color: #0033cc;">Mexico</span></a>’s ambassador to the city state.</p>
