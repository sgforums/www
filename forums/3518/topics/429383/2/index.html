              <p>i concur, there's always two side to a coin but it still doesn't

              <p>well, let's take a look at what LKY has actually said in the text eh ? ..... to be fair, I think his words have been taken out of context.</p>
              <p>In anycase, there is an important distinction, there is nothing wrong with a foreign chicken, or chen show mao for that matter, to want to come in here and sink roots, even though, as you've put it, the system is flawed.</p>
              <p> If he were an ordinary chap, much less a PAP candidate, who got his citizenship and disappeared for 30 years, would you not be resentful that he's ironically, still able to get his growth dividends as well ? I'd much rather this money be given to other needier  citizens here, in the country, whether foreign or native born, than to someone like him.</p>
              <p>As I have said once again, my ah tiong friend disappeared right after serving NS too ... And if chen show mao's actually maintained an address here, like he's shown on CNA, then wouldn't he have been a party to driving up property prices in singapore as well ? ... how often have we railed again people who bought and invested in places here while disappearing overseas, driving up property prices ? I shall note also, though with a caveat that the source was from other forums, that Chen Show Mao's children, are not registered as Singapore Citizens. So he actually say, that his roots was here, again ? .........</p>
              <p>Would you actually want someone like him, to waltz in after 30 years, with the foreign accent still thick, with his family still holding foreign passports to come in and be your political representative in parliament ?</p>

In the meantime, Germany indicated her willingness to stop her activities against the Soviet Union and abandon the so-called Agreement Against the Communist International and recognized the inviolability of the Soviet frontiers; hence the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">The policy of "non-intervention" pursued by international and primarily Anglo-French reaction is a policy of "sitting on top of the mountain to watch the tigers fight", a downright imperialist policy of profiting at others' expense. </span></span></strong></p>

              <p>well, let's take a look at what LKY has actually said in the text eh ? ..... to be fair, I think his words have been taken out of context.</p>
              <p>In anycase, there is an important distinction, there is nothing wrong with a foreign chicken, or chen show mao for that matter, to want to come in here and sink roots, even though, as you've put it, the system is flawed.</p>
              <p> If he were an ordinary chap, much less a PAP candidate, who got his citizenship and disappeared for 30 years, would you not be resentful that he's ironically, still able to get his growth dividends as well ? I'd much rather this money be given to other needier  citizens here, in the country, whether foreign or native born, than to someone like him.</p>
              <p>As I have said once again, my ah tiong friend disappeared right after serving NS too ... And if chen show mao's actually maintained an address here, like he's shown on CNA, then wouldn't he have been a party to driving up property prices in singapore as well ? ... how often have we railed again people who bought and invested in places here while disappearing overseas, driving up property prices ? I shall note also, though with a caveat that the source was from other forums, that Chen Show Mao's children, are not registered as Singapore Citizens. So he actually say, that his roots was here, again ? .........</p>
              <p>Would you actually want someone like him, to waltz in after 30 years, with the foreign accent still thick, with his family still holding foreign passports to come in and be your political representative in parliament ?</p>

              <p>There are many singaporeans who have left the shores to seek greener pastures in terms of career prospects and also to gain an international perspective but have always kept in touch with Singaporean affairs. I believe Chen is one of them. He has my support.</p>

              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">Firm's Role: Issuer's Counsel</span></strong></span></div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">For a business with 
              something of a dowdy reputation, Agricultural Bank of China 
              Limited--that nation's third-largest lender--had some big ambitions when
               it decided to go public last year. It wanted to raise a lot of money, 
              perhaps a record amount, despite the global economic crisis. It wanted 
              to move quickly. And--perhaps trickiest of all--it wanted a dual 
              listing, on both the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which trades only in 
              China, and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which trades internationally.</span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">To pull it off, the 
              bank, known colloquially as AgBank, turned to a lawyer with plenty of 
              experience with dual listings--Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell's Show-Mao 
              Chen. Four years earlier, Chen, who is based in Beijing, led a Davis 
              Polk team that advised China's biggest bank, Industrial and Commercial 
              Bank of China Limited (ICBC), in its initial public offering. That IPO 
              raised $19 billion, making it the world's largest at the time; it was 
              also the first entity to list shares in Shanghai and Hong Kong.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Dual listings are 
              difficult because each exchange has different sets of regulatory 
              requirements related to disclosure, timing, and underwriting practices. 
              These issues can become especially complicated in a large offering.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">So Chen and his team
               began working under what he calls some of "the most challenging 
              circumstances I have seen" so AgBank's IPO could launch in both markets.
               By April 2010, the bank had lined up ten lead underwriters, a record 
              number--four for Shanghai and six for Hong Kong. It would fall to the 
              Davis Polk lawyers to manage the various opinions of the underwriters 
              and smoothly incorporate them into the prospectus.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Time constraints 
              increased the pressure. There was talk about other Chinese banks that 
              wanted to go public in 2010, and AgBank wanted to ensure that it would 
              be the first in line. The bank wanted to get the IPO to market by July, 
              giving Chen just a three-month window. "Three months is just about the 
              shortest time to market I've seen for an IPO of this kind," he says. 
              "And it certainly felt like it was done in record time."</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Chen had teams of 
              lawyers camped out in Davis Polk's Beijing office to keep up with the 
              demanding pace. Meetings were conducted in both En­glish and Chinese, 
              and all of the documents were drafted in both languages, often doubling 
              the lawyers' work.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Antony Dapiran, a 
              former Freshfields Bruck­haus Deringer partner who worked as AgBank's 
              Hong Kong counsel on the IPO, credits Chen with shepherding a "very 
              complex IPO, done on a very compressed timetable, while managing the 
              many parties involved." (Dapiran left Freshfields after the IPO and is

              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Finally, there was 
              the hipness factor: AgBank didn't have much. Because it specializes in 
              agricultural loans, which usually have lower profit margins than other 
              sorts of loans, AgBank had long been called the ugly sister of Chinese 
              state banks, Chen says. That meant that the key to pulling off the IPO 
              was emphasizing the bank's potential for growth. (Chen calls it the 
              "glass half-full" view of the bank.) While its loan margins were small, 
              for example, AgBank had the largest network of banks in China, most of 
              them outside the country's largest cities. So in the prospectus, Chen 
              highlighted the "substantial potential for economic growth" in these 
              rural areas. "We were able to sharpen the focus of the bank's disclosure
               for investors," he says. "That was crucial."</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Their work paid off.
               When the IPO went to market, it raised $22 billion, a record amount 
              that surpassed the sum raised by ICBC four years earlier. Because the 
              IPO had been priced in China, not overseas, as is more customary, "in a 
              way, this IPO was like a coming-out party for China," Chen says. "It 
              feels like China has really arrived on the international market."</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">AgBank's record 
              stood for only a few months, until November, when the American IPO that 
              relaunched General Motors Company raised $23 billion. But on July 6, at 
              least, the ugly sister was finally the star of the show.</span></span></div>

              need a textbook when he teaches his class on global securities offerings
               at Georgetown University Law Center; he can mine his own deals for case
               studies and tests. The Debevoise &amp; Plimpton partner describes the 
              biggest transaction he worked on last year, the initial public offering 
              of American International Assurance, as "the perfect final exam, 
              [because] every issue the class covers came up." To wit: The parent 
              company, which had a central role in the banking crash of September 
              2008, had just been bailed out by the federal government. The subsidiary
               that was going public was based in Hong Kong and had highly regulated 
              operations in more than a dozen countries. And it all happened in the 
              midst of the economic turmoil that characterized much of last year.</span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">AIA's IPO, which hit
               the market in October, raised $21.5 billion, a record amount for the 
              Hong Kong Stock Exchange. It was one of several asset sales that 
              American International Group, Inc., held to repay its $182 billion 
              government bailout. "These were an amazing series of deals to do, 
              especially because they occurred during a time of great economic turmoil
               and political sensitivity," Vasily says. </span></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.law.com/jsp/tal/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202487438019"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">READ MORE</span></strong></span></a></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Hogan Lovells 
              corporate partner William Curtin III knows exactly how tough it can be 
              to do business in China. As the lead lawyer on Ford Motor Company's sale
               of Volvo Car Corporation to Zhejiang Geely Holding (Group) Co., Ltd., a
               private Chinese company, last year, the New York–based Curtin oversaw 
              the first-ever takeover of a global automotive manufacturer by a Chinese
               company. </span></span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: x-small;">Ford began 
              discussing the idea of selling Volvo with Curtin in 2007 as part of its 
              "One Ford Global Strategy," in which the automaker endeavored to close 
              or sell nearly all of its branded subsidiaries. In addition to putting 
              Volvo on the block, this meant selling Aston Martin to a consortium of 
              investors for $848 million in 2007 (Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; 
              Flom advised Ford on that transaction), and selling Land Rover and 
              Jaguar, which were bundled in a single $2.3 billion sale to the Indian 
              company Tata Motors Limited in 2008. (Curtin advised Ford on the 
              Jaguar–Land Rover sale at his previous post as head of Hogan &amp; 
              Hartson's European corporate practice in London.) </span></span><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.law.com/jsp/tal/PubArticleTAL.jsp?id=1202487435028"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong><span style="font-size: x-small;">READ MORE</span></strong></span></a></div>
