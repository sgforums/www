              <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.05em;">PAP ANNOUNCES 5-YEAR OLD ELECTION CANDIDATE AT PRESS CONFERENCE</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"><a style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;" href="http://meenacurren.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/jlkt-papsmall.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-35" style="border-style: none; padding: 0px; display: block; max-width: 100%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="JLKT PAPsmall" src="http://meenacurren.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/jlkt-papsmall.jpg?w=450&amp;h=255" alt="" width="450" height="255"></a></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">In a bewildering development, the PAP 
              included in its final introduction of new PAP candidates, a 5-year old 
              toddler from PCF Moulmein Childcare Centre who also resides nearby in a 
              4-four room HDB flat with his parents and two older siblings. MP Dr. 
              Yaacob Ibrahim carried little Jimmy Loh Kat Teck, proudly placed him on 
              his knee and announced Jimmy would be part of his team fielded in 
              Moulmein-Kallang GRC.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">Jimmy had just been plucked from his 
              afternoon nap and was visibly cranky. Drool and food stains were wiped 
              off his chin while an aide quickly changed his blue PCF T-shirt for the 
              PAP whites. Jimmy soon warmed up as fellow GRC member Denise Phua 
              tickled him under his chin, handed him a Lollipop and announced, “He’ll 
              win us many votes this little Cutie”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"> Analysts see the move in fielding ever 
              younger candidates as a master stroke in party renewal. “Right now, 
              27-year old Tan Pei Ling looks positively ancient and past her political
               prime compared to little Jimmy”, commented one observer. Others pointed
               out this strategy also solves the problem of attracting talent from the
               private sector. In a reverse strategy, Jimmy can serves his 2 terms and
               just be old enough to retire from politics, serve NS, find a 
              girlfriend, finish University and enter the private sector as he 
              pleases.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"> In answering questions about Jimmy’s 
              selection, Dr. Yaacob revealed he was shortlisted after a nationwide 
              seach across all PCF Kindergartens. “Jimmy has an IQ of 165, displays 
              tough love on fellow toddlers in his childcare centre and is toilet 
              trained”, claimed Dr. Yaacob. When asked to elaborate on these criteria,
               Dr. Yaakob offered this, “A high IQ is a must and is valued over EQ 
              which we don’t really understand ourselves anyway. When fellow toddlers 
              fall down and begin crying, Jimmy won’t ‘sayang’ them but will lecture 
              them on being more careful. Jimmy hasn’t worn a diaper in 6 months and 
              this is important because Meet-the-People sessions can go on for hours 
              and it would be quite unpleasant for everyone if a ripe diaper stinks up
               the room while people come crying about their hardships”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">To show their confidence in this infant 
              Candidate, Jimmy was allowed to answer questions from the Press and this
               much was gleaned, Jimmy’s favourite colour is Blue, he likes 
              Transformers but the movie scared him. He prefers Dumex to Horlicks and 
              he hates Speech &amp; Drama classes he’s forced to attend on Sunday 
              mornings.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">The Press Conference was hastily concluded when Jimmy burst into tears for no apparent reason.</p>

              <p style="text-align: left; font-size: 1.05em;">PAP ANNOUNCES
              5-YEAR OLD ELECTION CANDIDATE AT PRESS CONFERENCE</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"><a style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;" rel="nofollow" href="http://meenacurren.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/jlkt-papsmall.jpg"><img style="border-style: none; padding: 0px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="JLKT PAPsmall" src="http://meenacurren.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/jlkt-papsmall.jpg?w=450&amp;amp;h=255" alt="" width="450" height="255"></a></p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">In a bewildering development, the PAP
              included in its final introduction of new PAP candidates, a 5-year
              old toddler from PCF Moulmein Childcare Centre who also resides
              nearby in a 4-four room HDB flat with his parents and two older
              siblings. MP Dr. Yaacob Ibrahim carried little Jimmy Loh Kat Teck,
              proudly placed him on his knee and announced Jimmy would be part of
              his team fielded in Moulmein-Kallang GRC.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">Jimmy had just been plucked from his
              afternoon nap and was visibly cranky. Drool and food stains were
              wiped off his chin while an aide quickly changed his blue PCF
              T-shirt for the PAP whites. Jimmy soon warmed up as fellow GRC
              member Denise Phua tickled him under his chin, handed him a
              Lollipop and announced, “He’ll win us many votes this little
              Cutie”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"> Analysts see the move in
              fielding ever younger candidates as a master stroke in party
              renewal. “Right now, 27-year old Tan Pei Ling looks positively
              ancient and past her political prime compared to little Jimmy”,
              commented one observer. Others pointed out this strategy also
              solves the problem of attracting talent from the private sector. In
              a reverse strategy, Jimmy can serves his 2 terms and just be old
              enough to retire from politics, serve NS, find a girlfriend, finish
              University and enter the private sector as he pleases.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;"> In answering questions about
              Jimmy’s selection, Dr. Yaacob revealed he was shortlisted after a
              nationwide seach across all PCF Kindergartens. “Jimmy has an IQ of
              165, displays tough love on fellow toddlers in his childcare centre
              and is toilet trained”, claimed Dr. Yaacob. When asked to elaborate
              on these criteria, Dr. Yaakob offered this, “A high IQ is a must
              and is valued over EQ which we don’t really understand ourselves
              anyway. When fellow toddlers fall down and begin crying, Jimmy
              won’t ‘sayang’ them but will lecture them on being more careful.
              Jimmy hasn’t worn a diaper in 6 months and this is important
              because Meet-the-People sessions can go on for hours and it would
              be quite unpleasant for everyone if a ripe diaper stinks up the
              room while people come crying about their hardships”.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">To show their confidence in this
              infant Candidate, Jimmy was allowed to answer questions from the
              Press and this much was gleaned, Jimmy’s favourite colour is Blue,
              he likes Transformers but the movie scared him. He prefers Dumex to
              Horlicks and he hates Speech &amp; Drama classes he’s forced to
              attend on Sunday mornings.</p>
              <p style="font-size: 1.05em;">The Press Conference was hastily
              concluded when Jimmy burst into tears for no apparent reason.</p>

              <p>Got the latest info right now,my friends.....And I'm getting much prouder than ever....<br>Yup,SDP had already set sights on BOTH Sembawang and Holland-Bukit Timah GRC as both had been significantly strategic within the Northwest,within Bukit Panjang,SDP's main battleground.....Whilst what I've never been expected,Reform Party takes on AMK shortly after bringing in Alex Tan of SPP to contest there...And another thing,Tanjong Pagar which has been situated with Orchard Rd and Buona Vista's Holland V.,has been expected to see a first fight with Ng Teck Siong of the Socialist Front along with SDA members as there may possiblity that SDA may fight in....<br>Thanks a lot for praising me and my efforts,I've been following the whole stuff....</p>
