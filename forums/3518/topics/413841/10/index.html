              <p><strong>PAP-90 SEATS AT STAKE......NO MORE WALKOVERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br></strong></p>
              <p><br><strong>Possible opposition targets as suggested...<br></strong>Instead on focusing on single SMCs and GRCs, the opps could instead focus on an area to target to get more support from the people.<br><br>Workers Party did well this election... in most constituencies contested they managed to get 40+% of the vote. Most of the constituencies contested were in the east. I think Workers Party could continue working with the people in the east to gain their support. Aljunied GRC and Hougang SMC are great places to start.<br><br>National Solidarity Party could focus on the west. Even though they did quite well in Tampines and Marine Parade GRC, I feel it is better to leave Workers Party to the east. The west are often uncontested. If National Solidarity Party can work the ground there, it might turn the tide in their favour.<br><br>Singapore Democratic Party could work on the Central-Northern areas. This election, the image of SDP have improved. I believe if they work on their image and work the ground more, they can gain more trust from the voters there.<br><br>Singapore Peoples' Party, Singapore Democratic Alliance, Reform Party and Socialist Front should form a coalition. Singapore Peoples' Party was once under the Singapore Democratic Alliance banner. Also, when Chiam See Tong was chairman of Singapore Democratic Alliance, he attempted to bring Reform Party in. Socialist Front chairman Ng Teck Siong initially attempted to contest Tanjong Pagar GRC with candidates from Singapore Democratic Alliance. I believe when these 4 parties form an alliance together, they can share their stronger candidates with each other. This will allow them to have a greater chance to win SMCs and even GRCs. Singapore Peoples' Party did quite well in Bishan-Toa Payoh, realistically speaking. I believe they could contest in the Central-Southern areas.</p>

We need to work and work hard," he said in his presentation. "We need to invest our time on the ground. We need to expend our energy. That's the only way that we are going to get things done and earn our support."<br><br>He also laid out plans for the SDP to step up its ground work in the constituencies that the Party had contested in with one addition: Tanjong Pagar GRC. <br><br>"Let us get to the ground and let us convince the people of Sembawang, Holland-Bukit Timah, Bukit Panjang, Yuhua and, if I may add, Tanjong Pagar that we are worthy of their support, worthy to be their political leaders, and worthy to be their public servants."<br><br>This would close a geographical corridor that the Democrats will be working on: from Sembawang GRC in the north, to Holland and Bukit Timah in the middle, to Tanjong Pagar in the southern part of the island. <br><br>Well isn't that fair???SDP will be contesting plans to attack Bukit Panjang and Yuhua(Jurong East),Sembawang,Holland-Bukit Timah and also to set up a new target on Tanjong Pagar GRC....!!!Perfect set-up for Dr Chee,the boss.....Besides,Buona Vista and Holland V. is much closer to Holland-Bukit Timah and that Buona Vista,Tanglin and Cairnhill has been contested by the SDP in 1988 and 1991 elections.....Isnt that fair???Then SDP may have absolute access to Orchard Rd,Chinatown,Holland V.,Queenstown,Tiong Bahru,Tanjong Pagar,etc.......KUDOS!!!!<br><br>Very fair,that SDP's now maturing,then why didnt the SDP field up a suicide squad for Tanjong Pagar GRC for this elections???At least,SDP may have absolute access from Sembawang,to Holland-Bukit Timah and also to Tanjong Pagar now!!!Then why SDP targets Bishan,now that Chiam's now in favour of it???Just leave the Bishan to the SPP as it's much closer to Potong Pasir,then if Hong Kah North is much strategic to Chua Chu Kang why the SPP doesnt want to target CCK as well???Then,if Serangoon merged up for a new GRC,I'm suggesting SPP may fight in with Sin Kek Tong as leader and he may be happy in Braddell Heights as well....Then SPP may consider allow Alex Tan to lead a young team for AMK,as further expansion sooner...<br><br>As for Jurong GRC just leave it to the NSP as well as West Coast GRC,but I'm afraid Reform may barge in for a 3-cornered fight....CCK too....As well as Hong Kah North and Pioneer for the NSP,strategics for Marine Parade,Moulmein-Kallang and Tampines....</p></div>

              <p>Possible that Chee Soon Juan is going to take on Tanjong Pagar GRC in 2016.</p>
              <p>No one dares to take on Tanjong Pagar GRC, scared sued by Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>But Chee sued and jailed for so many times already, he also can't be bothered with such crap.</p>
              <p>He is going to walk the ground in Tanjong Pajar GRC and take on Lee Kuan Yew.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well,I don't think LKY may remain...He'll have to retire in 5 years time...<br>Possible scenario is that Dr Chee himself may lead the Tanjong Pagar GRC team,leaving his old Toa Payoh conquest to Benjamin Pwee himself for the SPP...Others are expected to be Gandhi Ambalam,Dr James Gomez,Francis Yong and newbie Jaslyn Go,who will be facing up with Dr Lily Neo or some newbie in Chinatown...Should Dr Chee and his dream suicide team contested the GRC,PAP may be likely to score up even better results,but percentage drop,even though this may be its first contest after both Bishan and also Holland-Bukit Timah itself...<br><br>Possible scenario for the SPP's future...<br><strong>Scenario 1</strong>-It is likely that the SPP may form up two teams to contest both Bishan-Toa Payoh and also CCK as SPP has also targeted Hong Kah North and also to retrive Potong Pasir as well....if boundaries remain unchanged...<br><br><strong>Scenario 2-</strong>Potong Pasir may be splitted up into two GRCs....And it is most apparently that a new 4-member GRC may be formed up,with the main Potong Pasir area in,as well as Serangoon Gardens,Braddell Heights and also Jalan Kayu....While Sitoh Yih Pin himself may be joining in Toa Payoh East,now that Lor 8 Toa Payoh Estate might be absorbed into the area....<br>Meanwhile,Lina Chiam would eventually lead the team,along with Sin Kek Tong and two newbies including Juliana Juwahir,as Serangoon GRC might be requiring a Malay candidate...Suggesting that PAP should be all-woman team to fight in....including Josephine Teo who would switch on,a woman minister who may lead,a newbie for Braddell Heights and also Dr Intan Azura Mokhtar for Jalan Kayu....<br>Whilst Jimmy Lee,AMK resident and also Youth Wing chief may have then along with Alex Tan may run in AMK SPP team,leading in-charge as well,even S Kunalen,as AMK GRC requires at least an Indian candidate ...Should this happens,SPP may have then contest in almost a full fledged Central area,covering AMK by the north and also Bishan,Toa Payoh,Potong Pasir and even Serangoon areas,giving the fact that Sin Kek Tong was in favour of Braddell Heights...That's 3 GRCs in a row...Meanwhile,Thomson may have then emerged out of Bishan GRC as an SMC with Hri Kumar Nair standing alone against an SPP newbie...Namely Camillia Chiam,CST's daughter...I believe SPP may have then contest in AMK,Bishan-TP and Serangoon GRCs and also Thomson SMC itself...<br>However WP might have then eyed Serangoon GRC,while SDP may have barge in Thomson as well...Should this happen,there could be some horse trading needed to avoid dilution of votes,especially the Tanjong Pagar GRC,in the case of both SDP and Reform Party,which may be contesting in.....And besides several opps began to eye AMK besides the SPP,except WP which indicates they would never come back again...Namely Reform Party,Socialist Front,NSP,SDA and possibly SDP....<br>Meanwhile,if Sin himself is much happier in Braddell Heights,that means he won't have to go as far as Hong Kah North to contest there...Just leave it to the NSP or even Reform Party too....<br><br>So here are the possible effects....<br>SDP-Holland-Bukit Timah,Sembawang,Tanjong Pagar and possibly Jurong GRCs,Bukit Panjang,Yuhua and possibly new SMCs of Bukit Merah,Thomson and Woodlands....<br><br>SPP-AMK,Bishan-Toa Payoh and Serangoon GRCs and Thomson</p></div>

Mr. JB Jeyaratnam has dented PAP's strong hold of power back then. In 1984 General Elections, PAP lost two seats in total: Mr. JBJ retained his Anson seat while Mr. Chiam See Tong won Potong Pasir beating Mah Bow Tan hands down with a respectable 60% of valid votes. <br><br>Ever since then, PAP was worried about losing more seats in the years to come. They squeezed every drops of brain juice they have, from suggesting some people may have two votes instead of one to tweaking the electoral system. Eventually, they came up with this BRILLIANT idea of GRC. Basically, the GRC system literally up the stakes for every electoral contest. <br><br>They have succeeded in preventing losing more seats in 1988 GE with a close shave of winning Eunos GRC with Workers Party's Team losing by merely 1%. Predictably, they are so dependent and addicted to the GRC system that they subsequently increased the size from 3 to 4 and eventually created the giant 6 man GRCs. It basically up the stake further just like a gambler who thinks he will sure win all. <br><br>Of course, PAP has very thick skin to ignore all logical criticism of its "kiasuism" (mentality of being afraid to lose). At one point of time, the Prime Minister even proudly joke openly about Singaporeans being "Kiasu" (afraid to lose), "Kiasi" (afraid to die) "Kiabo" (afraid of wife). However, ironically PAP has become like a gambling addict who keep increasing its stake in electoral contests.<br><br>It is indeed a paradox. While PAP is afraid to lose, it thought that it could prevent losing by increasing the stake for all. The most ironic argument I heard during this GE 2011 is that PAP has actually accuse Workers Party of making things difficult for Aljunied voters by "forcing them to make difficult choice". It could even be interpreted that WP is "holding voters at ransom" by fielding Mr. Low Thia Khiang and Sylvia Lim together in Aljunied GRC. <br><br>It is PAP who is trying to hold Singaporeans at ransom by setting up the GRC system. Not only did it try to use HDB upgrading as the carrot ransom, it also uses subtle threats of depriving voters funding for various services. The ultimate ransom is the argument that the Nation will lose two ministers plus one Speaker of Parliament along with one potential ministerial candidate. <br><br>But wait, isn't this PAP's own doing? It tries to gamble big by putting TWO ministers in Aljunied GRC. In fact, it is gambling away its "ministerial talents" by putting ministers in each and every GRCs! It just thinks that Singaporeans will not "sacrifice" its ministers and thus those who contest along with these ministers will have a safe passage way to parliament. <br><br>PAP's high stake gambling habits has cost it dearly. If you think the cost of this gambling is merely two or three ministers, think again. The implications of this lost in Aljunied GRC is much wider and deeper. <br><br>First of all, which PAP minister would be willing to risk their million dollar pay to contest in Aljunied GRC next round in the bid to win it back? Even George Yeo and Lim Hwee Hwa have bowed out of the game! Would it mean that once a GRC is lost, PAP will never be able to win it back again? <br><br>Secondly, after this defeat, how could PAP convince "high flyers" to quit their jobs like BG or superscale civil service positions to join them and promise them a safe passage way to become ministers? There is no longer SAFE Passage to parliament. BG Tan should understand this very well! <br><br>Thirdly, even the recruitment of backbenchers for PAP will face problem! No more hiding behind heavy weights so to walk into parliament safely!<br><br>Last but not least, there are several GRCs in "danger zones" which opposition parties have achieved more than 40%. These include East Coast GRC, Bishan Toa Payoh GRC, Marine Parade GRC, Tampines GRC, Moulmein Kallang GRC and Nee Soon GRC. There are two GRCs which are near 40%: Holland Bukit Timah GRC and Choa Chu Kang GRC. <br><br>It basically means that PAP will be fire fighting in all these places next round and I do not think it has enough ministers to have two ministers fielded in each of these GRCs. If PAP is not careful enough, it may face the possibility of losing more ministers. <br><br>It will be double whammy for PAP. On one hand, it will not be able to attract and convince talents to join its rank while on the other hand, it will keep losing ministerial talents. <br><br>PAP will do the same thing they did in the mid-1980s: think of some genius way to prevent the tide of losing more. They may try to raise the stake again (well, maybe turn Singapore into only 5 GRCs, North South East West and Central GRCs) or implement the one man two votes system for people who reach certain age. Else the only option is to go for some kind proportional representation. <br><br>Implementing proportional representation system may see PAP's percentage of seats dropping in parliament but it will help to prevent any further loss of ministers. <br><br>It seems that the implementation of proportional representation system would benefit Singapore. It will make sure that our parliament will maintain diversity of views for better debates on policy issues and at the same time, secure enough ministerial candidates to serve the nation. <br><br>The PAP has lost big time for GE 2011 and I hope that it will wake up in time to carry out the necessary electoral reforms to embrace diversity and cater to Singaporeans' urge of having more opposition voices in parliament.<br><br>Goh Meng Seng</div>
