              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Things Dr Balakrishnan himself might want to suppress</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">While he attempts to discredit and smear Dr Wijeysingha by with the accusation of hidden agendas and motives, we would do well to remember that Dr Balakrishnan himself has a track record which he probably would prefer voters to forget. But let’s not. Here are some of the things that Dr Balakrishnan has yet to answer for:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1. “Hawker centre, food court or restaurant”?</span><br>In 2007, when Dr Lily Neo, MP for Jalan Besar GRC, asked for extra financial assistance for the poor and needy, Dr Balakrishnan dismissed her by saying, “How much do you want? Do you want three meals in a hawker centre, food court or restaurant?”</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">This in itself is an elitist, classist, uncaring statement. Coming from the Minister of Community Development, Youth and Sports, whose job it is to take care of the people Dr Neo was speaking up for, it is downright unacceptable.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Again in response to a question from Dr Neo this year, Dr Balakrishnan said that there was <a href="http://www.sgpolitics.net/?p=6286"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">no need for a permanent and constructive safety net for the needy in Singapore</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. The homeless issue<br></span><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align: center; display: block;"> </span></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">“If you were a poor person anywhere on this planet, Singapore is the one place where you will have a roof over your head. Where you will have food on your table. Even if you can’t afford it we will deliver meals on wheels to you.”</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Not long after Dr Balakrishnan made those comments, Al-Jazeera English (AJE) did this story on homelessness in Singapore:</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align: center; display: block;"> </span></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">After this video was released, AJE was suddenly dropped from SingTel Mio’s line-up of channels due to a lack of viewership. Dr Balakrishnan stood up in Parliament and not only accused AJE (and “irresponsible websites”) of not “ascertaining the facts”, he also disclosed the featured homeless couple’s financial details to the public (see <a href="http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1052851/1/.html"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></span></a>). The Online Citizen later showed that he had <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/04/tocs-response-part-two-a-tidy-sum"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">presented the couple’s finances in a misleading way</span></span></a>. All this while the homeless couple was <em>STILL</em> homeless. I wrote about this issue <a title="The productivity of the MCYS." href="http://kirstenhan.me/2010/04/30/the-productivity-of-the-mcys/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3. YOG, three times over budget</span><br>Who can forget the fiasco that was the Youth Olympic Games (YOG)? The budget ballooned to over $400 million, the volunteers got food poisoning, the marketing was terrible, the seats were empty, the certificates were wrongly signed and the F1 racing tickets for the volunteers arrived only after the actual event. Although everyone was immensely proud of the young athletes who had trained hard and performed well, the actual management of event was labelled an “<strong>EPIC FAIL</strong>“.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">To date, there has been no accountability of the over-spending, only flimsy justifications and a “look, the Summer Olympics were even more expensive!”, when the YOG was nowhere near the scale or standard of the Summer Olympics. There has been a commemorative book of the YOG, though, <a href="http://yawningbread.wordpress.com/2011/04/12/why-ask-what-was-spent-when-glory-came-from-12498-sandwiches-served/"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">telling us how many sandwiches were served</span></span></a>. Because, you know, it’s much more important to do a sandwich count than to tell Singaporeans where their taxpayer money went.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“Rattled”?</strong></p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Balakrishnan’s efforts have not been well-received by the online Singaporean community. A new hashtag, #PAPsmear, has popped up on Twitter to refer to his cheap shots against Dr Wijeysingha and the SDP. With any luck, the section of the electorate who do not use social media will also see through these fear-mongering, cowardly tactics.</p>
              <p style="text-align: justify;">Dr Balakrishnan has clearly been spooked, or “rattled” (as Dr Wijeysingha put it), by the team that the SDP is fielding against him. I can understand that. If I were him, I would be looking at my own track record, then the credentials of the SDP team, and getting very, very “rattled” indeed.</p>

              <p>The Editor,                                                                                                26th April 2011</p>

              <p>Straits Times.</p>
              <p>Dear Sir,</p>
              <p> I am disturbed to see that the election campaign is once again heading towards gutter politics and the manipulation of people’s fear.  And bringing up the issue of homosexuality is calculated to do just that. The objective here is obvious to everyone: to tell voters that Vincent Wijeysingha is gay, and thereby win the votes of the population that will vote based on just this single issue, one event, regardless of the party’s manifesto and their declared policies.</p>
              <p>This particular instance (see Straits Times April 26th 2011- “Mystery Video Revealed”) reminds us of the PAP's willingness to use distasteful methods to win elections. We know the history. We know the tactics. We have witnessed its power to destroy alternative voices and views. We all know that the PAP will win, but just winning seems insufficient for the PAP. We know that. </p>
              <p>However Singapore politics has reached a turning point and the electorate has matured. The personal attacks, disguised as questions about "agenda" will be recognized for what it is: to engender fear. </p>
              <p>PAP’s fear is that voters will recognize the sincerity, credibility and the calibre of the opposition candidates and the desire of the electorate to have more real alternate voices in Parliament. Vincent Wijeysingha is a highly intelligent, able, articulate and sincere young man who is passionate about serving Singapore and committed to the well-being of Singaporeans. That is all we need to know about any candidate in addition to their stand on policies and their party’s manifesto.</p>
