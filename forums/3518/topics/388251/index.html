              <p><strong>SM Goh stresses importance of leadership for a country's economic devt</strong><br> <span class="update">By S Ramesh, Channel NewsAsia | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 16 January 2010 2226 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span>SINGAPORE: There is a relationship between a country's leadership
              and how its economy performs, says Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong.
              <br> <br>Addressing graduates of the first batch of youth leaders from a
              leadership programme in his Marine Parade GRC, Mr Goh says it is
              important to have good leaders in four sectors of the country -
              political, public service, business sector and the people sector.
              <br> <br>Twenty-four youths from the Marine Parade GRC on Saturday became
              the pioneer batch to graduate from the NextGen Leadership Programme
              organised by the Marine Parade Leadership Foundation.
              <br> <br>The seven-month programme equips the youths with interpersonal and
              leadership skills for community service. During the programme, the
              youth leaders had the opportunity to travel to Tanjung Pinang to help
              the residents with development programmes. <br> <br> The youth leaders also took part in several Meet-the-People sessions with the Members of Parliament of Marine Parade GRC.
              <br> <br> Ng Pei Ling, a graduate of NextGen Leadership Programme, said: "It
              allows me to see things from the government's perspective and I realise
              that actually there are a lot of things that come into play when
              settling things."
              <br> <br>Prasanth Selvam, another graduate of NextGen Leadership Programme,
              said: "I learnt that Singaporeans can actually be very petty with their
              requests, (like asking for the waiving of traffic summons). The thing
              is that you made the mistake and you have to pay for it. Some of the
              requests are very genuine."
              <br> <br>Mr Goh was impressed with the work of the youth leaders. He said
              their involvement reminded him of an ancient saying on the importance
              of leadership. <br> <br> <strong><span style="color: #3366ff;">Mr Goh said: "(The ancient saying is) 'an army of sheep led by a lion is stronger than an army of lions led by a sheep'. </span></strong> <br> <br> "In other words, leadership is critical in battles; the leadership
              qualities, the courage and the ability and getting the team to follow
              you is crucial."
              <br> <br>And Mr Goh said that for a country to succeed, good leadership is
              critical in four areas - political, public service, business sector and
              the people sector.
              <br> <br>"In a country, of course, leadership is important. In a battle it
              is crucial, in peacetime (it is important) in terms of generating
              economic growth," he said.
              <br> <br>"If you track the performance of a country in the last 30 years,
              you will come to the conclusion that there is a co-relationship between
              the leadership of a country and economic performance of the country,"
              he added.
              <br> <br>"The better the leadership, the better the government, more
              enlightened, more visionary. The more honest the government, the better
              the economic performance."
              <br> <br> However, Mr Goh hopes more can be done in the people sector, especially in grooming leaders in the volunteer sector.

              <p>maybe he should just keep alsation wolf dogs...but then why didnt he keep them???for starters they are obedient but cant drink dogs milk or eat dog meat.so he chose a herd of sheeps instead of obedient alsatian dogs.sheeps can be eaten n enjoyed in some parts of werld:)</p>
              <p>think he needs sheep to eat them...mainly.so when sheep mates n produce children,,,thats good fer lion....more meat to the grinder!!!</p>
              <p>so only person would be the lion.....the dogs consume sheep meat too and dont taste nice.in order to have lion  dead....all sheeps must vanish!</p>

              <p>I remember quite sometimes ago,the newspaper introduce SM Goh's son,whom appearing that his son was about to enter Singapore politics n most likely,join PAP as a minister.</p>
              <p>But eventually,the news go cold n i believe LKY n his son LHL must have oppose the idea n GCT was forced to drop the idea.</p>
              <p>This GCT keep dreaming that LKY n his son would share their power with him,n he keep switching from side to side between opposition n his party,as if dancing tango with LKY.And hope he can get the most benefits from it.</p>
              <p>Well,GCT can dream on,LKY n his son will NEVER share power with him.GCT is merely a "dog",use to guard Lees benefit.He must bear that in mind!!!</p>
              <p>If he want to seek a way out,then he n his colleagues must learn to defy LKY's order n help Singapore progress to a real democratic country.Otherwise,he n his colleagues will only be "slaves" under the Lees,n its just a matter of times they get nailed by the Lees,whereby they no longer useful to them anymore.</p>
