              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Prime 
              Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singaporeans should think carefully and 
              calmly about the long-term future during the upcoming General Election.<br><br>He said this on the sidelines of a community event in Ang Mo Kio on Sunday.<br><br>"Whatever
               emotions that are aroused during that period, calm down, detach 
              yourself, think carefully before you vote - which is why we have a 
              Cooling-off Day before Polling Day. So I think in that same spirit, we 
              really should take things in our stride," he said.<br><br>In response to
               a question from a reporter on whether there has been too much hype over
               the election, Mr Lee noted that newspapers are "getting a bit 
              breathless".<br><br>"And when it comes, it comes. And before it comes, know that it's on the horizon but no need to get breathless," he added.<br><br>-CNA/ac</span></span></p>

              <p>By 
              																				Rachel Scully, Multimedia Journalist</p>
              <p>"IT IS very daunting for them to stand in front of so many journalists 
              and answer questions one after another', said Prime Minister Lee Hsien 
              Loong.</p>
              <p>While speaking to the media on the sidelines of the People's
               Action Party Community Foundation's 25th anniversary celebrations, Mr 
              Lee expressed empathy for the new PAP candidates that were unveiled the 
              past week.</p>
              <p>When questioned on why the PAP announced its candidates for East 
              Coast GRC on Thursday ahead of Nomination Day, Mr Lee said he supported 
              the decision as it allowed residents to get know the new candidates 
              better.</p>
              <p>The news came after Senior Minister S. Jayakumar and Speaker Abdullah Tarmugi made public their intention to retire.</p>
              <p>Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Lim Swee Say - from 
              Holland-Bukit Timah GRC - and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for 
              National Development, Mohamad Maliki Osman - from Sembawang GRC - will 
              move to the constituency.</p>

              <p>Some of them are millionaires but they chose to carry balls instead. What music are these kind of jerks listening to? I say all these jerks must be listening and writing a lot of rubbish, none even have the lyrisim to write something about the situation now.</p>
              <p>Where are people like Curtis Mayfield, Marvin Gaye and John Lennon, but then again these people might also be scared shitless when PAP unleash their ISD dogs on them.</p>
