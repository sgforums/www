              <p>I RESPECTFULLY disagree with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong ("2-party system not workable here: PM"; Wednesday).</p>
              <p>First, a few top candidates introduced by the People's 
              Action Party (PAP) joined the party recently after leaving the civil 
              service and military. I believe they are standing for election because 
              they were invited by the ruling party to do so - the key word being 
              "ruling". If Singapore were to have a two-party system and if, say, the 
              Workers' Party were in power and invited top civil servants to join it, I
               believe many would, too.</p>
              <p>The new entrants have probably thrown their hat into the 
              ring because of their desire to make or influence national policy at the
               highest levels. They would get to do so only by joining the ruling 
              party, regardless of which one. The PAP does not have a monopoly on 
              talent.</p>
              <p>Second, I believe that with a strong opposition, more people
               with good credentials will come forward to participate in national 
              politics than is the case now. Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said 
              recently that some potential top candidates declined to stand despite 
              being invited by the PAP. These people must have diverse reasons for not
               joining the PAP, but one reason could be that they disagreed with 
              certain PAP policies.</p>
              <p>With a two-party system, well-qualified candidates would 
              have a choice of parties to join, and that would raise the level of 
              national debate and encourage the competition of ideas.</p>
              <p>Third, there is no reason why Singapore being small should 
              preclude a two-party system. New Zealand has four million plus people 
              and Denmark has five million plus people. Both countries have robust 
              multi-party democracies and are doing well economically. Why should 
              Singapore be any different?</p>
