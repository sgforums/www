              <p>hi. would you all like to share your views on why the opposition failed to take down aljunied grc in 2006? sorry if u all feel that this event has happened 4 yrs ago and i am discussing it only now.. i am doing so because i wanna find out wat were the main reasons and possibe events/ circumstances then u all felt that has led to this result. as most of us should know, elections is around the corner (i personally believe it should be towards end of yr after events like YOG and national day). Just wanna know that whether any factors/circumstances would have changed in these 4 yrs that would make the race an even more competitive and exciting one?</p>
              <p>anyway, just to add on, do u all think aljunied GRC will still be the hot spot in the coming GE? since it next to hougang, i feel that WP may believes tat they'll have a good chance to capture it given it's proximity to their turf. Or will it be bishan/toa pa yoh GRC due to mas selamat and immigrants issue (not to forget chiam's wish to contest a GRC and the proximity of potong pasir to the GRC). or will it be the tampinese grc (due to housing costs)?</p>

              <p>Well, I think the WP's credibility has greatly suffered when the James Gomez issue on accusing Election Dept. for not recognizing him as a minority race (They need to fill in such forms, F***, why the NRIC not enough to proof a candidate is a minority!?) and claim they have purposely lost it. (When he himself did not submit the form, proved by the CCTV). Anyway, he is gone for good. Better stay clear of parties before pull down the votes.</p>

              <p>No...... AFAIK, a PAP spokesman said that in places like Hougang &amp; Paya Lebar, it was like a 1 to 1 vote, making them very nevrous. BUT, on Bedok Reservoir and Eunos, the Malay majority areas, the PAP is able to secured &gt;60% of the votes......</p>

              <p>BTW, who is controversal in Eunos when some Cheng San candidate (Cant remember who, maybe one fled to Australia) kena sued by PAP candidate for defamation?</p>
