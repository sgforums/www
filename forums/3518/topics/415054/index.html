              <p><strong>By Seah Chiang Nee</strong></p>
              <p>With election buzz rising, Singapore’s talking point these days 
                  centres around two questions: What will the future be like without 
                  Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew?</p>
              <p>Will the young generation, whose voting strength is increasing, 
                  continue to support the People’s Action Party (PAP) under its present 
                  strategies without the founding leader?</p>
              <p><strong>An indication may come in the next few months from a benchmark 
                  general election possibly without the participation of the 87-year-old 
                  Lee for the first time in 51 years.</strong></p>
              <p>Still in grief over the recent passing of his wife, Lee is also weakened by a chest infection after a fall in Moscow.</p>
              <p>He is likely to recover but will be, in his own words, “a different man” without her.</p>
              <p>Under the circumstances, Lee may decide to call it quits when the PAP announces its candidates.</p>
              <p>“No one can tell for sure,” said a party insider. “But he has already
                   done so much for the country. He has often said he’ll step down if 
                  health forbids him from contributing. Regretfully, I think the time has 
                  come.”</p>
              <p>If it happens, history will start a new chapter after 51 years of 
                  Lee’s powerful presence that helped to shape today’s Singapore.</p>
              <p>It will also, for better or worse, lead to major changes after a period of continuity.</p>
              <p>The result of the coming polls – as is Singapore’s future – will 
                  largely be decided by the younger generation of both leaders and the 
                  electorate.</p>
              <p>Sensing a turning point, but not sure exactly how the longer term 
                  future will turn out, Singaporeans are awaiting the polls with some 
                  anxiety.</p>
              <p>No date has been announced, but it is widely expected to take place within the next six months.</p>
              <p>Foreign Minister George Yeo has already told party activists to 
                  prepare for one at the year-end or early 2011. In 2006, the PAP won 82 
                  seats on 66.6% popular votes while the opposition got only two seats, 
                  but won one-third of the votes.</p>
              <p>Some 47 per cent of the seats were uncontested because there were no 
                  opposition candidates, resulting in many PAP MPs winning seats by 
                  walkovers.</p>
              <p>Critics attribute it to a fear of Lee and his history of detaining or
                   suing his political foes. The Government, however, attributes it to the
                   poor performance of a fractious opposition.</p>
              <p>Things will dramatically change in a post-Lee Singapore.</p>
              <p>He himself had years ago predicted that after he quits, more and 
                  better quality Singaporeans would join the opposition to take on the 
                  PAP.</p>
              <p>He also said that his successors would have no problem winning the 
                  next two elections (until 2016-17), but hinted that they could be voted 
                  out if they failed to measure up to rising expectations.</p>
              <p>At the moment, the focus is on the ruling party’s self-renewal, like 
                  whether Lee and who among the older staunch Cabinet supporters will 
                  leave to make way for new blood.</p>
              <p>If it follows tradition, a quarter of its current 82 MPs will be replaced by younger men and women.</p>
              <p>Even without Lee or the fear factor, the ruling party as the 
                  incumbent will still enjoy overwhelming odds over its fledgling rivals, 
                  including the power to change rules and the support of a compliant 
                  press.</p>
              <p>Above all, the party is believed to retain broad support from older, 
                  conservative Singaporeans (especially housewives), the wealthy, the vast
                   bureaucracy and upper middle class, who feel “safe” under PAP rule.</p>
              <p>Few in this group appear keen to opt for the unknown.</p>
              <p>But the same cannot be said of the lower income group, struggling 
                  wage earners and young professionals who have suffered from the foreign 
                  influx.</p>
              <p>“There are many jobless or underemployed people out there who have become despondent and bitter,” one writer opined.</p>
              <p>“And young professionals are worried at all times that ‘cheaper’ foreigners will replace them or retard their pay rise.”</p>
              <p>Summing up this feeling was a recent letter “Linda” posted on the Internet, which said: -</p>
              <p>“My family members were staunch supporters of PAP and Lee Kuan Yew 
                  who had improved most Singaporeans’ standard of living through hard work
                   and education.</p>
              <p>“But during these past 10 years, I have seen one by one, my siblings,
                   relatives and friends, become jobless. A qualified accountant was told 
                  to apply for a job as chambermaid when she approached (an official job 
                  help body).”</p>
              <p>Linda said she had not believed this could happen, until the past few
                   years, “when I realised that so many foreigners were taking up most of 
                  the office jobs, and true-blue Singa­poreans were being displaced”.</p>
              <p>“Sorry, Mr Lee and PAP, I have now second thoughts about you. But 
                  thanks for the good years some of my generation had gone through – but 
                  not now for my children,” she concluded.</p>
              <p>Rising discontent will make the approaching election one of the hardest to confidently predict by using past yardsticks.</p>
              <p>In the wake of large-scale immigration, which was recently cut down, 
                  Singapore is now bigger and divided so much that it is difficult to 
                  stereotype its people.</p>
              <p>Lee’s old consensus society has disappeared long before him.</p>
              <p>Despite this, Lee will leave behind a country that largely works – an
                   efficient, purposeful civil service and a strong infrastructure.</p>
              <p>These will probably allow the PAP to retain a mandate for a while with or without Lee.</p>
              <p>But with the ground souring, his party will likely lose popularity to
                   a rising, more credible opposition both in votes and the number of 
                  seats.</p>
              <p>The coming polls will be crucial because it will show how the young 
                  will vote and how political upstarts, both in the PAP and in the 
                  opposition, will fare when things get hot.</p>
              <p>They could throw up a future prime minister.</p>

He forced clever bright locals to emigrate to other countries, he killed off creativity with state-run companies. Without giving real ownership of the country to citizens, citizens simply do not feel any need to sarifice, it has become LKY Inc. It made citizens behave in the same manner. How much R&amp;D work, which require many selfless man hours to produce something remarkable can any citizens scarifice in the name of this country? How many innovative products can we really say out and foreigners will nod? Soundcards anyone? Will any one stand out and question anything if injustices are found. Helplessness is bliss has regressively destroyed this country, we can only be cheaper, better and faster, and if locals can't do it, then let the third world country guy do it.</p></div>
