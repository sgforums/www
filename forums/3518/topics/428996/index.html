              <p>what if i tell you vote is just changing fiscal policy and how government policies can affect the economy.<br> <br>As we all know, our current money-based economies undergo the 
              business cycle from recession to a boom and back. And they are 
              influenced by supply and demand. Government has 2 ways of influencing 
              the economy: taxes and government spending. Government spending puts in 
              money into circulation thus boosting incomes of those who receive the 
              money from government spending. Taxes takes money out of circulation, 
              thus reducing incomes.<br> <br>Using these two methods governments has some control over how low 
              recessions get or how high booms get. Often when a recession hits. 
              Government can either lower taxes or increase government spending. When 
              there is a boom government can cut spending or increase taxes.<br> <br>There are 2 political views:<br>1)Government isn't doing enough for the people, and lacks the resources to do so<br>2)Government is too inefficient when its big<br><br>Folks
               with view (1) would promote that government spend more during a 
              recession to reduce loss of spending (low low spending as a result of 
              low demand), and keep money in circulation and reduce duration of a 
              recession (bailouts, welfare). And when a boom comes along, government 
              should increase taxes to slow the increasing demand (high demand leads 
              to high inflation).<br> <br>Folks with view (2) promotes the opposite measures. During a 
              recession, they promote cutting taxes, so that people have more money to
               spend and hence keep demand higher than it usually would be in a 
              recession. Then when a boom comes along they say government should 
              reduce spending so the amount of money injected into the system is 
              reduced and hence reduce inflation (lowering social services, welfare 
              etc).<br> <br>If you folks have been paying attention to politics these 2 views 
              and measures should sound very familiar. Peter Joseph ( visit website <a href="http://bit.ly/ev3fQ5">http://bit.ly/ev3fQ5</a> ) (don’t forget capital Q letter) is right when he says that these two 
              parties are 2 sides of the same coin (the coin being the monetary 
              system). The truth is people are choosing between 2 methods of 
              controlling booms and recessions, when they vote: nothing more. THIS 
              CLEARLY SHOWS WHY any political party WAS NEVER ABLE TO BRING REAL 
              CHANGE. Of course there are certain discrepancies: like how republican 
              GWB boosted gov't spending by going to war with Iraq.<br> <br>The folks advocating free-market economics obviously support view 
              (2). While folks have socialist views support view (1). however we dont 
              have to be sad, just enjoy the moment, lets starts the politic party!<br><br>lets support all the candidates to give us ALL THE GOODIES!<br> <br><br><br>“We of this mighty western Republic have to grapple with the
               dangers that spring from popular self-government tried on a scale 
              incomparably vaster than ever before in the history of mankind, and from
               an abounding material prosperity greater also than anything which the 
              world has hitherto seen.<br> <br>As regards to the first set of dangers, it behooves us to remember 
              that men can never escape being governed. Either they must govern 
              themselves or they must submit to being governed by others. If from 
              lawlessness or fickleness, from folly or self-indulgence, they refuse to
               govern themselves then most assuredly in the end they will have to be 
              governed from the outside. They can prevent the need of government from 
              without only by showing they possess the power of government from 
              within. A sovereign cannot make excuses for his failures; a sovereign 
              must accept the responsibility for the exercise of power that inheres in
               him; and where, as is true in our Republic, the people are sovereign, 
              then the people must show a sober understanding and a sane and steadfast
               purpose if they are to preserve that orderly liberty upon which as a 
              foundation every republic must rest.”<br> <br>-President Theodore Roosevelt; Opening of the Jamestown Exposition; Norfolk, VA, April 26, 1907<br><br><br><br><br>-------------------------<br><br><br><br><br>It
               is my intent and will that all who read this understand what it means. 
              Because if you are able to understand it, then you can finally move 
              forward in understanding why things today are exactly why they are. This
               is very important. We must recognize our defect and rejection of that 
              which the government has provided to us. To understand that the 
              governments of this world, though seemingly, corrupt and out of control,
               is merely a reflection of the people in which it has to govern. That we
               are the problem. I'm the problem and you are the problem. We have 
              refused to govern ourselves. Due to that refusal we are left with the 
              best that the government can literally provide.<br> <br><br><br>We as a dependent of the government are a disruption and a 
              burden because we refuse to govern ourselves. They have stepped in to 
              try to control us, to keep us from hurting ourselves and one another so 
              that some semblance of society might still exist. It's not pretty and 
              not what people think they want but it is what it is because that 
              appears to be exactly what we want.<br> <br><br><br>Like I said before, the government is merely (merely; 
              meaning ONLY) a reflection of the people in which it governs. The more 
              out of control the people who have submitted themselves to it, the more 
              out of control the government appears to be out of control to control 
              it. It's actually pretty simple. Cause and effect. We are the cause by 
              the choices we make and the government, in all of it's choices, are the 
              effect. We the people make this so. We are the problem.<br> <br><br><br>On the other hand, if we were to stop looking to the 
              government for our every need, for currency, for trade, for everything 
              commercial, to deliberate fairness and equality, there would be none who
               find themselves holding the short end of the stick. For there would be 
              no stick that any would want to hold.<br> <br><br><br>Every government of this world will be united. Know that. 
              Their cause will be to subdue all of those who are the problem. Know 
              that. They will rule with a "rod of iron". They will either force us to 
              all grow up by making us understand that we indeed are the problem or 
              they will have to simply put an end to those that will not except the 
              responsibility for their own actions, intents and understandings.<br> <br><br><br>For those of you who think that government has enslaved you,
               by whatever means, know that you did agree to be governed, by and 
              through your personal acts and actions. Do not be fooled. It is you that
               is the problem and your unwillingness to accept that responsibility is 
              the problem at hand.<br> <br><br><br>They'll get you by your claim of ownership. Understand that 
              they have taken steps to relieve you of ownership. Most governments 
              accomplished this in the 1930's. By doing so, they have made it possible
               for you to live your life here, now, in abundance. Yet because your 
              intent is to own that what you cannot possibly own, you have caused 
              scarcity instead of abundance. They see you fighting for the right of 
              ownership. Those who fight to own something that cannot be owned is 
              merely keeping others from the benefit of that which they make claim to.
               That is not love. That is not community. That is not being your 
              brothers keeper. That is not you looking out for the best interest of 
              others. That is not being in service to others.<br> <br><br><br>All in all, ownership of any kind today is selfish, 
              thoughtless and the source and cause of every single problem you can 
              point your finger at. Bar none. Ownership is the problem. A man's claim 
              of ownership is a man claiming to be owned. We were sent here to be in 
              the world, not to be of the world. To make a claim of ownership, you are
               being claimed by that which you claim and are therefore of the world 
              and no longer merely in it.<br> <br><br><br>"The powers that be" know this to be the truth of the 
              matter. They understand that simple fact of ownership. You say they want
               claim and ownership of everything and I say that is a lie. They make no
               claim of ownership, the only ones making a claim of ownership are those
               pointing their finger at<br> these "powers that be" and saying, "they are trying to own everything." When in fact they are merely controlling it.<br><br><br><br>Who
               said, "Own nothing and control everything"? That was a very wise man. 
              That was someone who understands what destruction ownership causes. That
               is a man trying to show others the right way. Those who misunderstand 
              the logic of non ownership are lost in illusions of grandeur and that is
               the product of the illusion of ownership.<br> <br><br><br>You truly own nothing. Your claim of ownership is causing 
              the hungry to starve, the thief to steal and the murderer to kill. You 
              who claim ownership of anything and everything, even your own family and
               loved ones, you are killing them and their future, in a world of 
              abundance that already exists.<br> <br><br><br>If you claim ownership, you are the problem. If you refuse 
              to understand that you are the cause of the problems that you see in the
               world today, your experience will not only be unpleasant for you but 
              for your prodigy also. Everything you try to hold in the form of 
              ownership, you WILL lose, including but not limited to your life.<br> <br><br><br>Do read this more than once. Understand what it says. Ask 
              for help in understanding if you don't understand. Do not let this 
              opportunity slip away into eternity.<br><br><br>Those of you who wish to
               continue by arguing for the "right of claim and ownership" don't bother
               to respond. I'm not here to change your mind for you, I'm here to 
              assist you to change your own mind, if change is what you seek. I have 
              no time nor energy to reason with you and your intent of continued claim
               of ownership. Let your will be done in that instance. Mine is "fair 
              warning". The "powers that be" also, have given you fair warning. Do you
               really think I came up with all of this on my own?<br> <br><br><br>A final word taken from the last line of the Declaration of 
              Independence, do understand it… ..."with a firm reliance on the 
              protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our 
              Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor." Notice: No claim of 
              ownership, it's ALL been pledged.<br> <br>Know thy self, for your only enemy is the one within.<br><br>jimmy</p>
