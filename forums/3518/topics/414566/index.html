              <p>By Alicia Wong – November 3rd, 2010</p>
              <p>Two more opposition parties could be joining the Singapore
               Democratic Alliance<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Democratic+Alliance&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> </a>(SDA), according to a report in <em>The Straits
               Times </em>(<em>ST</em>).</p>
              <p>The paper quoted sources naming the two parties: Dr Chee Soon Juan’s Singapore<a href="http://sg.search.yahoo.com/search?p=Singapore+Democratic+Party&amp;fr=fp-today&amp;cs=bz"> </a>Democratic Party and the Socialist
               Front, led by Mr Ng Teck Siong.</p>
              <p>The future of the Reform
               Party (RP) in joining SDA, however, remains unclear.</p>
              <p>Discussions between SDA chairman Chiam See Tong and RP had been 
              on-going over the past year, but on Tuesday, leaders of the SDA rejected
               Mr Chiam’s plans to have RP join the alliance, as negotiations were 
              conducted unofficially.</p>
              <p>SDA secretary-general Desmond Lim said, “Whatever discussions Mr 
              Jeyaretnam has had with Mr Chiam were in their own personal capacity.” 
              RP is headed by Mr Kenneth Jayaretnam.</p>
              <p>Mr Chiam was absent from the two-hour meeting, which was chaired by 
              SDA’s vice-chairman Ali Asjadi. He is also the leader of the Singapore
               Malay National Organisation (PKMS).</p>
              <p>A total of 11 of the 15 council members were present, including 
              leaders from the Singapore
               Justice Party and two others from Mr Chiam’s Singapore
               People’s Party.</p>
              <p>During the meeting, the leaders also supported Mr Lim, and rejected 
              Mr Chiam’s decision to replace Mr Lim as secretary-general.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim told reporters RP has not officially applied to join the SDA, 
              reported <em>ST</em>.</p>
              <p>He added that future discussions to bring in new political parties 
              will have to be approved by the alliance’s supreme executive council. Mr
               Lim will be the chief negotiator for these talks.</p>
              <p>New entrants will also be on a four-year probation, where they cannot
               sit on the council or have voting rights. The two opposition parties 
              that may join SDA have accepted these conditions, he said.</p>
              <p>Mr Lim added, SDA’s plans to ramp up preparations for the elections 
              will continue. This includes having monthly discussions with other 
              political groups on national policy issues.</p>
              <p>On Saturday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced that the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee has been 
              formed.</p>

              <p>For sure, SPP/SDP, as well as RP/SF will not be under the same umbrella.<br><br>It is not the first time that Chiam See Tong kenna booted out from the party/alliances that founded by him.</p>
              <p>Sad to say so but Chiam See Tong appears to be too 'weak' to be a political party leader although he leads a constituency very well. And he is the one who prefers all the opposition parties to unite together but as you can see some of the opposition parties are either fighting against each other or having some internal infighting.<br><br>Also Chiam have made a wrong step in making his wife to take over his helms in Potong Pasir.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>AN ALLIANCE of three opposition parties led by Potong Pasir MP Chiam See Tong appears to be coming apart.</p>
              <p>Sources in his Singapore People's Party (SPP) said he is 
              seriously considering pulling the party out of the Singapore Democratic 
              Alliance (SDA).</p>
              <p>Said an SPP member: 'Mr Chiam sees his best chances of 
              contesting a GRC with the Reform Party, but he feels the SDA member 
              parties are not going to let the Reform Party in.'</p>
              <p>Should he pull out the SPP, Mr Chiam would not need to 
              vacate his MP post because the SDA Constitution allows him to stay on as
               a member. He had contested the 2006 election under the SDA banner.</p>
              <p>The issue of letting the Reform Party (RP), led by Mr 
              Kenneth Jeyaretnam, into the alliance has been the main bone of 
              contention in the current SDA infighting.</p>
              <p>It came to a head this week, and yesterday Mr Chiam fired 
              the latest salvo by rejecting the SDA executive council's decision to 
              back the man he had replaced as the alliance's secretary-general.<br><br>Source:<a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_599120.html"><br>http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_599120.html</a></p>
