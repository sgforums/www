              Party Secretary-General Low Thia Khiang has said that any serious 
              opposition party will need to capture a Group Representation 
              Constituency (GRC) at the upcoming General Election to make progress.<br><br>"The
               GRC has been the trump card of PAP and mechanism for gerrymandering," 
              said the opposition MP for Hougang. "What happens if something happens 
              to (opposition MP) Mr Chiam (See Tong) or something happens to me? Can 
              we maintain Hougang? There's always this question. <br><br>"If you are 
              in GRC, perhaps you can ensure a smoother renewal and continuity...So 
              any serious opposition candidate, serious opposition party would need to
               seek a breakthrough in the GRC."<br><br>Mr Low was speaking to 
              reporters after visiting the New Upper Changi Road Food Centre, which is
               part of East Coast GRC, on Sunday.<br><br>The Workers' Party has expressed interest in contesting there.<br><br>Mr
               Low also said the Workers' Party is not seeking to form the next or 
              alternative government at this point in time and that he has no ambition
               to be the Prime Minister.<br><br>Mr Low was accompanied by council members including treasurer Eric Tan, youth wing president Koh Choon Yong and Gerald Giam.<br><br>- CNA/ir</span></span></p>

              <p>it'll be a bloody miracle if the horribly fractured opposition don't further fracture into smithereens.. seems like each of the idiot opposition parties prefer to fight amongst themselves or worse, fight their own party members instead of serving the people and thus winning the hearts and minds of the people..</p>
              <p>instead, they'd rather stab each other in the back, then during the elections, it's a mess..</p>
              <p>they need to do what LTK did with their internal assholes and throw them out of the party... maybe if they threw out enough troublemakers within their ranks, they may have a prayer of standing united..</p>
              <p>until then, the opposition will be seen as weak, ineffective, useless and preferring infighting rather than fighting the good fight</p>

              <p>by Andrew Loh</p>
              <p><span class="left">Posted by theonlinecitizen on March 13, 2011</span></p>
              <p>“Succession planning has been in progress,” says Mr Low Thia Khiang, 
              Secretary-General of the Workers’ Party (WP). He was replying to a 
              question from The Online Citizen (TOC) about whether he is looking for 
              someone to succeed him as leader of the WP.</p>
              <p>“It is important for a political party,” Mr Low says, referring to 
              the issue of leadership renewal. “And this is another important issue 
              and [an] important consideration for voters to look at.”</p>
              <p>Mr Low was speaking to the media after the party’s walkabout at New 
              Upper Changi Road in East Coast Group Representation Constituency (GRC) 
              on Sunday morning. Led by Mr Low, the group of some 30 members and 
              volunteers visited the hawker centre and several coffeeshops in the 
              area, introducing themselves to residents there and handing out fliers.</p>
              <p>Among those at Sunday’s walkabout were several potential WP 
              candidates who are expected to contest East Coast GRC. They include Mr 
              Eric Tan, 55, who led the WP team there in the last General Election 
              (GE); Mr Gerald Giam, 34; Ms Angela Oon, 32; Mr Png Eng Huat, 49; and Mr
               Fazli Talip, 29. The Online Citizen understands that Ms Glenda Han and 
              Mr Brandon Siow, who was a candidate with the East Coast team in 2006, 
              are also involved with the East Coast team.</p>
              <p>WP garnered 36.1 per cent of the votes in the GRC in 2006.</p>
              <p>On the issue of leadership renewal, Mr Low stressed that it is not just important for the WP, but for the opposition as a whole.</p>
              <p>“Mr Chiam is already well in his 70s. I am already [in my] 50s,” Mr 
              Low, 55, says. “By the next elections, I’ll be in [my] 60s. So, it is 
              important that voters also look at succession, look at how opposition 
              can renew. So you have a younger slate of players in the opposition who 
              can give them an alternative choice and who can lead the opposition 
              movement in the future. Especially for the younger generation of voters,
               I think they should be concerned about this.”</p>
              <p>Leadership renewal is also one of the reasons why the WP has declared winning a GRC as one of its goals.</p>
              <p>“[The] opposition can capture single seats like Potong Pasir and 
              Hougang, but to make progress, it’s not that easy,” Mr Low explains. 
              “The question always [comes] back: What if something happen to Mr Chiam 
              or something happens to me? Will we be able to retain Hougang? There’s 
              always this question. If you’re in a GRC, you can ensure a smoother 
              renewal and continuity. This is why we find that it is important and 
              strategic for the opposition to capture a GRC, if the opposition is to 
              play a role in the future.”</p>
              <p>Mr Low added, “[The] GRC has been the trump card of the PAP and also a
               mechanism of gerrymandering. We have to break through that.”</p>
              <p>After the last General Election, where the party received huge 
              support, especially at its nightly rallies, the WP saw an influx of new 
              members joining the party. Its first post-election Central Executive 
              Council (CEC) saw eight new members elected. Its Youth Wing was also 
              given a boost by many new recruits. Is this internal party renewal 
              process still on course?</p>
              <p>“Oh, we have done very well, in terms of renewal,” Mr Low says. “You 
              can see that the Old Guards have all retired. They’re now playing 
              supporting roles at the back. And you look at our CEC – much younger 
              people. What we’re trying to do now is trying to inject certain depth 
              into the party. You will see that Workers’ Party is not led by just Low 
              Thia Khiang and Sylvia Lim. There’ll be other younger leaders. We want 
              to promote a leadership team. In the next elections, you will see that 
              the party, besides a younger team of leaders, probably will have newer 
              members who can play leadership roles with maturity and experience. So, 
              we will have certain depth [in] in the Workers’ Party, moving forward.”</p>
              <p>In its 2006 General Election manifesto, the WP declared that it wants
               to be an “alternative government” in time to come. When asked if this 
              is a goal the party intends to fulfill, Mr Low said, “We are not seeking
               to form the next government or an alternative government at this point 
              of time. But of course, for any political party, their long-term 
              objective is to [be] an alternative government but we’re being 
              realistic. We want to build gradually, to build up the party.”</p>
              <p>When asked if he has ambitions to be Prime Minister one day, Mr Low 
              was unequivocal. “I have no ambition to be the Prime Minister,” he says.
               “Lets make it clear here. I have to be honest with voters.”</p>
              <p>In the meantime, he says the party’s role is “to provide a check and 
              balance, and to improve the functionality of the political system here.”</p>
              <p>Rebutting Prime Minister’s Lee Hsien Loong’s claims that a “two-party
               system will not work in Singapore, which is much better off with ‘one 
              dominant, clean and good party,” Mr Low said:</p>
              <p>“Singapore needs a strong government and also a strong opposition, to
               check on the government and [bring] the government to account. How does
               it square that you need a strong government and you do not need an 
              opposition? What system is this? Is he proposing a communist system?”</p>
              <p>As far as the upcoming General Election is concerned, Mr Low 
              reiterated several times that he “does not want to speculate” on how 
              well he expects his party to do, nor about his own performance in 
              Hougang. When queried about WP’s potential candidates in East Coast GRC,
               Mr Low said, “You want to know who stands where, that will be 
              Nomination Day.”</p>
              <p>He would only reveal that the WP “always looks for balanced 
              configuration, to provide a credible team, a credible choice to the 
              people” in each of the constituencies it will be contesting. “This will 
              have a balance between mature candidates and younger candidates,” he 
              adds.</p>
              <p>When pressed to elaborate further and to provide some clues on its 
              slate of candidates for the elections, Mr Low said, “First of all, the 
              Workers’ Party will select its best candidates to be fielded in the 
              election. And we select our candidates in a cautious [way]. We are not 
              fielding [just] anyone who come forward and want to be a candidate. As 
              to the quality of the candidates, I feel this should be judged by 
              voters.”</p>
              <p>Mr Low did, however, reveal that “there will be some professionals, 
              lawyers, researchers,” in the party’s line-up. However, he emphasised 
              that these may not be fielded in the elections as nothing has been 
              firmed up yet.</p>
              <p>The party will also be presenting its election manifesto in due time,
               Mr Low confirms. “We have been reviewing it,” he says. “We have had a 
              second review. We did a preliminary review one or two years ago and now 
              we’re doing a final review.”</p>
              <p>The People’s Action Party is expected to field a new, younger 
              candidate in Mr Low’s Single-member ward. Unionist Mr Desmond Choo, 34, 
              is slated to challenge Mr Low in the next elections, stepping into the 
              shoes of Mr Eric Low who lost to Mr Low in the last two contests.</p>
              <p>What does the MP for Hougang think of his potential new challenger and how well does he hope to do this time round?</p>
              <p>“I have not met him,” Mr Low says. “I do not want to speculate [on] the outcome of the election.”</p>
              <p>With the birth of new political parties and the changes to the 
              electoral system which, among other things, will see the presence of 
              more Non-constituency MPs in the House, Mr Low says the party is not 
              distracted and is focused on its goals.</p>
              <p>“Our direction is very clear: we want to provide a choice to the 
              people,” he says. “We want to build and show people that we are a 
              rational, responsible and respectable party. That has been the direction
               of the party. It has not changed.”</p>
              <p>The WP is in a tussle with the National Solidarity Party (NSP) over 
              the right to contest the newly-created Moulmein-Kallang GRC against the 
              People’s Action Party. When asked about this, Mr Low would only say that
               “there have been communications” between the WP and the NSP and he does
               not want to comment about it through the media.</p>
              <p>As for sentiments on the ground in East Coast GRC, Mr Low says: “My 
              gut feel is that they [residents] welcome contests. They want to 
              exercise their right to vote. So fundamentally, they welcome the 
              Workers’ Party here. They are prepared to support [us] because they know
               – if you want a choice, you got to support Workers’ Party. Then we will
               come back and provide you a choice. Because without support, we 
              probably won’t be able to come back again, right? I think they know 
              that. I appreciate that.”</p>
              <p>Mr Low’s first foray into electoral politics was to contest the 
              three-member Tiong Bahru GRC in 1988, the year the GRC system was 
              introduced in Singapore. In that election, his team scored 42.2 per cent
               of the votes against the PAP’s outfit.</p>
              <p>Will Mr Low lead a GRC team again?</p>
              <p>“I have declared to the press long ago,” Mr Low says, “that the option is always open to me.”</p>
