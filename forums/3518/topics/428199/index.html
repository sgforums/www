              <div class="ststory_large">
              <p> </p>
              <p>MR BENJAMIN Chow ('About Chen: Time will tell'; last Thursday) asked Mr Chen Show Mao why he wanted to participate in local politics now, after being abroad for so long.</p>
              <p>This is a reasonable question from any voter. But Mr Low Thia Khiang's reply brushed aside the question ('About Chen: WP rebuts Forum writer'; last Friday).</p>
              <p>In our search for candidates, the People's Action Party (PAP) has also considered people with good academic and work credentials who have been working overseas for many years.</p>
              <p>We advise them to come back and re-establish their roots first - get a job, set up a home, bring back their children, volunteer on the ground, get to know the issues first, and only then talk about candidacy.</p>
              <p>Even then, they should expect questions from the public about their commitment to Singapore and their motivations to stand as a candidate.</p>
              <p>Two of our PAP candidates, Dr Janil Puthucheary and Ms Foo Mee Har, were asked the same question posed to Mr Chen. They answered directly to allow voters to judge their motives and sincerity.</p>
              <p>They and their families have made Singapore their home for the last 10 and 21 years respectively, working and living here. In that period, Ms Foo added that she was posted overseas for 41/2 years. Their spouses and children are Singaporeans and they have sons who will do national service.</p>
              <p>From available information, Mr Chen has spent 40 of his 50 years out of Singapore. His entire career has been as a corporate lawyer in the United States and China. His wife and children do not live in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He now turns up and asks Singaporeans to elect him as a Member of Parliament. Surely, voters have a right to know from the Workers' Party if such a candidate can identify with the aspirations of Singaporeans and has a stake in our future?</p>
              <p>These questions should not be brushed aside and deserve a direct answer.</p>

              <p>THE People's Action Party (PAP) has called on the Workers' Party (WP)
               to tell voters if its candidate Chen Show Mao can identify with the 
              aspirations of Singaporeans, in what analysts see as the first salvo 
              fired by the ruling party at what has been billed as the WP's 'star 
              catch' ahead of the general election.</p>
              <p>The PAP's organising secretary, Dr Ng Eng Hen, has written to The 
              Straits Times Forum Page to criticise the WP for not answering directly 
              why Mr Chen, 50, is choosing to enter politics now, after having spent 
              some 40 years of his life overseas.</p>
              <p>Dr Ng contrasted the WP's lack of clarity to the PAP's own approach of getting its candidates to answer openly.</p>

              <p><strong>Personal attacks on WP's Chen will 'backfire': Analysts </strong></p>
              <p>THE People's Action Party is unlikely to go 'full guns blazing' or 
              step up personal attack on Workers' Party candidate Chen Show Mao, said 
              two political analysts on Tuesday.</p>
              <p>Mr Chen, 50, a China-based lawyer whose academic credentials include 
              topping the A-levels examination as well as degrees from Harvard and 
              Stanford, has been billed as the WP's 'star catch' for the coming 
              elections.</p>
              <p>Political watcher Derek da Cunha cautioned that if the PAP went overboard with 'negative campaigning', many voters might recoil.</p>
              <p>'It may backfire, particularly if the other side has not done 
              anything wrong. If the electorate perceives they have not done anything 
              wrong, then the PAP attacks come across as being gratuitous,' he told 
              reporters on the sidelines of a seminar at the Singapore Management 
              University.</p>
              <p>Concurring, SMU assistant professor of law Eugene Tan, said: 'I doubt
               it. They (the PAP) have made a point, and I think they should move on, 
              especially in view of the concerns that some of their candidates had 
              become citizens recently.'</p>
              <p>They were commenting on a letter to The Straits Times Forum Page on 
              Tuesday, in which PAP's organising secretary Ng Eng Hen criticised the 
              WP for not answering a letter-writer's question on why Mr Chen is 
              choosing to enter politics now, after having spent some 40 years of his 
              life overseas.</p>
              <p>At the seminar, both analysts presented their pre-election analysis of the coming polls, which will be held on May 7.</p>

              <p><strong>GE: WP defends Chen Show Mao's commitment</strong><br> <span class="update">By Wayne Chan | </span> <span class="update">Posted: 19 April 2011 2154 hrs </span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The 
              Workers' Party said its candidate Chen Show Mao has enough in terms of 
              commitment and local connection, having attended schools here and done 
              National Service as an Infantry Officer.<br><br>WP Chairman Sylvia Lim 
              was responding to a forum letter from Education Minister and PAP 
              Organising Secretary, Dr Ng Eng Hen - questioning Mr Chen's commitment 
              and motivations.<br><br>She added that Mr Chen's parents have been here 
              since 1972, and he has kept in touch with Singapore, coming back four to
               five times a year.<br><br>She said: "For example, he's serving on the 
              SMU Law School advisory board. So since 2007, four years ago till now, 
              he's been in touch with WP, our activities and also coming back and 
              learning more about how he can contribute.<br><br>"He's also made known 
              to the public that his wife and children will be moving back permanently
               to Singapore with him and that he intends to carry on his political 
              work in Singapore regardless of the outcome of the GE."<br><br>Ms Lim also responded to the PAP's Ms Indranee Rajah's criticism on the WP's vision of a first world parliament.<br><br>"She
               mentioned that we said that our vision of a first world parliament is 
              not modelled after any particular country and she finds it astonishing. 
              But I am surprised that she finds it astonishing. The PAP itself has 
              always claimed itself to be a first world government and I do not 
              believe they claim to model themselves after any particular government 
              of a developed country."<br><br>"In fact, they like to claim that they 
              would be a model for others to follow. So similarly for (the) Workers' 
              Party, our vision of a first world parliament, we've explained in 
              detail, is one where we have (a) opposition party performing a robust 
              check function in the house itself.<br><br>"And it doesn't have to be 
              similar to any other country's parliament, so long as it works for 
              Singapore and it is effective for accountability. I think that's the 
              most important thing."<br><br>Ms Lim added that the Workers' Party has always said it puts national interest before the party's.<br><br>"I
               mean Ms Rajah mentions that she doesn't think it's possible for any 
              opposition party to act other than in their own party's interest. But 
              let's not forget that the People's Action Party was once an opposition 
              before, so is she saying that at that time, the PAP also did not act in 
              the national interest?"<br><br>When asked about the timing of the 
              letters from the PAP, she said: "I think they are looking towards the 
              campaign and perhaps how Singaporeans might support the Workers' Party 
              or otherwise. So they would want to shape public opinion in their own 
              fashion.<br><br>"But I think it's important for Singaporeans to look at 
              the facts and look at our candidates in terms of what they have been 
              doing and how they've been connected to Singapore and look at the 
              reality rather than the rhetoric."<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>
