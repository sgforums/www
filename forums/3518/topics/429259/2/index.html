              <p>There is only one way WP can take aljunied, that is when PAP tears out a chunk of eunos, and put it somewhere else. But we know that will never happen, because they added in one more chunk called kaki bukit for this years GE.</p>
              <p>So next GE, I see a bigger chunk of serangoon north being cut off.</p>

              <p>Do not overestimate him. Eunos GRC helmed by former solicitor-general Francis Seow under WP in 1988 remains (as a matter of %) the closest any opposition ever came to seizing a GRC. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Do not forget this was achieved against the backdrop of Seow being detained by the ISA in the run-up to that particular poll, had all sorts of allegations being thrown against him through the corrupt media (most laughable of which was that he had been a CIA agent <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) in an era long before terrestrial TV and internet was easily and readily accessible.</p>
              <p>Against that backdrop, and what we're seeing with Aljunied today, he may very well be powerless to stop the tide that's enveloping that thug with fear.</p>
              <p>The bigger issue is, the regime has never had so many seats contested before in independent Singapore (that's before discounting the fact a vast majority of the estimated 1/4 electorate consists of Gen Y voters who have never voted before or voted only once in 10 years). Gerrymandering only works if you work on the premise substantial foundations are in place to ensure previous voting patterns can be replicated - the fascists have clearly not been in a position to estimate this with any reasonable sense of accuracy considering the last election only saw 47 (out of 84) seats being contested.</p>
              <p>If anything, there could well be greater aftershocks than just Aljunied awaiting the senile thug whose skullduggery and idiocy could actually backfire.</p>

              <p>Do you not realize a trend?</p>
              <p>This fascist knows - and understands - any change in electoral patterns are very likely irreversible and would inevitably lead to the erosion of his power.</p>
              <p>Following Operation Coldstore, the fascists "won" every single seat in every election between 1965 and 1981. Once JBJ cracked the hegemony at the Anson by-election in 1981, the fascists never regained 100% of seats in parliament again.</p>
              <p>When JBJ retained his seat in 1984, joined by Chiam See Tong in Potong Pasir, the fascist knew and realized the erosion was quick and rampant. Is it any wonder why he engineered the "GRC" system in 1988 to prevent the opposition from capturing more seats?</p>
              <p>Incidentally, there's no doubt in the mind of most Eunos would have fallen to WP had that campaign been run without the detention of Francis Seow (nevermind the fact the other constrains would have still been in place) and some 20 others (including Teo Soh Lung who's running in this elections at Yuhua) who were real and visible threats to the dynasty.</p>
              <p>Low and Chiam understand the mechanics of the game - if the opposition captures a GRC, it's highly likely the fascists will never recover from this in that no future elections will go by without the opposition capturing at least a GRC. It's only a matter of time, given this trend, that the opposition will capture enough seats to form the government.</p>

              <p>It will soon be July 7, the first anniversary of the great War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
              <p>Rallying in unity, persevering in resistance and persevering in the united front, the forces of the whole nation have been valiantly fighting the enemy for almost a year.</p>
              <p>The people of the whole world are attentively following this war, which has no precedent in the history of the East, and which will go down as a great war in world history too.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Every Chinese suffering from the disasters of the war and fighting for the survival of his nation daily yearns for victory.</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But what actually will be the course of the war? Can we win? Can we win quickly?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many people are talking about a protracted war, but why is it a protracted war?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to carry on a protracted war?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Many people are talking about Final victory, but why will final victory be ours?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How shall we strive for final victory?</strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Not everyone has found answers to these questions; in fact, to this day most people have not done so.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Therefore the defeatist exponents of the theory of national subjugation have come forward to tell people that China will be subjugated, that final victory will not be China's.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, some impetuous friends have come forward to tell people that China will win very quickly without having to exert any great effort.</p>
              <p>But are these views correct? We have said all along they are not.</p>
              <p>However, most people have not yet grasped what we have been saying...</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 24px;">The question now is<strong>:</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will China be subjugated? </span></strong></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; line-height: 24px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The answer is, No, she will not be subjugated, but will win final victory.

              <p>Do you not think the fascist did not consider this is actually working against them? You just need 50.01% of the total votes to totally and utterly destroy them.  </p>
              <p>If this system was in place, there would be no gerrymandering because you simply can't shift a chunk from Aljunied into Marine Parade from election to election. More importantly, that would be an all-or-nothing gamble. Would you risk 85 seats to regain 2 seats? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
