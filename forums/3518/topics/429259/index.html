              <p><strong>'Not end of the world if PAP loses Aljunied GRC': MM Lee </strong></p>
              <p>MINISTER Mentor Lee Kuan Yew does not consider it a major setback if the People's Action Party (PAP) loses the Aljunied GRC in the election.</p>
              <p>He said it would not be 'the end of the world' and the PAP would fight to get it back.</p>
              <p>He repeated that Aljunied voters will have to live with the decision for the next five years and 'repent' if they voted in the Workers' Party (WP) team led by Low Thia Khiang, who left his Hougang stronghold to make a push to capture a Group Representation Constituency.</p>
              <p>MM Lee was speaking to reporters on a wide-range of issues about this election, including cost of living and the younger generation, at the Radin Mas branch after a meeting with party activists and PAP candidate Sam Tan.</p>
              <p>He also said the PAP will not lose in this election, as the only hot-seat is Aljunied.</p>
              <p>'If Aljunied decides to go that way, well Aljunied has five years to live and repent,' said MM Lee.</p>
              <p>'We accept the verdict of the people, but they must also accept the consequences of their actions. You must expect the PAP to look after PAP constituencies first.'</p>

              <p><strong>Loss of Aljunied team will dent quality of Govt: SM Goh </strong></p>
              <p>THE quality of Singapore's government will take a hit if Aljunied GRC residents vote out the People's Action Party (PAP) team, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong warned on Saturday night.</p>
              <p>The five-member PAP team groups Foreign Minister George Yeo, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Finance and Transport Lim Hwee Hwa, Senior Minister of State (Foreign Affairs) Zainal Abidin Rasheed, Madam Cynthia Phua and new face Ong Ye Kung, who is widely tipped as a potential office holder.</p>
              <p>Noting the difficulties that many governments abroad face in recruiting good quality people to become Cabinet Ministers and office holders, Mr Goh warned Singaporeans that they would lose not only a foreign minister who has been able to foster good relations with neighbouring countries, but also Singapore's first woman minister, Mrs Lim, and a potential Speaker of Parliament, Mr Zainal.</p>
              <p>Speaking at the PAP Marine Parade GRC rally at Paya Lebar, he also dismissed the Workers' Party's (WP) call for a First World Parliament, describing the opposition party as a 'koyok man' selling pills that do not work.</p>
              <p>He urged voters not to be seduced or swindled by them. 'They want quantity but if they can't sing, it's not a good choir,' he said.</p>
              <p>In his 35-minute speech, Mr Goh also disclosed that his former principal private secretary Tan Jee Say, who is contesting in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC as a Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate, left the civil service to join the private sector as Mr Goh did not think he could make it as a permanent secretary.</p>

              <p>Let's be realistic, the only new ground that the opposition makes this time may just be aljunied GRC. Is that enough? 4 of them plus PP and Hougang seats, that's <strong>6 elected opposition MPs against 81 PAP MPs</strong>. Forget about the 9 NCMPs, they don't have the power of vote.</p>
              <p>What do Singaporeans want really? More years of hell? I fear for their chances when I see crowds of only 1 to 2 thousand for opposition rallies.</p>

              <p>If every stadium fills up with 10,000 people per opposition rally....then will the PAP sit up and have a self relook. Just 1 to 2 thousand? They won't be bothered and there you go, same shit policies once again.</p>
              <p>That's why I think, Singaporeans complain and complain, in the end they only have themselves to blame.</p>

              <p>The old man is again blundering in his speeches. This indicates that the PAP intend to 'fix' Aljunied if it fells into WP hands.</p>
              <p>He is ignoring the fact that there will a be significant  number of PAP supporters in Aljunied GRC even if it loses, in the first past the post system. He is in fact saying the PAP is prepared to also punish these PAP supporters as a warning to the rest of Singapore.</p>
              <p>The PAP do not have proprietorship of the  government, and should not behave like it has. LKY is in it too long. He believe he pwns Singapore.</p>
              <p>Its time Singapore show him and party otherwise, and it starts at Aljunied GRC.</p>
