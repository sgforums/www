I watched your appeal to US President Obama. While the president is probably too busy to constantly be meddling in our small country's political affairs, and much less so be watching your plea on Youtube, I was struck by your conviction and drive.<br><br>I watched the video of you giving a speech at NUS. And I thought, this guy isn't the lunatic I once thought he was. He is eloquent, intelligent, and courageous.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After a little reflection, I realized that it is really the mainstream media that has etched the image of a crazy dr chee into the minds of Singaporeans.</span></strong><br><br>You were imprisoned, made bankrupt, imprisoned again...yet you have never stopped your political activism and have continued fighting for what you believe in.|<br><br>While I do not wholeheartedly agree with the proposed policies of your team (ie, I am getting the impression that SDP wants to provide for all who are unable support themselves and this could undermine the value of meritocracy which many singaporeans believe in), I am deeply impressed with the conviction displayed by yourself and your party.<br><br>I have confidence that your party members will be able to act as a voice for singaporeans in parliament, undaunted by the many generals ands whatnot from the ruling party.<br><br>Thank you for fighting for Singapore and keep to the good work (especially on the social media front, it's working marvelously)!<br><br>QY<br><br>PS. Say hi danny the bear for me</p>

This is “My Hard Truth” about SDP.<br><br>SDP have not been having good records in the past years with yourself and some other members gotten into trouble with the law. I have not been following SDP. I am a great support for WP.<br><br>When two very capable ex-public servants, Mr. Tan JS and Dr. Ang were introduced by SDP being a candidate for the 2011 GE, my very first thought was “they must be crazy”!<br><br>They could have joined other “better” opposition like WP, SPP etc. Why put themselves in such high risk by joining the SDP? I have no idea who Vincent and Michelle were at that time and I thought these are also crazy people putting themselves at risk by joining SDP.<br><br>In the Political Forum telecast on air, Vincent left me a deep impression with his steadiness and well presented questions, but that did not change my perception of SDP.<br><br>In the recent GE Rally, I have been watching most of the opposition speeches. To my very surprise, I was extremely impressed by majority of the speakers from the SDP. Mr. Tan, Dr. Ang, Dr. Vincent, Michelle LJ, Teo SL, Alec Tok were very impressive speakers.<br><br>In fact, I feel that the speeches and agenda are much better than other opposition because they have great substance in the speeches and are closer to the heart of the Singaporean. In addition, there is a very good mixed of candidates who complement each other’s expertise and is able to feel for the people on the ground.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I started to relook at SDP from another angle, start looking at the past videos of SDP and Dr. Chee’s family, speeches etc. I started to reflect and understand why Dr. Chee’s scarification. You being a father of three beautiful children, you are NOT out of your mind but all these that you have done are for the democracy of Singapore, putting yourself and your family at risk. I salute you.</span></strong><br><br>I urge that Dr. Chee and SDP can continue to excel in the Singapore political arena. I certainly feel that this is a NEW Dr. Chee and Brand NEW SDP.<br><br>I certainly will consider joining as a member of SDP and is willing to participate in any of the focus group discussion if SDP requires.<br><br>I once again applaud SDP for the great effort in putting up such great teams in this coming GE. I wish SDP the very best of luck in Holland-Bukit Timah, Sembawang, Yu Hua and Bukit Panjang. Please continue to be the voice of the people of this country.<br><br>I love Singapore. This is my home and my country.<br><br>Steven Ng</p>

In the past, we were taught about how much PAP had done for Singapore, how LKY has brought Singapore to where she is now in the international stage etc.<br><br>As for the media, they blinded us by casting a bad image of Dr Chee (how he 'kicked' Mr Chiam out of SDP, how he 'bad-mouthed' LKY etc.)</span></strong><br><br>With the lastest attempt for his appearance at Yuhua Stadium on the evening of 28 April 2011, the media tried to report it as a protest. Shame to the national papers.<br><br>That is why no one will and want to vote for the SDP in the past elections.<br><br>With the advance of technology now, things change. Singaporeans start to find out the truth through various means and not being fooled by the media (controlled by PAP).<br><br>Dr Chee's election message touched the hearts of many elderly. With all the videos produced by SDP, it give us a clearer and fairer understanding of Dr Chee in his fight for democracy for the nation.<br><br>Dr Chee, please fight on and see you in GE 2016.<br><br>Anonymous</p>

              <p>maybe he's changed his spots...</p>
              <p>but we are old enough to remember the knife he stuck in the back of Chaim See Tong... and how he took the opposition movement back 20 years after Chaim turned the SDP into a credible alternative...</p>
              <p>all was lost when the power-hungry guy stuck one into the person who brought him into the party and nurtured him to be his successor...</p>
              <p>and before you go rant about "propaganda", you should go ask Chaim all about it..</p>
              <p>or you can ask Chee's collaborators like Ling How Doong... and what they did behind Chiam's back...</p>
