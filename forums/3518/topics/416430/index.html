              <p>I think its a foregone conclusion that they will increase GST to 10%. in 2011, you will receive GST credits of $700 to cope with the implementation of 10% GST in 2012.</p>

              <p>They can have seperate tax for gst especially for those in shopping centers and for resturants or hotels etc...</p>

              <p>The gst will stay/remain without further increased. But have another seperate gst name as Gst Tax.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So for pple like me or others where we shop at ntuc or any supermarkets or any coffee shop, we will only charge gst minus out the gst tax.</p>

              <p>well that also depends on whether u buy the branded stuff or not haha. Normally if u buy house brands it can go many dollars cheaper but then again, some of these house brands suck.</p>

              <p>well that also depends on whether u buy the branded stuff or not haha. Normally if u buy house brands it can go many dollars cheaper but then again, some of these house brands suck.</p>
              <p>And NTUC is not for the people man. A lot of their stuff are even more expensive than the grocery stores or Sheng Siong. Serving the people is no longer a priority.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Transcript of the <a href="http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/11/sdp-unveils-economic-programme-for-singapore/">pre-election rall</a>y
               speech by Dr Vincent Wijeysingha of the Singapore Democratic Party on 
              13 November. We thank Dr Vincent for providing us with this transcript 
              at our request. </em></strong></p>
              <p>My friends,</p>
              <p>It is an honour to have the opportunity to address you again, my 
              fellow Singaporeans, who share with me a love and a concern for the 
              future of our country.</p>
              <p>You know, I have lived in many places. And everywhere I went, I 
              always came home. Home to our familiar Singlish. Home to mee pok, satay,
               prata. Home to MacRitchie Reservoir and the East Coast. The beautiful 
              shophouses of Joo Chiat, the grand buildings on St Andrew’s Road. Home 
              to my people. Those of you who have been abroad like I have will know 
              the constant yearning to come home.</p>
              <p>But home has stopped feeling like home. For all the PAP accusations 
              that Singaporeans treat our country like a hotel, it is they who have 
              turned us out of our home and then rented it back to us as tenants.</p>
              <p>We no longer live in our own country. We live in a strange land, 
              where we are not entitled to share with one another what hurts us and 
              harms our community; where we are disallowed from discussing what needs 
              to be done; where those who speak up are rebuked and accused of treason.
               Where honest, decent people who work for the welfare of their fellows 
              [sic] are silenced.</p>
              <p>But the SDP has refused to be silenced. The SDP has insisted on its 
              right, the right of citizenship, to speak up where things have gone 
              wrong; to tell those in power when they have lost their way; to not 
              pretend not to notice the elderly and weak who are literally cast on the
               trash heaps of our nation to fend for themselves. To say enough, no 
              more.</p>
              <p>We look around us and we are unhappy with what we see. We look around us and have decided that we will not look the other way.</p>
              <p>Today, we offer the people of Singapore an alternative vision for our
               nation. Today we offer the people of Singapore a set of fresh, creative
               and humane ideas to rejuvenate our nation and make our community live 
              again.</p>
              <p>Our party programme has been the result of many years’ work by many 
              dedicated people who have looked deeply into where we are and [where] we
               might end up if we don’t shift course now. <em>It’s About You</em> is a comprehensive programme that has been costed and tested against the thinking of internationally-renowned academics.</p>
              <p>It is a departure from the timeworn, redundant policies of flooding 
              the country with cheap labour, filling every available space with a 
              multinational moneymaking venture, and constantly telling the people to 
              spend and spend and spend. And in the process of doing it, raising the 
              cost of basic services, housing, doctors, school books so that 
              Singaporeans struggle just to keep a roof over their heads, and have to 
              debate whether or not that nagging pain can wait till next month to see a
               doctor.</p>
              <p>This is not a policy we want. This is not a country we want. This is not a future we look forward to.</p>
              <p>My friends, at this stage, I want to say something about the SDP’s 
              response to the immigration policy. The SDP is not, and never has been, a
               racist or xenophobic party. We have always supported the rights of all 
              people and have campaigned that no one’s human dignity should be denied.</p>
              <p>The SDP makes a clear distinction between the migrant workers who are
               in our midst and the highly misplaced immigration policy that is 
              threatening to inundate the island with more people than it can afford, 
              and at a cost to our socio-cultural fabric that has not been assessed in
               any way. As the party which has shown its commitment to defending human
               rights, we argue strongly for the rights of migrant workers. But we 
              state very clearly that the PAP’s immigration policy is not only 
              ill-advised but threatens to tear apart the fabric of our community that
               we have build over these many years.</p>
              <p>We look forward to a future where all Singaporeans are safe and cared
               for. Where all our children have the opportunity for an excellent 
              education; where all our old people can live out their last days in 
              comfort and dignity. This is your right and this is what we demand for 
              you.</p>
              <p>Once upon a time, the PAP strove to provide these things. Today, the 
              PAP has utterly and totally lost its way. It has lost the right to tell 
              us that it knows best and does best.</p>
              <p>Our alternative vision speaks to your deepest aspirations. Our 
              alternative vision is your vision. I invite you strongly to get a copy 
              for yourself. To find out what we propose and how we’ve arrived at those
               proposals. To see for yourself that some of our policies have even now 
              been taken on by the PAP. To read the views of internationally-renowned 
              thinkers who support our vision.</p>
              <p>Let me share with you some highlights of the programme:</p>
              <p><strong>We call for a new, internationally-recognised way of measuring how well the economy is doing from the viewpoint of the people.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We want to see income rebalancing policies like restructuring tax 
              bands, introducing a minimum wage, looking again at the level of GST and
               removing it from essential goods.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We advocate retrenchment benefits for those who have lost their jobs 
              and are taking time to retrain to re-enter the workforce. After all, not
               all of us earn enough to save for that rainy day since wages have so 
              significantly declined for ordinary Singaporeans.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We want to see the creation of rooted and sustainable homegrown 
              companies through policies that enhance the capability of our small and 
              medium sector.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>We propose reducing the cost of HDB flats to make them truly a public service and not a money-making, profit-oriented concern.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>And we propose ways to increase expenditure on education and 
              healthcare to build a healthy, and thinking, dedicated and creative 
              population which can meet the challenges of the 21<sup>st</sup> century and when it is time to retire, retire healthy and happy.</strong></p>
              <p>My friends, with the publication of <em>It’s About You</em>, we say 
              firmly that no longer can the PAP write off the SDP. In fact, the 
              worn-out habits of the PAP are what should be written off as tiresome 
              and pointless. The SDP’s programme offers a constructive and workable 
              alternative, an alternative that the PAP is afraid of, because it has 
              nothing with which to challenge it. It has nothing because with 
              long-time success has come laziness and complacency.</p>
              <p>We, the SDP, are not complacent. We place our proposals before you, 
              the people of Singapore and we ask you to coldly, soberly, 
              intelligently, measure them against what has been thrown at us these 
              recent years which have resulted in the structural problems we are 
              facing today. And we ask you to challenge the government, ask what its 
              response is to the SDP.</p>
              <p>What is our response to the PAP? We say it is time you went, and went
               quickly. And leave the government of this country to those who care 
              about it, about its people. About its future. Because <em>It’s About You.</em></p>
              <p>My friends, at this stage, I invite you to join with us, to help us. 
              What you see at this rally has come about through hard work, time, 
              effort and energy. And of course, money. We need your support, at 
              whatever level you can give. Come volunteer with us, join us, support 
              us. Help us to do what you want us to do: To represent you, to speak up 
              for you. To see that it remains about you.</p>
              <p>Thank you and good night.</p>
