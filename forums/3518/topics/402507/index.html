              <div class="entry">
              <p><strong>By Ng E-Jay</strong></p>
              <p>As a casual political observer, I find Malaysian politics interesting for two reasons.</p>
              <p>Firstly, the Malaysians have shown us what can happen in the context of Singapore politics if the opposition parties here unite and put up a credible fight against the incumbent PAP. For those who believe, like me, that the gradual democratization of Singapore’s political landscape is inevitable as voters mature and become better informed global citizens, Malaysia shows us the potential for change that can occur here.</p>
              <p>Secondly, the ruling Barisan Nasional has, in the wake of their spectacular drop in popularity during the most recent 2008 general elections, resorted once again to strong arm tactics like the use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) against journalists and political dissidents. They have shown us how rashly and unthinkingly a government can act if it feels cornered by growing discontent and feels its grip on power on the verge of being threatened.</p>
              <p>Throughout the contemporary history of both Singapore and Malaysia, our politics has been inextricably intertwined. In some sense, Malaysia is now a few steps ahead of us in terms of the inevitable democratization which I spoke of earlier. Malaysia shows us, in a nutshell, our potential future path. If we can study the current course of politics in Malaysia, we can learn to avoid the potential pitfalls. We are fortunate to have a time machine located just across the causeway.</p>
              <p>The main message of my short article is that if Singapore’s opposition parties can take a leaf out of Malaysia’s Pakatan Rakyat and at the same time learn from their shortcomings, a credible and substantial fight can be put up against the incumbent PAP, and I believe that we will have the ability to deny the PAP their 2/3 majority in Parliament.</p>
              <p>The Pakatan Rakyat, or People’s Alliance, is an informal opposition coalition formed in the wake of the March 2008 general elections. They comprise the PKR, DAP and PAS, and contested the 2008 elections under the banner of Barisan Rakyat, or People’s Front, which also included other opposition parties at that time.</p>
              <p>The enormous success of the component parties of Pakatan Raykat during the 2008 elections can be traced to the fact that despite sometimes daunting difference in ideology, they were willing to set all these aside and create a united, credible campaign that spoke to the hearts and minds of voters. They made full use of the internet and information technology to transmit their message. They were not willing to be silenced or ostracized by the Malaysian mainstream media which is blatantly biased against the opposition. They created their own print and electronic media channels, and engaged in the debate vigorously using all available tools at their disposal. And most importantly, they had very strong and capable leaders helming the entire operation, chief among them was Dato’ Seri Anwar bin Ibrahim.</p>
              <p>What does Singapore’s opposition need to do in order to become another Pakatan Rakyat that will once and for all shake the PAP from its undeserving dominance?</p>
              <p>Firstly, opposition parties have to be willing to put aside their differences and recognize that the common enemy is not each other.  Sadly, some opposition members or supporters have not been able to do that. The time for that to change is now. Opposition in Singapore must be seen to be mature enough to act collectively for the greater good rather than be dragged down by lesser concerns.</p>
              <p>Secondly, opposition parties have to encourage strong and capable leaders to rise up through the ranks and take charge of the situation. Like Anwar Ibrahim, opposition leaders in Singapore must be conversant in both bread and butter issues as well as fundamental issues like democracy, social justice, and the rule of law. They should have not just a credible domestic presence, but also a strong visible international presence, just like Anwar has. They must have charisma and the ability to mobilize both activists and well as the grassroots.  And finally, they should be men and women of outstanding character.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, opposition parties in Singapore must be both able and willing to create their own print and electronic media channels to break the dominance of our mainstream media.</p>
              <p>To conclude my article, I would like to again emphasize my belief in the wisdom of Singaporeans, as well as my belief in the inevitable democratization of Singapore society. What is the basis of my conviction? Well, to put it simply, a house built on a foundation of sand will never stand the test of time.</p>
