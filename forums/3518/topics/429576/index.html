              <p>IMPOTANT COMMENTS to make in the final rally<br><br>There are only two days left for rallies. I beg you to make speeches that pertain to many people's hearts. Folllowing are the 16 issues that people are unhappy about:<br><br>(1) Why does PM LEE decide to give only a HALF-HEARTED apology yesterday? He only apologised about the Mas Selamat incident, Orchard Road flooding, housing shortfall and transport problems. What about the new minimum sum policy where people cannot withdraw $150,000 when they reach age 55? What about the absurd foreign talent policy where foreigners are employed over locals with the same qualification? And what about Lee Kuan Yew's threats against Aljunied residents? TELL MM LEE TO STOP BEHAVING LIKE A BULLY.<br><br>(2) I am still very angry at Lee Kuan Yew's USE OF THREATS AND INTIMIDATION to threaten the Aljunied Constituency. That the Aljunied Constituency under Worker's Party will regret it for 5 years and finally repent? WHAT IS THIS? Lee Kuan Yew is an intelligent man but he seems to have reached a stage of senility where he is talking NONSENSE. He is no longer logical. He has definitely reached the stage of senility. His threat that property prices in Aljunied will fall is stupid. In fact this time round, the PAP seems to be talking nonsense. 15 years ago, the opposition spoke a lot of nonsense. This time it is the PAP who is talking nonsense and the opposition are the ones making sense.<br><br>(3) In the first place, Aljunied housing prices will not fall. Please see statistics at http://www.bernardleong.com/2011/05/01/are-property-prices-affected-by-who-you-vote-for/.<br><br>(3a) In the second place REPENTANCE IS ONY TO GOD FOR YOUR SINS. You don't repent to PAP who are MERELY HUMANS. Does PAP think they are gods so much so that Aljunedians will fall to their feet and repent? In addition George Yeo's free badges given out at Serangoon Stadium  distorted the phrase in the US dollar bill 'IN GOD WE TRUST'. George Yeo's team changed the phrase into 'IN GEORGE WE TRUST'. NOT ONLY ARE THE PAP now regarding themselves as gods, George Yeo is also assuming the position of a god. THIS IS OUTRIGHT BLASPHEMY.<br><br>(4) Why not address last year's newspaper article on 30th October 2010 against Goh Chok Tong, where we read that one university undergrad told Goh Chok Tong that he feels 'SINGAPORE IS NOT WORTH DEFENDING ANYMORE'. When undergrad Lim Zi Rui brought up this issue during a Ministerial Forum dialog between SM Goh and NTU students, SM Goh was caught 'off guard'. According to the TNP report, Goh Chok Tong expressed surprised and said that he did not know such disenchanted sentiments existed. Undergrad Lim Zi Rui said “I feel that there is a dilution of the Singapore spirit in youth…We don’t really feel comfortable in our country any more.”  Mr Goh replied, '‘This is one early sign of danger… If this is happening, IT IS VERY SERIOUS...if the majority feel they don’t belong here, then we have a FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM SAID MS GOH. From this dialog, Goh Chok Tong is seen by many young Singaporeans as OUT OF TOUCH with them. Read the full article on http://sg.yfittopostblog.com/2010/10/30/i-dont-know-what-im-defending-anymore/<br><br>(5) From Sembawang PAP Ong Teng Koon said 'if you elect a PAP MP, you can be sure that we will work for you WEEK after WEEK, YEAR after YEAR. But Singapore People's Party (spp) has promised in their rally at Bishan Stadium (on 2nd May 2011) that they will have the MEET A PEOPLE SESSION TWICE A WEEK, and those who meet the MP will receive more than 1 minute of their time (PAP's usual mode of addressing the people is just 1 minute)<br><br>(6) SDP has capable people with Dr Ang at the helm. PAP says that SDP policies are a 'rushed patchwork' (Straits Times 4th May). This is not true. Dr ANg has many years to think of the policy he wishes to implement.<br><br>(7) On the ground, PAP has been getting little support. From the jeering by a coffeshop from PAP's walkabouts, to the refusal to accept a PAP pahmplet by a resident (read Sunday Times front page, right column). In addition there is lack of general ground support. Look at  notices posted by stall hoders at Tampines market who even took the time to LAMINATE their anti-pap signboards. Important: Please see http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/showthread.php?t=3217252<br><br>(8) CPF belongs to us. When you reach 55 you are forced to keep a minimum sum of NEARLY $150,000. The governement keeps CHANGING the CPF rules to STIFLE THE PEOPLE as if the money belongs to them. They initially promised to pay an annuity of (ONLY) a few hundred dollars a month after age 62. Now they have raised that age to 65. What happens if I die at age 66? I will never be able to enjoy my hard-earned $150,000.<br><br>(9) The government is too insistent on its foreign talent policy. With many voters venting their anger against this policy, how can you say PAP is right and the masses are wrong. The masses have seen and heard for themselves Filipino and China and Easten Bloc angmos accented workers EVERYWHERE. Voters are not blind. WHen one foreigner takes up a job, one local is deprived.<br><br>(10) The phrase I invented is 'foreigners foreigners everywhere, not a job left to take'.<br><br>(11) Additionally, during a recent community event, Lee Kuan Yew said: “Please remember: We still need 900,000 foreigners on work permits.” According to Lee Kuan Yew, total employment in Singapore rose by 786,000 between 2006 and last year and in 2010,<br>115,900 jobs were added, with half going to Singaporeans. This means that a shocking 57,950 jobs went to foreigners! HALF of jobs created last year go to Singaporeans (only). Additionally 900,000 foreingers are Waiting at our Gates: What’s the use of telling citizens PAP's past achievements when we have 900,000 hungry immigrants outside our gates?<br><br>(12) Singaporeans also understand that nothing is going to improve if the PAP is once again swept into power. PAP will just take the people's support for granted and dish out more of the same unbalanced foreign worker / foreign talent, CPF and tranport policies.<br><br>(13) As long as ALternative Parties make speechers that makes SENSE, voters would be convinced. And as long as MME Lee and Lee Hsien Loong talk NONSENSE, voters will be alienated against the incumbents. Alternative Parties, pleas always back up your claims with statistics and never use smear techniques against the PAP. Speak SENSIBLY and LOGICALLY and FROM YOUR HEART.<br><br>(14) Finally, Altenative Parties have to show more energy and passion, especially the Reform Party. So LAUGH MORE, SMILE MORE and TALK TO YOUR RESIDENTS MORE.  This will swing votes to you because voters like myself want to see PASSION and SACRIFICE in who they are voting for. Lethargy and lack of stamina tend to alienate voters.<br><br>(15) 15 years ago, it was the Alternative Parties who were talking nonsense. Now, the tables have turned and it is the  PAP who is talking nonsense and the alternative parties are making sense. Let's make this year a milestone for Alternative Parties.<br><br>(16) Sylvia Lim makes a lot of sense. See these clips.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPqeIz3nrxk&amp;feature=mfu_in_order&amp;list=UL<br>(Help George Yeo into early retirement)<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5bTRHiRQU40<br>(2nd part is in English. New CPF rules minimum sum means<br>that at age 55, u cannot take out nearly $150,000 - is this<br>fair?)<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpcCVntO8LQ<br>(PAP forogt the lessons of 1991 - they now take citizens for</p>
              <p>granted.</p>

              <p>I'm not trying to claim to be better than the opposition. I do not want the opposition to address issues that are unimportant. Simply to remind them that there are issues they have not talked about. As it is, I SENT THIS LETTER TO EVERY OPPOSITION PARTY i.e. SPP, SDA SDP, NSP, WORKERS PARTY AND REFORM, I hope that in on Wedneday (today) and on Thursday rallies, they will be able to bring up some of these topics which resonate with the people. If they can, my efforts to help the opposition would not be in vain.</p>
              <p>I have an idea. Why don't we all post something on sgforums and other influential sites that will help the opposition. We have 2 days left before the Friday cooling-day.</p>
              <p>Let's solve Singapore's injustices. Comon everyone. This is our last chance to bring some opp into parliament.</p>
