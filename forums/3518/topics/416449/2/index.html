              <p>No, it is just that the number (no.) of 6 member GRC to be reduced, and hence I predict only Tanjong Pagar and Sembawang will continue be 6 member GRC because it does not make sense for PM not set a good example to reduce its member in his team and the reduced GRC will form a 4 men GRC instead (Only 3 of them are exceptions, the 3 new SMCs).</p>

              <p>Well....Here's absolute predicts of what will
              happened..........<br> GRCs<br> Aljunied-Under Low Thia Khiang who will be speculated to leave
              Hougang to join Sylvia Lim,thus becoming the new team leader
              after his first lead back in 1988 in then-Tiong Bahru GRC
              against Chng Jit Koon(Senior Parliamentary Secretary for
              Community Development),against unpopular PAP GRC chief George Yeo
              Yong Boon,Worker's Party may have enough potential to win the GRC
              however,PAP had to do anything to increase more,thus dashing Low
              and Lim's hopes.............<br> <br> Ang Mo Kio-What if Worker's Party returns against PM Lee again???Or
              even the National Solidarity Party team????Will PAP wins big enough
              or low down from 66%?<br> <br> Bishan-Toa Payoh-Witnessing the first battle against Chiam See Tong
              of SDA or Reform Party if he joins it...Can DPM Wong's team
              including Sitoh Yih Pin(maybe)win against SDA/RP team???Possibly
              around 60 plus........Also known that SDP may join in the
              fray........It is apparent that Potong Pasir is much closer to
              Bishan-Toa Payoh,making Chiam more interested for dis
              moment.........<br> <br> East Coast-Worker's Party had eventually did it again,against the
              new chief,Raymond Lim......Can the incumbent succeed in ward off
              even stronger challenge?<br> <br> Holland-Bukit Timah-Speculated that Dr Chee Soon Juan of Democratic
              Party(SDP)may be leading his second team after release from
              bankruptcy,minus his sister who lead Sembawang team and
              subsequently bankrupted.....With Bukit Panjang adjacent to the
              GRC,can the PAP wins much bigger against Dr Chee's team?<br> <br> Hong Kah-Either Amy Khor or even Gan Kim Yong may be the new chief
              against a Reform Party team,possibly lead by Kenneth
              J.....Speculated that RP may defeat PAP or even defeated by
              Gan/Khor's team..........<br> <br> Jalan Besar-NSP's traditional battlefield.....With Dr Yaacob as the
              new chief,can it defeat Ken Sunn's team??<br> <br> Jurong-NSP's only battleground in Western part,as 3 of them,Tanjong
              Pagar,West Coast and Hong Kah has been taken by Reform Party while
              SDP had declared for Holland-Bukit Timah....Can both Lim and
              Tharman succeed in their second battle against NSP-led Christopher
              Neo???<br> <br> Marine Parade-Another NSP's declared battleground,after its sound
              defeat in 1992's by-election.....Could Tan Chee Kien lead Marine
              Parade team against incumbent Goh Chok Tong's team???And possibly
              there may be few SMCs carved out...Braddell
              Heights,possibly.......<br> <br> Pasir Ris-Punggol-SDA team-led Desmond Lim had declared recontest
              against incumbent DPM Teo,Defence Minister.....However,with a
              likely split of the SDA within Chiam's conflict,Pasir Ris may be
              remained under PAP's rule.........Teo Ser Luck had been reserved
              for a closest SMC within the area......<br> <br> Sembawang-Either WP or SDP had been intend to a battle arena
              against Khaw and Shanmugam.......But I bet,Sembawang may down to
              only 5,with Chong Pang to a new GRC with Shanmugam as the
              chief,namely Nee Soon GRC,with both Nee Soon Central,East and
              South.......So SDP may be return to Sembawang while WP lead by John
              Lim may be trying to defeat Shanmugam,or IF Sembawang is still
              6,could WP may enter the fray????<br> <br> Tampines-Another NSP battleground,lead by Goh Meng Seng against the
              incumbent Mah Bow Tan....Due to housing issues,Goh may be the first
              NSP MP,or what if PAP team had successfully defeated Goh's
              team?<br> <br> Tanjong Pagar-Lee Kuan Yew,the man behind Singapore and the ruling
              party's success for over half a decade,had eventually may remain
              for his very last,right against a Reform Party team...Most probably
              Kenneth J himself,son of JBJ,who wishes for a last showdown before
              his untimely demise in 2008....I bet Tanjong Pagar may win much
              bigger,or if Lui Tuck Yew replaces him as chief,in definite
              contrast.....<br> <br> West Coast-Another Reform Party's declared battlegrounds after Hong
              Kah and Tanjong Pagar,Bishan-Toa Payoh too,if the SDA/SDP has not
              made it,Holland-Bukit Timah however declared by SDP's Dr
              Chee.....With Lim Hng Kiang as the chief,PAP may eventually wins
              successfully,thus warding off a strong challenge from most probably
              Tony Tan Lay Thiam's team..........</p>

              evetually 2-4 SMCs or Hougang as the sole opp SMC AND Aljunied is
              the FIRST OPP GRC by the Workers Party......Thus,PAP had scored
              slightly higher up to 68% or down to 63%as in 1988..PAP had won
              altogether at least 76 seats with eventually both Aljunied GRC and
              Hougang or eventually more,slight drop,drastically.....Or
              eventually down to 70 seats...We all know that the best opp losers
              may get all <strong>9</strong> NCMP seats,eventually the Reform
              Party and the rest of WP members including a sole SDA candidate who
              defeated to PAP in Potong Pasir......<br> By right,IF the polls up and the SDP lead by Dr Chee has INDEED
              landed in Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC,I'll get my chance to vote within
              the most exciting event after all these years.......After all I'm
              going to be 21 next month,legal age to vote and beyond.....<br> May the best one wins........See you in the polls
