              <p> </p>
              <p>What happened is this father-son (So dun accuse PAP, as opposition also got father son / daughter as well), father went to many cornered fight in CCK, worse than some independents who managed to get less than 2% (Less than 500) of the votes while this son went into Kampong Glam in 1997 and earned 29.7% of the votes.</p>
              <p>Sad to say, by 2001, this father went to MacPherson SMC and got 16.8% of the votes but his son go to Ayer Rajah (At Teban) SMC and got 12% of the votes, which happened to his (son)'s turn to lost the deposit (Lost deposit = Earned less than 12.5% of the votes)</p>
              <p>By 2006, his son went to 10Penis with SDA and lost with 31% of the votes, his father, did not stand to become a candidate.</p>

              <p>Last time, I recall one candidate affectionately known as "slipper man" who didn't go around canvassing for votes during the elections. </p>

              <p>Think he got a decent amount of votes though he did not win.</p>

              <p>You still mention this wasted slipper man?</p>
              <p>This slipper man was DPP member, who happened to be involved in
              the murder case (Son's PRC Wife kill dunno who and get 16 years in
              jail).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What happened is this father-son (So dun accuse PAP, as
              opposition also got father son / daughter as well), father went to
              many cornered fight in CCK, worse than some independents who
              managed to get less than 2% (Less than 500) of the votes while this
              son went into Kampong Glam in 1997 and earned 29.7% of the
              votes.</p>
              <p>Sad to say, by 2001, this father went to MacPherson SMC and got
              16.8% of the votes but his son go to Ayer Rajah (At Teban) SMC and
              got 12% of the votes, which happened to his (son)'s turn to lost
              the deposit (Lost deposit = Earned less than 12.5% of the
              votes)</p>
              <p>By 2006, his son went to 10Penis with SDA and lost with 31% of
              the votes, his father, did not stand to become a candidate.</p>

              <p>If he can get that percentage, can graduates with enough courage, fervour and intellect come out to contest against PAP get better percentage, and win a seat?</p>
              <p>The answer is YES!</p>
              <p>And that is why the Govt knows this, and that is why the Govt goes all out attracting local Grads into Govt jobs, so that they will not get a chance to contest against them.</p>
              <p>For the sake of your country, can our graduates come out and speak out for your fellow citizens? Join the opposition, or even go out and contest and speak out!</p>
