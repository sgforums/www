              <p>GE: What are the hot—button issues?<br><br>SINGAPORE: As the drumbeats of the General Election get louder by the
               day, a survey of 618 voters commissioned by Today has found that the 
              rising cost of living here is more likely to influence how the voters 
              cast their ballot than supposedly hot—button issues such as the influx 
              of foreigners or housing.</p>
              <p>For some political watchers the results came as a surprise.</p>
              <p>The
               survey, conducted earlier this month via telephone by Media Research 
              Consultants, is statistically representative of HDB dwellers, the 
              findings weighted by the national profile for gender, age, race and HDB 
              housing type. The survey, however, does not cover voters living in 
              private properties.</p>
              <p>The result, which political watchers found the
               most interesting: Almost 7 in 10 voters (65.5 per cent) said that the 
              issue of foreigners — the influx and its side effects will not affect 
              their vote at the GE.</p>
              <p>This finding was backed up by the fact that 
              slightly more than half the voters (55.3 per cent) felt that the steps 
              taken by the Government to slow down the influx of foreigners and to 
              sharpen the differentiation between citizens and non—citizens have been 
              "adequate" to address their concerns.</p>
              <p>Trying to reconcile the 
              survey findings with the widely held perception, especially in 
              cyberspace, that foreigners are the hot—button issue of this General 
              Election, independent scholar Derek da Cunha noted that there is 
              "tendency among the majority of Singaporeans to avoid controversy by 
              making only politically correct statements".</p>
              <p>Dr da Cunha added: "I
               am quite sure that the issue of the influx of foreigners into Singapore
               is more significant than many people would care to admit openly."</p>
              <p>But
               having said that, when it comes to concerns on the influx of 
              foreigners, the perception that it has led to greater congestion on 
              buses and MRT trains was the concern most often cited by voters edging 
              out other concerns such as the erosion of the national identity, a 
              difficulty in integration or a feeling of being a second—class citizen.</p>
              <p>On
               the housing front, framed broadly as a question of availability and 
              affordability of public housing, the survey found that only 4 in 10 
              voters (41.6 per cent) said that this issue would influence how they 
              plan to vote. Almost 6 in 10 (58.4 per cent) said that the issue would 
              not have any effect how they vote.</p>
              <p>This was despite the fact that 
              opinions were quite evenly split — 47.6 per cent saying yes and 52.4 per
               cent saying no — when asked if the slew of measures taken by the 
              Government to cool the private property market and to help Singaporeans 
              buy a HDB flat have been adequate to address concerns.</p>
              <p>The one 
              issue that has lived up to its "hot—button" billing was the rising cost 
              of living. An overwhelming 8 in 10 voters surveyed said they were 
              worried about rising costs in their daily lives — be it when they were 
              buying basic necessities at the supermarket, or a meal at the food 
              court, or going to a polyclinic or planning to buy a new car or even 
              going on a vacation.</p>
              <p>Political analyst Eugene KB Tan observed: 
              "There is an inverse relationship between the perceived effectiveness of
               the measures taken to address the hot—button issue and the effect it 
              will have on how the respondents vote at the GE."</p>
              <p>As to why the 
              cost of living was the hottest of issues, the assistant professor at 
              Singapore Management University noted that it was "intimately connected 
              with perceived standard of living, it affects spending propensity and is
               regarded as also impacting the future."</p>
              <p>Institute of Policy 
              Studies faculty associate Tan Ern Ser said the survey showed that all 
              three issues were "significant" to varying extents.</p>
              <p>"However, I 
              must add that cost of living is pretty salient at this point in time, 
              affecting most people ... while housing affects a smaller proportion of 
              people, probably those in their late 20s and 30s — some of whom have 
              never voted before," said the sociologist.</p>
              <p>While offering some 
              insight into the psyche of heartland voters, the survey throws up a 
              relevant question: Could more grassroots concerns such as covered 
              walkways, the frequency of feeder buses, or housing estate facilities 
              turn out to have a greater impact on how voters decide to cast their 
              ballot? —</p>
