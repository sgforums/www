              <p><strong>Tan Jee Say did not make the cut: SM Goh </strong></p>
              <p>SENIOR Minister Goh Chok Tong disclosed on Saturday night that his former principal private secretary (PPS) Tan Jee Say did not make the cut to be a Permanent Secretary, and that was why he resigned from the Civil Service.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, 57, is a Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate contesting in four-member Holland-Bukit Timah GRC.</p>
              <p>'He was an able, hardworking PPS, but I did not think he would make it as a Permanent Secretary,' said SM Goh, speaking at a PAP rally in Marine Parade GRC. He is leading the PAP team contesting there.</p>
              <p>This was why Mr Tan resigned to go into the private sector to advance his career, SM Goh added.</p>
              <p>Mr Tan went to Oxford University on an Overseas Merit Scholarship, and served as PPS to then Deputy Prime Minister Goh from 1985 to 1990.</p>
              <p>He left the Administrative Service in 1990 to join investment bank Morgan Grenfell Asia, before moving into fund management.</p>
              <p>Now a private investor, he said he joined the opposition because he was dismayed at the direction Singapore's society and economy had been taking in recent years.</p>
              <p>SM Goh said Mr Tan had not made a smart choice in joining the SDP.</p>

              <p><strong>A reply by Tan Jee Say....</strong></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE Democratic Party (SDP) candidate Tan Jee Say rebutted strongly against the recent attacks on him by Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong and Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew.</p>
              <p>Speaking to a packed field in Clementi on Sunday night, the candidate for Holland-Bukit Timah GRC said he was 'surprised' by some remarks made by MM Lee and SM Goh, whom he used to serve as principal private secretary from 1985 to 1990.</p>
              <p>SM Goh had said on Saturday that Mr Tan resigned from the civil service after being told he would not make it as a permanent secretary.</p>
              <p>'I am surprised that he made such a remark as he had earlier said he would not comment on candidates outside of Marine Parade GRC,' said Mr Tan at last night's SDP rally.</p>
              <p>He added: 'I do not expect such comments from him after five years of loyal service.'</p>
              <p>Mr Tan, a former government scholarship-holder, said that it had never been his mission to be permanent secretary. He said he had wanted to leave the civil service after his bond ended in 1984, until he was persuaded to stay on for another five years by Mr Goh, who was then deputy prime minister.</p>

              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) candidate for Holland-Bukit Timah, Mr Tan Jee Say, said he is saddened by remarks made by his former boss, Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong, about him.<br><br>At a People's Action Party (PAP) rally for the Marine Parade GRC on Saturday night, Mr Goh pointed out that Mr Tan appeared to have 'benefited' from his previous appointment, and he wanted to make known why Mr Tan left the civil service.<br><br>In response, Mr Tan, who served under Mr Goh as Principal Private Secretary from 1985 to 1990, said he had already intended to leave the civil service at the end of his government bond, but was persuaded to stay on in his position.<br><br>Mr Tan told Channel NewsAsia during a Sunday morning walkabout at Empress Road market that it was never his mission in life to remain in public service and after five years, he resigned with Mr Goh's blessing.<br><br>Mr Tan recalled: "I said, okay, I can help you. But for how long? He said, three to five years. I said, well Mr Goh, you know my intention is not to stay in the civil service. If it is three to five years, if at the end of it, I want to go, will you let me go? He said, yes.<br><br>"I have given five of my best years in my career to Mr Goh, and I did not expect such comments from him. I wish he had not gone down to the personal level. I met a young lady at this market, and she said after reading this morning's report on his personal attack on me, she is more determined to vote for me."<br><br>He added that he was surprised as Mr Goh had earlier stated he would not comment on any candidate outside of Marine Parade GRC.<br><br>Mr Tan is contesting in Holland-Bukit Timah GRC on the SDP ticket.<br><br>His economic proposals have also drawn some attention. Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew has criticised Mr Tan's proposal to shift the Singapore economy away from manufacturing and said he was not 'qualified' to speak on manufacturing.<br><br>Mr Tan pointed to his background in economics and policymaking experience accumulated over six years at the Ministry of Trade and Industry.<br><br>"Not only am I qualified to talk about the economy, but my views have been endorsed by somebody who has presided over the transformation of a major first world economy, from a manufacturing economy to a knowledge-based economy. How more qualified can anybody be?" <br><br>Mr Tan was referring to Lord Butler, former Cabinet Secretary to three British Prime Ministers - Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Tony Blair.<br><br>Mr Tan said inefficient factories would be phased out under his plan, and added that this process was already taking place in Singapore.<br><br>He believes a services and knowledge economy will attract more Singaporeans to take up jobs.<br><br>"We should give the jobs to what the people want, and what they are trained and educated for, and they're happy to work in. Not force them into factories that they are not happy to work in."<br><br>Under his plan, S$10 billion will be given over five years to nurture young entrepreneurs, notably in the creative industries.<br><br>"Most of them will fail, but at least we give them a chance to be leaders of the industries of the future. We may have a future Facebook, future Google, future Baidu from Singapore," he said.<br><br>He also disagreed that the SDP's S$60 billion economic proposal amounted to a raid on reserves, saying it is an investment in Singapore's future.<br><br>Other areas for investment include education, healthcare and community support.<br><br>-CNA/ck/fa</span></span></p>
