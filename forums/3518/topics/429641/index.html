              <p>The PAP’s campaign for the 2011 election is a <strong>castastrophe right
              from the very beginning, plagued by incoherent messages to the voters,
              contradicting statements made by leaders</strong> and an outright dissociation
              from the reality on the ground amidst fast rising public disgruntlement
              at opprobrium.</p>
              <p>For the last one week, the PAP’s disjointed
              campaign was dominated by two former prime ministers instead of the
              incumbent. PAP ‘walkover’ MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC <strong>Lee Kuan Yew used
              his trade-mark ‘knuckle-duster’ style to intimidate Singaporeans from
              voting for the opposition</strong>, in particular residents of Aljunied GRC who
              were told to ‘repent for five years’ if they voted for WP. <strong>Then Goh
              Chok Tong, who had earlier promised not to comment on candidates from
              other constituencies shot his own foot by making disparaging remarks
              about his former subordinate</strong> and now SDP candidate for Holland-Bukit
              Timah Tan Jee Say.</p>
              <p>The PAP has adopted the same modus operandi it
              employed so successfully in previous elections by harping constantly on
              its ‘track record’, handing out goodies like ‘Grow and Share’ package
              to woo voters and using the state media to smear and fix the opposition.</p>
              <p><strong>It
              appeared to have panicked when it realized that the same old tactics
              aren’t working on Singaporeans</strong> anymore, especially the young who are
              widely read and have no affiliations to the PAP.</p>
              <p>The oft-repeated
              message of ‘good governance, political stability and economic growth’
              now sounds like a <strong>stale old record repeating itself</strong> to a wall
              especially when life is indeed getting tougher for ordinary
              Singaporeans facing increasing competition from the relentless influx
              of foreigners.</p>
              <p>The hundreds of dollars handed out to Singaporeans
              are too little to help them cope with the rampant inflation while the
              usua smear tactics which have worked so well in the past now backfired
              one by one in the age of Facebook and Youtube.</p>
              <p><strong>Like an
              over-confident student who did not bother to study hard for his exams
              only to realize in the last minute that the format of the papers have
              changed and doing last-minute revision now, the PAP is changing gear
              with only three days to go to salvage a disastrous campaign so far.</strong></p>
              <p>The
              format of this election has indeed changed, <strong>revolutionized by the new
              media which the PAP has failed to incorporate into it campaign.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>All
              of sudden, Lee Kuan Yew who had dominated the headlines for the last
              few days has all but disappeared from public view</strong> altogether with Goh
              Chok Tong whose infamous last words were – “The majority of
              Singaporeans are not concerned by the high ministerial pay.”</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PAP leaders suddenly remember to
              engage Singaporeans instead of talking down to them. <strong>George Yeo made a
              desperate appeal on a Facebook video to young Singaporeans to support
              the PAP, promising to “change and improve” when he said in 1995 that
              ordinary Singaporeans have no right to discuss about policies with the
              government.</strong></p>

              I ONCE SAW A CABBAGE N A LETTUCE AT A SUPERMARKET.
                                
                                THE CABBAGE WAS BIG N STABLE BUT SLIGHTLY EXPENSIVE.
                                
                                THE LETTUCE WAS SMALL BUT CHEAPER BY $1.
                                
                                BUT BY WEIGHING THEM I FOUND THEM TO BE ALMOST THE SAME SOMEWHAT?I WAS IN A DILEMIA AS I HAD ONLY STORAGE PLACE FOR 2 VEGETABLES.AND BOTH SEEM TO BE MORE OR LESS THE SAME.IN THE END I GORT 1 LETTUCE AND 1 CABBAGE.WHY&gt;?
                                
                                BECAUSE THE CABBAGE MIGHT NOT HAVE MUCH  TASTE ALTHOUGH ITS BIG AND THE LETTUCE MIGHT BE  TOO SMALL FOR MY LIKING ALTHOUGH BEING DELICIOUS TO ME.THATS WHY I CHOSE THE 2 OF THEM.
                                
                                ONCE I GOT HOME..I DUMPED BOTH OF THEM IN THE POT...AND THAT WAS THE BEST VEGETABLE MEAL I EVER HAD IN LIFE.

              <p>Too much complacency.. they don't realise today's opposition is not the same opposition of yesteryear. </p>
              <p>So they stuck to their tried and true tactics which turned out to be ineffective.  Upgrading is not so important when you are losing jobs or promotions or school places to foreigners.</p>
              <p>Disgust over the attempts at gutter politics.</p>
              <p>Some of the  most senior PAP political figures helped torpedo their own campaigns with their mindless utterances.  Thank god for them!</p>
              <p>Some inane ex-general talking about SE Asian civilisations in such a cocky, low EQ tone.  If he ever speaks like that in the private sector, he'll be out of a job in months.</p>
              <p>That young girl who couldn't think on her feet and responded badly to impromptu questions, and who towed the party line that cost of living and education is low.  Is she really the best in the land to qualify for political office in our country's highest body?</p>
              <p>A comedy of errors.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The opposition in the meantime were disciplined and stuck to their plan and kept their messages simple. </p>
              <p>They have fielded candidates which were credible; a world apart from the crackpots we used to see.  I think a lot of SIngaporeans including myself attended the opposition rallies because we wanted to see whether these guys had the quality to represent us, and many of us went away with the feeling that they can.</p>
              <p>And you cannot help but be inspired by people like Chiam See Tong and Low Thia Kiang, who are standing up for this to serve the people better and to improve democracy in our country.  Chaim See Tong especially - campaigning so hard even after he had a stroke - how many PAP ministers will do that?</p>

              <p>Any individual with Chen Show Mao's calibre and standing would easily command wages well in excess of a hopeless minister's. For someone with Chen's credentials, his wages (had he chosen to remain an active part of Davis Polk) would very well dwarf the President's.</p>
              <p>Do you really think Chen is even in this for the money? Let's be honest, SGD16k/month, while well above the median income in this part of the world, is a far cry from the world he left. And here you're talking about someone (nevermind his strong interpersonal skills) whose tangible credentials (be they education or professional ones) would put every single fascist to shame.</p>
              <p>As a matter of fact, to even compare credentials is an insult - to Chen.</p>

              <p>Knowing full well that the PM is not safe even in his own GRC, they came up with the idea of sacrificing Aljunied and Marine Parade GRC to the opposition parties by throwing all the attention on these 2 GRCs with their feet stomping candidates, below the belt antics and Academy Award winning performances.</p>

              <p><br>some still very happy they won. but this election we see what the results will be like when they really face tough oppositions. percentage over at Nicole's loss still look promising for someone who is vey new, and immature lightning candidiates like TPL is only going to cost taxpayerrs more money donw the drain. ask her to go one on one against nicole she will stand no chance. next leceltion if the boundaries are noit changed hippos really stand a chance to win more seats. but i am sure they will start shifting things here and there again.</p>

              <p>Comments by one person I found require attention.</p>
              <p>By SophiaRosieHart</p>
              <p>1. if Foreigners weren't in singapore singapore would have heaps of poor people or heaps of people in jail</p>
              <p>2. if we werent here singapore would of been run to the ground singapore cant live without Foreigners because they the ones who are bringing all the money in and they the ones who are building all your malls like if i wasn't here also mbs wouldn't be up and running like it is now</p>
              <p>3. singaporeans race is mostly chinese and malay mixed</p>
              <p>4.everyone is a Foreigner to singapore because singapore doesnt even have its own real race</p>
              <p>5.my own real race is maori and english<br>and mbs is the only good looking building in singapore but crap inside sadly hahahaha i got here to late when it started flooding because these dumb *****s dont know anything about building</p>
              <p>6.@Darn walk out on a job i get paid 30 grand a month for mate you must be joking,found a job like that in new zealand nope because they all taken and i would rather travel the world i've been to most of asia i must say singapore was the worse place i ever landed in and i cant wait in till i get to move</p>
              <p>7.and u see i already have another job lined up thats mine if i want it and most of the new zealanders here get moved around by the same company they dont keep them here because they know they dont like it just like my boss knows i hate singapore thats why next is Bangkok or Dubai or Aussie.<br>he probably worked his ass of an lied to get the job thats why he cant move anywhere because he sucks and no one wants him ouch that must hurt hahahahahahahahahaa like no one wants you</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I guess our Governement is not aware of all these. Keep talking about about "talent". The Government need to have a system to weed out such Foreigner.</p>
