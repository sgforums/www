              <p class="header"><span class="update"><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said this election is about voting for the party that can serve Singaporeans best.<br><br>In his first rally speech on Friday night in Ang Mo Kio constituency, PM Lee said the National Wages Council recommendations released on Friday for "higher total wages" for Singaporeans show that despite the last five tumultuous years, Singapore is doing well. <br><br>Mr Lee assured Singaporeans that the government will take care of all Singaporeans, including the low- and middle-income group.<br><br>He dealt squarely with the issues which the Opposition has picked on, such as the cost of living, and the affordability of housing.<br><br>"Everyone (is) feeling the pinch of the cost of living because energy prices go up, electricity prices go up and it's not cheap compared to last year, even more, compared to two or three years ago. <br><br>"We have a 'Grow &amp; Share' package this year to address these problems and to help Singaporeans. <br><br>"For example, to help with the utilities bills, we have more U-Save this year, we have more S&amp;CC rebates this year. <br><br>"In fact, the U-save for some households should be enough to pay for five months of utilities bills so if you are careful, it can go a long way.<br><br>Mr Lee promised that HDB flats will be kept affordable, especially for young couples. <br><br>But he also added the government needs to safeguard the value of current HDB flats and enhance them.<br><br>"The reality is, we will promise you that if you are buying a flat from the HDB, we will keep the prices affordable, because we building flats for Singaporeans and we want Singaporeans to be able to own that flat," Mr Lee said.<br><br>"And we will make sure Singaporeans can afford these flats."<br><br>Speaking at the same rally, PAP candidate for Ang Mo Kio GRC Inderjit Singh said residents should rate Members of Parliament (MPs) not just according to how well they speak in Parliament. <br><br>They should also focus on the work that gets done behind-the-scenes.<br><br>Mr Singh recalled how in the past he ensured every housing estate would have lift floor indicators.<br><br>He also asked PUB to provide every household with sandbags following the floods in July last year.<br><br>Mr Singh added that in future, Ang Mo Kio residents will also see a renovated park. <br><br>"We are upgrading Bishan Park. In a few months, you (will) have a new river in Singapore, the newest river running along Bishan Park. <br><br>"That is something that our residents in Ang Mo Kio will be enjoying. <br><br>"And do you know how much this is going to cost? It's going to cost S$1.2 billion in the next five years -- double of what we spent in the last five years. <br><br>"So the Ang Mo Kio team is committed to (making) Ang Mo Kio even better for all of our residents".<br><br>Separately, at a rally held near Kallang Ave, Minister for Environment and Water Resources Yaacob Ibrahim urged all Singaporeans to show their support for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's entire team in this election. <br><br>Dr Yaacob said given the PAP's track record, Singaporeans can trust Mr Lee's promise that the government is doing something to tackle the rising cost of living. <br><br>The PAP candidate for Moulmein-Kallang GRC also joined in the war of words over Workers' Party's driver analogy.<br><br>"........ And so we hear a party that's come to our GRC which only appeared on the 27th April," Dr Yaacob said. <br><br>"Before that, they were missing. We do not know who they were. But they want to be a co-driver. But they have been missing. <br><br>"So how can you be a co-driver if you're missing, right? <br><br>"So it's difficult for us to take these people seriously because they've not been around for the last five years to work the ground here and deliver services. <br><br>"They pop up (all) of (a) sudden like Minister Lui said the story of mushrooms and I'm confident they will disappear after the 7th (of) May."<br><br>"So we need to build that team, of a Prime Minister supported by a strong Cabinet behind, to make sure that we can work together. <br><br>"This is not about a co-driver, who sometimes can fall asleep and disappear for five years. <br><br>"This is about a team that can bring Singapore to the future. <br><br>"So let's work together, let's put the PAP back in government on the 8th of May, and not just Moulmein-Kallang, but the rest of Singapore. <br><br>"Because we want to show the rest of the world we know what we're talking about because this is about the future of Singapore.<br><br>"(This is a) team that the Prime Minister has assembled... a team that will bring Singapore into the uncertain future but with a safe pair of hands on the wheel, supported by a strong and dedicated, committed team to bring us into a bright future. That's our vision."<br><br>-CNA/wk </span></span></span></p>
