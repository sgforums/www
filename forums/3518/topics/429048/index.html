              <p>
              </p><p>I think in order for opposition to win PAP, they have to first explain to the people why it is okay for previous ministers not to be re-elected.  Unfortunately many Singaporeans have the wrong mindset that if previous ministers are not re-elect, then it would mean the end of Singapore.</p>
              <p>For example my friend is very scared that George Yeo would not be re-elected.  He said, "If George Yeo is not the foreign minister, then it will affect the existing relationship with other countries right?"  This is of course a misconception:</p>
              <p>1) Even if George Yeo is re-elected, he may not continue to the foreign minister</p>
              <p>2) The foreign minister in other countries changes all the time. Countries continue to have good relations with one another.  For example the US equivalent of foreign minister changed every time the president changed.</p>
              <p>3) Perhaps someone else would do an even better job than George Yeo!</p>
              <p>The same goes for other previous ministers as well.  Mah Bow Tan needed not be the next Minister for National Development.  Wong Kan Seng and Teo Chee Hean need not be the next DPM. Koh Boon Wan need not be the next Minister for Health. Ng Eng Hen need not be the next Education minister, etc.  Even if they are re-elected they may not go back to that previous post.  If you think further, perhaps you don't even want them to go back to that previous post.  For example some people would think Housing and Education are pretty messed up by now, perhaps it would be better for someone else to be the minister.</p>
              <p>Most importantly the opposition should explain to the people that the previous prime minister (i.e. Lee Hsien Loong) need not be re-elected.  If he is not re-elected, someone else from PAP who is elected, will be the next prime minister.  Life goes on. Decisions were not unilaterally from Lee Hsien Loong anyway, but collectively from PAP.  Therefore nothing will change.  For those who are really scared if the "Lee" family is not in charge, be assured that Lee Kuan Yew is still elected.  He would be the "Lee" family representation that you want.  Therefore it is fine for Lee Hsien Loong not to be elected.  Thinking on the brighter side, perhaps this would be good opportunity for PAP to move beyond the "Lee" family era.</p>
              <p>I think this explanation and reassurance, that previous ministers need not be re-elected, is very important.  An excellent explanation and reassurance will go a long way to encourage voters to truly vote for what they want, and not vote from their misconception about the need to re-elect previous ministers.</p>

              <p>Talking about foreign minister, he is the middle man. He goes out and meet others ministers. And bring in biz and jobs opportunities. He is a very important man.</p>
              <p>If he lost, who will be taking over? Maybe pap will have others to take over his position if he lost in the GE.</p>

              <p>But when all his diplomats made disparaging remarks exposed by wikileaks, he didn't make any statement of regret to soothe anyone's offense. We are a global city of many nationalities who would be rightly offended. Neither did he take responsibility saying it's "coffeeshop talk and gossip".</p>
              <p>And he wasn't very discreet when he said "christians are less likely to riot".</p>
              <p>I believe he didn't handle the water issue well. There were alot of big egos involved but he never found a mutually beneficial solution like to the railway land.</p>

              <p><br>it's not ego</p>
              <p>Back then 50% of our water had to come from M'sia. Furthermore seriously what the British (the details) signed secured water for us, which Dr M was obviously not happy.</p>
              <p>With that, things like railway land &amp; CPF we can afford to put it aside.</p>

              <p>Still Malaysia did have a point that the Govt makes huge profits from the resale of water to us users. The Govt must cover distribution, storage and treatment costs but on top of the increased rate, it slaps a water conservation tariff.</p>
              <p>I don't think Malaysia satisfies the demand or variety for our food. In any case they don't produce food cheaply anymore, Western grain has always been cheapest and most efficiently produced.

              <p>Malaysia is a vital friend, supplier and neighbour. And despite the surface differences we still have better relations with them than any regional state. George Yeo should take the same attitude he takes to further away countries to the Malaysians, then their less civic minded politicians will have less ammo to shoot us.

              <p>Water conservation tarrif is a necessary evil. You would be surprised M'sian politicians are calling for them to follow us impose a tax. Because at e rate it's going, M'sia will face water shortage thks to their water usage</p>

              <p>If they are ministers I think they should be first to be voted out since their pay is the highest in the world yet performance is so poor since 2006.</p>
              <p>The core of these ministries lies in the civil service and the high ranking civil servants.</p>
              <p>Some highly paid PAP ministers voted out is nothing, the entire civil service bureaucracy is still intact.</p>

At the beginning, it was the right thing for us to attract multinationals to Singapore. For some years now, I’ve been trying to tell everybody: ‘Look, for God’s sake, grow our own timber.’</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">If we really want knowledge to be rooted in Singaporeans and based in Singapore, we have to support our SMEs. I’m not a supporter of SMEs just for the sake of more SMEs, but we must grow our own roots.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;">Creative Technology’s Sim Wong Hoo is one and Hyflux’s Olivia Lum is another but that’s too few. We have been flying on auto-pilot for too long. The MNCs have contributed a lot to Singapore but they are totally unsentimental people. The moment you’re uncompetitive, they just relocate.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; color: #333333; padding: 0px;"><strong style="font-style: normal; font-weight: bold;">Q. Why has this come about?</strong></p>

Some civil servants behave like they have a mandate from the emperor. We think we are little Lee Kuan Yews</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;">.</span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #333333;"> SM Lee hasearned his spurs, with his fine intellect and international standing. But even Lee Kuan Yew sometimes doesn’t behave like Lee Kuan Yew. </span><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">There is also a trend of intellectualisation for its own sake, which loses a sense of the pragmatic concerns of the larger world.</span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;"><span style="color: #333333;">The Chinese, for example, keep good archives of the Imperial examinations which used to be held at the Temple of Heaven. At the beginning, the scholars were tested on very practical subjects, such as how to control floods in their province. But over time, they were examined on the Confucian Analects and Chinese poetry composition. Hence, they became emasculated by the system, a worrying fate which could befall Singapore.</span></p>

              <p>The way things are going now, all the PAP ministers are just taking things for granted.</p>
              <p>All of them must be voted out on May 7.</p>
              <p>That is the only way to refresh up the ministries and force them to think and work.</p>
              <p>If the ministers are not changed, there won't be a change in HDB high prices, there won't be change in aliens flooding Singapore, the cost of living, regressive taxes like GST will all be going up.</p>
              <p>Old ministers will implement old ideas, old policies.</p>
              <p>You have to bring in fresh faces to have change.</p>
              <p>Vote for change.</p>
              <p>Vote PAP out.</p>
              <p>Don't buy into PAP's rubbish about ministers.</p>
              <p>Vote all of them out on May 7.</p>
