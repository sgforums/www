              <p>1) No respect for orderliness and proper administration</p>
              <p>Desmond allowed 30 members barged into room without proper 
              administration “Go in go in don’t need to register”. a …SPP cadre and I 
              stopped the crowd and like a mad man he shouted and insisted his way 
              through.</p>
              <p>2) Inappropriate behavior of a Sect Gen</p>
              <p>first thing right up to my face “Alex Tan your no longer a member of SPP because your application was not approved on 6 of May”</p>
              <p>(my application form is under his care all along. now it’s gone? and 
              i’m not with SPP? no worries I will stay with Chiam side as a non-member
               supporter volunteer as an adviser.)</p>
              <p>the room was a rowdy drama for the first 1 hour with Desmond’s 
              “members” and I can tell many of them are clueless at what’s going on. 
              are they members? SPP needs volunteers every Thursday to help out at 
              Meet-the-People session so badly and now popped out so many members?</p>
              <p>2 “cadre” members voted into SPP CEC, bryan chua bingsheng and Sydney
               soon. both just joined this year and yet they are “cadre”? just because
               Desmond insisted so? does Democracy means disregard of proper 
              procedures?</p>
              <p>Desmond’s men was so rude in the room. taunting Mrs Chiam, shouting 
              words like “you are old and slow”? like wth? is this a circus?</p>
              <p>I was giving my ending speech to the conference and Desmond can shout all the way from his seat “this is not a member!”</p>
              <p>let me share this scenario I saw personally with my own eyes. at the 
              end of the conference, chiam asked Desmond for the 5 new “cadre” 
              members’ hp number and address. Desmond waved him off and rushed the 5 
              out of the room.<br> what arrogance?! I pity the old man. I would have slapped Desmond if I am Mr Chiam.</p>
              <p>a sect gen of the Democratic Alliance with no regards for civilized 
              and democratic orderliness. SPP will be in ruins if it has a leader like
               this. Singapore will be in ruins if it has a MP like this.</p>
              <p> </p>
