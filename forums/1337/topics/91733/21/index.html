            <div class='col-md body'>good evening to all... have fun in Sound of Music.<br><br>Here's my blog for the day:<br><br>0900 : Woke up... and realised I had to pay for my defensive riding fees by today or i will kena screwed by my encik.<br><br>0930 : BBDC calls up "PAY UP U #!@#!@($*!(@*$", at least that's what i heard. I went online, left a message for my lau po~ in msn. Stayed around in sgForums to crap, then got changed into my coveralls. Working the 1400 shift... only 1100 now.<br><br>1120 : reached my bike, got the forms all ready... gotta reach base by 1200, before S1 goes for lunch!<br><br>1150 : Had an uneventful trip... found S1 and handed her blank forms to sign "Want me to sign blank cheque ah????", "Sorry la... i'm going back to squadron to get the particulars, sign first leh...", job done.<br><br>1230 : After getting the particulars and forging a signature, i got the forms and tried... TRIED to find my way to BBDC. I knew how to go from HOME, but not from work!<br><br>1310 : After going from Bukit Panjang, to CCK, i finally found my way to BBDC. Joined the queue, paid up... admin, SETTLED.<br><br>1400 : Stupid rain... started on the way back to base... took out my raincoat, got a free massage on my knuckles. Went to the McDonalds' just outside my camp entrance and ordered a McSpicy Double Meal... and 9 piece nuggets. It was still bloody raining, and my socks were totally soaked. Soggy feet the whole day through.<br><br>1400 - 2045 : Still raining, assigned to marshal an aircraft... In the end, flight cancelled, WOOHOO~ waited for rain to stop and was assigned to another aircraft to do A/F (After Flight) servicing.<br><br>Auditors roaming around, must be on the ball, and to be on the ball, all our work processes have gone wayyyyy too slow. Worked on an aircraft with a junior, taught alot of things, trying to make him understand things logically. The easiest way to learn, is to understand... he was memorising alot, no good at all.<br><br>Aircraft was towed back to the other Dispersal Site, no more auditors, working speed picks up. Had to remove a rescue hoist and put it on another aircraft, chop chop, finished quick. Settled paperwork, wrote till i had cramps coming up on my hand!<br><br>*Ding Dong* "All personnel come to Line Office", sweetest thing you can hear everyday. Flight program up for tomorrow, timing to report, 0800...<br><br>2110-Now : Reached home, chatted with my lau po~ now writing this... I AM SO ENG. But gotta sleep soon, waking up at 0700  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
