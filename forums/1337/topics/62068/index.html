Someone recently gave me a free 20 min lesson and pointed out to me that I'm using alot of my throat. That 20 mins taught me plenty. She mentioned every part of your face and chest should be used for voice projection. Her instruction helped me to sound louder without have me to raise my vioce to sound louder. I paisei to continue because it was free. She's 60 yrs old but still sing like a nightingale.<br><br>Another teacher whom I train under        taught me to free up my voice for higher notes. She was the one who informed me of possible damage to voice if I strain it further. Damage vocal chorfd are called nodules. Many ppl who sings karaoke encountered this problem in Japan and must go thru operation. After that of course cannot sing already. Teachers in singapore often face the same problem.<br><br>Little house of horror was a movie musical made into a broadway musical or the other way around....I can't really remember. Good funny lyrics but the main female lead sang in a funny way which I cannot comprehend....very straineous to the vocal chords.</div>

Someone recently gave me a free 20 min lesson and pointed out to me that I'm using alot of my throat. That 20 mins taught me plenty. She mentioned every part of your face and chest should be used for voice projection. Her instruction helped me to sound louder without have me to raise my vioce to sound louder. I paisei to continue because it was free. She's 60 yrs old but still sing like a nightingale.<br><br>Another teacher whom I train under        taught me to free up my voice for higher notes. She was the one who informed me of possible damage to voice if I strain it further. Damage vocal chorfd are called nodules. Many ppl who sings karaoke encountered this problem in Japan and must go thru operation. After that of course cannot sing already. Teachers in singapore often face the same problem.<br><br>Little house of horror was a movie musical made into a broadway musical or the other way around....I can't really remember. Good funny lyrics but the main female lead sang in a funny way which I cannot comprehend....very straineous to the vocal chords.</div></blockquote>Hey you know what? The fella who posted in the forum "Singing Music in Singapore" here in SgForums mentioned it's only a myth that singing must use diaphragm... so which is the right one..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is tru that singing should not and need not be concentrated on the diaphram all the time.  Using your throat, using ur nasal, projecting ur voice thru ur nose, thru ur forehead can produce different kind of voicing which may be suitable at certain parts of a song.  If you sing a 5 minute song using ur diaphram all thru out, you will just tire urself out...well you can if you are damn trained in ur diaphram strength but that to me is unnecessary waste of strength esp when in a showmanship-heavy performances for a band.</div>

This techincal study ensure that you are using the right voice mechanism and not hurting the vocal cords in the process. This study is almost standard; the training methods are almost empirical in the intital stages.<br><br>2) Artisitic - This is when alot of people mix it up with techincal. Only when you can get the right and easy voice, then you can start modelling it into the way you want it to be. It can be round and big classical voice, tough rough rocker voice, or it can be a mutable pop voice. Different instructors will also have their favourite 'vocal effects', hence you'll be able to pick up different styles from different instructors. This is also the part when alot of differences arise. The debate whether you should use head or chest voice, inhale silently or with sound...... It's a matter of preference.</div>

You know....you cannot really work for a vocal school and start taking private vocal students yourself, regardless where you get to know them. It's direct conflict of interest; no big deal, but at least for the moment, I can't bring myself to do it.<br><br>Anyway, unless you have non-objective neighbours, then it's quite difficult to have singing class at home. For the student, it can feel quite weird too, to make weird vocal sounds(part of lessons) in your own or someone else home. I do think learning in a studio, or in my case, a school, adds a bit of seriousness into the subject.<br><br>But hey, thanks for even having that thought.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
