            <div class='col-md body'>The Earache label in the late '80's and early '90's consolidated the worldwide Death/Grindcore Metal movement into one cohesive whole for a stream of 99 totally classic records reaching its peak with Bolt Thrower's IV Crusade, Carcass' Necroticism, Entombed's Clandestine and Cathedral's Ethereal Mirror (all released 1991-93 with 1992 being an especially fine year) until devolving into a morass of faceless releases of mediocre-to-bad hardcore, "industrial" and "techno." The grand announcement (in early 1997) that Earache had just signed the band led by Prodigy's GUITAR player is just about the final nail in this once mighty label's coffin. Regardless of your feelings about Death Metal (or Metal for that matter), flagship Napalm Death alone through it's branching out into Godflesh, Carcass, Cathedral, and Scorn have exerted an inmeasurable amount of influence in the world of powerful and extreme loud musics of all genres<br><br>Earache Records always had the coolest logo- spiky and vaguely hardcore-ish like an over-xeroxed photograph, yet streamlined in a superstar Metal way, it holds all these releases together as a symbol of goofball extremity and pseudo-satanic biker tatoo dread. Emerging out of the "crossover" phase of hardcore punk, when the long-hair fury and velocity of speed metal started to seem most attractive to scuzzy punk bands, Earache's first batch of releases set up the Napalm Death dynasty and its first diversion into Unseen Terror and Carcass. Morbid Angel comes in soon after with its trend-setting Altars of Madness album as Earache starts scouring the globe for extreme stupidity of all types, and lands in Tampa Florida's Morrisound studios, the vatican of moronic metal. Next stop is Sweden, as Entombed's Left Hand Path sounds the opening shot of the Scandinavian metal onslaught that still hasn't abated. Add the mighty Bolt Thrower to the mix and the lineup is untouchable. In the early nineties no one was louder, faster or dumber than Earache's roster. Besides, their CD's usually have the lyrics printed, and even if you take Carcass out, Earache's lyrics can't be topped for creative language mangling and confusion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOSH 6 Carcass Reek Of Putrefaction (198<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Masterful debut from Bill Steer's post Napalm group. It's interesting to note how dissatisfied they are (and were even back then) with the recording of this. The most recent reissue CD's credits say "Initially recorded and ruined by Mike 'it up wrongly' Ivory." Carcass always seemed extremely proud of their appeal to the non-Metal crowd-yet they slowly devolved into a fist-pumping straight metal band (with vomit vocals) churning out recycled Thin Lizzy and U.F.O. riffs. Did it ever occur to them that the muddy blur of sound on their first album is what the non-metal crowd found most appealing? The NWOBHM/Venom metal riffs are already here in the intros to just about every song, but those retching demon vocals drown any sense of metal musicality you might hope for as each song melts into massive hairballs of distortion. The death metal crowd loved them, though, especially as they grew more "technical," even gaining support from the mainstream metal press with Heartwork and staying on the good side of the underground crowd that accused Entombed of selling out with Wolverine Blues. Their gore-worshipping artwork (too gruesome to reissue on CD as it first appeared on the LP) and their extended incomprehensible song titles/lyrics have influenced many in the death metal, grindcore, industrial and noise world. Here's a sample of their lyrical skills:<br>Parasitic carnivorous carrion, your gastrointestinal tract, your prey's cremator<br>Bloody neo-cannibalistic, bloodfeed masticator<br>Rigor sanguined fleshfeast, gourging on festered entrails and warm meat<br>Devouring cold offal, necro-sentient mortis feed<br>Or how about:<br><br>Mucopurulent organs digested in sepsis<br>Mucolysifying, rancidifying as you eat your own cysts<br>Putrefying your pyorrhoea - infested corpse excretes away<br>Expelling pyuria and septic goitrous membrane<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>MOSH 11 Morbid Angel Altars Of Madness (1989)<br>Looking like they got lost on the way to a Monsters of Rock Halloween party these satanic clowns never made a better album than this. Quite possibly the best to come out of Morrisound (along with Monstrosity's Imperial Doom on Nuclear Blast) this creepy excursion into the minds of barely grown men grasping onto their pre-adolescence is a masterpiece of spastic metal. Their cod-piece collection might have gotten more interesting over the years but their music hasn't. Put this up against Merzbow's (roughly contemporaneous) Batz-Tou-tai and see which clears the room fastest. I've always disliked the drum sounds on Morrisound's product but Pete Sandoval, one of the many competing "fastest drummer in the world" title-holders, surmounts weak sonics with sheer insane speed. Fine detailed color cover artwork by Dan Seagrave, whose artwork would also grace Entombed and Nocturnus and many other Earache releases. Dan's style can best be compared to the sort of naive demon warrior pencil drawings you used to find on the margins of high school text books. Except Dan has the patience to fill a large area of his drawings with fine intricate anal retentive detail. This album also adds to the Earache roster another Grindcore trademark- apparently sincere non-ironic satanism. Lyrical highlights include incantation of demons in an alien Lovecraftian tongue, and much Christian-bashing. "Killer."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">MOSH 12 Grindcrusher Compilation (1989)<br>A genre-defining compilation. All the Earache luminaries are here plus assorted related bands. Unlike most of the Earche LP's of this era (especially MOSH 11 and 13) the artwork on this does not scream "metal" in any way- mostly it makes me think of Big Black's big font fetish (the Racer X EP especially) but with a more dayglo palette. Without the dungeons and demons imagery this release more than any other introduces "grindcore" as a genre onto itself, beyond Metal, beyond Hardcore, beyond Industrial, beyond music- completely alien, drug-fueled, mechanical, brutal and uncompromising, a true sound for its age. If you can only buy one Earache album...</span><br><br>the very best compil....dunno where mine went,not sure if a friend nicked it or i lost it..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOSH 15 Godflesh Streetcleaner (1989)<br>Barfing vocals appear on this second album from Justin Broadrick's group, and no one did them better than Godflesh. Drum machines in a metal context work best when they are slowed down- and some of the rhythms here are unbelievably sludgy and claustrophobic. Nothing compares except Swans' Cop LP- but they had a real drummer that slightly humanized and warmed (so to speak) their sound. Everything you could hope for in a mechanized death metal noise-rock fusion can be found on this release. Could have been culled down to half the album's length, for a total masterpiece of gloomy icy atmosphere. As it is, it's just exhausting and more than a little boring after repeated listens. Inspired countless imitators (Earache even signed one of them- Pitchshifter) who just don't measure up to the nasty inhuman vibe of this and scattered parts of Godflesh's successive career.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>MOSH 79 Sleep Sleep's Holy Mountain (1992)<br>Stoner Slo-Core slackers overselling themselves to the Sabbath crowd by aping just about every Iommi riff they could manage to remember through that reefer haze that clouds their brains. More metallic than the smart-guy conceptual Melvins/Swans hybrid of their debut (not on Earache) this is one of the better one-shot Earache releases. Their conceptual edge remains in their deja vu-inducing note-by-note appropriation of Sabbath riffs and melodies. That punk/whatever ironic edge is the only thing that separates them from similarly conceived Ozzy worshipping "Doom" acts on the Hellhound label. But unlike many of those acts, this is actually pretty listenable and competently produced and recorded, with the guitar sounding especially tasty.<br><br></div>
