            <div class='col-md body'>hey i find an article on jaycn.com....i dunno why people said david are arrogant but how come no one said jay is arrogant..have u mistaken what u see ??david never ever mention that he is 100marks and no need to improve.<br><br>Source: Jaycn.com<br><br>Speak about Music, Jay feel proud and confident on himself, almost reach the level of overwhelming. He felt that his music already reached 100% and for now, theres no need to improve on anything yet. Although Jay's comment are quite stand out among, but he highlighted that HE HAD NEVER EVER CHANGE SINCE HIS FIRST DAY INTO MUSIC INDUSTRIES, and NEVER ACT LIKE VIPS.<br><br>Jay admit that he is [guilty], the stories are, his mum Ye Hui Mei, always told him had to be ÂŒÂªÂ”Ãš ( means had to be low profile ), especially on music. Jay feel guilty over what his mum had told him cuz he sometime never follow what his mum told him, especially his own point of view into music. He had his own thinking, IN MUSIC, HAD TO BE NO.1. But being pointed out like to Act like VIP's, Jay fight back and said :" SOme said i had infected by " BIG HEAD DISEASE"( means like very like to act as he is so popular ) , said that i am not who i am when i was new, I DON't THINK SO! I had never changed, is those who look at me, their point of view had changed, when i was new in the industries, no one Notice me, and now when they starts to notice who i am, i had never changed."<br><br>Jay added said when he was newbies, he scared that people will think he is too proud of himself, and purposely said that his music are inspired by Jacky Chueng. He said" In composing music, i had never depends on anyone, all by myself, piece by piece seaching, this is why i had proud of myself on music and feel like guilty toward his mum's advice to be low profile.<br><br>What's surprises are, Jay said that He don't need anymore improve from his own music! His idea and Point of view are, until now, he had done what he think was ok, but it doesn;t meant that HE will not improve anymore. He said:" i think until now , my music are considered 100 marks, and will maintain what it is now, don't need to rush to get 105 points. Jay had his own ways on defining himself on the views. He admit that in discussing Music, he will sure feel proud, but when attending show that targeted families, he will choose to be more low profile attitude.<br><br></div>
