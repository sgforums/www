            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>Today I went to school and saw this girl with boyish good looks making a phone call outside the library. She just reminded me of another guy whom I sometimes bump into on the bus. And so as I was walking, I was thinking where he'd disappeared to cos I hadn't seen him ever since the prelim exams.<br><br>As I was thinking... walking... thinking... walking... poof! There he was, seated in front of a computer. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You know, when I didn't see him for so long, I kinda missed this little piece of eye-candy. Ah bleurgh I'll never forget the day he caught me staring at him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>But... his lack of self-grooming simply turns me off. If he were more concerned with his own appearance, rather than standing sloppily and making a big effort to sleep each time he got on the bus and having messy hair and wearing dingy clothes, I'd gone up to him and introduced myself.<br><br>Whennnnn oh whennn will my Prince Charming come!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>For a moment, I thought all was gone. I thought I should give up on my 'A' levels. I thought I shouldn't come for anymore papers.<br><br>Today is Day One, the first day of the Big As. This morning, I had a Mathematics paper and an excruciating Economics 3-essay paper in the afternoon.<br><br>The Mathematics paper.. already minused so many marks. I don't know why, suddenly I totally forgot how to do all those. I felt so useless this morning. I should know how to do all those! I'd been doing them for years! It's ridiculous for me not to be able to do the questions. I felt so stupid.<br><br>I really thought there wasn't anymore hope. I'd pinned all my hopes on Math paper 1, since it was all on pure math, while Paper 2, with statistics and all.. I could never excel at that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I was feeling pretty hopeless for the afternoon paper too.. There was so much more I should study. But then I remembered, in the morning, a classmate whom I wasn't exactly close to, she came up to me and told me "Don't give up okay? Hang in there."<br><br>There are people who have put their hopes on me.. My seniors, my tutors, my friends..<br><br>So I went ahead after the Math paper... into the library and concentrated on preparations for the next paper.<br><br>I had only prepared half of all that we were supposed to study. I couldn't care anymore. I believed it was better if I continued to focus on what I'd prepared.<br><br>And so, as I sat down in front of the exam paper in the afternoon, I prayed so hard for the questions to be on what I'd studied.<br><br>Thank God. They ALL came out! The 3 chapters I had really really studied for! And so I went ahead, planning my essay before putting it into actual words...<br><br>I didn't manage to finish the paper. But I have really tried my best. Really. Maybe. But I really did all I could do... But I think my essays were badly written.. I lacked practice under such conditions. And I wrote too slowly.<br><br>But all is not lost.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I still have a chance to score at least a C if I do well in my MCQ, data response and case study. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Tomorrow's GP... I can do it! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>Finally, after 18 years of life on Earth, I can say proudly: <strong>I have a dream.</strong><br><br>I used to be terribly fickle-minded about what I wanted to do when I stepped into the working society.<br><br>Doctor, nurse, politician, lawyer, stockbroker...<br><br>They kept changing. Until I began to distrust myself. Whenever I thought of something I would become, the thought that it would soon go away would come to my mind. And it really did.<br><br>When I recently felt that I should pursue a career in music, I was worried it would go away again. But as the days go by, I'm becoming more certain of the path I should take.<br><br>I want to teach. I want to teach the world music. I want to spread music around, because I think it's one of the most beautiful things mankind has. And I believe music is not just for pleasure, but has its other purposes too.<br><br>I've always wanted to learn music, but I regret not insisting on it when I was young. Now I know I must not let the regret continue...<br><br>The path that lies ahead of me is full of uncertainties. It's covered by thick bushes and a forest of trees. I really don't know what is to come. I don't know how long it will be before I will succeed. I don't know what price I have to pay.<br><br>I'm scared, but I know I have do it.</div>

I'm back to square one again, armed only with an 'O'-level cert and torn between a mass comm diploma and a graphic designing diploma... or...<br><br>I'm not sure if I should pursue a polytechnic education while pursuing my dream in music.. It will not be possible for me to achieve a Grade 8 in a short period of 2-3 years due to the exam regulations.. So I estimate that it will take me at least 4 years to get to La-Salle for my diploma in Music.<br><br>Or should I retake my 'A'-levels if it's allowed, and head for NIE and become a teacher in Music?<br><br>I don't know.. really don't know.<br><br>Last paper on the 27th.. Think maybe I should do a couple of essays and try to save my Literature.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Mixed feelings.. argh I don't know what I'm saying anymore.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, just to offer some experience for reference and inspiration<br><br>I'm a full-time vocal instructor now with a establish school in Singapore. I wouldn't say I spent alot of time before earning my music qualifications, most of them are half-past 7 types.<br><br>Neither did I spent alot of time in my studies, but I manage to scratch through all these years from primary to uni.<br><br>You will have to cherish the times of being a student; it;s when you are officially free to do the things you want, provided you give a reasonable academic report. I never regret studying a totally irrelevant course in NUS to what I'm doing now. Many people don't understand; it's during then I dabble alot in music creation, performances, and even performing arts management. One thing in mind, I was determined to work in the music scene and I fully utlised my time to juggle between study and music-related work(ok, I might even say less on studies).<br><br>Yes, you do need a bit of right connections, so start looking now! Be it contemporary or classical, there are people who can give you the head-start.<br><br>Because of my experience in various faculties, including the performing art itself, management, education and administration, I immediately got my first job after exams as operation manager of school. Currently, I've shifted to full-time teaching cum HOD.<br><br>Ok enough of my life-story. I just hope it's inspiring enough for you. You don't need a big miracle. I was an average Singapore student under the stiff primary--&gt;secondary--&gt;JC--&gt;NS--&gt;NUS education system. But you can make it.<br><br>Just remember my signature; FOCUS.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
