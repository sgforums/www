The two friends mentioned above.. aren't the only two who don't reply at times. Sometimes, when SMSes are sent to some people, they don't reply at all! Like say, it's a question: What time does class start tomorrow? And if the receiver doesn't know the answer, he'll just ignore it.

Furthermore, I lack the capital.<br><br>I cannot see my future ahead of me. It's all bleak...<br><br>If I were to pursue my dream, ultimately, will I be happy? Given all the sacrifices I have to make, and all the hardships I will have to go through, without seeing a sign to tell me I've come to a certain stage, will I be happy?<br><br>It's a long, long journey... I'm going to take it alone. Who will care, other than myself?<br><br>Suddenly I think my life has no meaning.. for myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Ah....dreams dreams....ambitions ambitions....I have them too.  I guess to be happy, one has to learn how to be contented.  I think I have learnt to be contented.  I am a musician and sing in a band. We dream of making it big one day. I am now working as a sales executive doing client servicing. I like that because Marketing is the only thing i like during my studies. But i shared with my boss on the first day when she asked for our dreams, i said the only thing that will draw me away from working here is when a record company offers us a chance to record albums or i have a chance to tour with the band.  Big dreams? Impossible? Well maybe. But that does not stop me from being chasing after it cos I still practice with my band and hope one day someone spots us. But then I am contented to be here right now because I know whats most important to me is still with me and that is God and my family. If i cant fulfil my dreams, so be it but i sure would want to! I know I will be happy cos I am contented. Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>Funny how it seems, one thing/person can mean the world to a person, but the person means nothing to that thing/person.<br><br>To each and every human being, the Earth is our world and we cannot do without it... but to the Earth, a single human being is a mere speck of dust on its lands.<br><br>To a dying plant, a drop of water is a ray of hope, a chance at life again... but to the drop of water... I don't know.<br><br>To the person who means the world to me, I doubt I even take up a space the size of a cell in his heart.<br><br>I have... been waiting for 4 years.<br><br>Maybe I'm just deluding myself. Maybe he doesn't mean that much to me. Maybe I thought he did because... he came as a light in my darkest moments. Maybe, maybe if I looked harder, I'll find someone to replace him?<br><br>I am tired tired tired. I don't want to think about him anymore but he just keeps appearing in my dreams and I can't control that. I thought I had let go of everything finally, after I kept away all that stuff - the photos, the present, and.... and the wallet I had been using for 4 years... but I was wrong.<br><br>I feel stupid, to wait for so many years for someone who doesn't remember, or doesn't want to remember.. or talk to... It's like waiting for a new planet we can all live on... It's a long wait that's futile in the short period of my life span...<br><br>I need help... thoughts of him just blind me to a way out, to a new beginning to something, but the help must come from myself...
