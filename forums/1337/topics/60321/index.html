            <div class='col-md body'>*sniff sniff* Don't know why today just feel so depressed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I'm so stressed, every minute I'm thinking of the 'A' levels.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Last night, I messaged two friends to ask a question on a particular subject. Till now they haven't replied yet. Hello, please don't tell me "oh, I switched off my phone for the past few days because I've been studying!" Like the two of you will... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Luckily I changed my mind after SMS-ing them and called somebody instead. Phew.<br><br>When people get stressed, as in, in such a situation when the 'A's are coming, is it normally like this? I felt so hurt, like they don't care, or they care more about themselves [I have to study, no time to bother about your question.]? Or at least if you don't know the answer to my question, reply since it was clearly directed at YOU with your name. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>That brings us to the question of SMS etiquette. The two friends mentioned above.. aren't the only two who don't reply at times. Sometimes, when SMSes are sent to some people, they don't reply at all! Like say, it's a question: What time does class start tomorrow? And if the receiver doesn't know the answer, he'll just ignore it. Alright who's guilty of that?! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> I think we should just reply lah ok. Imagine the sender waiting and waiting... in vain.<br><br>Sigh.</div>

Maybe I won't attend university. I think I'll learn piano and get myself a diploma in it, and then head for a school where I can get my degree in music. Career opportunities? Work in arts organizations, piano teacher, lecturer if I manage to get my degreeS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Somebody told me "It's better to do music if you're really interested in it, rather than spend time doing something I don't like, and wasting precious time by not faring well."<br><br>I'm not sure if it's the right decision, but it may be time for me to be firm and make my choice in life. I've never dared to venture out into the wild, and I really feel like trying now.<br><br>I figured if it doesn't work out in the end, I can always study and get a diploma... and then a degree.. working from bottom to top.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Dairy,<br><br>School was productive today, given that I managed to finish up 3 case studies with 10 minutes' worth of help from my tutor. But seeing the progress of my classmates, I realized I am lagging behind alot.<br><br>I know I know I should work alot harder. I've tried too. But, I don't know. It doesn't work. Sometimes I'm motivated to.. but most of the time not. Why? Is it because I lack a fixed direction in life? I remember back in primary school, there was a year I told myself after seeing friends collect prizes at the prize-giving ceremony, that the next year I must be one of those people. And I did manage to come in 2nd in standard for Chinese that next year. But whyyy. I am still as competitive as ever, but where has my motivation and determination gone?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I know I'm not going to make it this time for the 'A's. It's not being pessimistic but rather realistic. And I know I deserve it too. Right now I don't wish for anything else, but only not to freak out during the exams and run away from it. I guess maybe one of the most important things to me now is to learn self-control - how to keep my cool during stressful situations and work my way out of it.<br><br>Today I came home from school, hoping to see the topic I started this morning, on kindness, filled with nice replies. Or just many many views. To my horror, none were relevant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Doesn't anyone care anymore?<br><br>Why is it that the people I put my faith in always seem to let me down? Where have I gone wrong? What's wrong with me? And what's wrong with the world?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Diary,<br><br>[yes bismarck I am in danger...]<br><br>It's one day away from the 'A' levels.<br><br>I'm having mixed feelings.<br><br>I'm very afraid.<br><br>Afraid of failing, afraid of getting panic attacks again.<br><br>I didn't use to be afraid of failing, because I had a backup plan. In fact, I didn't want to attend university.<br><br>But I haven't received a reply from ABRSM, telling me that I CAN take 2 exams in a year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Life is so uncertain for me now.<br><br>If I can't take 2 exams in a year, I'm going to spend 7 years pursuing a diploma in Music, when my friends are going to spend 3 or so years pursuing their degree.<br><br>I'm quite prepared to flunk the 'A's. But the most important thing right now is not to let stress overcome me at the last moment. If I can never learn how to maintain my composure during stressful situations, I'll never be able to succeed!<br><br>But.. but if I flunk my examination, I don't know.<br><br>I don't know whether to blame myself for the state I'm in now.<br><br>I always think that why I am what I am today is because my parents never bothered, never cared about what I'd been doing. Achievements were left unnoticed. That's alright. But they didn't even stop to think about the poor grades I'd been getting since secondary school, until my mom was called to the college a few months back.<br><br>But nothing has changed ever since the visit. She told me she'd change. She told me she'd stop grumbling to me about everything and start to show me more concern. But she didn't. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Like today, I merely asked her to buy some ginseng so that I can bring them to school on days when I have papers in the afternoon, she merely told me to bring SOMETHING ELSE. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> I'm not picking on the fact that she gives all her attention to my elder brother when he needs it. But even without the brother around, she doesn't care about me enough. Hello, this is my 'A' levels. Even though I have made it clear about pursuing a career in music, it doesn't mean I DON'T CARE. She can't even show the least bit of concern by preparing meals more often at home.<br><br>I've been kinda inclined to think towards the lack of care/concern from the people around me. You know, it's like when you keep doing something, and even when you excel in it, and nobody cares, eventually you'll grow tired of it. One cannot live in a vacuum.<br><br>But when I look at those successful people with family backgrounds worse off than mine.. I think I should be put to blame. For not being strong enough. For not being determined enough. For not being focused enough.<br><br>So, the 'A's are on Monday.. Sigh!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
