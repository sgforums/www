            <div class='col-md body'>hmm..why jay is popular than david? u ask this question very hard to answer.  I have to say because main reason because media promote jay more than david. and i don't like jay but i try not to talk bad about him like what some jay's fans like to talk bad about david. i will tolerate not to quarrel with them.  well, although david is not very popular but we know he make good music and concern his fans, that's enough.<br><br>if i can i will try all my way to promote david like create thread in forum i know to let some people don't know david to know him to spread his love and music.  i think every fans should do it like talk about him in david's website you know to raise his popularity since the media don't want to do so. so we fans has to do our part. is that ok? all david's fans united together.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>david's 2nd message in davidcn!! i never see an artiste so sincere in writing his message because i never see an artiste writing his messages for so long!! all of you here please take your time reading finish his messages because he did say something about his new album.<br><br>8/24/04 2:34pm LA<br><br>These past few weeks have been quite difficult as far as writing and music goes.  I have been struggling with ideas, sounds and concepts.  Mainly, I have been at a loss for what to say and talk about.  For me, this is the biggest issue when producing an album because if I donÂ’t know what I want to say then everything is meaningless.<br><br>I experience a lot of self-doubt, confusion, frustration and depression during each production of a new album.  But this process is essential because otherwise nothing new will emerge.  I firmly believe that one must Â“reset to zeroÂ” before oneÂ’s heart and soul can contain and express new ideas and emotions.  However, this process can be quite painful and exhausting emotionally.  I believe that if one is not able to complete this process andcycle then one will not move forward or grow in that stage of life.<br><br>Something IÂ’ve wanted to talk about but only touched upon previously is the state of Chinese music as a whole.  The reason I couldnÂ’tÂ’ talk about these things is because of the limitations of the media and press.  IÂ’m not talking about censorship but about the fact that our media is becoming increasingly more focused on trends and gossip rather than more Â“seriousÂ” topics.  Therefore, I am delighted to have this forum in which I can Â“chatÂ” and share with my friends and supporters thoughts and ideas I may have. I am in no way claiming that I am right about anything so please donÂ’t hold me to that.  I am merely expressing my opinions and observations about things that I am extremely concerned about. I donÂ’t see music as just merely entertainment but a reflection of our culture and society.<br><br>The eternal dilemma of the artist is to create something new while at the same time not isolate his/her audience.  That is something I ponder with each album.  To deliver something that is both new and fresh while at the same time not losing your audience is something very difficult to achieve if at all achievable.  If you come out with an album that is too different than your previous works then people will say that you are changing for changeÂ’s sake or that you have changed for the worse.         If you donÂ’t change at all then people will say you are repeating yourself and stagnant.  How does one achieve a Â“perfectÂ” balance so that both sides are satisfied?<br><br>Often people tell me that their favorite album of mine is the Â“blueÂ” one or the first album.  They tell me their favorite songs are Â“Blue MoonÂ” or Â“I Love YouÂ” and that they wish I could write more songs like those.  However, what they fail to understand is that the person who wrote those songs has grown and changed.  If I tried to write songs like I did on the first album I probably wouldnÂ’t be able to do so because IÂ’ve become a different person who feels and thinks differently.  And even If I were able to write songs similar to those on the first album would people like them or would they say that IÂ’m repeating myself?  Herein, lies the dilemma.<br><br>And what is the solution to all this?  Well, there is no Â“solutionÂ” except to be true to yourself and be yourself.<br><br>However, that is easier said than done, as you all know.  It takes courage, love, and some wisdom to be yourself.  What IÂ’m grateful of is that at least I have the love and support of my fans and friends to be myself.  As for<br>wisdom, well, I ask that of God.<br><br>Production and work on my new album has already commenced as you may already have heard.  I am deep within the process and am often confused and frustrated.  I hope something new and true will emerge at the end of this journey.  There are talks and rumors about when the album will be released but all I can say is that it will be done when itÂ’s done.  I ask for your support and patience and that you also keep an open mind and ear when you first listen to this album when it comes out.It will be something quite different than the previous albums but I assure you one thing-that this and every album of mine will be an imprint of my life, mind, heart and soul.<br><br>To me, the first three albums formed a trilogy of sorts.  This is technically the fourth new studio album and, so, it will commence a new period or perhaps trilogy for me.  This new album will embark on new sounds, topics, ideas, feelings and opinions.  But it will, nevertheless, still be a David Tao album at the core.<br><br>Until next timeÂ…DT<br><br><a href="http://www.davidcn.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=24038" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidcn.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=24038</a></div>

It is rather long and i think he gonna released his new album soon coz he see light..haha<br><br>9.4.04 9:48am Taipei<br><br>A little less than two weeks have passed and IÂ’m in a much different place than when I wrote my last letter.  ItÂ’s not the fact that IÂ’m now in Asia but that IÂ’m now suddenly invigorated and very inspired.  IÂ’d like to tell you how and why but itÂ’s difficult to explain and describe so IÂ’ll just say that God has been leading me and lighting the path for me.  Things are starting to become clear and colorful again and it seems that now I can Â“seeÂ” the road and my destination.  I was worried and down but it seems that the dark cloud has been lifted and now the sun is shining on me.  I feel that IÂ’m walking into new territory and the next phase of my life and this album.  Encouragement, friendship and love during this time are very crucial and, again, I thank you all for your constant outpour of love and support.<br><br>The new album is taking shape and I am now able to see many of its distinguishing features.  I canÂ’t say that the end is near but the end is in sight.  I am very excited about this new album and I can guarantee that it will be something very different yet close to my heart. There are many new things that IÂ’m working on in this new album but one of the key elements is, simplicity. I feel some of my previous creations (and much of whatÂ’s on the market now) is very Â“overproducedÂ” and often times too slick.  I feel that music needs to return to its roots in terms of instrumentation and content. Music nowadays is often times just layer upon layer of sounds and parts that really donÂ’t add up to anything.  We have at our disposal so much technology and information yet we donÂ’t generate or create anything truly original or new.<br>ItÂ’s no different for musicians and producers as we now have software and equipment that can do things you only dreamed of five years ago.  Yet we abuse and overuse it while at the same time create nothing truly new and original. Thus, trying to keep things simple is one of the most difficult things to achieve in spite of all these options and tools.  Some of the best artists and painters draw with very simple lines and colors.  Some of the most haunting and memorable images are nothing more black and white portraits.  Some of the best melodies only have a few notes and chords behind them.  ItÂ’s not what you put in but what you decide to leave out, as Beethoven said.  Simplicity is the key to life.<br>One thing IÂ’d like to clarify is that presently there is no Â“officialÂ” David Tao website.  You may be reading this letter on a bbs, forum, email, etc. but please note that it has originated from yoursÂ’ truly and is NOT the property of any website or organization other than myself.  Also, the fact that you find the posting of this or any of my writings on a website, forum, bbs or email does NOT mean that I am endorsing that particular entity, individual or organization.  I want to clarify this in the event that there may be any misunderstandings or issues in the future.  Again, I am NOT endorsing, validating or officiating any forum, organization or website when I post my writings on it.  IÂ’m merely sharing with everybody my thoughts and ideas via<br>this particular medium or website.  Consequently, I am not responsible nor do I have any involvement with the operation or management of this and these websites, forums and organizations.  I hope you can all understand my stand on this issue and that it is not intended to offend anyone.  This is to avoid problems and misunderstands in the future which could prevent me from posting my writings.  I do, however, encourage you to share my letters and postings with your friends and other forums that may be interested.<br><br>Often times, during the production of an album I close myself off to the world and itÂ’s happenings.  I donÂ’t read the news, listen to the radio or any music nor do I participate in many activities.  This forces me to look Â“insideÂ” myself and become introspective.  I canÂ’t rely on the outside world for inspiration, feelings or interaction all the time. I must become self-sufficient and live on my own for that period of time especially when IÂ’m writing.  I call it Â“fasting from lifeÂ”.  These periods could last from one week to a few months and often times it can become quite painful.  ItÂ’s very similar to fasting or food abstinence in that the early stages are very difficult while your body goes through changes and tries to adjust to the lack of food and nutrition.  However, as your body adjusts (or in my case, my mind and life), new feelings, ideas and perspectives emerge and present themselves.  Often times, you are able to see things clearer than before and perhaps things you initially missed now take on new meaning.<br><br>This is a period of cleansing in which I empty my mind and soul and allow new energies into my life.<br><br>I enjoy driving very much because it gives me a sense of freedom, speed and clarity.  I can see the world in itsÂ’ entirety and every passing second gives me a different view and landscape.  I am Â“in controlÂ” and I can go where I want to go.  When my friends ride with me in the car<br>they often ask me why I have the radio/CD player off.  They are quite surprised since they would imagine a musician to enjoy listening to music while driving.  Many people like to drive with the music on as it accompanies their drive as well as provides an emotional backdrop for<br>they journey.  However, I like to drive with the music completely off.<br><br>In fact, I rarely listen to music throughout my day.  Perhaps itÂ’s because IÂ’m always around music that I choose to not have music on in my daily life. You may have heard people ask, Â“Do you listen to music to change your mood or to fit your mood?Â”  I think people do both, which shows how powerful music, can be.  And because music has such power I choose to have it off at certain times because it can either alter or further enhance my present mood at that moment.  IÂ’d much rather allow my mind and heart to think and feel for itself rather<br>than have something else interfere. ThatÂ’s why often times when I come back to Asia I feel myself being bombarded with new gossip, information, news and Â“garbageÂ”.  ItÂ’s difficult to Â“turn offÂ” the world outside of us but sometimes we need to do that.<br><br>One my favorite directors once said that we are all systematically being changed without us even knowing it.  Year by year our standards and expectations are being lowered and we arenÂ’t even aware of it. If you compare our world with the way it was a year or two years ago you may realize how little itÂ’s progressed and improved.  You may notice, in fact, that it has regressed and worsened.  Or perhaps you think the world is a better place?  Perhaps our standards and expectations have been lowered so gradually that we donÂ’t even realize it?  How many of you feel Â“safeÂ” in the city you live in?  Do you feel an increased amount of violence and hatred in the city, country, and world in which you live in?  I do.  Oddly, sometimes I donÂ’t even feel safe in my own home. Violence doesnÂ’t always present itself in the physical form.  There is violence within the mind, spirit and soul.  There is constant and increased abuse of our rights and lives by society, the media, corporations and governments.  Therefore, I feel the Â“turning offÂ” of the outside world during certain periods to be very important.  ItÂ’s also very important to know how to Â“filterÂ” what comes in and what stays out of our lives and minds.<br><br>ItÂ’s very much like the proliferation of viruses and bugs in our computers and even cell phones now.  Each day I open my email box to find dozens of pieces of junk mail and garbage flooding and overloading it. We have junk mail filters which are designed to Â“search and destroyÂ” this garbage, however, these filters donÂ’t necessarily catch everything and at times can even misidentify legitimate mail for junk mail accidentally discarding it.  Each one of us is like an email box and our filters are all set at different operating levels.  Some of us donÂ’t have filters so we have to manually sort our mail each day, which is both frustrating and time consuming.  Many times, we are tempted or fooled by such junk or fraudulent mail and misinformation leading to disastrous results.  As in life, our mental and emotional filters<br>often times donÂ’t catch everything and, as a result, we are lead astray and become confused.  Do you have a junk mail filter for life?  And if so, what level is your junk mail filter set to? Are you aware of whatÂ’s true or false in your life and whatÂ’s around you?  Do you believe everything you read in the papers?  Do you believe everything your government, teachers and leaders tell you?<br><br>When in doubt, follow your heart.  DonÂ’t be afraid to ask questions.  DonÂ’t be afraid to have a point of view.  Pray to God for guidance and clarity.<br><br><a href="http://www.davidcn.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=25063" rel="nofollow">http://www.davidcn.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=25063</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>David 4th letter to fans. Yeah i'm excited he going to release his new album in Jan!!<br><br>Dear Friends,<br><br>ItÂ’s been a long time since IÂ’ve written to you all but youÂ’ve been on my mind, nevertheless.  I may have seen some of you over the past few months at events but, for the most part, IÂ’ve been undercover and deep in the throes of production.  IÂ’ve received many messages and letters of support and concern during this period (to which IÂ’ve not replied due to lack of time) for which IÂ’m deeply grateful of.  Thank you for your continued love and encouragement.<br><br>IÂ’m still working on the new album though much work has been accomplished over the past few months with the help of many great musicians and minds.  ThereÂ’s still quite a bit to complete though the end is within sight.  What I can reveal is that the album will be delivered to your hands sometime in the New Year and it will be noticeable progression from my previous albums.<br><br>IÂ’m very excited at this moment because I have some exciting news to share. Within a few weeks, I will be launching my very first official website.  We are putting the finishing touches on it as I write this.  I am very proud of this site not only because it is a David Tao premiere but also because it will provide a direct channel for us to interact.  There will be many surprises within it and, of course, there will be an abundance of exclusive and exciting new content about the upcoming new album and me.  In the upcoming weeks, youÂ’ll be receiving more information about this website and how to become a member of our new home.  Please stay tuned!<br><br>Peace and be strong in what you are doing,<br><br>David Tao<br><br>http://www.davidcn.com/bbs/viewthread.php?tid=28341&amp;fpage=1</div>

David said before he will try new thing , he don't alway do the same kind of music .This song is not about real ghost but talking about people and things that happen around you, it is a society song. I know what he is singing and agree in the lyrics that said sometimes people are more scary than ghosts. You should listen carefully before you said that is disappointing, have faith in him.<br><br>You should listen to his another new song "who do you love?"I heard yes933 playing it today, maybe this song will be more appealing to you. This song is touching and excellent, he sing with emotions , i especially like the piano part.<br><br>i think you should visit regularly his official website to know what he trying to express in his new album. There is a hot discussion about his new album in his forum.</div>
