It'll be an intergration of various art mediums. 2yrs to plan and train. It'll be more like a charity fund raising musical either given directly to our poor aged people or some organisation who are really doing real jobs for them.<br><br>I was wondering if people from this forum can eventually participate when I saw some of the lyrics written here. Its a good platform for many especially the naughty ones who are hopeless in studies  to prove to their parents that they can do good in their lives. I intent to integrate rock music with world music. Of course with one or two involvement from Sg forum, we'll place our forum's credits in our posters. What do you think?<br><br>Currently we're facing a 51% increase in our Juvenile delinquent rates in singapore and gov agencies are helpless. We believe we have a certain solution to help these people.</div>
