            <div class='col-md body'>i've bought music cassettes and stuff all my life... so i can't remember much as i'd save money and buy a bunch...<br><br>what i listen to and what means a lot changes too...<br><br>like Nat Cole's "When I Fall In Love" still brings tears to my eyes coz i fell in love with someone.. even tho we were not to be, i still love her and i know i always will, even tho i've let go... the words ring true<br><br>when we parted, Macy Gray's "I Try" was what i felt then...<br><br>there was a time when my mind was in turmoil, and i was lost... self-destructive thoughts went through my mind, feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt and more plagued me, Nine Inch Nails' "Hurt" (done also by Johnny Cash before he passed on) helped me... i was not the only one...<br><br>when i was in love and with my ex.. Jane's Addiction's "Classic Girl" kept going through my head.. because of these lines:<br><br>"Such a classic girl, gives a man great ideas<br>And you'll tell your friends: Hey Man! Won't you listen to my great ideas!"<br><br>songs and music will be part of my psyche, i guess for as long as i am alive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
