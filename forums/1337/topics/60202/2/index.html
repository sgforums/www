Like Small Town Girl, personally I think there are other songs that are nicer than that, like Yue Liang Dai Biao Shei De Xin or Hu Die from Black Tangerine. Or maybe it was simply because he wanted to put in 4 songs from each album.</div>

I guess that's probably because Chinese tend to be more sentimental. No lah, some songs, SOME, are truly written from experience.

Of cos I am not going to generalise and say that all chinese songs are like that one but it is kinda sad that it is being dominated by such songs.  Making money out of music is not wrong, afterall you need to survive. But you can see many people going in for the sake of money and fame.  Tell me, if you are not good at speaking mandarin, would you even put singing mandarin songs as a career top choice? I dun think so, but look at the number of ABCs coming into the chinese market. Some even have to take mandarin lessons to brush up their cannot make it mandarin...gosh...<br><br>but as i said, I totally hate them to the core...I use to like chinese pop back then people like Jacky Cheung, Sky Wu who are really vocally powerfully and are hugely talented....now? The scene is a comical orgy of young hippies cashing into the pop sh|t.<br><br>So well dun be offended what i say huh, not directed at anyone but just my point of my view.
