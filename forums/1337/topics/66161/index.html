            <div class='col-md body'>I second that...<br><br>Take it from me...I've been playing for about 2 yrs now...And most of the stuff i learnt are from the net. Get a course that provides u with a strong foundation, something to get u going. After abt 3-4 mths, u're off to go on ur own...<br><br>During the course,learn how to read notes, chords, chromatics, scales blah blah blah...<br>Also, try to acquire guitar techniques such as tapping, A.harmonics, N.harmonics, slides, bends, hammer-on/off.These skills play a great deal in ur soloing and stuff...<br><br>Mind sharing with me which genres do u mostly prefer?<br>Metallica? Dream Theater? D.Mattews?<br>I might be able to provide u with some simple songs to give u a headstart...<br></div>

I might be able to find you one.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually, do u all think it's easier to learn electric guitar direct or start from classical guitar? cos i find that the neck of the classical guitar is broader and my fingers are too short liao...<br>hmm... how har? esp the F &amp; G chords.... very difficult to press leh... it's mainly the G lah... thot electric guitar or even acoustic neck is narrower....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...From what i can tell, it's best to start with a classical guitar...<br>Why so u ask?<br>So as to train ur accuracy and hand movement...<br>No doubt the fretboard of a classical is wider, but in such cases, it provides u with a strong foundation in ur left hand movement. This is consequential because as u progress along in guitar playing, a strong control and accuracy is needed. U may disagree with what i say but my shi fu did improvised this method on me. I'm a teacher myself and i know that this is true cause students of mine had become excellent guitarists...<br>What's more, i like that creamy tone of a classical.<br>But when push comes to shove,i would rather be handling an electric guitar as many techniques can be put into use.<br><br>P.s The chords F and G aren't hard to hit.
