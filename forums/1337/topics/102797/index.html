            <div class='col-md body'>I like this catchy song. But last time received an email that claimed the song was associated with devil, but it's already thrown in recycle bin. It's likely a hoax. Googling it yields something similar as what i read:<br><br><blockquote>Probably most of you haven't realized the true meaning of this<br>particular song. Because as native English speakers, it's hard to<br>understand a song in a different language, and even worse, in a bad<br>mixture of English, Spanish and demonic hidden messages!<br><br>That's right, it's widely known (especially in the Hispanic world<br>[because they can understand it]) that this song praises Satan. And<br>even worse, it predicts his coming to this world in an apparent<br>Apocalypse.<br><br>These girls defend themselves from those statements, claiming that '<br>they were trying to sing in English, but as they can't (because they<br>don't know the language) they sing what they think is an English<br>song'. [Yeah right!]. Or things like that, in fact there are several<br>versions of why the song has an understandable part, which is in no<br>language at all.<br><br>The point is that these previously unknown and untalented girls with<br>this demonic anthem have soared to the height of the popularity<br>charts and topped the most heard charts AROUND THE WORLD! Let's begin<br>with the analysis:<br><br>In the Spanish speaking countries the debate is really a hard one.<br>Some say: "let's avoid it because it's a demonic song", but others<br>: "let's hear and love it because it's a demonic song". ?!?!<br><br>So it's up to you, whether you want to be a Satan follower and<br>prepare the grounds for his coming. Or fight them, (Satan and the<br>New World Order).<br><br>In English the song says:<br><br>Look at what's coming at the turn of the corner (interpreted as a<br>prophecy of the evil coming), Diego (Diego seldom taken as the<br>devil) comes dancing rumba.<br><br>With the Moon in the pupils, (of course it's at night if the Moon is<br>up) and his ocean blue suit (according to the occultists, blueis<br>Satan's favorite color) ' go smuggled remains' ? (this is the best<br>English translation of this part, because even in Spanish it doesn't<br>make any sense).[smuggle, related to illegality] and where not even a<br>soul fits in (this is understood as The Hell) he squeezes in to give<br>himself pleasure, possessed by the Ragadanga<br>rhythm.(ragadanga has no meaning in Spanish, could be an occultist<br>thing). And the DJ who knows him plays the midnight hymn, (hour in<br>which satanic rituals and sacrifices take place), for Diego the most<br>desired song.<br><br>And he dances, and he ENJOYS it (in Spanish the word 'gozar' is more<br>related to pleasure, than just enjoy), and he sings it. (Then comes<br>the unintelligible part, which makes no sense, not even trying to<br>analyze it from the Spanish or English phonetics as full words).<br><br>Aserej? ja, de je, de jebe tu de jebere sebiunouva, majabi an de<br>bugui an de buididipi. [But, analyzed in parts, the word aserej?could<br>be taken by it's sound in Spanish as "being an heretic", ja (they're<br>the acronym for Jehovah in the Bible); de je, de jebe tu de jebere<br>(which could be understood as stop being yourself, or leave your<br>being). Put together:<br><br>" an heretic being Jehovah, stop being yourself, or leave your being".<br><br>It continues with the word majabi, which relates to 'bajan' in<br>Spanish 'to go down'. Read backwards, 'an de', modifies to 'han<br>de' 'are to'. Bugui an de buididipi (these last words were found to<br>be forms of 'guide' in Spanish. The part 'gui' is formed from<br>our 'we'.<br><br>So, the hidden message in this stanza is:"(they) come down [bajan]<br>and are to guide us (we) [y han de guiarnos]. It's not a matter of<br>witchcraft, that I find him very (wrongly spelled in Spanish,<br>from'todos'='every', to tonlos'='(kind of) 'every' but is related to<br>an old Spanish form of the word 'Sin') day, on the path I'm walking.<br>Diego 'has attractiveness' (that's the most appropriate<br>translation, and remember that Lucifer was a beautiful angel) and<br>that point of happiness afro gipsy rastafari (both terms related to<br>tribes, esoterism, sacrifices, cards, fortune telling, etc).<br><br>These are the facts, and given the present conditions of this post-<br>September 11 world, there's no doubt that the widely announced<br>Apocalypses is coming. These girls are just trying to take the best<br>out of it while they can. And sure they are! They are profiting in<br>the millions of dollars.<br><br>First verse is as it says it in English:<br>Look who's coming down the way, at the corner, it's Diego doing the Rumba. Now, I have a friend named Diego (did his parents name him Satan? I don't think so. Diego, as in San Diego- does that mean Saint Satan?, is a common Spanish name).<br>-con't- With the moon in his eyes (literally his pupils), and his aqua marine suit, he's getting into trouble (going after contraband, the person who wrote the above article, didn't write down the right spanish lyrics which are vas despues de contrabando)<br>And where you can't even fit a soul, he'll make himself room, possessed by the rythym of the ragatanga (now, yes, its using words like possessed and soul to show the overall picture of this guy Diego, who's a hot shot, kind of a snake, but not possessed by the devil, but by the music - ragatanga, nonsense word in Spanish used to describe a good beat, at least in my Chilean culture, a slang word)<br>And the DJ who knows him, plays the song from 12 on for Diego, the song he wants the most, and he dances, and he has joy (goza actually does connotate joy and the above saying about the word is absolutely 100% false. It means joy, period.) and he sings...<br><br>chorus (nonsense words, a spell, hehe...maybe but is awapap eluba bewap bam boom also a spell? Could it also be "I said a Hey Hah, Hey ..etc. nonsens...and the boogie and the boogity beat" nonsense words messing up english words, could be)<br><br>Verse 2 says in line 1: No es cosa de brujeria (means, Its NOT witchcraft) que lo encuentre to los dias (that I come across him every day) por donde voy caminando (when I go walking) Diego tiene chuleria (Diego is full of tricks - lit. Diego has leg-pulling) and his source of happiness is afro gypsy rastafari (now that's not good, but it does not say that its a song about the devil) And where not even a soul can fit, he'll give himself some room, possessed by the rythem of the ragatanga and the DJ that knows him plays the song from 12 on for Diego, his most desired song, and he dances, and has joy, and sings...<br>chorus<br><br>Literally, not spiritually healthy, maybe. But NOT conclusively about the devil at all. This song is about a guy Diego, who thinks he's a hotshot, walks the street in his tacky lookin suit, gets in on all the clubs, parties and plays his favorite song. It's not witchcraft that he's everywhere, but he's just out to have fun, possessed by the music's rythem. </blockquote></div>
