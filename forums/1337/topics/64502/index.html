But as some people refer to the electone as an organ, specifically the electone organ, this one runs on electricity.<br><br>The electone organ is similar to the keyboard, just that the organ comes with pedals of up to one octave or more if you like [but not too many], and has more options such as the combinations of sounds, types of instruments and rhythm beats, allows recordings, allows you to preset different combinations of instruments and the list goes on....<br><br>Pianos are hmm I think considered percussion instruments, though the sound is produced by hitting the wire thingy behind, but since it's HITTING it's percussion <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Pianos nowadays sometimes run on electricity too, in the case of a silent piano [which can be used as a normal piano without the headphones too]...<br><br>I don't exactly know very well.. I'm sure there are others who can give better explanations  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mooku's got it quite right.<br><br>instruments that come wif the all too familiar black n white keys abound nowadays...<br><br>my definitions:<br>piano: combination of percussion n string instrument that (usually)requires no electricity.  sound comes from the hammers hittin the strings inside.<br>types of piano include grand (the huge damn steady lookin one); upright piano (the type u usually find in our wonderfully spacious HDB flats, strings vertical instead of horiz for grand); and a few others la... but these are the main ones<br><br>organ: now this is the ultimate platform for a pun but i shall refrain. organs used to be wind operated, where air has to be pumped thru it and all... quite like an accordian??  but mooku correct, the term is now used very loosely to encompass electones<br><br>electones: electronic thingy wif the black n white keys, that allows u to use sampled sounds (the sound is recorded before manufacture and then assigned to the different keys on the black n white - quality of electone involves largely the quality of the sampling methods used in manufacturing)  some electones got 2 levels of keys... can sequence drums etc etc, its a 1 stop music makin platform<br><br>keyboard: loose term again for machines wif the black n whites, that also uses sampling methods to produce the sounds. not a complex as an electone as it's just a slab of musical machinery compared to the whole piece including leg pedals. sometimes keyboards incorporate weighted keys to make them feel like a piano, so u can express urself better when playin... the korg sp200 is a good weighted keyboard.<br><br>got others also la... clavinova (spellin i not sure) etc etc... but all same way of using one i suppose...<br><br>hahah... i'm a drummer by the way, so u may not wanna believe all i say...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Add a little bit more the Electone Organ: The orgran is made up of 2 layer of keys plus the pedal keys. The top layer usually played by the right hand mainly will focus on the melody.<br><br>The second layer usually played by the left hand will mainly foucs on Chords.<br><br>The pedals produce the base sounds usually complementing the chords played by the left leg.<br><br>As mention "usually" above, the right and left hand can interchange and played on either layers for different music pieces (except for the pedals).<br><br>Thus you are using your left, right hands plus your left leg during playing of a music piece. The right leg is uusally controlling the music volume to enhance the effect. (Basically feel like riding a motorbike when all your limbs are in use)<br><br>Because of the Electone capability to produce wide range of sounds. Electone orgran can be a one-man orchestra thus superceding the other instruments. So that is why when you see person playing the electone orgran, you don't see any accompany him or her. And due to this the electone orgran is usually foucs on pop music rather than classicals ones.</div>
