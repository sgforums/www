            <div class='col-md body'>Your Shih Tzu had been ill-treated by previous owner before &amp; possibly when it didn't pee &amp; poo on designated area, the ex-owner whacked it. This makes it eat its own poo coz it's afraid to be beaten. Another possibility is that it's trying to detect if there's anything wrong with it's health coz dogs have the ability to self-cure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>regarding question 2, i found some info which may help... the poo eating habit is called Coprophagia... more info here: <a href="http://www.behaviour-problems.freeserve.co.uk/3/BehAdv/coprophagia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.behaviour-problems.freeserve.co.uk/3/BehAdv/coprophagia.htm</a><br><br>a copy of the 1st paragraph:<br>Coprophagia is defined as the consumption of faeces by an animal and is a common complaint of owners to their veterinarians. Since there has been little research done on this particular behaviour, the veterinarian is usually poorly equipped to give a recommendation to the owner. This study is intended to provide epidemiological information about the incidence of the<br>behaviour in the canine population, the age of onset, age of disappearance, and various other pieces of information crucial to form a basis from which to study this very important behaviour.<br><br>hope it helps...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"> <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/spcaFFL_banner_19k.gif"> <img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v517/kei_ko/catdance2.gif"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1) he is probably bored, get him some toys to play with, spend more time playing with him. dun let him make it a habit as he might end up chewing his own tail...<br><br>2) it is NOT normal. it's a kinda sickness, u can stop tat by simply being there when he do his biz and immediately clear it. Stop him when he attempts to go near his poo, not by whacking him, but by getting his attention and saying a firm "NO".<br><br>3) he might be scared or just needed somewhere to be his comfort zone. give him his own corner in the room or house as his sleeping den. make it comfortable. it would be good to give him one of ur unwanted old tee, clean of cos. the smell of u on the tee makes him comfortable, like being near u.<br><br>4) every dog should at least poo once a day, pee at least twice. make it a habit for him. after every meal, get him to go poo and pee. encourage him to do on the paper and dun let him get away until he did. after the habit is formed, it bec normal for him.<br><br>5) make water easily available for him. make sure there's always fresh water. for me i put a bottle of water and a feeding pump at his crate. he can just drink whenever he want. also after every meal, get him to go drink water.<br><br>you'll realise having a dog is rather similar to having a baby. but the good thing is dog is a creature of habit and once the habit is formed, it will remain. therefore, help him to form good habits. also in training, avoid whacking. Just a firm "no" or just roll a newspaper and hit on the floor will do significantly.<br><br>of cos i do beat my dog lah... i piak his butt!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> but not often cos i yelled his name he kia liao!</div>
