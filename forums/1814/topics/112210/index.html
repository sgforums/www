            <div class='col-md body'>My Dog, Sex<br>-------------------<br><br>Everybody who has a dog calls him 'Rover' or 'Spot' I made the mistake of calling mine 'Sex'.<br>Now, Sex has been very embarrassing to me. When I went to city hall to renew his dog license, I told the clerk I would like a license for Sex. He said, 'I'd like to have one too!' Then I said, 'But this is for a dog.' He said, 'I don't care what she looks like.' Then I said, 'You don't understand, I've had Sex since I was nine years old.' He said, 'You must have been quite a kid.'<br><br>When I got married and went on my honeymoon, I took the dog with me. Not wanting the dog to bother us, I told the clerk that I wanted a room for my wife and me and a special room for Sex. He said that every room in the place was for sex. I said, 'You don't understand, Sex keeps me awake at night.' The clerk said, 'Me too.'<br><br>One day I entered Sex in a dog show, before the competition began, Another contestant asked me what I was doing. I told him that I planned to have Sex in the show. He said that I should have sold my own tickets. When I asked if the show was televised he called me a pervert.<br><br>I left my dog at the Veterinarian. When I went to pick him up I said, 'I've come for my dog.' She said, 'Which one, Spot or Rover?' I said, 'What about Sex?' She slapped me. After I straightened out the misunderstanding, I asked if Sex was good for her. She slapped me again.<br><br>Sex ran away, I went to the dog pound. As I was looking in all the cages the operator up to me. I said I'm looking for Sex. He said I was looking in all the wrong places.<br><br>When my wife and I separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. I said, 'Your Honor, I had Sex before I was married.' He said, 'What's your point, so did I.' I said, 'But my wife wants to take Sex away.' He said, 'That's what happens in a divorce.'<br><br>Last night Sex ran off. I spent hours looking for him all over town. A cop came over to me and asked, 'What are you doing in this alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?' I said I was looking for Sex.<br>My case comes up on Friday.<br>I hope u liked it!<br><br></div>

The first man's dog asked the second man's dog what he's there for. They are putting me down. Oh no, says the first dog, why? The second dog says,"Well, you see... I've been chasing the Postman for years. Yesterday, I finally caught him, and bit him. So, I'm going to be put to sleep.<br><br>The second dog says, "Well, my master just completely remodeled the inside of his house. I didn't like it because my scent wasn't anywhere, anymore. So, when he went to bed last night, I pissed on everything I could find, to get my scent back. This morning, my master found out what I had done, so he is putting me to sleep also.<br><br>The third dog said,"This is my masters new girlfriend. She runs around the house all the time without her clothes on. This makes me very horny. So, this morning, as she was getting out of the shower, and bent over to wipe up the water on the floor. I couldn't stand it anymore, so I jumped on her a gave it to her good!" The other dogs say, " so' that's why they are putting you to sleep?" No says the dog, "She is bringing me here to get my toenails clipped!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Seeing eye dogs<br>--------------------------<br><br>Two guys are walking their dogs;<br>one guy had a Doberman, the other a Chihuahua.<br><br>As they were walking, they passed a bar and wanted to get in. But there was a sign in the window that said: NO PETS ALLOWED!<br><br>So the guy with the Doberman said, "Let's go in as blind men with seeing-eye dogs!" They agreed that the guy with the oberman would go in first. The first guy told the barkeep that the Doberman was his seeing-eye dog, so he got in. When the second guy tried to get in, the barkeep said, "Excuse me sir but, Chihuahuas aren't seeing-eye dogs!"<br><br>And the second guy said," WHAT? THEY GAVE ME A CHIHUAHUA?!!"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Medical tests<br>-------------------------<br><br>A man runs into the vet's office carrying his dog, screaming for help. The vet rushes him back to an examination room and has him put his dog down on the examination table. The vet examines the still, limp body and after a few moments tells the man that his dog, regrettably, is dead. The man, clearly agitated and not willing to accept this, demands a second opinion.<br>The vet goes into the back room and comes out with a cat and puts the cat down next to the dog's body. The cat sniffs the body, walks from head to tail poking and sniffing the dog's body and finally looks at the vet and meows. The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the cat thinks that your dog is dead too."<br><br>The man is still unwilling to accept that his dog is dead. The vet brings in a black Labrador. The lab sniffs the body, walks from head to tail, and finally looks at the vet and barks. The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the lab thinks your dog is dead too."<br><br>The man, finally resigned to the diagnosis, thanks the vet and asks how much he owes. The vet answers, "$650."<br><br>"$650 to tell me my dog is dead?" exclaimed the man....<br><br>"Well," the vet replies, "I would only have charged you $50 for my initial diagnosis. The additional $600 was for the cat scan and lab tests."<br><br></div>
