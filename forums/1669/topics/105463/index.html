            <div class='col-md body'>Do u know this?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Cigarettes cause the body to release its own stores of sugar and fat by a drug type of interaction.  That is how it basically operated as an appetite suppressant, affecting the satiety centers of your hypothalamus.  As far as for the sugar levels, nicotine in fact works much more efficiently than food.  If you use food to elevate blood sugar levels, it literally takes up to 20 minutes from the time you chew and swallow the food before it is released to the blood, and thus the brain, for its desired effect of fueling your brain.  Cigarettes, by working through a drug interaction causes the body to release it's own stores of sugar, but not in 20 minutes but usually in a matter of seconds.  In a sense, your body has not had to release sugar on its own in years, you have done it by using nicotine's drug effect !</div>

Recent research has shown that the hoodia cactus species contains a molecule (P-57) that is similar to glucose, only MUCH stronger. The scientists believe that this molecule in hoodia cactus 'fools' the body into believing that it has just eaten. The result of eating it is thus a lack of appetite. It produces an immediate effect upon eating. Many people experience an upliftment in their mood immediately, followed by a satiation of the appetite. After eating hoodia cactus, one simply doesn't feel like eating more. You might want to eat because you know its lunchtime, but there's simply less desire to chew and swallow your food.<br><br>Hoodia cactus is a leafless and grows naturally in the Northern Cape, a province of South Africa, where it is registered as a protected species by Nature Conservation. It has been used for thousands of years by shepherds and hunters of the nomadic SAN tribes that populate the arid territories of South Africa and Namibia. Hoodia cactus is famous for its effects as an appetite suppressant and mood enhancer. Excellent results have been obtained from people using it as part of a weight loss program. Mass global interest has been shown for hoodia cactus since an international pharmaceutical company, started to research hoodia's potential to help people with obesity. Because of this property, Western countries have claimed that it is the 'new miracle diet ingredient'. There is strong evidence to suggest that hoodia cactus may become a worldwide answer to obesity, as studies confirmed excellent results.<br><br>As far as scientists know, there are no negative side-effects. The local SAN, who's ancestors have been using the plant for thousands of years, claim that there are no negative side effects. We do not know for sure whether there may be drugs that interact negatively with hoodia cactus, since it is a new food. hoodia cactus is currently not classified as a medicine in South Africa, but as a foodstuff, which is testimony to how safe it is.<br><br></div>
