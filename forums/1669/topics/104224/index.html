Taught by his tutor Aristotle to believe that the Greeks were the most advanced people in the world, Alexander created a huge empire, encompassing Macedonia, Egypt, Syria, Persia and Asia Minor.<br><br>Alexander the Great was born in 356BC in Pella the ancient capital of Macedonia. Alexander was the son of Philip II, king of Macedonia, and Olympias a princess of Epirus.<br><br>Alexander had a very close relationship to his mother Olympias and this may have affected his future relationships with women. Although Alexander did marry and have a son, it is believed that Alexander also a relationships with his closest male friend Hephaestion. This relationship was a source of intense jealousy to his mother Olympias. Alexander married his first wife, Roxane in 327. She was a princess of Sogdania (now Uzbekistan). When Alexander died in On June 11 323 she was pregnant. Alexander also had a second wife, Statira.<br><br>Alexander was a military genius and greatly admired by his troops for his leadership and courage. Alexander proudly led his troops into battle on his mighty horse Bucephalus. On conquering Egypt he was declared a Pharaoh and a god. The Egyptians hailed him as their liberator and he was crowned with the traditional double crown of the pharaohs of Egypt. He was given the salutation of '"a son of Amon"<br><br>Two cities founded by Alexander were Alexandria in Egypt and Bucephala in India.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">The Great Library of Alexandria</span></strong><br><br>Recognised as the 8th Wonder of the World, there is no doubt that the Great Library of Alexandria did exist. Founded by the Ptolomies, it made Egypt one of the most important learning centres of the ancient world. The Alexandria Museum and library survived for many centuries, but they were both believed to have been destroyed in A.D 200 during a civil war.<br>Alexander the Great had the inspiration to believe that the Alexandria Library would be the centre of the most prominent civilisations of the time, the Egyptian, the Greek and the Middle Eastern civilisations. Here would be the centre of all knowledge for the civilised world.<br><br>It is generally believed that Ptolemy I founded the library and started the collection which was to be continued by his successors until being destroyed in A.D. 200 during a civil war. The library became the world's first university with its college scholars including such famous names as Euchlid, Erastosthenes, Heron and Archimides.<br><br>On February 12th, 1990, members of the International Honorary Commission including Heads of State and world dignitaries signed the Aswan Declaration for the Revival of the Ancient Library of Alexandria.<br>The revival of the Ancient Library of Alexandria Project aims at building a universal modern public library to be a centre of culture, science and academic research.<br><br></div>
