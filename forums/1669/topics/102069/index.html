            <div class='col-md body'>Doctor Joseph Ignace Guillotin (1738 - 1814) belonged to a small reform movement that sought to banish the death penalty completely. At that time, executions in France were public events held in town squares. The entire town would gather to watch a quartering, where the prisoner's limbs were tied to four oxen and the animals were driven in four different directions. Upper-class criminals bought their way into a less painful death. Guillotin argued for a painless and private capital punishment method equal for all the classes, as an interim step towards completely banning the death penalty.<br><br>Guillotine like killing devices had already been used in Germany, Italy, Scotland and Persia for aristocratic criminals. However, never had such a device been adopted on a large institutional scale, for that reason the guillotine was named after Doctor Guillotin. The 'e' at the end of the word was added by English poets to make the word easier to rhythm.<br><br>Doctor Guillotin worked together with German engineer and harpsichord maker, Tobias Schmidt, to build a prototype guillotine machine. Schmidt suggested placing the blade at an oblique 45-degree angle and changing it from the round blade. Additional improvements to the guillotine machine were made in 1870 by Leon Berger, an assistant executioner and carpenter. Berger added a spring system, which stopped the mouton at the bottom of the groves, a lock/blocking device at the lunette and a new release mechanism for the blade. All guillotines built after 1870 are made according to Berger's construction.<br><br>The French Revolution began in 1789, the year of the famous storming of the Bastille, the notorious French prison. On July 14 of the same year, Louis XVI was driven from the throne and sent into exile. The new civilian assembly rewrote the penal code to say, "Every person condemned to the death penalty shall have his head severed." All classes of people were now executed equally. The first guillotining took place on April 25, 1792, when Nicolas Jacques Pelletie was guillotined at Place de GrÃ¨ve on the Right Bank. Ironically, Louis XVI had his own head chopped off on January 21, 1793. Thousands of people were guillotined during the French Revolution and executions became more of a public celebration. The last execution by guillotine took place in Marseilles, France on September 10, 1977, when the murderer Hamida Djandoubi was beheaded.<br><br>Total weight of a Guillotine is about 1278 lb<br>The guillotine blade with weight is over 88.2 lb<br>The heights of the guillotine posts average about 14 feet<br>The guillotine blade drop is about 88 inches<br>The falling blades rate of speed is about 21 feet/second<br>The actual beheading takes 2/100 of a second<br>The time for the guillotine blade to fall down where it stops takes 70th of a second<br>The power when the guillotine blade stops at the bottom is 888,5 lb<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="http://www.hillcity-comics.com/models/guillotine2.jpg"><br><br>One of the most talked about devices in history, the guillotine is the tell-tale execution device of the 18th and 19th centuries. Although reports of Â“guillotine-likeÂ” devices date back to the 14th century, the actual device itself didnÂ’t surface until the late 18th century, suggested by Dr. Joseph Guillotine, as an expedient method of execution. It soon became the chief means of dealing with criminals. Of course, the most famous of all victims to the machine, Marie Antoinette, can still be heard muttering those notorious words: Â“let them build models!Â”<br><br></div>
