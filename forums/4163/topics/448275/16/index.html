              <p>@alize: Giving is supposed to be done out of the giver's will.
              After clarifying this issue with some mature Christians, it is not
              right for a leader to approach members to give. We are judged not
              based on whether or how much we gave, but how we steward our
              finances. God does not need our money, giving is just one of the
              many ways we should do to prevent covetousness and support church
              leaders in their work.</p>
              <p>How the church leaders account for the money is a different
              matter. They are to be good stewards; spending wisely and reporting
              transparent details for accountability.</p>
              <p>@Xiao^P: We do not know how true Jame's story about his friend
              is. After all, his first post is not supported by accurate
              information, but rather opinionated. The church builds up a
              spiritual family that provides a platform for one another to grow
              in the body of Christ. Of course there will be some others who may
              desert you in times of crisis, indifferent from the secular
              setting, but which organization and its people are perfect? Based
              on personal experiences alone, I know that there're church friends
              who stood by me when I struggled. No one can promise that all
              friends can be there for you and this remains true within and
              outside the walls of the church. It doesn't work to judge Christ
              based on your encounters with church attendees alone. I hope one
              day you realize how much He loves you.</p>
              <p>@Zeeleewong: Your faith has made you strong. Loving God
              wholeheartedly and loving people fervently are the foundations of
              CHC's beliefs. Arguing does no one justice. Some of their points
              are worth thinking through- Entrusting your life in Pastor Kong's
              teaching and actions is not healthy Christian living, rather, be
              open to constructive criticism. Leave them be if their opinions
              cannot agree, keeping hurtful remarks out of discussion. Blessed
              are the peacemakers. ;)</p>

              <p><strong>BY YEN FENG </strong></p>
              <p><br>AN INQUIRY by the Commissioner of Charities into the finances of City Harvest Church has exposed misconduct and mismanagement, particularly in the way its funds were managed from 2007 to 2010.</p>
              <p>  In a statement yesterday, the charities watchdog said that financial irregularities of at least $23 million from the church's funds have been discovered.</p>
              <p>  These funds were used 'with the purported intention to finance Ho Yeow Sun's secular music career to connect with people', said the commission.</p>
              <p>  The funds were funnelled to the United States, where Ms Ho - the wife of founding pastor Kong Hee - was based.</p>
              <p>  It was done mainly in two ways: through an affiliate church in Kuala Lumpur, and a private bank account set up by the church some time after 2003.</p>
              <p>  Between December 2007 and May 2010, at least $2.1 million was transferred from City Harvest to the Kuala Lumpur church.</p>
              <p>  The commission said that five people were aware of the 'true purpose' of the donations to the Kuala Lumpur church - pastors Kong Hee and Tan Ye Peng, as well as executive members Teo Meng How, Sharon Tan Shao Yuen and Serina Wee Gek Yin.</p>
              <p>  The controversy may be said to have begun a decade ago, in 2002, when Mr Kong and Ms Ho established The Crossover Project to use Ms Ho's singing career to reach out to non-Christians.</p>
              <p>  A year later, church member Roland Poon levied accusations at the church, saying it was using members' donations to fund the singer's music career.</p>
              <p>  The allegations gained widespread scrutiny and the church issued press statements and persuaded its members that the allegations were untrue. Mr Poon later issued a public apology and retracted his statements.</p>
              <p>  The commission said yesterday that the church had in fact used its funds to finance the project.</p>
              <p>  Over three years, at least $23 million in church donations was used. However, the church's executive members were not told of how the funds were being used, the commission added.</p>
              <p>  Besides using the Malaysian church to send money to the US, there were several donations and tithes that were re-directed to a private fund known as the Multi- Purpose Account.</p>
              <p>  Funds in this account were also used to finance Ms Ho's career, the charities board said, adding that it was administered by Ms Wee, the church's former finance manager and executive member, and Ms Jacqueline Tan, a staff member.</p>
              <p>  Between April 2007 and March 2010, at least $3.6 million from this private fund was used to pay for Mr Kong's and his wife's expenses, the commission said.</p>
              <p>  To keep the fund going, selected donors were asked to transfer their contributions - from the church's building fund to this private account.</p>
              <p>  Apart from this small group of members, the existence of the fund was not known to other church members. There was even an attempt to conceal the existence of the account by closing it and dealing only in cash transactions, the commission said.</p>
              <p>  In 2009, a plan was hatched by Mr Tan, Mr Chew, Ms Wee and Ms Sharon Tan to transfer a $600,000 building fund donation by an Indonesian businessman, Mr Wahju Hanafi, to the private account. Of this, $100,000 was used to finance a media team from Singapore to publicise Ms Ho's career in the US.</p>
              <p>  The commission said the transfer was done by drafting letters from the businessman and a third party stating that the donation was not to the building fund, but to some City Harvest pastors and members as 'love gifts'.</p>
              <p>  The recipients of the funds then re-deposited the $600,000 donation into the private fund. Investigations by the commission, however, uncovered evidence that 'strongly suggests' the letters were backdated.</p>
              <p>  It also uncovered instances where the church attempted to hide 'related party' transactions.</p>
              <p>  Between 2006 and 2008, a company headed by Mr Kong sold more than $3 million worth of goods to the church. Because of his ties to the church, these transactions should have been declared in the church's financial statements.</p>
              <p>  But they were not. The commission said Mr Kong, motivated by concerns that the books would be audited, returned $770,000 to the church. This 'refund' was concealed as a 'sales discount' given to the church by his company.</p>
              <p>  But the amount was later reimbursed to Mr Kong from funds collected through the private account and the Kuala Lumpur church. The refund was thus 'cosmetic' and he was never 'out of pocket', the commission said.</p>
              <p>  Those aware of this move were Mr Tan, Mr Teo, Ms Sharon Tan, Ms Wee and Ms Jacqueline Tan.</p>
              <p>  The commission also said the church had refunded donations of about $338,000 in two separate tranches to Mr Chew after he suffered some financial difficulties. The second payment of $98,000 was approved by the board nine months after Mr Chew received the full amount.</p>
              <p>  It added that Mr Chew's appointment as the church's investment manager was not properly tabled and discussed by the church's board.</p>
