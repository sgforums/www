              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Last night my CHC friend ended our friendship based on my
              "blasphemic" belief.</p>
              <p>I just finished typing my applause to Zeeleewong when my friend
              surprised me with a visit, flanked by a CHC Brother and Sister. The
              "sister", as turned out my friend's cellgroup leader, did all the
              talking. </p>
              <p>The purpose of their visit was to have a "friendly exchange" on
              Faith. The sister was concerned that the conversations I had with
              my friend seemed to have a negative effect on his belief. She
              claimed: "As Christian brothers and sisters it should be possible
              to have a mature and constructive discussion, and be open to
              different point of views"</p>
              <p>Heck, I am all for healthy conversations - let's talk. </p>
              <p>Whether planned or not, the discussion moved to David Yonggi
              Cho, and his fourth spiritual dimension. The CHC sister elaborated
              on how God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are dwelling in a 4th
              dimension, the 3 other dimensions being the 3D world we live in (3D
              being the x-y-z axis). </p>
              <p>The CHC sister went on to explain that if we imagine things in
              the 4th dimension, God will make them happen in the 3D world. She
              stressed the importance of having a detailed vision of what we want
              - the picture must be accurate and complete. She even gave me an
              example - I quote her: "If you want a car, it is not good enough to
              just ask for a car because than God does not know what you want and
              he cannot provide. However, if you visualize a BMW, colour black,
              7-series, preferred license plate, than God knows what you want and
              will make it happen in the physical 3D world". She then asked my
              opinion.</p>
              <p>I surpressed the word which popped-up in my head immediately
              (BOLLOCKS), and tried to explain in a more diplomatic fashion that
              I find this hard to believe. I explained that I did read something
              similar in a recent book I bought (The SECRET) and went on to
              question the biblical foundation of this doctrine.</p>
              <p>The CHC sister was less diplomatic in her reply. Expressing
              doubts about a message from God's annointed one (David Yonggi Cho)
              and supported by another one of God's annointed (Kong Hee) is proof
              of blasphemy. The blasphemy argument was used to convince my friend
              ("See - We told you so") that I was a blasphemer. On top of that
              "How could I not see how my disbelief is hurting my friends
              feelings?"</p>
              <p>The "idiot" (if you notice some frustration here, you are right)
              acknowledged and officially ended our friendship. I was to never
              contact him again ...blah blah blah. He even thanked his friends
              for making him see the truth. </p>
              <p>This ends my brief CHC adventure.</p>
              <p>What I learned is:<br> It is not possible to help someone who does not want to be helped.
               How to tell a drug addict that taking heroine does not feel
              good? To my friend it feels good and prevents him to see that
              around him his world is falling apart. My door will always be open
              for him but I will stop my efforts in trying to change his
              mind. </p>
              <p>All this leaves a very bitter taste about CITY HARVEST
              CHURCH. <br> <br> I have learned that most of the CHC members are good people and
              dedicated Christians trying to get closer to God.</p>
              <p>I have seriousdoubts and question the leadership of CHC. All
              evidence points at Kong Hee putting his personal interests over the
              well-being of the members. Kong Hee fails to take responsibility in
              his role as spiritual leader. Ignorance is no defense. He is
              accountable to God, but in his time on Earth, he choose to carry
              the burden of looking after the spirituality of his group, and is
              therefore accountable and responsible for every single member. In
              my book, Kong Hee is not doing a great job. </p>
              <p>The size of a church is more important than single members,
              which tells me that Kong Hee is on the wrong path. </p>
              <p>For me, CHC is a non-Christian church with many genuine
              Christians, with a very charismatic yet theologically immature and
              morally questionable teacher focusssed on realizing his personal
              dreams instead of bringing people closer to God. </p>
              <p>This is my personal opinion. I have mine - you have yours.</p>
              <p>Thanks to everybody for contributing to this topic. I most
              certainly learned a lot.</p>
              <p>Take care and God bless.</p>

              <p>Sounds like a book I read before regarding the Law of Attractionn years ago. But I would think that supposedly once we leave this worldly place and transcend beyond the material plane, we are not supposed to be human anymore... to have physical needs and wants. To decay or grow. To feel hunger and fullness. <br><br>Anyways, there is not much one can do. U will always have those that truly believe. I dont blame them. Perhaps they experienced grace ? Like u said, there are genuine God seeking Christians there.  There will always be those core group of people, but it has been shown and proven over time that eventually, it will eat itself from within.</p>
              <p>Undoubtly there will be those that will be disgruntled and will leave the church angry and resentful because they did not gain what they wanted while only having a superficial understanding of Christianity. Or they would seek salvation after the realisation.</p>
              <p>Will CHC in the future end up just like the demise of the magnificent Crystal Cathedral..  bought over by the Catholic after bankruptcy, I dont know.</p>
              <p>End of the day, all will be judged. On this earth or another.</p>

              Hi James
              I totally agreed with your findings and analysis on CHC. On the surface, CHC may receive a lot of endorsement from even the former retired Anglican Bishop. However, underneath it seem that there is no quality teaching being taught. 
              
              They seem to be more concern with quoting Biblical verse out of context. Like Mark 10:30 where they just claim that Jesus promise 100 fold blessing. However, the key word seems to be the fact that Jesus is foretelling the possibility to be persecuted as believer. In fact, history has attested that early Christians were persecuted for their belief. The verse seems to hold out comfort to early believer to endure the suffering and  that believer should rest their hope in the eternal kingdom then the earthly one. 
              
              Beside, look at any history text; one will know that Jesus is not a rich man. I wonder how on earth did prosperity preacher received such revelation. In the academic world, the historian and theologian must be laughing it off.
              
              Finally, does imagining things till the finest detail will lead to a God answered prayers. Hence it implies God is not OMNISCIENCE (all powerful) and OMNIPOTENT (all powerful) as it deemed. That is really interesting, Psalm 44:21 seem to say otherwise.
              
              Zeeleewong
              If you have time, do listen to what Stephen Tong got to say about Charismatic movement.

              http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5xZT-S1-Hc&amp;feature=related
              
              Chinese has a good saying, â€œçœŸé‡‘ä¸�æ€•ç�«â€� real gold is not afraid of fire. Hence Real Christian faith is being able to face the hardship without being waver at one belief. That command respect.

              <p>If I may add, that the CHC sister believes that one has to visualise things (because God does not know what you want and thus cannot provide) in the 4th dimension in order to have it materialise in the 3rd dimension is to deny the divine attribute of omniscience.</p>

              <p>Yes, Jesus prayed that God's Kingdom come and His will be done, but this does not translate to Health &amp; Wealth Gospel.</p>
              <p>Yes, heaven is super abundance, but this does not translate to earth riches for all believers.</p>
              <p>When Jesus was on earth, foxes have holes and birds have nests but He had no place to rest. Neither by life-example of Jesus' and His immediate followers or in their teaching do we get the idea that riches and health are the inherent rights of a believer.</p>

              <p>Hi James<br>I totally agreed with your findings and analysis on <span>CHC</span>. On the surface, <span>CHC</span> may receive a lot of endorsement from even the former retired Anglican Bishop. However, underneath it seem that there is no quality teaching being taught.</p>
              <p>They seem to be more concern with quoting Biblical verse out of context. Like Mark 10:30 where they just claim that Jesus promise 100 fold blessing. However, the key word seems to be the fact that Jesus is foretelling the possibility to be persecuted as believer. In fact, history has attested that early Christians were persecuted for their belief. The verse seems to hold out comfort to early believer to endure the suffering and that believer should rest their hope in the eternal kingdom then the earthly one.</p>
              <p>Beside, look at any history text; one will know that Jesus is not a rich man. I wonder how on earth did prosperity preacher received such revelation. In the academic world, the historian and theologian must be laughing it off.</p>
              <p>Finally, does imagining things till the finest detail will lead to a God answered prayers. Hence it implies God is not <span>OMNISCIENCE</span> (all powerful) and <span>OMNIPOTENT</span> (all powerful) as it deemed. That is really interesting, Psalm 44:21 seem to say otherwise.</p>
              <p>Zeeleewong<br>If you have time, do listen to what Stephen Tong got to say about Charismatic movement.</p>

              <p>Chinese has a good saying, “çœŸé‡‘ä¸�æ€•ç�«” real gold is not afraid of fire. Hence Real Christian faith is being able to face the hardship without being waver at one belief. That command respect.</p>

              <p>I think that depends on where the error lies in. By my lights there are core/essential doctrines that define the faith and these pertains to the salvation of the individual. Compromise or denial of these core truths would be fatal. There are other non-core or peripheral teachings that pertains to the health of the church or the believer. These may not affect the eternal destiny but may affect the walk of a believer.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Last night my CHC friend ended our friendship based on my "blasphemic" belief.</p>
              <p>I just finished typing my applause to Zeeleewong when my friend surprised me with a visit, flanked by a CHC Brother and Sister. The "sister", as turned out my friend's cellgroup leader, did all the talking. </p>
              <p>The purpose of their visit was to have a "friendly exchange" on Faith. The sister was concerned that the conversations I had with my friend seemed to have a negative effect on his belief. She claimed: "As Christian brothers and sisters it should be possible to have a mature and constructive discussion, and be open to different point of views"</p>
              <p>Heck, I am all for healthy conversations - let's talk. </p>
              <p>Whether planned or not, the discussion moved to David Yonggi Cho, and his fourth spiritual dimension. The CHC sister elaborated on how God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit are dwelling in a 4th dimension, the 3 other dimensions being the 3D world we live in (3D being the x-y-z axis). </p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">The CHC sister went on to explain that if we imagine things in the 4th dimension, God will make them happen in the 3D world. She stressed the importance of having a detailed vision of what we want - the picture must be accurate and complete. She even gave me an example - I quote her: "If you want a car, it is not good enough to just ask for a car because than God does not know what you want and he cannot provide. However, if you visualize a BMW, colour black, 7-series, preferred license plate, than God knows what you want and will make it happen in the physical 3D world". She then asked my opinion.</span></strong></p>
              <p>I surpressed the word which popped-up in my head immediately (BOLLOCKS), and tried to explain in a more diplomatic fashion that I find this hard to believe. I explained that I did read something similar in a recent book I bought (The SECRET) and went on to question the biblical foundation of this doctrine.</p>
              <p>The CHC sister was less diplomatic in her reply. Expressing doubts about a message from God's annointed one (David Yonggi Cho) and supported by another one of God's annointed (Kong Hee) is proof of blasphemy. The blasphemy argument was used to convince my friend ("See - We told you so") that I was a blasphemer. On top of that "How could I not see how my disbelief is hurting my friends feelings?"</p>
              <p>The "idiot" (if you notice some frustration here, you are right) acknowledged and officially ended our friendship. I was to never contact him again ...blah blah blah. He even thanked his friends for making him see the truth. </p>
              <p>This ends my brief CHC adventure.</p>
              <p>What I learned is:<br>It is not possible to help someone who does not want to be helped.  How to tell a drug addict that taking heroine does not feel good? To my friend it feels good and prevents him to see that around him his world is falling apart. My door will always be open for him but I will stop my efforts in trying to change his mind. </p>
              <p>All this leaves a very bitter taste about CITY HARVEST CHURCH. <br><br>I have learned that most of the CHC members are good people and dedicated Christians trying to get closer to God.</p>
              <p>I have seriousdoubts and question the leadership of CHC. All evidence points at Kong Hee putting his personal interests over the well-being of the members. Kong Hee fails to take responsibility in his role as spiritual leader. Ignorance is no defense. He is accountable to God, but in his time on Earth, he choose to carry the burden of looking after the spirituality of his group, and is therefore accountable and responsible for every single member. In my book, Kong Hee is not doing a great job. </p>
              <p>The size of a church is more important than single members, which tells me that Kong Hee is on the wrong path. </p>
              <p>For me, CHC is a non-Christian church with many genuine Christians, with a very charismatic yet theologically immature and morally questionable teacher focusssed on realizing his personal dreams instead of bringing people closer to God. </p>
              <p>This is my personal opinion. I have mine - you have yours.</p>
              <p>Thanks to everybody for contributing to this topic. I most certainly learned a lot.</p>
              <p>Take care and God bless.</p>

              <p>James, to put simply, God answers prayers, all of them. But what people fail to appreciate is that that like any other request, He has a right to say No.</p>

              <p>Anyway no point arguing or debating with these fools. Like someone once said -</p>
              <p>Never argue with a fool, they will bring you down tot heir level and beat you with experience.</p>

              <p><br>ha... i so agree with you... and i guess james you are right in that your ex friend has been intoxicated too much to be even objective in his own judging. The mentality of them coming in is not a exchange of faith but a "proving that james is a non believer of faith/troll" they are merely doing it in the name of exchanging of faith/opinion.</p>
              <p>I believe tht so called faith is already too deeply rooted in them that cannot be removed easily. Proof text reading is always a wrong way to proving but to them its evidence. So i wonder if everyone from CHC visualises and wishes for a BMW Black colour 7 series, wont we be flooded?</p>
