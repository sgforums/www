              <p>The CHC weekend services were great. </p>
              <p>Key verse: <strong>"For where your treasure is, there your heart will also be". </strong><br><br>Pastor Kong proved the biblical foundation of seeding.<br>If you invest in the stock-market, you will follow your stocks. That is where your heart will be. If you seed and offer (your treasure) to God, then your heart will automatically be with God. Thank you Pastor Kong. </p>
              <p>Pastor Bill Johnson from the US worked his science, miracles and wonders. Pastor Bill guided our combined prayers to heal terminally ill patients, backpains, stomach aches and financial problems.</p>
              <p>Pastor David Yonggi Cho will visit City Harvest Church next month. You are all welcome to join our service and bear witness of the power of the 4th dimension. </p>
              <p>To all the sceptics on this blog, come and follow a CHC service. You will feel the love of God, and it will transform your life.</p>

              <p>Zeeleewong, sorry no offence, I cant help but notice your posts generally mention "Pastor Kong" said this and that and also there is one line you said:</p>
              <p>"<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">We have unconditional faith in Pastor Kong. If Pastor Kong leaves, we will follow. You can call that cultic, we don't care."</span></p>
              <p>From an angle, it seems that Jesus has been replaced by Pastor Kong and also would like to point out that your unconditional faith should be in with the LORD not Pastor Kong.</p>
              <p>God is always &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pastors so and so, no matther how "holy" these pastors might seem to be, they are still human and they make mistakes.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Of course Pastor Kong is not Jesus. Pastor Kong never claimed he is Jesus. Jesus speaks and heals tru Pastor Kong.</p>
              <p>God has chosen Pastor Kong to bring people to Christ. Like with the Apostle Paul, Jesus revealed himself to Pastor Kong and ask him to do His works. Like Paul, Pastor Kong is building a church for Christ. Like Paul, Pastor Kong has to face a lot of hardship. Read this blog to understand what I mean. Everybody criticise and mock Pastor Kong. As the Romans tortured Paul, CAD is attacking Pastor Kong. Do you know what it is like to be subjected to days of interrogations? </p>
              <p>I have complete faith in Pastor Kong because he changed my life. Where would I be today if it wasn't for Pastor Kong? And it is not only me, Pastor Kong is touching the life's of hundreds of thousands of people. Can you not see how CHC is growing? Pastor Kong is dedicating his life for City Harvest Church. Pastor Kong's life would be so much easier without all the work he is doing, free of charge, for City Harvest Church. Without CHC, Pastor Kong would be the CEO of a company, yet he is sacrificing everything for Christ.   </p>
              <p>Of course Pastor Kong is human but so far he has not made any mistakes. Everything Pastor Kong has prophesied has come to pass. </p>
              <p>Why don't you visit our services in Suntec. You will feel the presence of the Lord.</p>

                          be the CEO of a company, yet he is sacrificing everything for
                          Christ.   </p>
              <p>Of course Pastor Kong is human but so far he has not made any
                          mistakes. Everything Pastor Kong has prophesied has come to
                          pass. </p>

              <p>What the Romans did to Paul was religious persecution. I caution you against defaming the authorities or maybe in future, the courts.</p>
              <p>I heard Kong is no longer paid by the church, he makes money from his books and speaking engagements. Yet his profile as a speaker would be lower if he was not a pastor of his church.</p>
              <p>You have watched too many Channel 8 series. If you wanna charge anyone, no need to interrogate him. Just open his books and use them as evidence.</p>

              <p>Don't count your chickens. No news from the police is usually good news but until they can confirm to him that he's in the clear, there's always a possibilty things can go downhill.</p>
              <p> But also that doesn't mean they were harrassing him. A report must have been lodged and they are duty bound to investigate, the police don't go around investigating and harrassing people for nothing (except maybe opposition members). Somebody in your CHC or close to it (maybe him), must have made a report or complaint for them to start investigations.</p>
              <p>Of course, until he's convicted in a court, he's innocent and I'll fully accept whatever he, you or any of his followers say in defense of his innocence. Even if he's arrested or charged, he's still innocent, he has a right to defend himself and claim the charges are false or wrong. Only if he's convicted, will I accept a claim of guilt on him. I may have suspicions, maybe even make comments disparaging him, but that doesn't mean squat, until there's a conviction.</p>
              <p>As for 'opening the books', the police will never do that in an ongoing investigation, only when it's needed as evidence in court to support their claims. 'Opening the books' for public scrutiny is entirely up to Kong Hee. He may want to wait until he gets the all clear from the Police (or in reality the AG's chambers), or at any time he chooses. But I suspect under legal advise from his lawyers, he'll probably wait, unless of course he's already done so.</p>
              <p>And I do know what actually happens in an interrogation as a former policeman. It's not like what you suggest with Paul and the Romans. Of course even interrogations in the CAD or CID, is no walk in the park, but he wasn't physically tortured. If he was, he had every opportunity to report this and get the officers involved charged</p>

              <p>Of course, police  and CAD officers being enforcement officers aligned with the prosecution, will not question or interrogate him in the same manner as his defence counsel would.</p>
              <p>They have to be suspicious and as a basic tactic, disbelief any thing he says in the initial stage, hence the accusations during interrogation. However, the CAD and police are tasked to investigate a case, and that means finding out the truth.</p>
              <p>They have a duty to investigate whatever he raises in his denials or defense. Only after they have done all this - both what the complaintnant has alleged and recovery of any evidence ( documenatry or oral testimonies, if any) and what he has raised in his denials and defense (witness statements, documents etc, if any), then they will send the file to the AG's chambers. There, a DPP will decide if there's enough evidence based on the facts for him to be charged in court (or given a warning), or if there's insufficient or no evidence to support a charge.</p>
              <p>Since it's 2 years, and I accept what you suggest, that it should have been long enough for them to decide, if there's any truth (or evidence to suggest) that an offence has been made to warrant a charge (s). Therefore you and CHC members must urge your pastor, to demand an explanation from the AG's chambers or the CAD.  He should demand a reply from them, if they don't want to charge, they should say so officially and not let this 'hang on his head', and allow more innuendo or allegations of wrong-doing to remain. If they aren't then, he's has every right to feel vindicated and demand that detarctors should shut up, because he's clearly innocent.</p>

              <p>The CHC weekend services were great. </p>
              <p>Key verse: <strong>"For where your treasure is, there your
              heart will also be". </strong><br> <br> Pastor Kong proved the biblical foundation of seeding.<br> If you invest in the stock-market, you will follow your stocks.
              That is where your heart will be. If you seed and offer (your
              treasure) to God, then your heart will automatically be with God.
              Thank you Pastor Kong. </p>
              <p>Yes what your pastor has said and 
              the illustration he has used is correct. It should be followed or 
              emulated, however it appears the good pastor has forgotten to mention 
              further (from your post).</p>
              <p>The verse clearly states in it's literal meaning, where ever you 
              place something important to you (can be the literal treasure - property
               or cash, or the figurative, if you son or daughter is your treasure), 
              your heart will be in it all the way. If you offer that treasure to God,
               you will be in union with Him, as your pastor said.</p>
              <p>But it also must be taken in another more pertinent context and 
              retain its' meaning. If you make Jesus, doing His Will or the Gospel 
              your treasure, and that's where your heart will be also. In fact in 
              Matthew and Luke, the verses continues to advise people not to build too
               much treasure on earth, which isn't permanent, at the expense of doing 
              His Will. Instead, it advises to build treasures in heaven more, which 
              is permanent. And by making that your treasure, that's where your heart will be.</p>
              <p>There's nothing in either Matthew or Luke to suggest that you 
              should 'seed', build your treasure and thereafter offer it to God, or in
               offering your treasure to God, you can expect to be blessed with 
              'greater returns' on your treasure.</p>
              <p>In fact both Matthew and Luke advises to not to worry about
               all these, go and sell your possessions, give to the poor etc. God also
               provides for the ravens and birds, and will provide for you. He 
              understands your needs, but build your treasure in His kingdom first, 
              and these things will be provided for you. That's is where your heart 
              should be in regards to your treasure. God first that is the treasure 
              that your heart should follow.</p>
              <p>Anyway how you want to interpret it is up to you. You may want to 
              take all Kong Hee says as absolutely 100% correct. But remember many are
               called, few are chosen. Jesus even said that even those who believed 
              they were doing His will and calling out to Him, can be doing the wrong 
              thing.</p>
              <p>My message is more others who read this, and want instead 
              to focus more on the Word, than what is said or interpreted by 
              'messengers'. My advise to you is, fair enough listen to what the pastor
               says, but analyse it, if it's good and correct follow it. But if you 
              think maybe, he got this one slight wrong or not perhaps 100%, then find
               the missing % and get the correct message in its entirety.</p>
