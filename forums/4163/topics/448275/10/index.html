Hopefully, he/she will come to realize that God gives us hardship so we can face life's challenges better. Hopefully he/she and all of you will come to see that there is an alternative called CHC. There really is no need to face life's challenges on your own. In CHC we look after our family.</p>

              </p><p>@ Alize: There is no way to tell if Zeeleewong and my friend know each other. I doesn't matter. </p>
              <p>CHC will refer to Zeeleewong's actions as "over-zealous". </p>
              <p>Although my friend agrees with Zeeleewong, I doubt if other CHC members would voice their "zeal" in the same manner. </p>
              <p>Within CHC, a "Thank God giving us such a great leader and this wonderful building" results in praise and hallelluja's from fellow members. Outside CHC, this type of behaviour raises eyebrows.</p>
              <p>CHC members are not equipped to answer any sceptical questions. So many CHC members will keep these thoughts to themselves, and prefer to avoid the "sensitive" discussions with non-CHC-believers (as referred to by Pinknutri). </p>
              <p>I wonder if Zeeleewong, seemingly frustrated by the "resistance" of the people posting here, would dare to speak up in public. Calling somebody "Satan-lover" in a blog, is not the same as doing this face-to-face. </p>
              <p>I doubt that Kong Hee is happy with the "free CHC advertising" displayed by Zeeleewong. Kong Hee is the King in his little CHC castle where nobody can touch or question his authority. Drawing special attention from sceptical outsiders over which Kong Hee has no emotional control, is not in his interest. Talking to numbed followers is not the same as talking to rational outside Christians.</p>
              <p>Would Kong Hee be capable of having a mature discussion on faith with somebody like BroInChrist? I doubt so.</p>

              <p>@ Acx1688: </p>
              <p>Does CHC have a charity arm? Interesting question - I browsed the CHC site.</p>
              <p>On the CHC website, "City Harvest Community Services Association" (CHCSA) is indicated as the CHC community Services.</p>
              <p>To my surprise, CHCSA publishes a financial statement <br>(see following link: http://www.chcsa.org.sg/2012/financial_statements.htm)  </p>
              <p>In the statement for 2009 we see that following charity spendings by CHCSA:</p>
              <p><strong>Local charity: 327,000 SGD</strong> </p>
              <p><strong>Overseas charity: 27,000 SGD</strong> </p>
              <p>Salaries (9 fulltime staff): 380,000 SGD </p>
              <p>Operating/Admin cost: 156,000 SGD</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Based on the information available, this means that the 30,000 CHC members united, managed to give 10+ SGD each to local community services in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Well done City Harvest Church.</p>

Things<br> are not much different here in the States. We too are awash<br> with mega-churches which, whatever their doctrine, promote<br> superficiality over spirituality. Even bigger problems come<br> when the church is or becomes a cult. It is sometimes<br> difficult to draw that line, but in general terms when<br> personality, entertainment, numbers and money take center<br> stage, the church/group moves to the tipping point. From<br> there, the allure of false doctrine is very strong, because<br> false doctrines are always much more capable of catapulting<br> personalities to greater fame, exciting the sheep, drawing<br> in more victims, and fleecing them more effectively. Before<br> going on, here are some links at the site you might want to<br> consult first:<br> <br> Read Your Bible: Protection against Cults (includes<br> "cult characteristics"). &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/readbible.htm"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/readbible.htm</span></a>&gt;<br> <br> Mega-Churches, Emergent Christianity, Spirituality and<br> Materialism.<br> &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/mail-Mega-Church-Materialism.htm"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/mail-Mega-Church-Materialism.htm</span></a>&gt;<br> <br> The persuasiveness of the tribulational false religion.<br> &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/Tribulation_Part_3A.htm#2%29%20The%20persuasiveness%20of%20the%20tribulational%20false%20religion"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/Tribulation_Part_3A.htm#2%29%20The%20persuasiveness%20of%20the%20tribulational%20false%20religion</span></a>&gt;<br> <br> Dysfunctional Churches.<br> &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/mail-Dysfunctional-Churches.htm"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/mail-Dysfunctional-Churches.htm</span></a>&gt;<br> <br> The Situation of the Church and "church-visible" on the<br> Eve of the Tribulation.<br> &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/Tribulation_Part_3A.htm#2.%20The%20Situation%20of%20the%20Church%20and%20%22church-visible%22%20on%20the%20Eve%20of%20the%20Tribulation"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/Tribulation_Part_3A.htm#2.%20The%20Situation%20of%20the%20Church%20and%20%22church-visible%22%20on%20the%20Eve%20of%20the%20Tribulation</span></a>:&gt;<br> <br> On the issue of convincing people that the tripe they have<br> bought into is just that, as I often say I am not gifted in<br> the area of apologetics. Your description of "name-it-claim<br> -it" as a short-hand for the prosperity gospel strikes me as<br> being right on the mark, and, quite frankly, this "4th<br> dimension" seems to me to be just a clever re-working of<br> that heresy. The whole idea behind both false doctrines is<br> that we can control God and make Him do what we want; and<br> inevitably what we want is material blessing rather than<br> anything spiritual. It's difficult to know where to start<br> when dealing with this mind-set which, I may add, is the<br> normal non-Christian, pseudo-Christian, and<br> marginal-Christian status quo. Everyone would like to<br> believe that we are here on earth after salvation to be<br> blessed materially and "have a good life" -- and, well, who<br> wouldn't want to have a rosy life with no troubles? And<br> can't God do that for us, being all-powerful? Of course He<br> could. The problem is that all this is not only /*not*/ in<br> the Bible but is actually antithetical to the entire plan of<br> God. If I were trying to convince someone, I would start<br> with the fact that the prosperity gospel is not in the Bible<br> and that Bible represents the Christian life a difficult and<br> challenging thing with persecution not boundless prosperity<br> being the rule -- for those who are following Jesus Christ<br> in truth.<br> <br> And when they had preached the gospel to that city and<br> made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium,<br> and Antioch, strengthening the souls of the disciples,<br> exhorting [them] to continue in the faith, and [saying],<br> "*/We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom<br> of God/*."<br> Acts 14:21-22 NIV<br> <br> Paul and company didn't tell these new believers about some<br> "fourth dimension" or just to "name it" and they could have<br> a cornucopia of blessing fall into their lives. Why not?<br> Because that is not the way it is -- at all. We are here to<br> demonstrate by the growth and perseverance of our faith<br> /through tribulations/ that our faith is genuine (cf.<br> 1Pet.1:6-7), and by the testing and refining of it to gain<br> glory for the Lord and reward /in eternity/, rather than in<br> this life (e.g., Matt.6:19-20; 2Cor.4:17). That is why Jesus<br> told us to "count the cost" before committing to being His<br> disciples, because the road ahead is /harder/ for our giving<br> our lives to Him, */not/* easier:<br> <br> "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and<br> mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes,<br> and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. "And<br> whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot<br> be My disciple. "For which of you, intending to build a<br> tower, does not sit down first and count the cost,<br> whether he has [enough] to finish [it]-- "lest, after he<br> has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all<br> who see [it] begin to mock him, "saying, 'This man began<br> to build and was not able to finish.' "Or what king,<br> going to make war against another king, does not sit<br> down first and consider whether he is able with ten<br> thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty<br> thousand? "Or else, while the other is still a great way<br> off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.<br> "So likewise, */whoever of you does not forsake all that<br> he has cannot be My disciple/*."<br> Luke 14:26-33 NKJV<br> <br> Being a true disciple requires sacrifice, and as we go grow<br> up in Jesus Christ things get more challenging, not less so.<br> God prunes those who are bearing fruit so that we may bear<br> even more (Jn.15:2), but those who go their own way and do<br> not remain in Him -- which fate all who follow false<br> doctrines and cults are at least flirting with -- are thrown<br> into the fire and burned (Jn.15:6). Jesus was poor. Paul was<br> poor. Virtually all of the great believers were not only<br> deprived in material terms but suffered all manner of trials<br> and tribulations:<br> <br> Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were<br> chained and put in prison. They were stoned [fn]; they<br> were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword.<br> They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute,<br> persecuted and mistreated--the world was not worthy of<br> them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in<br> caves and holes in the ground. These were all commended<br> for their faith, yet none of them received what had been<br> promised.<br> Hebrews 11:36-39 NIV<br> <br> These great believers did not "receive what was promised"<br> because the promise we are looking forward to in Jesus<br> Christ is the resurrection, reunion with Him, an eternal<br> reward and eternal life in the New Jerusalem. But if we are<br> looking to the things of the earth instead, how is it that<br> we do not have our perspective exactly backward from what<br> the Lord wants from us?<br> <br> Since, then, you have been raised with Christ, set your<br> hearts on things above, where Christ is seated at the<br> right hand of God. Set your minds on things above, not<br> on earthly things. For you died, and your life is now<br> hidden with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your<br> life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.<br> Colossians 3:1-4 NIV<br> <br> Do not love the world or anything in the world. If<br> anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in<br> him. For everything in the world--the cravings of sinful<br> man, the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he<br> has and does--comes not from the Father but from the<br> world. The world and its desires pass away, but the man<br> who does the will of God lives forever.<br> 1st John 2:15-17 NIV<br> <br> Yes I know they will mention Abraham. But Abraham had to<br> wait until he was 100 years old until he received what he<br> wanted most, a son -- and then he was called upon to slit<br> his son's throat in obedience to the Lord. So I suppose if<br> we are as patient as Abraham so as to wait 50 years "to<br> claim it" and if we are then actually and genuinely willing<br> to give it right back to God not theoretically but<br> viscerally and irrevocably, then we too may "get something".<br> Of course the heir for whom Abraham waited had been<br> specifically promised to him as in integral part of God's<br> plan for forming Israel, and surely that makes his situation<br> unique for that reason too (along with a whole host of others).<br> <br> These are the last days of the Church, and it was prophesied<br> by John in the book of Revelation that they would be days of<br> appalling lukewarmness (see the link: Laodicea<br> &lt;<a href="http://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2A.htm#7.%20Laodicea:%20%22The%20Era%20of%20Degeneration%22%20%281882%20to%202026%20=%20144%20years%29"><span style="color: #0068cf;">http://ichthys.com/Tribulation-Part2A.htm#7.%20Laodicea:%20%22The%20Era%20of%20Degeneration%22%20%281882%20to%202026%20=%20144%20years%29</span></a>&gt;).<br> Hence my dilemma in attempting to answer your question. For<br> it seems to me that for a Christian who is genuinely<br> committed to hearing what Jesus is saying and really wanting<br> to follow Him, any one of the verses quoted or cited above<br> would be sufficient to cause him/her to part company with a<br> fellowship which has it completely backward, one that is<br> telling him/her what he/she /*wants*/ to hear and clearly<br> not what the Bible is saying from cover to cover. For if a<br> person has stopped up the ears to the point of no longer<br> being willing to listen to such a clear and consistent<br> message from scripture -- especially as there is absolutely<br> no biblical support for the other side -- then the odds of<br> said person turning around based upon what I would have to<br> say are minimal. I admire people who enter onto that<br> battlefield, come what may, and I stand willing to "lift up<br> my banner in the Name of the Lord" when they (you) are<br> successful.<br> <br> I hope you will find the above of some use in your noble<br> quest, and I am happy to continue our conversation and/or<br> answer any other question you may have.<br> <br> Yours in the One who sacrificed more than we can presently<br> know that we might reign as kings with Him -- in eternity --<br> Jesus Christ our Lord.</span></p>
