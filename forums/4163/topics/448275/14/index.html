              <p>Somewhere before the next service, the cell group leaders
              collect the receipts (which are not sealed in an envelope). The

              transparency".  At the next service, the cell group leaders
              will distribute your receipts to you.Guess what happens if you

              <p>Neither am I talking about coercion to give, so you are beating a strawman argument here.</p>
              <p>But one can indoctrinate you to willingly part with your money which should have been used on family needs.</p>
              <p>The way you put it is that all fault lies with the giver and never with the person from the pulpit. It's dangerous if you make the leader immune from Biblical scrutiny and criticism.</p>

              <p>You claimed that there is no indoctrination, this would be incorrect. Indoctrination always takes place, the issue is what kind of indoctrination and whether it is within Biblical bounds. And I think what most people would want to know (including James) is exactly what CHC teaches, and coming from CHC folks themselves. Specifically, what does CHC teaches with regards to health and wealth? Why did James' friend behave or think the way he did? Who did he listen to?</p>

              <p>
              </p><p>BroInChrist, do you believe that being poor, ill or disabled is equals blessing in the eyes of the Lord? Pastor Kong is teaching us the responsibility of tithing and giving cheerfully. We do live a happier life thanks to God's living word. We are taught that God does not encourage us to trust Him, only to deny us good health and wealth. We believe that God does not enjoy people being broke. We believe there is nothing wrong with being healthy and wealthy. Did you ever hear Jesus say  that it is not His Will to heal? I find lots of references in the Bible with people receiving wealth and health. I guess it depends how you look at things.</p>
              <p></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no idea why James friend is acting the way he is. When a church grows as big as City Harvest Church, you occassionally get people who act irresponsible. Generalizing this is wrong.</p>

              <p>Zeeleewong, I am not surprised that you feel your world is fine, and instead "others" are in need of assistance. </p>
              <p>Everybody has the right to believe anything they choose - just ensure that no deception was used. BroInChrist is right when he says indoctrination always takes place. If indoctrination without consent is used to convert someone to the CHC beliefs, whatever this may be, than the rights of the person involved have been abused.</p>
              <p>Similar to my friend, you seem to have lost the ability to critically assess the information given to you by CHC. In my view, failure to assess information because they contradict your belief system, is a sign of effective mind control.</p>
              <p>If you have been in CHC for more than 1 year, I am sure that you will have noticed that the CHC teachings are flawed. Not everybody receives a 100-fold right? If Kong Hee is correct, everybody in CHC would be healty and rich beyond belief. You know that this is not the case. You can witness yourself that the only one getting rich is Kong Hee himself.</p>
              <p>What I fail to grasp is why you, as well as my dear friend, despite obvious failing of the prosperity teachings continue to defend CHC, and continue to idolize its leader. In todays time and age, I find this very scary.</p>
              <p>Having said all of the above, dear Zeeleewong, I applaud you for reading critical information against CHC and posting replies in this blog. Could this be a sign that not all is lost for you? If more CHC members would be open for critical and open feedback, we might get a serious dialogue going. Any chance of you convincing your CHC friends to join in?</p>

              <p>James, regarding your above post, I read an article on US megachurches that should be of interest to you.</p>
              <p>The article said that members do not mind, and are even happy, if their leaders become rich beyond belief or if their church spends a lot. They are happy if the wealth results in new members being attracted to the church. A simple search should give you the article.</p>

              <p>BroInChrist, do you believe that being poor, ill or disabled is equals blessing in the eyes of the Lord? Pastor Kong is teaching us the responsibility of tithing and giving cheerfully. We do live a happier life thanks to God's living word. We are taught that God does not encourage us to trust Him, only to deny us good health and wealth. We believe that God does not enjoy people being broke. We believe there is nothing wrong with being healthy and wealthy. Did you ever hear Jesus say  that it is not His Will to heal? I find lots of references in the Bible with people receiving wealth and health. I guess it depends how you look at things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no idea why James friend is acting the way he is. When a church grows as big as City Harvest Church, you occassionally get people who act irresponsible. Generalizing this is wrong.</p>

              <p>Doesn't your church leaders teach you that we live in a fallen world, which is why there are things such as suffering and death? Do you believe that? Or do you think that those who are suffering or poor are not recipients of God's blessings? What does CHC teach you?</p>
              <p>You said Kong Hee teaches you to tithe and give cheerfully. But does he teach you that tithing is NOT a requirement under the New Covenant? I ask you to provide me an instance in the NT where believers are taught that they must tithe their income to the church. Just one. Yes, we should give cheerfully.</p>
              <p>Where in the Bible is it taught that those who trust in God are full of health and wealth? Your leaders may teach this, but is this what the Bible teaches?</p>
              <p>You said God does not enjoy people being poor. Again no where is this taught in the Bible. It is fallacious to claim that those who are critical of the H&amp;W movement are people who think that there is something wrong with being healthy and wealthy. There is nothing wrong with both. What is wrong is to claim that these are what believers should get when they become believers. Neither the Scriptures or reality bears this out.</p>
              <p>You just need to give me NT examples of believers being promised health and wealth. When Jesus walked the earth, He healed many who came to Him in faith. I am sure there were also many who left without healing because they did not come to Him in faith. It's not about how one chooses to look at things, it's about what the Bible teaches and whether your beliefs are exegetically sound.</p>

              <p>From what I know, NCC requires that "those serving in any ministry should tithe faithfully".Among other things, they also cannot have premarital sex or "a lifestyle of frequenting nightspots" and are to be "submissive to their superiors".</p>
