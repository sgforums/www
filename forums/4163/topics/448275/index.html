              </p><p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I hope people can see the humour of this, and start to think again.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">1. Confess to the world that you love Jesus, and intend to follow Him and devote your life to Him. It does not matter if you do not mean it, just saying it will guarantee acceptance from your CHC brothers and sisters.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">2. Acquire the skill of speaking in tongues, get water-baptized and claim you feel that your life has been change. Do not pass on any opportunity to claim that your conversion is attributed to Kong Hee only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">3. Attend all CHC services and events. In case you fail to go to service, follow the service on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac Workbook. Consequently post some willy nilly phrases on your facebook to create the impression that you were in church. If you do not own a iPAd or iPhone, pretend to put money in the envelope yet instead use it to purchase this necessity.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">4.Use following rules of conduct during worship:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">-- Put your face into the “gaze into eternity” mode: practice to perfection in front of the mirror.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">-- Raise your hands in devotion: this part is easy ,just follow your neighbour worshipper.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Sing along with all the songs. If you do not know the words, pretend as the music is so loud that nobody will tell the difference</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Always stand up when asked to do so, and start to clap frantically when Kong Hee releases the “Let’s-give-the-lord-a-clap” command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">-- Wiping away a tear once in a while and sighing every 4 minutes might get you on the video screen. This earns respect from fellow worshippers</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">-- Shout “Amen”, “Hallelujah”, “Praise the lord”, “Thank you Jesus” or read the words in bold on the screen out loud, when instructed by Kong Hee.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--This is also the time to put your newly acquired “speaking in tongues” into practice. Don't be nervous and do not hold back, just shut down your brain and make it up as you go along. everybody else does. A few beers before service might help.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Extra devotional points, and guaranteed camera coverage can be obtained by falling to the floor, shaking your body, laughing frantically while yelling “AH-JAYSUS”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--If any first timers stand up next to you, be the first to welcome them to the greatest church in Singapore. If hot and sexy, hug them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Always check who is sitting next to you. Ensure you are seated next to good looking fellow members. Chances are, Kong Hee will ask you to hug them, or hold their hand. And when, no need to hold back, give it a good squeeze as Kong Hee has allowed you to do.   </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">5. Every service, make sure you put a large amount of money in the bucket. Make sure that everyone in your vicinity sees you giving money. Try to get camera attention by letting the tears run from your eyes. If you have no money, pretend, the room is too dark  for anybody to notice. Better to keep the money for the cellgroup meeting’s offering, so you can boast how generous you are, and avoid being reported to Kong Hee.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">6. When listening to Kong Hee, or your CHC friends, occasionally confuse something they say with something that Jesus had said. This will impress them, and they will think highly of you. Or at least you will not be blacklisted yet.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">7. Stop reading the Bible. Only read from your notes from CHC Bible school, or the services. Preferably learn following verses by heart, or have page markers, so you can quickly pull them out:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Malachi 3:10<br>Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven<strong style="font: inherit;">AND POUR OUT SO MUCH BLESSING THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ROOM ENOUGH TO STORE IT.</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Joshua 1:8 <br>for then thou shalt make thy way <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPEROUS</strong>, and then thou shalt <strong style="font: inherit;">HAVE GOOD SUCCESS</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Isaiah 54:17<br>No weapon that is formed against thee shall <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPER</strong>; </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">3 John 1:2<br>I wish above all things that thou mayest <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPER</strong> and be in <strong style="font: inherit;">HEALTH</strong>, even as thy soul<strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPERETH</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Phil 4:18<br>But my God <strong style="font: inherit;">SHALL SUPPLY ALL YOUR NEED ACCORDING TO HIS RICHES</strong> …</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">2 Cor 8:9<br>For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was <strong style="font: inherit;">RICH</strong> (important to stop the verse right here )</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Job 8:5,7 <br>and make the habitation of thy righteousness <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPEROUS</strong>. 7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should <strong style="font: inherit;">GREATLY INCREASE</strong> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Job 22:25<br>Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have <strong style="font: inherit;">PLENTY OF SILVER</strong>.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Avoid any verses that sound like: suffering of Christ -- Camels going thru needle eyes -- Thou shall be content -- the Son of God had nowhere to lay is head  -- Thou shall not add anything to the Word of God -- Only 2 maximum 3 can speak in tongues -- False prophets come with great signs …</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">and discard all the verses where God kills firstborns, pregnant women, as you have not learned to put them into context, it might damage your gullible spirituality.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">8. Regularly quote Kong Hee. This will impress other CHC’ers of your “Biblical” knowledge, even if you do not know squat about theology.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">9. Believe in all Kong Hee’s, or CHC guest’s revelations, regardless of how silly they may seem.   Even if you do not believe in them, just pretend, same as everybody else.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">10. Abandon all sound reason and critical thinking. This is imperative. It is not possible to become an honest CHC member if you question Kong Hee’s teachings with reason or scepticism. This would be the fastest way for you to become a “backslider”.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">11. Smile a lot to everyone you see. Say you love them even when you hate them. You must pretend at all costs, to love your worst enemies even if it kills them in the end. This is even more valid towards NCC and FCBC members. See also next point.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">12. Attempt to convert your “unbelieving” friends. This means mainstream Christians, as well as NCC and FCBC non-believers. Make an ass out of yourself to the point of getting them angry. Make sure you always keep smiling and tell them how much you love them. This will escalate their anger and leave you fully satisfied. If they persist, claim that they are in league with the Devil and only faith in Jesus can release them (make sure you keep smiling).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">13. If anyone presents reasonable arguments against CHC, simply go into denial. Say that their tempting only makes your faith grow stronger. Never submit to them. No worries, after 3 services or so, the Kong Hee mantra “Do not let them hijack your faith” will kick in automatically.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">14. If anybody quotes a verse from the Bible that contradicts Kong Hee’s position, simply say that they're taking that verse out of context. The out-of-context ploy will get you out of many difficult situations and will make it seem that you actually understand the correct context when in fact you don't.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">15. Advertise your CHC membership.<br>Examples: keep a Kong Hee (for the females*) or Sun Ho (for the males*) picture in your wallet or use him as your wallpaper. Always positive to wear Ed Hardy clothes from Christian Audigier or accessoires from Skin Couture. * The reverse is not allowed as Kong Hee does not like gay people.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">16. Show unconditional support to Kong Hee. If the situation requires, drag banners into service or call to arms on the internet. Violently disagree when accussed of idolizing Kong Hee or Sun Ho</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">17. Marry within the church and send your kids to the free-of charge brainwash sessions in “children’s church. Profess family values. If you catch your hubby cheating on you, never let CHC know. Never get a divorce, regardless of how miserable you both feel. If the news does get out, pray you have money so you can have the Jack Neo treatment.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">18. Buy all the "devotional" material that is on offer. Make sure your cell group leader hears about this. If it is Sun Ho developed stuff, buy in 10-fold to ensure extra blessings.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">19. The ultimate sacrifice and and all time CHC nr. 1 will always be: Give your possessions away to CHC. The Bible says give all you have to anyone who asks (Luke 6:30). Kong Hee is asking every week to give him all your money, to sell your house, car,… Warning: If you do not do this, you are disobeying a direct Jesus request. However, if you do obey this command, Kong Hee will guarantee you a Christian position and you will garner his greatest esteem and respect until the well dries up.</p>

              <p>1. We accept everybody that loves Jesus</p>
              <p>2. Speaking in tongues is not a skill we learn. It is the Holy Spirit speaking thru us.</p>
              <p>3. We enjoy going to service. If we miss a service we feel sad. We do not always give but there is no need to pretend</p>
              <p>4. We do not act. We feel the presence of the Lord. All we do comes from the heart and our relationship with Jesus Christ</p>
              <p>5. Not all of us tithe. I personally do not like to appear on the screen</p>
              <p>6. Jesus speaks thru Pastor Kong</p>
              <p>7. Thanks to CHC and Bible school, I am who I am today. Strong, confident and happy. You quote some of my favorite verses. I believe God wants us to prosper. I have faith in the Lord. The Lord will bless me if I believe with all my heart. How else can we support the poor and needy if we are poor ourselves?</p>
              <p>8. I have been to Bible school. I know the Bible very well</p>
              <p>9. So far, all Pastor Kong's revelations have come to pass</p>
              <p>10. There are no backsliders in CHC</p>
              <p>11. I have friends who go to NCC. I do love them dearly. </p>
              <p>12. Of course I try to convince my friends. I want them to be blessed just like me</p>
              <p>13. Our faith is build on solid ground. There is no need for us to be in denial</p>
              <p>14. I have been to Bible school. I know how to read the Bible correctly</p>
              <p>15. I like Ed Hardy. This has nothing to do with CHC</p>
              <p>16. Kong Hee is dedicating his life for us. That is why we love him so much</p>
              <p>17. I am not married yet. Of course I would like to find a husband with the same belief system.</p>
              <p>18. I buy Pastor Sun CD's because she is a great singer and a wonderful person. The profits of her CD's is used to build churches and shelters around the world for helpless people. I love Pastor Sun. I hope to become like her one day.</p>
              <p>19. We give with a free heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God bless! </p>

              <p>With open mind, I went to the CHC service last Saturday. Good thing I went because Pastor Kong blessed us with a Revelation. Read on...</p>
              <p>I forced myself to try and see the positive side of things but failed miserably. My bad.</p>
              <p>Faithfull to hypnosis 101, and how to use cardiovascular beats to increase suggestibility, the service opened with the usual Karaoke. A constipated worship leader (It is not nice to say this but I cannot get around the thought that this probably very nice person, and definitely a gifted musician, has bowel problems). Same songs return every week: "Author and Savior" and I caught myself tapping my foot to the beat. Very catchy indeed.</p>
              <p>The karaoke lasted for about 30 minutes, with the occassional Tongue speaking, then Pastor Tan Ye Peng entered the arena to take it to the next level. <br><br>"Let's not allow anything to stand in your way", "Open your mind", "Open your mind for Jesus", "Let everything fall aside", "Open your mind for Jesus", "Shiri ala bala chiriala", "Open your mouth", "Let Jesus come into this place", "Wonderful things are going to happen to us today", "God is gonna come and speak to us today", "Open your mind", ""Shiri ala bala chiriala",...&lt;Jesus enters&gt;..."Let's give the Lord a big hand for his presence."</p>
              <p>He sounded very much like one of those S$2.50 hypnosis tapes you can by at your friendly buddhist nieghborhood store.</p>
              <p>At this point, everybody is standing up, eyes closed, hands towards the invisible Jesus, all speaking in tongues.</p>
              <p>"God will touch us in a very special way", "Turn to your neighbor and say:"Jesus loves you, and I love you".  I took my own advice, and made sure I sat next to a good-looking worshipper. Kinda nice to look her straight in the eye while saying with a soft voice "I love you". It paid off as I took her for a drink and dinner after the show of which I will not report. ;)</p>
              <p>Pastor Whu Yu Zhuang took over: <br>"Since it is the first weekend of the month we have to take communion" - as if this is some annoying formality to be fulfilled. To prove it is a burden, the Apostle's creed and the Lord's prayer was rushed thru at the speed of light.</p>
              <p>While the pastor blasphemed: "Thank you Jesus for taking away poverty and giving us prosperity by dying on the cross", I was still grinning about the creed which literally states: "I believe in the holy catholic church" - and the "Do not leed us into temptation". Talking about hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>We were almost ready to start the tithes and offerings, but first special guests from Taiwan were welcomed. Pastor Abraham (funny Taiwanese name) Ku and his wife. To prove the point that all Pastors indeed are rich, Mrs. Ku was loaded with diamonds from top-to-bottom. I am sure she is a nice old lady, but hard to believe that giving to the poor can be found in her dictionary.</p>
              <p>Tithing can start. Some willy nilly verses were quoted such as 1 Kings 8:34,38. <br>Israel (meaning he who battles with God) is not the most humid place on the planet so rain was kinda important. The Pastor conveniently skipped verses 35,36,37, which would have made clear this verse is about rain, to translate this into the more suitable: God will hear whoever pays (stretches out his hand) to "Arise and Build".</p>
              <p>Interesting comment from the Pastor: "We are in the market place, and we want to stay in the market place, so prepare to give many tithes and offerings". The pastor thanked God for the Suntec convention centre. Finally saying: "God will act quickly if we give by multiplying". It is so absurd when writing this on a Monday morning, but in church you can literally feel a pressure to give. Somehow it seems not right not to give. Amazing how powerful peer-pressure can be.</p>
              <p>I will skip the announcements to move on to an international guest. Mrs Sarah Kips, the latest X-factor winner in the Netherlands, and married to a CHC overseas pastor. I have only one thing to comment: This lady has a voice like an angel. Absolutely fantastic and amazing. I will go back to CHC anytime when she is singing. Maybe they can replace the constipated one with her - attendance will go thru the roof.</p>
              <p>6:09 Finally Pastor Kong enters the scene. Pastor Kong ranted on, mainly about himself, for about 1 hour. I will shorten and stick to the message.</p>
              <p><strong>God loves us like a father loves his child.</strong> <br><br>Kong Hee's own testimony of what a wonderful father he is to his son, as well as following verses were used to drive this point home:</p>
              <p><em style="background-color: #fffff8; font-family: Helvetica, Univers, sans-serif; font-size: medium; line-height: normal; text-align: -webkit-auto; ">Exodus 21:15,17 A child who hits or curses his parents must be executed</em></p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto; "><em>2 Kings 10:17 <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Univers, sans-serif; line-height: normal; background-color: #fffff8; font-size: medium; ">They took the king's sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel</span></em></p>
              <p><em>Hosea 13:16 ...Their little ones will be dashed to the ground, their pregnant women ripped open</em></p>
              <p>My notes were hard to read so I might have misread a few verses. ;) For the confused CHC folks - go google on difference between ceremonial, moral and legalistic laws of the old testament. You might find that circumcision, tithing and abstinence from pork, ...is no longer required.</p>
              <p>Back to Kong:<br>Kong's sermon was one big plead for pity. For the larger part we had to listen to Kong pitying himself, poor son had rash because of first class travel jetlag, poor Kong had depression because of wrong investment decision, poor Kong has to fly back and forth to his Mansion in LA. And do not get me wrong. This guy is good. He is a fantastic speaker. He literally moved people to tears. Due to all this "hardship" in his life he was ready to give up. But than it happened. God spoke to him in the airport!!!! Hallelluja.</p>
              <p>What did the Lord of Lords, Who spoke to Moses, have to say to Kong? Did he pass on any message? Did he pass on new commandments? Did God come as a burning bush? No, no and no.</p>
              <p>God whispered in his ear. <br>And God said:"Thank you Kong - I love you!" - <br>Isn't God the greatest?</p>
              <p>It was indeed a pityful performance but I bet 99% of the people in the room actually believed it. If this is not boasting "Not only did God speak to me, the great Kong Hee" " No no no, the King of Kings, who did not reply to the pleads of his own son when dying on the cross, took the time to whisper a "Thank you" to Kong.</p>
              <p>Delusional - or - lying...one of the two.</p>

              <p>Pastor Kong dedicates his life to us. He is transforming so many lives by bringing hundreds of thousands of people around the world to Jesus. Did you know that he is not receiving any payments? Did you know he went through a lot of suffering and hardship for us?  Pastor Kong lives up to his promises. He promised us a place to worship, and God gave us Suntect City. What more do you need?</p>
              <p>You have been to our services but could not feel the presence of the Lord? I have no explanation. We can all feel the Holy Spirit, like a fire in our heart, talking through Pastor Kong. You have hardened your heart. When you open up your heart, you will feel what all of us are experiencing every week. God is good. God is love. And God will bless us financially, because He wants us to prosper. God is our father and he will not short-change us.</p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal">I found an article on mind control interesting enough to
              apply it to CHC. The original article was written by Mr. John Blatt and can be

              impairing, or compelling process through the gradual application of
              PSYCHOLOGICAL FORCES.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The coercive persuasion program - within CHC it is
              called "The CHC Statements of Faith" - is a behavioral change technology
              applied to cause the "learning" and "adoption" of a set of behaviours
              or an ideology under certain conditions. It is distinguished from other forms
              of benign social learning or peaceful persuasion by the conditions under which it
              is conducted and by the techniques of environmental and interpersonal
              manipulation employed to suppress particular behaviours and to train others.
              Over time, coercive persuasion, a psychological force akin in some ways to our
              legal concepts of undue influence, is MORE effective than pain, torture, drugs,
              and use of physical force and legal threats.</span></span><br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br> <span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"><span style="background: white;">The effects CHC is able to achieve with coercive
              persuasion are devastating. With coercive persuasion Kong Hee is changing a
              person's will without their knowledge and volition. Kong Hee is creating new
              "attitudes" where CHC members will do things willingly which they
              formerly may have detested, things which previously only physical pain, or
              drugs could have coerced them to do. In effect, CHC’ers desires change, their
              viewpoints change, and their feelings change through this controlled persuasion.
              People in CHC have no idea of the depth of change that this type of persuasion
              is bringing to their person, even changing them in "an instant". This
              seems impossible and that is a part of its strength and deceitfulness.</span><br> <br> <span style="background: white;">The anxiety and emotional stress production
              technologies used  in CHC Coercive
              Persuasion supersede any physical style coercion that focuses on pain, drugs,
              or threat in that these physical systems of coercion do not change an attitude
              so that subjects follow orders "willingly." CHC  Coercive Persuasion changes both attitude AND
              behavior, not JUST behavior. Did you ever meet a CHC member who did not
              claim their life was changed?</span><br> <br> <span style="background: white;">CHC Coercive Persuasion is best understood as a
              coordinated system of graduated coercive influence and behaviour modification
              designed to change the wills and volition of members, usually in a cellgroup or
              bible school  setting, in order for the Kong
              Hee and his entourage to spiritually and psychologically profit from this
              persuasion to validate their own program and to continue the feeling that the
              program gives each converted person. The CHC Coercive Persuasion is a
              psychological program that is inherently addictive in itself, because the
              program makes itself the sole purpose of life and feeling. My Church – My Family-My
              Life. This is one of the reasons why it is so hard on many levels to deprogram
              and be freed from this psychological addiction of this program.</span><br> <br> <span style="background: white;">The essential strategy is based on the systematic
              selecting, sequencing and coordination of several coercive persuasion tactics
              over CONTINUOUS PERIODS OF TIME. There are seven known and studied tactic types
              in various combinations in the coercive Persuasion programs. A coercive
              persuasion program can still be quite effective without the presence of ALL
              seven of these tactic types. Let’s take a closer look at the tactics.
              You can decide for yourself which tactics are applied by Kong Hee and his CHC.</span><br> <br> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">TACTIC 1. The individual is prepared for thought
              reform through increased suggestibility and/or "softening up,"
              specifically through suggestibility-increasing techniques such as audio,
              visual, verbal, or tactile fixation drills (anything that is "moving"
              to the emotions as well as to the mind, i.e., worship music, dancing, embraces,
              stirring preaching or instructional teaching from a pulpit) and excessive
              repetition of routine activities.</span> <br> <br> <em>How often have CHC services been  referred to as “Rock Concerts” or “MLM” events?
               It becomes more clear why Kong Hee does
              not object to this description as it takes the focus away from mind control. Nobody
              will disagree that CHC is for sure applying tactic nr.1</em></span><br> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">TACTIC 2. Using rewards and punishments, efforts
              are made to establish considerable control over a person's social environment,
              time, and sources of social support. Social isolation is promoted. Contact with
              family and friends is abridged, as is contact with persons who do not share
              church-approved attitudes. Psychological and emotional dependence on the group
              is fostered.</span> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">How much of their personal time do CHC members
              spend on CHC versus normal people’s activities? CHC members can answer for
              themselves, yet my estimate would be: pretty much all of the time is spend with
              CHC friends. My estimated guess is that CHC members would not be able to endure
              spending a night discussing Christianity with other-than-CHC Christians or
              Catholics.My experience,  CHC’ers feel
              ridiculed very quickly and will leave the scene. Somehow they seem to feel that
              what they are doing is weird in the eyes of regular society. Build on solid
              ground is different.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">Tactic 2 – mild yes.</span></em></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">TACTIC 3. Disconfirming information and non-supporting
              opinions are prohibited in CHC communication. Rules exist about permissible
              topics to discuss with outsiders. Communication is highly controlled,
              especially communication from Kong Hee. Kong Hee's communication is one-way,  and nothing is to contradict that communication.</span></span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial;">At the least, criticism is discouraged. There is
              no formal process to convey doubts in CHC. Criticism is stopped at the cell
              group level. Service in Suntec 3 weeks ago: Kong Hee ranted for 90 minutes on “We
              must stand united”. “If there is any criticism, it must be in line with the
              managements thinking otherwise we create chaos. We can therefore safety say
              that Kong Hee is using tactic nr.3.</span></em></p>

              to cause a person to re-evaluate the most central aspects of his or her
              experience of self and prior conduct in negative ways. Efforts are designed to
              destabilize and undermine the subject's basic consciousness, reality awareness,
              world view, emotional control, and defense mechanisms as well as getting them
              to reinterpret their life's history, and adopt a new version of causality. <em></em></span></span></span></p>

Intense and frequent attempts are made
              to undermine a person's confidence in himself and his judgment, creating a
              sense of powerlessness. The only power that can help is God, or more precisely,
              CHC’s version of God. Kong Hee is relied upon to hold the truth, understand the
              bible and for "encouragement" to "be close to God"</span></span></span></p>

              humiliation (private and public confession of sin), loss of privilege
              (suspension or excommunication from the CHC), social isolation (from the world
              and the "unbelievers" as well as from erring or heretical Christians
              that doesn't agree with CHC), social status changes (from being a
              "respectable" and "stable" Christian to a "weak"
              or "unstable" Christian – “Are you in a cellgroup?”), intense guilt,
              anxiety, manipulation and other techniques for creating strong aversive
              emotional arousals, etc.</span></span></span></p>

I guess
              CHC members would be a better judge on “how much do they rely on CHC in their
              life”. “How would CHC members coop in a world without Kong Hee?” Is the exaggerated
              reaction of multiple CHC members to the CAD investigations the consequence of
              fear of losing CHC?</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><br> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">TACTIC 7. Certain psychological threats (force)
              are used or are present: That failure to adopt the approved attitude, belief,
              or consequent behaviour will lead to punishment or dire consequence, (e.g.
              physical or mental illness given by God, the reappearance of a prior physical

              other common elements of mind control systems.<br> If most of Robert Jay Lifton's eight point model of thought reform is being
              used in an organization, it is most likely a dangerous and destructive cultlike
              organisation. CHC is a dangerous and destructive cult (please note that
              "dangerous and destructive" does NOT mean that it must be PHYSICAL.
              The dangerousness and destructiveness is a psychological, emotional and
              spiritual one. Just because Kong Hee doesn't create personal or public violence
              does NOT mean that it is not severely destructive on many other levels). If you
              are a CHC member, you will be able to see that every sentence of these
              following points are prevalent within City Harvest Church. Meaning: Yes, you
              are part of a cult in the understanding of the general public. And yes, this is

              of a public gathering in the group, admitting past sins and imperfections, even
              doubts about the group and critical thoughts about the integrity of the leaders.</span></span></span></p>

              absolutely true and completely adequate to explain EVERYTHING (CHC rebutes any
              critical question presented and CHC is the Truth and is capable to explain
              everything about life and spirituality). The doctrine is not subject to

              Paul Potts, the gifted singer, winning X-factor thanks to his conversion to

              His parents?

              greatly modify a person's self-concept, perceptions of reality, and
              interpersonal relations. The CHC coercive thought reform programs also, among
              other things, create the potential forces necessary for exercising undue
              influence over a person's independent decision-making ability, and even for
              turning the individual into a deployable agent for the organization's benefit
              without the individual's meaningful knowledge or consent.</span></span><br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">The CHC Coercive Persuasion programs are effective
              because members experiencing the deliberately planned severe stresses they generate
              can only reduce the pressures by accepting the CHC proposed system or adopting
              the CHC behaviours being promulgated by Kong Hee. The relationship between the
              CHC member and the coercive persuasion tactics are DYNAMIC in that while the
              force of the pressures, rewards, and punishments brought to bear on the person
              are considerable, they do not lead to a stable, meaningfully SELF-CHOSEN
              reorganization of beliefs or attitudes. Rather, they lead to a sort of coerced
              compliance and a situational required elaborate rationalization, for the new
              conduct. With this being said the mind will reconstruct its reality and will
              view everything through this new reality. The construct of this new reality, to
              the new convert, is perfect and whole and beautiful even though it is
              psychologically devastating and logically contradictory. The CHC mind cannot
              see its own blind-spots. It sees no contradictions, no dangers, no
              imperfections, yet this is the Matrix that is the CHC Coercion Persuasion
              Program.</span></span><br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <span style="background: white;"><span style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">Once again, in order to maintain the new attitudes
              or "decisions," sustain the rationalization, and continue to unduly
              influence a person's behaviour over time, coercive tactics must be more or less
              CONTINUOUSLY applied, thus the need to be a consistent member CHC. </span></span></span></p>

              makes CHC coercive persuasion less likely to attract attention or to mobilize
              opposition. It is also part of what makes it such a devastating control
              technology. Victims of coercive persuasion have: no signs of physical abuse,
              convincing rationalizations for the radical or abrupt changes in their behaviour,
              a convincing "sincerity", and/or they have been changed so gradually
              that they don't oppose it because they usually aren't even aware of it.</span></span><br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br style="text-align: -webkit-auto;"> <br> <span style="background: white;"></span></span></p>

              <p>Lawsuit? Christians have much to learn from Buddhists and Muslims. See what happened at NUS lately. Christians defamed Buddhism and Islam but Buddhists and Muslims did not issue any lawsuit for defamation. There are more cases like Rony Tan case, did Buddhists issue lawsuit? If Buddhists were to behave people like you, I guess Christians will be going to court for countless of times.</p>

                  than throw dirt at a group of good Christians. You can expect to
                  receive a lawsuite for defamation very soon. And later, God will
                  judge you too.</p>
              <p>God bless.</p>

              <p>I find this difficult to follow. The thread starter said little about your church, but said much about what to do there. He described not your church's practices but a hpyothetical member's. If by analogy someone gave advice on how to excel or to slack off while in NS, would it damage the reputation of the SAF and be cause for a defamation suit?</p>
              <p>Supposing he posted something else defamatory. Would it be wise for you to start a landmark case, holistically considering the situation your church is in? Thread starter has not described your church's practices, but would it prompt others to question these practices?</p>
              <p>Likewise if someone else faithfully represented your church's practices and gave a personal opinion on them- see example below. Would it be cause for a defamation suit?</p>

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I
              hope people can see the humour of this, and start to think
              again.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">1.
              Confess to the world that you love Jesus, and intend to follow Him
              and devote your life to Him. It does not matter if you do not mean
              it, just saying it will guarantee acceptance from your CHC brothers
              and sisters.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">2.
              Acquire the skill of speaking in tongues, get water-baptized and
              claim you feel that your life has been change. Do not pass on any
              opportunity to claim that your conversion is attributed to Kong Hee
              only.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">3.
              Attend all CHC services and events. In case you fail to go to
              service, follow the service on your iPad, iPhone, or Mac Workbook.
              Consequently post some willy nilly phrases on your facebook to
              create the impression that you were in church. If you do not own a
              iPAd or iPhone, pretend to put money in the envelope yet instead
              use it to purchase this necessity.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">4.Use following rules of conduct during worship:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--
              Put your face into the “gaze into eternity” mode: practice to
              perfection in front of the mirror.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--
              Raise your hands in devotion: this part is easy ,just follow your
              neighbour worshipper.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Sing along with all the songs. If you do not know the words,
              pretend as the music is so loud that nobody will tell the
              difference</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Always stand up when asked to do so, and start to clap
              frantically when Kong Hee releases the “Let’s-give-the-lord-a-clap”
              command.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--
              Wiping away a tear once in a while and sighing every 4 minutes
              might get you on the video screen. This earns respect from fellow
              worshippers</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--
              Shout “Amen”, “Hallelujah”, “Praise the lord”, “Thank you Jesus” or
              read the words in bold on the screen out loud, when instructed by
              Kong Hee.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--This is also the time to put your newly acquired “speaking in
              tongues” into practice. Don't be nervous and do not hold back, just
              shut down your brain and make it up as you go along. everybody else
              does. A few beers before service might help.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Extra devotional points, and guaranteed camera coverage can be
              obtained by falling to the floor, shaking your body, laughing
              frantically while yelling “AH-JAYSUS”</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--If
              any first timers stand up next to you, be the first to welcome them
              to the greatest church in Singapore. If hot and sexy, hug them.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">--Always check who is sitting next to you. Ensure you are seated
              next to good looking fellow members. Chances are, Kong Hee will ask
              you to hug them, or hold their hand. And when, no need to hold
              back, give it a good squeeze as Kong Hee has allowed you to do.
                </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">5.
              Every service, make sure you put a large amount of money in the
              bucket. Make sure that everyone in your vicinity sees you giving
              money. Try to get camera attention by letting the tears run from
              your eyes. If you have no money, pretend, the room is too dark
               for anybody to notice. Better to keep the money for the
              cellgroup meeting’s offering, so you can boast how generous you
              are, and avoid being reported to Kong Hee.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">6.
              When listening to Kong Hee, or your CHC friends, occasionally
              confuse something they say with something that Jesus had said. This
              will impress them, and they will think highly of you. Or at least
              you will not be blacklisted yet.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">7.
              Stop reading the Bible. Only read from your notes from CHC Bible
              school, or the services. Preferably learn following verses by
              heart, or have page markers, so you can quickly pull them out:</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Malachi 3:10<br> Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food
              in my house. Test me in this,” says the LORD Almighty, “and see if
              I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven<strong style="font: inherit;">AND POUR OUT SO MUCH BLESSING THAT THERE WILL NOT
              BE ROOM ENOUGH TO STORE IT.</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Joshua 1:8 <br> for then thou shalt make thy way <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPEROUS</strong>, and then thou
              shalt <strong style="font: inherit;">HAVE GOOD
              SUCCESS</strong></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Isaiah 54:17<br> No weapon that is formed against thee shall <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPER</strong>; </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">3
              John 1:2<br> I wish above all things that thou mayest <strong style="font: inherit;">PROSPER</strong> and be
              in <strong style="font: inherit;">HEALTH</strong>, even as thy

              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">Avoid any verses that sound like: suffering of Christ
              -- Camels going thru needle eyes -- Thou shall be content
              -- the Son of God had nowhere to lay is head
               -- Thou shall not add anything to the Word of God
              -- Only 2 maximum 3 can speak in tongues -- False
              prophets come with great signs …</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">and
              discard all the verses where God kills firstborns, pregnant women,
              as you have not learned to put them into context, it might damage
              your gullible spirituality.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">8.
              Regularly quote Kong Hee. This will impress other CHC’ers of your
              “Biblical” knowledge, even if you do not know squat about
              theology.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">9.
              Believe in all Kong Hee’s, or CHC guest’s revelations, regardless
              of how silly they may seem.   Even if you do not believe in
              them, just pretend, same as everybody else.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">10.
              Abandon all sound reason and critical thinking. This is imperative.
              It is not possible to become an honest CHC member if you question
              Kong Hee’s teachings with reason or scepticism. This would be the
              fastest way for you to become a “backslider”.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">11.
              Smile a lot to everyone you see. Say you love them even when you
              hate them. You must pretend at all costs, to love your worst
              enemies even if it kills them in the end. This is even more valid
              towards NCC and FCBC members. See also next point.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">12.
              Attempt to convert your “unbelieving” friends. This means
              mainstream Christians, as well as NCC and FCBC non-believers. Make
              an ass out of yourself to the point of getting them angry. Make
              sure you always keep smiling and tell them how much you love them.
              This will escalate their anger and leave you fully satisfied. If
              they persist, claim that they are in league with the Devil and only
              faith in Jesus can release them (make sure you keep smiling).</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">13.
              If anyone presents reasonable arguments against CHC, simply go into
              denial. Say that their tempting only makes your faith grow
              stronger. Never submit to them. No worries, after 3 services or so,
              the Kong Hee mantra “Do not let them hijack your faith” will kick
              in automatically.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">14.
              If anybody quotes a verse from the Bible that contradicts Kong
              Hee’s position, simply say that they're taking that verse out of
              context. The out-of-context ploy will get you out of many difficult
              situations and will make it seem that you actually understand the
              correct context when in fact you don't.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">15.
              Advertise your CHC membership.<br> Examples: keep a Kong Hee (for the females*) or Sun Ho (for the
              males*) picture in your wallet or use him as your wallpaper. Always
              positive to wear Ed Hardy clothes from Christian Audigier or
              accessoires from Skin Couture. * The reverse is not allowed as Kong
              Hee does not like gay people.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">16.
              Show unconditional support to Kong Hee. If the situation requires,
              drag banners into service or call to arms on the internet.
              Violently disagree when accussed of idolizing Kong Hee or Sun
              Ho</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">17.
              Marry within the church and send your kids to the free-of charge
              brainwash sessions in “children’s church. Profess family values. If
              you catch your hubby cheating on you, never let CHC know. Never get
              a divorce, regardless of how miserable you both feel. If the news
              does get out, pray you have money so you can have the Jack Neo
              treatment.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">18.
              Buy all the "devotional" material that is on offer. Make sure your
              cell group leader hears about this. If it is Sun Ho developed
              stuff, buy in 10-fold to ensure extra blessings.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">19.
              The ultimate sacrifice and and all time CHC nr. 1 will always be:
              Give your possessions away to CHC. The Bible says give all you have
              to anyone who asks (Luke 6:30). Kong Hee is asking every week to
              give him all your money, to sell your house, car,… Warning: If you
              do not do this, you are disobeying a direct Jesus request. However,
              if you do obey this command, Kong Hee will guarantee you a
              Christian position and you will garner his greatest esteem and
              respect until the well dries up.</p>

              <p>But what is a far greater wrong than any of the comments that he has made is your mistaken view and wrong interpretation of what the Bible mentioned - 'those who are not with you are against you'.</p>
              <p>You mean to say if the Methodist, Presbyterian, Catholic, Baptist or any other church disagrees with the methods of CHC, or CHC's interpretation of certain biblical laws or teaching, then they are "satan's followers', merely because they are not with you?</p>
              <p>Please la, surely, you can be better than that. If you really are the Christian that you claim you are or a devout follower of CHC that preaches Christian values, the primary ones - loving God with all your heart, mind etc and your neighbour as yourself, and if you also believe in Divine forgiveness, you'll apologise to him and take that back.</p>
              <p>The verse you use, is not for situations like these, it's for those who reject the principle tenet of Christianity - the salvation of men through the Lord's sacrifice on the Cross, and by doing so would reject the Holy Spirit, since it's He who brings that message to mankind.</p>
              <p>Churches are only vehicles which are used to pass that message on, or places where the faithful come to worship. To put the CHC or any church on the same pedestal as you are quick to do, and denounce anyone who doesn't subscribe to it, as followers of the devil, is wrong and reprehensible.</p>
              <p>Rather it is the person who isn't afraid to voice the true meaning of faith, even if it means questioning the methods or practises of any church that strays from it, that person must be allowed to speak the truth without fear.</p>
              <p>As another verse puts it - Speak forth the truth for the truth shall set you free. Like I said, doesn't means all he says is wrong or right. Your duty would simply be to speak the truth as you see it, and let the Lord be the final judge.</p>
              <p>It's afterall God that calls out to man, and the One that determines who receives or doesn't receive His Salvation. You do your duty as you see fit, and lets leave God to His.</p>

              <p>James Tan's post did not give me the impression that CHC is cult but your post above is giving that impression especially this statement :<span style="color: #000080;">Those who are against CHC are satan followers. </span><span style="color: #000000;">May be you can say people who are against CHC are ignorant about your religion and church but accusing people who are against CHC are satan followers. You must be brain washed! From this statement, I'm starting  to question is  CHC really a cult. <br></span></p>

              <p>You are twisting the facts. James is slandering CHC. What else is coercive persuasion? What about the cult topics he posted?  We at CHC do not slander other religions. You put those words in my mouth. We do not say other Christians are all wrong. Maybe some of us are more right. It's all about the interpretation, isn't it.</p>
              <p>You have your interpretation of faith, and we have ours. Who's right. Only God can judge. I put my faith and trust in Pastor Kong. Why do you think we are the biggest church in Asia? This is God showing appreciation for CHC. We are harvesting our seeds. God did whisper a thank you to Pastor Kong for all his good work. This touched my heart. No need for James to call Pastor Kong delusional. He does not know Pastor Kong like we do. Everything is possible with God. God is on our side.</p>
              <p>God also speaks to me. Everytime I read the Bible I have revelations. God guides me in my path. Wonderful things have happened to me during service. My headache once disappeared when Pastor Kong started preaching, and I was not even close to the stage. One time, our cell group burst out in laughter, and we could not stop. The Holy Spirit is with us. Many more things have happened which I do not want to share. You would not understand</p>
              <p>In the end, it is all about a personal relationship with God. Do you have a personal relationship with God? Do you feel the presence of the Lord in your services?  It is all about balance. God is love. He loves us like a father. </p>
