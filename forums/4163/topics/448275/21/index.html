              <p>@auscli: many people in this forum realize Kong is far from being a nice guy. Heck, even BroInChrist and laurence82 would find mutual ground. I have been following thi forum for quite a while. Trust me when I say that those guys agreeing on something is close to a miracle.</p>
              <p>I am aware of Pringle, and so are many others. He is of the same breed as Kong, just different skin color. The only reason that Kong appointed Phil to steer the ship during his absence, is that Phil is no threat taking over the CHC ship. Better safe than sorry hence bring in crook from NZL.</p>
              <p>Keep reporting on the Phil dude as I feel that this shit actually gets read in higher places. Keep up the good work.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>BY DARYL CHIN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>WITH less than three weeks to go, one of the biggest Christian concerts held here annually, the  Festival of Praise, has been cancelled because of recent developments surrounding the leaders of City Harvest Church.</p>
              <p>  In a Facebook notification posted yesterday morning, and on its website, the festivals founder and president Canon James Wong said this move was taken "with the heaviest of hearts" .</p>
              <p>  The concert, which brings together members of more than 30 churches in Singapore, is one of the most significant events on the local Christian calender.</p>
              <p>  Into its 26th year, it is usually held at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, and attracts crowds of more than 10,000 a night with its snazzy shows and overseas performers. This year's event was supposed to be held on Aug 3 and 4 in City Harvest Church's auditorium in Suntec instead, as the indoor stadium was not available for rent.</p>
              <p>  Canon Wong, whom City Harvest Church founder Kong Hee considers a mentor, said the festival was relying on the support of City Harvest's staff and members in hospitality, ushering and security matters.</p>
              <p>  "However, as you might know, Reverend Kong and City Harvest Church are currently undergoing a challenging period. In view of this situation, the committee has decided not to go ahead with this year's festival," he said in his online statement.</p>
              <p>  The news came as a shock to some, as attending it had become an annual affair. Regular concert-goers say the event is almost always packed, and thousands of Christians of all denominations turn up, as well as non-Christians. The concert is free, and queues start forming at the venue several hours before the shows start, they say.</p>
              <p>  Mr Edwin Lim, 28, who is in-between jobs, has attended more than five sessions. He said: "It's an important event as many churches of different backgrounds and denominations come, so it doesn't feel justifiable to me that it's cancelled just because of one man and his church."</p>
              <p>  Kong, 49, who has been the executive director of the festival since 2005 and also between 1997 and 2001, was arrested two weeks ago together with four other senior City Harvest members. They have been charged with conspiring to cheat the church of millions of dollars.</p>
              <p>  Another regular attendee, nurse Janice Tan, 33, asked: "I don't understand why such a major event can be dropped just like that. Couldn't they have tried to find another venue?"</p>
              <p>  But the festival relies heavily on City Harvest volunteers to run the show. The Straits Times understands that City Harvest provides much of the manpower needed, such as ushers, lighting and sound crew, and even for printing the flyers.</p>
              <p>  Civil servant Michael Yap, 27, who has been showing up at the festival for the past nine years, said: "Firstly, there's an issue with manpower. And secondly, I believe this is a decision that the organisers take very seriously, and did not make without considering other options."</p>
              <p>  Every year, pastors and bands are brought in from overseas to preach or perform, while local pastors support in singing Christian songs.</p>
              <p>  Overseas guests this year had been due to include Reverend Mark Conner and Christian band Planetshakers, both from Australia, as well as the British singer-songwriter Matt Redman.</p>
              <p>  Ms Lucilla Teoh, corporate communications director for the Auglican Diocese of Singapore, said: "It's one of the milestone events of the year and members from a large number of churches normally participate."</p>
              <p>  Mr Lim Kay Tham, general secretary of the National Council of Churches of Singapore, said he was not surprised by the cancellation.</p>
              <p>  "Kong Hee, who is the main driving force behind this festival for the past few years, probably wants to concentrate on his own affairs. This event attracts many and has a large following, so I'm sure plenty of people will be disappointed."</p>
              <p>  Efforts to reach the festival organisers, City Harvest Church and Canon Wong were unsuccessful.</p>

              There is. That the atheist can talk about this or that being true or false is one thing, but justifying the existence of truth in atheism is another. It is a case where the atheist acts inconsistently from his atheism. For the atheist matter is all there is. Man is the result of an accident, a random naturalistic process. Thoughts are but chemical reactions in the brain. But on what basis can random chemical reactions give rise to notions of truth, right from wrong? Again I am not saying that the atheist son does not know things that are true, he certainly can. But this is not because of atheism but in spite of atheism. Atheism does not supply the preconditions of intelligibility, but theism does.
