              <p>I think you are still missing the point. It is not about denying
              pain or morality, but explaining it and providing a basis for
              it.</p>
              <p>Yes, pain is real and felt in its various forms.</p>
              <p>Violence is real too.</p>
              <p>But on what basis do you we call violence wrong and immoral?
              Violence in the animal world is a reality, but do you call that
              wrong or immoral? Why do we not indict animals for preying on other
              animals? Why do we reserve moral judgement and accountability for
              human violence towards fellow humans but not animals on animals? In
              an evolutionary-atheistic world of nature red in tooth and claw,
              where the fittest survive, who is to declare that violence for the
              sake of survival is morally wrong?</p>
              <p>Can you begin to see what I am driving at? Only theism supplies
              the pre-condition and basis for morality, moral absolutes, and
              moral judgement. Pain and violence are the effects experienced in a
              fallen world marred by man's moral rebellion against God. Moral
              laws presuppose a moral lawgiver. If you can even declare something
              to be wrong or immoral it already PRESUPPOSES the existence of
              moral absolutes or objective moral values, the very things that
              atheism CANNOT explain and does not supply. Any atheist who insists
              that there are objective moral values is sneaking theism into his
              belief system whether he realises it or not, or even if he denies
              it. Such an atheist is being inconsistent with his belief
              system.</p>
              </div>

              <p>If eveyrone can feel pain then why can't people come to a morality in which violence is wrong over thousands of years?</p>

              Kong Hee strongly encouraged his followers ( I was told he was more pissed off than Jesus in the temple) to delete, burn, get rid off, never ever watch,...catch the drift... a documentary called Marjoe.
              
              In this documentary, the youngest ever pentecostal minister, ordained at the age of 4, explains how he cheated people out of their money.
              
              I posted 2 extracts so you get the idea. Definitely worth watching - can be downloaded via Isohunt...

              <p>Â  Serina Wee Gek Yin (right), 35, the former finance chief of CHC, was charged in court yesterday with six counts of being involved in a conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust by an agent.</p>
              <p>Â  The charges involve more than $50 million in all.</p>
              <p>Â  Of the money, $24 million was allegedly siphoned off towards purported sham bond investments to fund the music career of Ms Ho Yeow Sun, the wife of the church founder, Kong Hee.</p>

              <p>Â  She was among the first to arrive at the Subordinate Courts yesterday, stepping out of a car at around 8.30am, wearing a sombre black dress.</p>
              <p>Â  With a pair of sunglasses shielding her eyes, she ignored the press photographers as they snapped her picture.</p>
              <p>Â  The other five people involved in the case (see report at right) turned up within minutes of one another, with Kong, 47, being the last to arrive. Ms Ho, 42, did not accompany her husband to court.</p>
              <p>Â  Wee, represented by Senior Counsel Andre Maniam, was red-eyed when she left the courtroom.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 16pt; color: red; line-height: 115%;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Sunglasses</span></span></p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Â  Slipping on her sunglasses again and with her head low so that her long hair formed a curtain over her face.she walked hand-in-hand with an unidentified woman, also in a black dress, towards a waiting car.</p>
              <p>Â  The vehicle sped off soon after she got in. The unidentified woman remained behind and disappeared into the crowd shortly after.</p>
              <p>Â  Last month, more than 200 of Kong's supporters turned up at the Subordinate Courts to show their support.</p>
              <p>Â  It was a quieter affair yesterday, with about 100 people.</p>
              <p>Â  Previously, the supporters - who accompanied Kong to his car after the court proceedings - bulldozed their way through a group of press photographers and journalists who were in his way.</p>
              <p>Â  It was less chaotic yesterday and Kong reached his awaiting vehicle smoothly.</p>
              <p>Â  In a statement e-mailed yesterday evening via his lawyer's firm, Allen &amp; Gledhill, Kong said:"I do maintain my intergrity and will rigorously defend (it) against these charges."</p>
              <p>Â  He said he was confident he would be vindicated.</p>
              <p>Â  The New Paper found security especially tight around the court grounds yesterday morning.</p>
              <p>Â  A group of men, believed to be plainclothes police officers, removed a sign that could potentially have affected religious harmony.</p>
              <p>Â  The home-made sign, about 2m tall, was spotted at around 8am, propped up against a tree about 50m from the main entrance of the Subordinate Courts building.</p>
              <p>Â  It displayed a strongly-worded message.</p>
              <p>Â  Passers-by stared at it as they walked past, and many fished out their mobile phones to snap a picture.</p>
              <p>Â  Witness whom TNP spoke to said they spotted a man resting the sign against the tree before leaving the premises earlier that morning.</p>
              <p>Â  Responding to queries from TNP, the police said that they received a report at 7.54am yesterday about a poster with "objectionable contents" that was placed in front of the Subordinate Courts.</p>
              <p>Â  Officers have arrested a 57-year-old man in connection to the incident and investigations are ongoing.</p>

              <p>The question you thought I should be asking is the question that I am posing to atheists! For a theist, objective moral values exist because God is the absolute moral lawgiver. God is all good. God as Creator tells us what is right and wrong. That's what make morality absolute and objective.</p>
              <p>But your idea of moral values is subjective and more of a herd mentality or majority rules. Something being unpleasant is not the same as that thing being wrong. We don't like pain, but that does not make pain wrong. Pain is pain, it is what we experience. But pain can be due to you stubbing your toe or someone stomping on it. The former is not a moral issue but the latter is.</p>
              <p>You take issue with God-given morality, but have you thought harder about man-given morality? Is it not also a might-makes-right idea or majority-makes-right notion? But if you appeal to some innate idea of morality aka conscience, then where does this inherent notion of morality comes from? Is it because we are made that way? The theist says YES, because we are made in God's image. But if man is made in the image of apes (which is what evolution says) then from where and when and how did animal instincts become human moral values?</p>

              <p>Morality, even practiced by the most moral people, is not a consensus. It is subjective, imperfect and comes in many varied principles that contradict each other, which is the strongest evidence for something that evolved from different parts of humanity.</p>
              <p>You are saying morality is perfect, objective and absolute, which is fanciful. Let alone that it is god-given.</p>

For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God. Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment. For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval, for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer. Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience. ...</p>

              <p>Morality, even practiced by the most moral people, is not a consensus. It is subjective, imperfect and comes in many varied principles that contradict each other, which is the strongest evidence for something that evolved from different parts of humanity.</p>
              <p>You are saying morality is perfect, objective and absolute, which is fanciful. Let alone that it is god-given.</p>
              <p>You can't even tell us which of these principles has priority and is therefore the god-given one. It is also bigoted and disdainful of other established moral opinions.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>If you told me god gave us a morality that is diverse, conflicting and imperfect, perhaps I could believe you.</p>
              <p>If you told me he gave us a "perfect, objective and absolute" morality, he has done a piss poor job of giving it.</p>

              <p>If morality is subjective, then on what basis you declare something (e.g. rape, incest) to be morally wrong? You have no basis to give any moral judgement or expect that judgement to carry any moral weight.</p>
              <p>I am saying that there are objective moral values. Why that is fanciful at all is something you did not elaborate. And for someone who espoused moral subjectivism and relativism, how do you go about judging my views as bigoted?</p>
              <p>Read the Bible, it says that God has created man in His image. Man was created morally pure to begin with. But when man chose to rebel against God, we lost that moral purity. Now we are all morally depraved, sinners.</p>
