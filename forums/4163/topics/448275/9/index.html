              <p>Sorry my reply was in the quote; The reply is:</p>
              <p>Yes what your pastor has said and the illustration he has used
                                          is correct. It should be followed or emulated, however it appears
                                          the good pastor has forgotten to mention further (from your
                                          post).</p>
              <p>The verse clearly states in it's literal meaning, where ever you
                                          place something important to you (can be the literal treasure -
                                          property or cash, or the figurative, if you son or daughter is your
                                          treasure), your heart will be in it all the way. If you offer that
                                          treasure to God, you will be in union with Him, as your pastor
                                          said.</p>
              <p>But it also must be taken in another more pertinent context and
                                          retain its' meaning. If you make Jesus, doing His Will or the
                                          Gospel your treasure, and that's where your heart will be also. In
                                          fact in Matthew and Luke, the verses continues to advise people not
                                          to build too much treasure on earth, which isn't permanent, at the
                                          expense of doing His Will. Instead, it advises to build treasures
                                          in heaven more, which is permanent. And by making that your
                                          treasure, that's where your heart will be.</p>
              <p>There's nothing in either Matthew or Luke to suggest that you
                                          should 'seed', build your treasure and thereafter offer it to God,
                                          or in offering your treasure to God, you can expect to be blessed
                                          with 'greater returns' on your treasure.</p>
              <p>In fact both Matthew and Luke advises to not to worry about all
                                          these, go and sell your possessions, give to the poor etc. God also
                                          provides for the ravens and birds, and will provide for you. He
                                          understands your needs, but build your treasure in His kingdom
                                          first, and these things will be provided for you. That's is where
                                          your heart should be in regards to your treasure. God first that is
                                          the treasure that your heart should follow.</p>
              <p>Anyway how you want to interpret it is up to you. You may want
                                          to take all Kong Hee says as absolutely 100% correct. But remember
                                          many are called, few are chosen. Jesus even said that even those
                                          who believed they were doing His will and calling out to Him, can
                                          be doing the wrong thing.</p>
              <p>My message is more for others who read this, and want instead to
                                          focus more on the Word, than what is said or interpreted by
                                          'messengers'. My advise to you is, fair enough listen to what the
                                          pastor says, but analyse it, if it's good and correct follow it.
                                          But if you think maybe, he got this one slight wrong or not perhaps
                                          100%, then find the missing % and get the correct message in its
                                          entirety.</p>
              <p>Blindly following or refusing to question has been the cause of much of man's failures.</p>

              <p>My comments are written with a sincere heart. It was not my
              intention to be amusing at all. It saddens my heart to read
              all the lies and slander about my church. CHC IS NOT A CULT. If CHC

              <p>I have reported this site to my cell group leader. She will pass

              better than all other satan followers who have nothing better to do
              than throw dirt at a group of good Christians. You can expect to
              receive a lawsuite for defamation very soon. And later, God will
              judge you too.</p>

              <p>You know what Acxx, maybe they should really sue James and others who they claim are defaming them.</p>
              <p>You
               recall the NKF saga? What did TT Dorai do when somebody and later the 
              ST raised certain issues they felt some disquiet about? He sued! He was 
              so sure of himself, so proud and over-confident, he sued. He even wished
               Davinder Singh, SC, good luck before the start of the court case! Singh
               is one of the best and most aggressive lawyers around. It was like the 
              sheep wishing the wolf good luck!</p>
              <p>Then what happened, Singh tore 
              into Dorai's activities and methods, and before the case reached Day 4, 
              he threw in the towel and admitted defeat. That was the start of a 
              series of misjudgments that would lead Dorai to jail.</p>
              <p>So the same 
              here, if CHC really wants to sue, go ahead, but don't think everyone 
              will just lie down like sheep. Also remember you would have to account 
              for all your actions in justifying your suit against the other party 
              (ies). All your words and actions will be replayed in the open. Other 
              persons running different churches will also come forward and explain 
              how they run things in a church, and you will have to justify why you're
               different. Any controversial topics or actions will hit the headlines.</p>
              <p>So
               if they sue, they better be sure everything they did was perfect and 
              have no skeletons. You think they will be prepared to take such a risk? 
              Especially when there's no official word about Kong Hee's case from the 
              AG's chambers or CAD. Suing would thrust this issue back in the 
              limelight and may just be the catalyst for the CAD or AG to press 
              charges.  You think they dare to call the CAD's bluff?</p>
              <p>And don't 
              forget they are a church, not some corporate organisation or VIP that's 
              been slandered or defamed. What would be the perception/reaction among 
              ordinary Singaporeans, maybe even the region, when a church sues? Plus 
              it's 1 whole church, a rich one at that, going after 1 or 2 individuals.
               You think if they have good lawyers, their lawyers would advise to sue?
               (unless of course the lawyers just wanna make money from a long and 
              drawn out, lawsuit)</p>
              <p>Then of course, the issue of wealth, costs of 
              running things, donations, salaries, investments etc, all will be 
              raised. What would the perception be, if the amounts are astronomical or
               have been poorly utilised, or worse not fully accounted for (not 
              necesarrily criminal, but poor bookeeping or record keeping). How will 
              the CHC justify itself?</p>
              <p>So go ahead, then sue. I'm sure there are 
              some, maybe even many, who's prepared to call your bluff, and want a 
              open trial in court to establish the facts for all to see.</p>
              <p>The 
              cell group leaders, some members - maybe 90% and supporters may be going
               around throwing around the 'Im gonna sue you for defamation card'. 
              Maybe it makes them feel important, or even proud that they are rock 
              solid defenders of their church. Maybe it gives them some power, real or
               imagined, that when they use that card, their detractors will whimper 
              away in fear.</p>
              <p>But for all their bluster, the people who really 
              matter - Kong hee, wife, the upper management and those in the top 10%, 
              these people have been very silent on the issue of suing for defamtion 
              and slander. Why? Because they are not stupid and don't follow like 
              sheep like the bottom 90%.</p>

              <p>The defamation by the CAD is different. Investigating Singapore's largest church based on a single claim is harrassement when nothing is found. After 2 years nothing has been found so a clear case of harrassement. CAD, AG, ... are too proud to admit their mistake.  </p>
              <p>Pastor Kong asking for clearance? What's the point in CHC harrassing CAD? We are not so proud. NO NEED, we know already that Pastor Kong did not do anything wrong. We know the money is used help the poor and needy. Read the CHC news, and you will know all the good we are doing in the world.</p>
              <p>In his forgiveniss, Pastor Kong is not holding CAD's ridiculous actions against them. We prefer to focus on the doing the Lord's work instead of starting the same wild goose chase that CAD initiated. Christians will always be persecuted.</p>
              <p>Thank you for explaining the verse, I know you mean well.  But also here, NO NEED. We trust Pastor Kong. Not because we are sheep but because he has proven worthy of our trust. Pastor Kong is a PhD in Theology, who has been studying the Bible since he was young. Pastor Kong has founded multiple Bible schools in Asia. Pastor Kong is a respected speaker, invited by many churches around the world. Would it be logical to trust my own interpretation or the interpretation of a former policeman over the words of a proven teacher like Pastor Kong? </p>
              <p>Matthew 7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened onto you:</p>
              <p>Maybe you should come and listen to Pastor Kong before you make any judgements.</p>

              JoeRaj, u r rite man. U have interpreted the verse in a right context. Nowadays, most people does not read Bible in context in order to extract the meaning. Thatâ€™s very sad.
              
               Perhaps they forgot to read Luke 10:33 Sell your possessions and give to the poor.
              
              In fact, a few paragraph prior to the verse, it was talking about The Parable  Of Rich Fool, how he is keen to build bigger treasure for himself to enjoy life. Hence the verse thereafter seems to imply what JoeRaj has written God provident on people NEEDS BUT NOT WANTS when one share your wealth with unprivileged of the society. 
              
              There were no 100 fold blessing promises. There were no promises that God will provide you branded goods, clothes, cars or houses.
              
              Hence, I think one need to reflect if Prosperity Gospel is indeed a true message of the Gospel.

              <p>Thank you for explaining the verse, I know you mean well.
               But also here, NO NEED. We trust Pastor Kong. Not because we
              are sheep but because he has proven worthy of our trust. Pastor
              Kong is a PhD in Theology, who has been studying the Bible since he
              was young. Pastor Kong has founded multiple Bible schools in Asia.</p>
              <p>Pastor Kong is a respected speaker, invited by many churches around
              the world. Would it be logical to trust my own interpretation
              or the interpretation of a former policeman over the words of a
              proven teacher like Pastor Kong? </p>
