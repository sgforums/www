              <p>If morality is subjective, then on what basis you declare
                  something (e.g. rape, incest) to be morally wrong? You have no
                  basis to give any moral judgement or expect that judgement to carry
                  any moral weight.</p>
              <p>I am saying that there are objective moral values. Why that is
                  fanciful at all is something you did not elaborate. And for someone
                  who espoused moral subjectivism and relativism, how do you go about
                  judging my views as bigoted?</p>
              <p>Read the Bible, it says that God has created man in His image.
                  Man was created morally pure to begin with. But when man chose to
                  rebel against God, we lost that moral purity. Now we are all
                  morally depraved, sinners.</p>

              <p>I think you are completely missing the point! But I wonder if you know what is meant by objective moral values? Objective moral values mean that some things are universally right and wrong REGARDLESS of time and space and independent of what you feel or believe about it. Whether you choose to punish or forgive does not invalidate the fact the objective moral values exist. Yes, I have no basis OF MY OWN to judge anyone's morals and I am glad you realised that. Your moral views or mine are irrelevant because we do not have the right to impose our own views on others. What's absolute is what God has decreed as right or wrong. You may not like me insisting that something is exclusively true, but can you fault the fact that truth by definition is exclusive?</p>

              <p>Thanks for agreeing that objective moral values exist. Now the next step is to account for their existence. Only the existence of God can be the basis for objective moral values. Do you agree?</p>
              <p>If you have read the Bible you would know what is the Bible's stand on sexual related issues. See 1 Cor 6:9 for yourself.</p>
              <p>The Bible records Lot as a righteous man who lamented the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, see 1 Peter 2:7. No where did the Bible praise or held up Lot's offering of his daughters as exemplary behaviour. Why do you malign the Bible this way? Had Lot offered his own sons (if he had any) then perhaps you can still argue that Lot had nothing against being gay, but he offered his daughters to them out of desperation and in order to save his guests. But we know at the end who saved who, ya?</p>
              <p>Who says morality has nothing to do with exclusive truth? You never heard of moral truths? Truth is exclusive, whether talking about morals or not. See <a href="http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/moral-truth.htm">http://www.allaboutphilosophy.org/moral-truth.htm</a></p>

              <p>Nope. Don't twist my words. There is plenty of disagreement on what is moral and immoral.</p>
              <p>There is agreement on some acts being immoral because people are in agreement that such acts are unpleasant eg beating you up. If one did so, do you need god to tell you that is objectively immoral?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>God approved of his act and warned him to leave the city before destroying it. Whether he offered his sons or daughters to suffer in place, it would have been immoral.</p>

              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;">An angry member from the controversial City Harvest Church has lashed out at its critics on Facebook.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;">In an expletive-filled post, Will Chan chided non-Christian commentators for ‘not using their brains’ and say such ‘atrocious profanities’ on Pastor Kong Hee and the church.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>“If you put both Pastor Kong and Pastor Tan Ye Peng to jail, then who’s gonna preach for CHC?”</strong> he wrote.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;"><a style="font-weight: bold; color: #0a8fbc;" href="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chcwill.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7985" style="display: block; margin: 5px auto; border: 1px solid #b0b0b0; height: auto; max-width: 97%; padding: 5px;" title="chcwill" src="http://temasektimes.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/chcwill.jpg" alt="" width="638" height="260"></a></p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;">He added that God will not come ‘visibly’ to Singapore and only ‘great’ pastors like Kong Hee deserve to preach.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;"><strong>“So stop blabbering so much f**king nonsense about our church, and stop making Pastors suffering from depressions again! Period!”</strong> he added.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 15px;">Kong Hee and five other members of CHC have been charged for misusing up to $50 million dollars of the church’s funds to further the music career of his singer wife Ho Yeow Sun. He is currently out on a S$1 million dollar bail to travel overseas to continue his ‘pastoral’ duties.</p>

              <p>Why are broinchrist and alize debating about the objectivity of morality? Is alize an atheist?</p>
              <p>In my experience with atheists, I find that they have morality standards contrary to common impression - they care a lot about what is right or wrong and will argue for them. Christians fall into 2 groups - the bochup one (who avoids all religious/moral debate) and the other group are ones who will scour scriptures to find answers.</p>
              <p>Also, in my experience and observations, atheists know the bible fairly ok. They aren't ignorant of what the bible writes, although I have to say their interpretation and reading of the scripture is a little off at times. They tend not to separate the OT with the NT and lump everything together - hence a jealous God is the only God they see most of the time, due to OT stories.</p>
              <p>Morality IS important. I guess the question of whether they are objective depends very much on whether you hold a modernist or a post-modernist worldview (i.e. something that is absolute, like "truth" vs. post-modern thought, which is "perception is reality")</p>
              <p>It's one of those discussions where the debate will always ends up, "how do you know if Tim, whom I am looking at now isn't really a purple triangle in reality?" It's the whole, "how do you know the earth is truly spherical?" debate.</p>
              <p>This also ties in with how and why different churches run things differently. A megachurch tends to be post-modernistic ("perception is reality" camp), even though they hold God to be an absolute. Hence, there is a lot of emphasis on making "things look good" because they believe what people see is the truth. One pastor always said, "'Man looks at the appearance, God looks at the heart.' Why not take advantage of it?" My counter argument is: why do you use the scripture against God's intention?

              <p>Why are broinchrist and alize debating about the objectivity of morality? Is alize an atheist?</p>
              <p>In my experience with atheists, I find that they have morality standards contrary to common impression - they care a lot about what is right or wrong and will argue for them. Christians fall into 2 groups - the bochup one (who avoids all religious/moral debate) and the other group are ones who will scour scriptures to find answers.</p>
              <p>Also, in my experience and observations, atheists know the bible fairly ok. They aren't ignorant of what the bible writes, although I have to say their interpretation and reading of the scripture is a little off at times. They tend not to separate the OT with the NT and lump everything together - hence a jealous God is the only God they see most of the time, due to OT stories.</p>
              <p>Morality IS important. I guess the question of whether they are objective depends very much on whether you hold a modernist or a post-modernist worldview (i.e. something that is absolute, like "truth" vs. post-modern thought, which is "perception is reality")</p>
              <p>It's one of those discussions where the debate will always ends up, "how do you know if Tim, whom I am looking at now isn't really a purple triangle in reality?" It's the whole, "how do you know the earth is truly spherical?" debate.</p>
              <p>This also ties in with how and why different churches run things differently. A megachurch tends to be post-modernistic ("perception is reality" camp), even though they hold God to be an absolute. Hence, there is a lot of emphasis on making "things look good" because they believe what people see is the truth. One pastor always said, "'Man looks at the appearance, God looks at the heart.' Why not take advantage of it?" My counter argument is: why do you use the scripture against God's intention? Those words are meant to teach us NOT to look at outward appearances rather than exploit man's weakness.</p>

              <p>Hi, thanks for sharing.</p>
              <p>Just to clarify, I am not saying that atheists have no morals. I am saying that atheism as a worldview cannot account for the existence of objective moral values.</p>
              <p>Also, in my experience, most atheists have only a vague idea of what the Bible teaches, but they do hold a lot of caricatured and distorted views mainly as a result of a disinterested reading of the Bible. Having said that, there are a few atheists who IMO should be preaching in our churches to give a wake up call to Christians.</p>

              <p>I agree with your thoughts that "atheism as a
               worldview cannot account for the existence of objective moral values", 
              but that is a call that only God (who is absolute) can make. At this 
              point in time, the world is still in its fallen state, and subjective 
              laws will still be a part of the world's consciousness.</p>
              <p>Even 
              if someone doesn't believe the earth is spherical, the truth doesn't 
              change. His decision is his alone and he has to be responsible for his 
              own decision.</p>
              <p>That being said, the gospel must continue to be 
              preached, and if an atheist decides to be an obstacle to that, it 
              shouldn't stop us from preaching Christ.</p>
              <p>The Gospel *ISN'T* 
              about how old the earth is, it ISN'T about gay marriages. The Gospel is 
              about a loving God sacrificing his Son save the world.</p>
              <p>My own 
              beliefs and worldview about evolution, about the age of the earth didn't
               change until after I heard and believed the message of Christ (i.e. the
               forgiveness of sins); and that should really be the focus. Everything 
              about my worldview about creationism vs. darwinism, philosophy, etc changed after I 
              accepted Christ.</p>
              <p>I believe that Atheists make very good Christians
               if they aren't misguided and blinded by the enemy. They usually (more 
              often than not, if you observe) have a background of 
              Christianity/Catholicism/Judaism (although they will refute it with 
              claims of Muslims and Buddhists turning atheist too) but fell when they 
              couldn't reconcile the incomplete teachings they received or heard.</p>
              <p>They
               are VERY STRONG intellectually AND intuitively, and if I was the enemy,
               I would blind them too. It makes the work much easier.</p>
              <p>How 
              many times have we heard: Some grandmother of someone turned atheist 
              said their friend will go to hell because they didn't believe - which 
              really isn't he gospel. Atheists intuitively know that, but don't know 
              how to deal with it. There is ALWAYS a defining turning point in their life that influenced their views and addressing that point in life is always difficult because atheists cover that part of their life story with layers and layers of intellectual debate about society - which is avoiding the root issue.</p>
              <p> The Gospel is about Good News, it's about Christ.</p>
              <p>The
               good news isn't "if you don't believe, you will go to hell".There is a 
              FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE between "if you don't study you will fail" vs. 
              "The exam is difficult. Here, take these past year exam questions and 
              the answers to it".</p>
              <p>And while it seems like it's the same and a
               matter of words and presentation, it is much more than than. It is a 
              difference in an attitude of seeing the best in someone and wanting 
              someone to suceed (with the provision already made) versus I'm going 
              somewhere good, you are not - it assumes a self-superiority over others.
               It is subtle, but the difference is day and night - One is judgement, 
              the other is saving grace. One is selfishness, the other is generosity.</p>

              You are absolutely right that the issue isn't about the age of the earth or gay, the issue is really about the Authority of the Word of God. What does the Bible says and do we believe it and take it as authoritative, even if it contradicts what man says? The Good News is based on what the Bible says. But the Good News is predicated on the bad news. What bad news? Well it is right there in Genesis 3. But that is precisely where the atheists aim their guns at. If evolution is true then nothing in Genesis 1-11 happened in fact. Adam is fiction, there is no Fall to speak of, no literal Garden with literal snake to deceive a literal Eve who handed a literal fruit to a literal Adam who literally disobeyed a literal command given by a literal Creator God, so what need for a Saviour?

              <p>I think too many people think that 
                      the "bad news" is caused by God, hence, all the debate about why did God
                       allow it? How can a perfect God create an imperfect creation? blah blah
                       blah. There are theological answers, but I won't rehash them, I think 
                      atheists have heard them enough and an intellectual debate is not my aim
                       (although I think intellectual debates are fun!).</p>
              <p>The issue in 
                      the end is a heart issue. I personally think that atheists took the easy
                       way out and threw the baby out with the bath water. The best way to 
                      deal with it all is to reject God altogether and what better way than to
                       discredit the integrity of the sciptures?</p>
              <p>The opening of the Red
                       Sea, resurrection from the dead, bearing a child at 99 years old, 
                      humans living thousands of years old, giants, solid walls falling down from a blow of a trumpet! So many "incredible" 
                      tales. 6 day creation is the most "ludicrious"! How can something as 
                      complex as a world (complete with living things from bacteria to whales)
                       be created in 6 days, when a swiss watch takes months to complete? It's
                       very easy to use science to reason it all as folklore. WAY TOO EASY! So
                       much that it should be a joke, but to atheists they take it very 
                      seriously, rather strange for "logical" people. It's rather like trying 
                      to prove ice is cold and water is wet. Why? Because of their heart is in
                       conflict. They cannot believe in an angry God. They might not have the 
                      scriptures to prove it, but they intuitively discern correctly that it's
                       not God's nature to being wrathful.</p>
              <p>And so what is the answer 
                      when talking to atheists? I don't have all the answers yet, but I'm not 
                      so sure the best way is to use intellectual debate, because it's the 
                      conflict in their **hearts** that is what is the problem. And getting 
                      into an intellectual discussion is like trying to treat a heart disease 
                      with neuroscience.</p>
              <p>To me (and to me only - my opinion, not universal), the best way 
                      is just to give the Message of Christ and the forgivenss of sins. For it
                       is the Holy Spirit who convicts. It is also the Holy Spirit who knows 
                      the deep waters of a man's heart and what are the fears and conflicts 
                      within it that is preventing a person from opening his heart to Christ.</p>
              <p>But
                       if you don't give the message of Christ, the Holy Spirit has nothing to
                       bear witness to or convict. It's not my responsibility to convince them (it is the Holy Spirit's job to convict others, not me. For Romans 2:14 also says: even those without the Law are a law unto themselves - all of us know our human shortcomings), my 
                      responsibility is to make sure I am a proper ambassador of God's 
                      intention of saving people by giving them the right message. That is, 
                      the message of reconciliation - reconciling them to God through the 
                      forgiveness of sins in Christ. Nobody has to openly admit they are a 
                      sinner (i.e. imperfect under God's perfect standards), the important 
                      Person to admit to is God. And they can do it privately, not necessarily
                       under duress by a Christian trying to push them. I certainly did open 
                      to Christ in my own privacy. I HATED (back then) Christians pushing religion off of 
                      me. I HATED (back then) discussing creationism. Looking back, I learned a lot what 
                      not to do. It wasn't science that converted me. It was faith (in a 
                      loving God). Selah.</p>
              <p>Lastly, it is the message of Christ that is the power unto 
                      salvation. The focus is Christ, not creationist theology. We know that 
                      blindness has affected those who don't see and the enemy is responsible 
                      for that blindness. The enemy isn't afraid of Bible info - in fact, he 
                      quotes scriptures when tempting Christ. It doesn't bother the enemy.</p>
              <p>So, what 
                      actually does bother the enemy? I believe it is Christ, His message and 
                      His work, because it destroys and "disarms principalities... and puts 
                      them to open shame."</p>
              <p>Just food for thought.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Why are broinchrist and alize debating about the objectivity of
                  morality? Is alize an atheist?</p>
              <p>In my experience with atheists, I find that they have morality
                  standards contrary to common impression - they care a lot about
                  what is right or wrong and will argue for them. Christians fall
                  into 2 groups - the bochup one (who avoids all religious/moral
                  debate) and the other group are ones who will scour scriptures to
                  find answers.</p>
              <p>Also, in my experience and observations, atheists know the bible
                  fairly ok. They aren't ignorant of what the bible writes, although
                  I have to say their interpretation and reading of the scripture is
                  a little off at times. They tend not to separate the OT with the NT
                  and lump everything together - hence a jealous God is the only God
                  they see most of the time, due to OT stories.</p>
              <p>Morality IS important. I guess the question of whether they are
                  objective depends very much on whether you hold a modernist or a
                  post-modernist worldview (i.e. something that is absolute, like
                  "truth" vs. post-modern thought, which is "perception is
                  reality")</p>
              <p>It's one of those discussions where the debate will always ends
                  up, "how do you know if Tim, whom I am looking at now isn't really
                  a purple triangle in reality?" It's the whole, "how do you know the
                  earth is truly spherical?" debate.</p>
              <p>This also ties in with how and why different churches run things
                  differently. A megachurch tends to be post-modernistic ("perception
                  is reality" camp), even though they hold God to be an absolute.
                  Hence, there is a lot of emphasis on making "things look good"
                  because they believe what people see is the truth. One pastor
                  always said, "'Man looks at the appearance, God looks at the
                  heart.' Why not take advantage of it?" My counter argument is: why
                  do you use the scripture against God's intention? Those words are
                  meant to teach us NOT to look at outward appearances rather than
                  exploit man's weakness.</p>
              <p>I think it's an endless cause to argue intellectually about
                  whether morality "simply is" or are subjective to man. There are
                  arguments in either camps. In the post-modern view, there are
                  political science writings such as "The social contract" (by
                  Rosseau), where what society deem as moral or immoral are a result
                  of an unspoken "contract" where an individual gives up some of his
                  rights in exchange for a society ruled by laws (the legal system),
                  so that randomness and arbitrary actions are reigned in. It is
                  really hard for an individual to predict what will happen if
                  anything and everything is allowed - someone is allowed to rob you
                  or murder you without consequences. Hence he gives up some of his
                  "freedom" to allow a state sanctioned legal system in which the
                  rules are applied for everyone. Religious or not.</p>
              <p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Social_Contract</p>
              <p>It's a non-religious explanation of why there are laws that
                  applies to everyone regardless of his faith (or lack of one, as in
                  the case of an atheist). For me personally, my personal conviction
                  remains a Christian one, where God is the final moral standard and
                  that no mortal human can meet His perfection, except Him who came
                  in the flesh.</p>

              <p>BroInChrist is saying that</p>
              <p>1. the existence of morals proves the existence of god because nothing else can create morality. He cited the example of chemicals in the brain not being able to result in morality. He said that the morality of atheists comes from god and they deny it.</p>
              <p>2. morality is objective because some acts are universally considered wrong.</p>
              <p>3. god's morality is absolute.</p>
              <p>4. he argued elsewhere that</p>
              <p>And I countered that:</p>
              <p>1. his argument for god's existence is valid only if nothing else can cause morality to come about. I said that the universal existence of pain and its unpleasantness can lead us over milennia to agree that certain acts are repulsive. I asked him if he needs god to tell him that beating him is unpleasant.</p>
              <p>2. morality is not objective because not all acts are universally considered wrong. The diversity of morality shows it evolved from many earthly sources and did not come from one source.</p>
              <p>3. if god's morality is absolute it should leave no room for doubt in interpretation, leave no room for other moralities and address all moral issues in life, which it does not. BIC said that moral guidance in scripture can be interpreted by the learned, but I disagree. Even putting the confusion aside, excessive and collective punishments in the bible are worse than what the Taliban do.</p>
              <p>4. his insistence that god's morality is absolute shows no respect for other understandings of morality. It also ignores that the bible cannot guide us in many areas in life. Imagine if we had to derive all the legal principles from the bible just to judge Kong Hee's case- which is a relatively simple case. And all manner of bible scholars became the lawyers.</p>

              </p><p class="MsoNormal">I checked my bible study notes to see what Pastor Kong has
              to say on the morality topic. Disclaimer: These might not be Pastor Kong’s
              words word for word. They are my personal interpretation and notes during the
              Bible study sessions in my cellgroup. Pastor Kong was not present, but our CGL
              was inspired by Pastor Kong directly.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">First: Why Morality and Religion are not related per se,
              Pastor Kong explains that if we would literally behave like God, how to explain
              that the old testament describes God as a mass murderer page after page? As a
              consequence, the legalistic bible is not the best moral guidance.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Pastor Kong elaborates: The old conservative and legalistic churches
              often claim that without Christianity there is no morality. This of course cannot
              be correct. We all have Muslim, Hindu or even atheist friends or family who are
              inherently good and decent people despite belief in a wrong God.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">We all get our morals from the same human compassion and
              empathy. If we interpret the bible correctly, we feel that God is love, God is
              compassion, God is empathy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Legalistic and old style Christians interpret incorrectly
              that the God of the Bible is one of the most evil creatures in all of
              mythology. The God of the OT orders gruesome murder of innocent pregnant women
              and children. The God of the OT punished people who worshipped the wrong god by
              ordering "their little ones" to be "dashed to the ground"
              and their pregnant women to be "ripped open"; he ordered his warriors
              to commit genocide, and they murdered every Midianite man, women, and child
              except for the 32,000 female virgins that the warriors were told to "save
              for yourselves"; and he created a place called hell which he uses to
              torture people who he dislikes for all eternity.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Luckily in CHC, we understand not to follow this moral and
              not to do this. Luckily we are applying our own moral standards to weed out and
              ignore those parts of the Bible that don't fit in with our values. The claim
              that the Bible can serve as the ultimate moral guide is therefore patently
              absurd. Divine guidance through revelations using God’s anointed is necessary
              to make sense of the Bible.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Do other churches help society like City Harvest Church?
              Well, some do <em>some</em> good but unfortunately, they (example: NCC) create
              conflict between different groups of believers. Sometimes NCC can inspire
              people to be kinder, to be more charitable, and to help others. But not always.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another example is the Catholic Church. Adolf Hitler was a Catholic.
              His actions were consistent with the evil Old Testament god, but hardly moral.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Catholics have recently carried out a genocidal campaign
              against Muslims in Kosovo. Other religions do similar cruelties: Islamic
              terrorists have murdered many innocent people in order to further their goals.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Catholic terrorists attack abortion clinics in the name of God.
              These hypocrites call themselves pro-life. In addition, it would be wrong to
              damage the believers sense of personal responsibility by allowing them to shift
              their responsibility to God or Satan, and this can have adverse effects on the
              believers' morality.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Very often, traditional churches point out that some
              atheists, particularly communists, have also committed evil acts. This is true
              enough. There is, however, an important distinction to be made: Catholics like
              Hitler have been inspired by religion to commit atrocities, while communists
              have been inspired to commit atrocities, not by their lack of belief in gods,
              but by their political beliefs and desires.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">How many catholics would argue that even if some people have
              done evil things in the name of religion, most religious people are good, moral
              people, and that religion on the average provides a positive moral benefit? It
              is true that most religious people are good, moral people, but so are most atheists.
              The catholics claim that religion is morally beneficial on the average is
              completely without merit. Not only is there no evidence indicating a positive
              correlation between religion and morality, there is evidence of a negative
              correlation:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">"The United States is the most religious of all the
              industrialized nations. Forty-four percent of Americans attend church once a
              week, compared with 27 percent in Britain, 21 percent in France, 16 percent in
              Australia, and 4 percent in Sweden. Yet violent crime is not less common in the
              United States--it's more common. The murder rate here is six times higher than
              the rate in Britain, seven times higher than in France, five times higher than
              in Australia, and five times higher than in Sweden. Japan, where Christianity
              has almost no adherents, has less violent crime than almost any country. In
              Singapore, thanks to the City Harvest Church community efforts, the crime rate
              is close to zero.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Another source of data on religion and morality is
              statistics on religious beliefs of prisoners compared with beliefs of the
              general population. This data indicates that adherents to traditional
              churches are more than 40 times more likely than atheists to end up
              in prison.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The God in the Bible, on the average, is apparently not a
              positive moral force. A vastly superior moral framework is provided by Pastor Kong
              who uses a loving God, human reason and empathy to construct moral values. City
              Harvest Church believes that morality should be based on human values, not
              arbitrary and incorrect interpretations from uneducated or traditional churches.</p>

              <p>I checked my bible study notes to see what Pastor Kong
              has to say on the morality topic. Disclaimer: These might not be
              Pastor Kong’s words word for word. They are my personal
              interpretation and notes during the Bible study sessions in my
              cellgroup. Pastor Kong was not present, but our CGL was inspired by
              Pastor Kong directly.</p>
              <p>First: Why Morality and Religion are not related per
              se, Pastor Kong explains that if we would literally behave like
              God, how to explain that the old testament describes God as a mass
              murderer page after page? As a consequence, the legalistic bible is
              not the best moral guidance.</p>
              <p>Pastor Kong elaborates: The old conservative and
              legalistic churches often claim that without Christianity there is
              no morality. This of course cannot be correct. We all have Muslim,
              Hindu or even atheist friends or family who are inherently good and
              decent people despite belief in a wrong God.</p>
              <p>We all get our morals from the same human compassion
              and empathy. If we interpret the bible correctly, we feel that God
              is love, God is compassion, God is empathy.</p>
              <p>Legalistic and old style Christians interpret
              incorrectly that the God of the Bible is one of the most evil

              and they murdered every Midianite man, women, and child except for
              the 32,000 female virgins that the warriors were told to "save for
              yourselves"; and he created a place called hell which he uses to
              torture people who he dislikes for all eternity.</p>

              <p>In Singapore, thanks to the City Harvest Church
              community efforts, the crime rate is close to zero.</p>

              a positive moral force. A vastly superior moral framework is
              provided by Pastor Kong who uses a loving God, human reason and
              empathy to construct moral values.</p>
