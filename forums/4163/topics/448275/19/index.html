              <p>Why is there no website for Super Value Stores?</p>
              <p>Super Value Stores in Papua New Guinea? Ever been to Paua New Guinea? Who are you kidding? <br>Why is Pastor Kong's house in Hanafi's name?<br>Why would Hanafi give Pastor Kong a mansion?<br>Why is Hanafi's house next to Kong's?<br>Why does Pastor Kong continuously praise Hanafi?<br>How much do you all want to see Pastor Kong go down before you all wipe the shit out of your eyes?</p>

              <p>
              </p><p class="MsoNormal">I read through this thread in one sitting and found the
              discussion amusing as well as thoughtful. I laughed, felt sad and learnt as I
              followed the discussion. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Now the “amusible” (no, there’s no such word) part got hold
              of me<strong>. </strong>Since the tread was started with "light" digging of practices of certain CHC members, I will attempt to bring this back to its lighter tone. <strong>I’m just having fun with this
              part and am not being serious.  Please
              forgive if I have overstepped boundaries of propriety and have treated subjects
              that are deep and serious in your hearts with irreverence. I APOLOGISE in
              advance if I had been insensitive.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">From the thread, I believe that the only person from CHC is
              Zeeleewong and so far her cell group leaders and others have not come onto the forum
              to comment at all. This is odd behavior from a church that is controlling minds
              and behavior. Now, from Zeeleewong’s postings, we can only conclude she is the stereotype
              of all that James_Tan_1983 and alize said of CHC members and members of cultish
              organisations respectively –what these members will say, how they response to
              questions. Example “Do not let them Hijack your Faith”.  So far, zeeleewong’s responses have been, in a
              word, <strong>unbelievable</strong>.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If the argument is true that CHC strongly teaches and
              controls how their members respond to outsiders, then clearly Zeeleewong is out
              of sync with the church’s teaching. The logic works this way:</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>If CHC advises their members not to engage with
              outsiders on matters on the church and their leaders integrity as clearly they
              do not have the right frame of mind to interpret and understand truth as CHC
              sees it.  Zeeleewong is clearly violating
              that CHC rule  even though she devoutly
              defends the church and all its practices and presumably follows all its dos and
              don’ts. This is definitely not possible.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>If CHC allows or does not disallow their members
              to debate with outsiders on matter relating to the church and its leaders
              practices. Then given the discussion here so far, Zeeleewong has not consulted
              with her cell leaders. This should also be a no-no as all engagement with
              outsiders needs to be reported within the cell group structure especially
              something as important as an outsider calling into disrepute, CHC leaders’ practices.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>My argument is that her cell leaders are well
              aware of her participation in this forum. The following are possible scenarios:</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 72.0pt;  text-indent: -18.0pt; ">a.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span>She is thinking that she is winning all the
              arguments so she doesn’t need help from her leaders. If this is the case, it is
              my belief that she would let her cell leaders know how she is doing such a good
              job so that other members can also be encouraged to put up a strong defence in
              public of their church and leaders. So her leaders would know about this forum.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 72.0pt;  text-indent: -18.0pt; ">b.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span>She is not winning the arguments but continues
              to just state her point of view. She would share with her cell leaders on
              lessons on how to tackle such opposition. 
              Her cell leaders encourage her to persevere but do not want to get
              involved, adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As long as you say it over and over
              and over, you will wear them down to your point of view. So they will know
              about this forum.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="margin-left: 72.0pt;  text-indent: -18.0pt; ">c.<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">       </span>She is losing the arguments and surely would have
              approached her cell leaders but none have come to her rescue as none of them
              want to be on the “losing” side. They know about this forum.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>So Zeeleewong’s cell leaders are well aware of
              her arguments and discussions in this forum. They do not see it fit to join in
              but allow Zeeleewong to continue on her own. Aren’t they concerned about the
              “blasphamies” that could corrupt other fellow members. I think it is unlikely
              that they have not stepped into this discussion yet OR have not removed her
              participation yet.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here comes the “amusible” part: What if Zeeleewong is not a
              real person, much less a CHC member but someone who is an outsider. He/she
              posts just like the stereotype described by James_Tan_1983 / alize accentuating
              the clichéd behavior and nuances. Then we are made to believe that CHC is
              really full of these stereotypical simplistic believers. You see, I have read
              my share of Agatha Christie….</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If the “amusible” part is true, and Zeeleewong is really the
              disguise of …… then we need our usual suspects.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">My list is as follows:</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>James_Tan_1983</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The protagonist with the sad story,
              typically innocent, good looking with sad eyes :leading man who can tug at the
              heartstrings of the audience. Very likeable and sincere. Normally not suspected
              but usually turns out to be the dastardly culprit in the end. His possible
              motive is to have a go at CHC and make their members look silly.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>alize</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The brainaic who works out elaborate schemes
              and methods – the most “scheming” of the lot. He can take the time to plan out attacks
              in detail and executes with patience and precision. He will leave no clues and
              covers all his tracks. He is almost impossible to be found out. The only chance
              to catch him is to equally patient and wait until he makes a mistake. His
              possible motivation is just to see how this whole debacle plays out in
              accordance with his plan and how accurately he can forecast players’ reactions.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>Dalforce 1941</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The one who rejects many things. By
              projection, he probably will reject more than he accepts. He thinks that there
              are many wrongs in the world and if he drums up sentiments, he may get more
              people to reject what is bad in the world, the world can become a less badder
              place.</p>

              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Not a young person and probably has seen much
              in life. He understands constraints in life and wants CHC and outsiders to
              understand that although many permutations are possible, God’s answers to
              prayers need to be optimised against constraints like government laws, physical
              limitations (which God also can ultimately also override). His motivation will
              be to teach the young lessons.</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style="text-indent: -18.0pt; ">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: 'Times New Roman';">          </span>JoeRaj</p>
              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Obviously very frustrated by answers. And
              sometimes can get emotional. If he is Zeeleewong, he must have created the
              character so that he can kill the character in a fit of internet rage. That
              could be very cathartic indeed.</p>

              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">The person who quotes the Bible most. He
              reads and analyses the Bible deeply and seeks truth is what is being written.
              If he is guilty, he probably created Zeeleewong’s character unconsciously as a
              sparing opponent to juice up different angles to tackling Biblical knowledge.</p>

              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">Laurence82 zooms in and out quickly. He
              does a drive by shoot out and is gone before you could even respond. He’s
              probably the one everyone wants to be the guilty one but normally ends up being
              innocent but he rarely wins over the audience’s sympathies. If he is the one,
              no,no, no he can’t be “THE ONE”.</p>

              <p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle">This suspect probably commits her crimes in
              her dreams. She lives in a very surreal world and may have difficulties
              reconciling that with the real world. Zeeleewong may only have existed only in
              her own world but she must have successfully placed an “inception” in all our
              minds that Zeeleewong indeed responds to the forum.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 47pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Star quality still most important</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>REPORT: <strong>LEDIATI TAN</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MADE my wish to be a superstar, sings Ms Ho Yeow Sun in her English single, Fancy Free.</p>
              <p>  Ten years ago, Ms Ho, 42, who goes by the stage name Sun Ho, embarked on her secular music career as part of the Crossover Project to reach out to non-Christians.</p>
              <p>  Now, her music career is part of the focus in the investigations against individuals from the City Harvest Church.</p>
              <p>  The Commissioner of Charities had found financial irregularities of at least $23 million from the church's funds which were allegedly used with the purported intention of bankrolling Ms Ho 's career.</p>
              <p>  On Wednesday, her husband Kong Hee and four church office-bearers were charged in court with the alleged misuse of the funds.</p>
              <p>  Notwithstanding the case before the courts, can someone buy his or her way to stardom? And how far can money get you in the music industry?</p>
              <p>  Industry insiders here and in the US told The New Paper that while money is important in gaining a foothold, talent will be the decisive factor in carving out a successful long-term career.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: red;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Money helps, but...</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Mr Ngiam Kwang Hwa, managing director of Mandarin music label Rock Records, said: "Money can definitely bring you in, but money can't sustain you. You won't go far if you don't have talent.</p>
              <p>  "I don't believe that you can groom anyone without any star quality or talent. It depends on what you can offer to the consumer to sustain your music career."</p>
              <p>  American Robert A Case, a music career consultant who owns two music publishing companies, said: "I know of people who have millions and millions of dollars, who throw money in as entertainers. And they've failed."</p>
              <p>  Asked how much it would cost to break into the US market, Mr Gingio Muehlbauer, founder of intenational music consultancy MC-Input.com, said that in the pop music scene, it would cost close to US$3 million (S$3.8 million) for the full works, from producing an album to marketing the singer.</p>
              <p>  Then, there are also the costs of collaborating with top names in the industry to draw more eyeballs and gain recognition.</p>
              <p>  Mr Jerry Lembo, president of Jerry Lembo Elltertainment Group, said that most notable producers are represented by an agent or manager, and their time, availability and fees would be negotiated by them. The costs of hiring these producers, he added, would most likely be included in the record label 's recording budget.</p>
              <p>  Mr Muehlbauer said that hiring a top artiste, producer or musicians can cost anything from US$10,000 up to "hundreds of thousands", depending on how well-known they are.</p>
              <p>  And there are additional costs if you want a collaborating artiste to appear on the video or perform as a guest in concerts, he added.</p>
              <p>  Besides having talent and financial backing. success in the music industry also often depends on who you know and the relationships you build.</p>
              <p>  Mr Peng Chi Sheng, a local musician and director of Intune Music School, said: "One of the most important things is who you know.</p>
              <p>  "Just a call from the right person and you could get linked up to other people."</p>
              <p>  Mr Muehlbauer said that attending major conferences or events such as the Grammy Awards and big private parties is a great way to get noticed.</p>
              <p>  He added: "You can pay to get into some of these events. But most of them are by invitation only, so it always comes down to who you know."</p>
              <p>  Mr Case had this piece of advice for foreign artists who want to break into the US market. "It doesn't matter if you are from a foreign country. The key to success is to be successful in your own country first," he said.</p>
              <p>  "Create a buzz in own country or region first, then other countries will take you seriously."</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>2007: After the release of China Wine, a collaboration with Wyclef Jean (above left), Ms Ho come under fire for her dressing in the music video (left).</p>
              <p>  The China Wine single was her sixth track since she went over to the US in 2003 to work on her album, which was never released. The first five singles made it to the top 10 of Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs.</p>
              <p>  While in the US, Ms Ho also collaborated extensively with big names from the music industry such as producer David Foster, and Grammy award-winner Olivia Newton-John.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2010: In February, she attends the Grammys in a black dress (above) which netizens said showed too much skin.</p>
              <p>  In June, she returns to Singapore to help police with investigations on the alleged misuse of church funds.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I read through this thread in one sitting and found the
                  discussion amusing as well as thoughtful. I laughed, felt sad and
                  learnt as I followed the discussion. </p>
              <p>Now the “amusible” (no, there’s no such word) part got
                  hold of me<strong>.</strong> Since the tread was started with
                  "light" digging of practices of certain CHC members, I will attempt
                  to bring this back to its lighter tone. <strong>I’m just
                  having fun with this part and am not being serious.  Please
                  forgive if I have overstepped boundaries of propriety and have
                  treated subjects that are deep and serious in your hearts with
                  irreverence. I APOLOGISE in advance if I had been
                  insensitive.</strong></p>
              <p>From the thread, I believe that the only person from
                  CHC is Zeeleewong and so far her cell group leaders and others have
                  not come onto the forum to comment at all. This is odd behavior
                  from a church that is controlling minds and behavior. Now, from
                  Zeeleewong’s postings, we can only conclude she is the stereotype
                  of all that James_Tan_1983 and alize said of CHC members and
                  members of cultish organisations respectively –what these members
                  will say, how they response to questions. Example “Do not let them
                  Hijack your Faith”.  So far, zeeleewong’s responses have been,
                  in a word, <strong>unbelievable</strong>.</p>
              <p>If the argument is true that CHC strongly teaches and
                  controls how their members respond to outsiders, then clearly
                  Zeeleewong is out of sync with the church’s teaching. The logic
                  works this way:</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;-<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;If CHC advises their members not to engage with
                  outsiders on matters on the church and their leaders integrity as
                  clearly they do not have the right frame of mind to interpret and
                  understand truth as CHC sees it.  Zeeleewong is clearly
                  violating that CHC rule  even though she devoutly defends the
                  church and all its practices and presumably follows all its dos and
                  don’ts. This is definitely not possible.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;-<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;If CHC allows or does not disallow their
                  members to debate with outsiders on matter relating to the church
                  and its leaders practices. Then given the discussion here so far,
                  Zeeleewong has not consulted with her cell leaders. This should
                  also be a no-no as all engagement with outsiders needs to be
                  reported within the cell group structure especially something as
                  important as an outsider calling into disrepute, CHC leaders’
                  practices.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;-<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;My argument is that her cell leaders are well
                  aware of her participation in this forum. The following are
                  possible scenarios:</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;a.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;She is thinking that she is winning all the
                  arguments so she doesn’t need help from her leaders. If this is the
                  case, it is my belief that she would let her cell leaders know how
                  she is doing such a good job so that other members can also be
                  encouraged to put up a strong defence in public of their church and
                  leaders. So her leaders would know about this forum.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;b.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">     </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;She is not winning the arguments but continues
                  to just state her point of view. She would share with her cell
                  leaders on lessons on how to tackle such opposition.  Her cell
                  leaders encourage her to persevere but do not want to get involved,
                  adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As long as you say it over and
                  over and over, you will wear them down to your point of view. So
                  they will know about this forum.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;c.<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">      </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;She is losing the arguments and surely would
                  have approached her cell leaders but none have come to her rescue
                  as none of them want to be on the “losing” side. They know about
                  this forum.</p>
              <p>&lt;!--[if !supportLists]--&gt;-<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">         </span> &lt;!--[endif]--&gt;So Zeeleewong’s cell leaders are well aware of
                  her arguments and discussions in this forum. They do not see it fit
                  to join in but allow Zeeleewong to continue on her own. Aren’t they
                  concerned about the “blasphamies” that could corrupt other fellow
                  members. I think it is unlikely that they have not stepped into
                  this discussion yet OR have not removed her participation yet.</p>
              <p>Here comes the “amusible” part: What if Zeeleewong is
                  not a real person, much less a CHC member but someone who is an
                  outsider. He/she posts just like the stereotype described by
                  James_Tan_1983 / alize accentuating the clichéd behavior and
                  nuances. Then we are made to believe that CHC is really full of
                  these stereotypical simplistic believers. You see, I have read my
                  share of Agatha Christie….</p>
              <p>If the “amusible” part is true, and Zeeleewong is
                  really the disguise of …… then we need our usual suspects.</p>
              <p>My list is as follows:</p>

                  good looking with sad eyes :leading man who can tug at the
                  heartstrings of the audience. Very likeable and sincere. Normally
                  not suspected but usually turns out to be the dastardly culprit in
                  the end. His possible motive is to have a go at CHC and make their
                  members look silly.</p>

              <p>The brainaic who works out elaborate schemes and
                  methods – the most “scheming” of the lot. He can take the time to
                  plan out attacks in detail and executes with patience and
                  precision. He will leave no clues and covers all his tracks. He is
                  almost impossible to be found out. The only chance to catch him is
                  to equally patient and wait until he makes a mistake. His possible
                  motivation is just to see how this whole debacle plays out in
                  accordance with his plan and how accurately he can forecast
                  players’ reactions.</p>

                  understand that although many permutations are possible, God’s
                  answers to prayers need to be optimised against constraints like
                  government laws, physical limitations (which God also can
                  ultimately also override). His motivation will be to teach the

                  rage. That could be very cathartic indeed.</p>

              <p>The person who quotes the Bible most. He reads and
                  analyses the Bible deeply and seeks truth is what is being written.
                  If he is guilty, he probably created Zeeleewong’s character
                  unconsciously as a sparing opponent to juice up different angles to
                  tackling Biblical knowledge.</p>

              <p>This suspect probably commits her crimes in her dreams.
                  She lives in a very surreal world and may have difficulties
                  reconciling that with the real world. Zeeleewong may only have
                  existed only in her own world but she must have successfully placed
                  an “inception” in all our minds that Zeeleewong indeed responds to
                  the forum.</p>

              <p>Hmm... Others have since become active inthis thread
                  and I have yet to analyse their behaviour. But normally the culprit
                  is already part of the scene right from the beginning so the later
                  members are not on my list.... yet.</p>
              <p style="margin-left: 0cm;">I had my fun. I submit myself
                  humbly to your scoldings, ridicule and insults. I do deserve them.
                  Hopefully there will not be any painful under-the-belt
                  punches and no one had been harmed.</p>

              <p>Two points.</p>
              <p>Firstly the church does not bar members from debating its practices with outsiders. They encourage you to do so. They only don't allow you to befriend critics. If you are a leader, you can use either rule when it suits you and your people will accept you without questioning. Chances are you are not a bright spark and will also fool yourself.</p>
              <p>Also you may debate but cannot question the practices. ie you may debate them in a positive light. :)</p>
              <p>Secondly zeeleewong's cell leaders are not purposely avoiding making fools of themselves. They have no idea how stupid zeeleewong is because she is painting her participation in the most positive light, perhaps by outright lying about the extent of her stupidity. Likely she said nothing about the argument itself, only: "these poor misguided people are irritating me so please pray for me" and the sheep start mumbling in agreement.</p>
              <p>A high chance they are no mensa members themselves and see nothing but brilliance in zeeleewong's line of reasoning. They share beliefs. To question her is to question themselves.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0pt;"><strong>BY JEREMY AU YONG<br></strong>POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT</p>
              <p>
              </p><p> </p>
              <p>THERE was an interesting study on charisma conducted in 1998, just after Steve Jobs returned to Apple but before he built his reputation as a messianic chief executive.</p>
              <p>  Then, researchers asked 150 students to allocate $10,000 across three possible investments: a mutual fund, money market certificates or Apple shares.</p>
              <p>  The students were given similar sets of financial information with one big difference. Half the students were shown a video of Jobs making a presentation at a trade show with his trademark flair, while the rest were not.</p>
              <p>  Researchers wanted to see if the simple addition of Jobs' charisma would have any impact on the investment decisions. The results shed some light on the impact charisma can have.</p>
              <p>  The arrest of Kong Hee and four other leaders of the City Harvest Church last week for alleged financial wrongdoings has once again drawn scrutiny to the notion of charismatic leadership.</p>
              <p>  Without commenting on his innocence or guilt - that is now a matter before the courts - his case does reignite debate over the potential dangers of charismatic leaders.</p>
              <p>  It is a conversation Singapore society has had before. After the cases involving former National Kidney Foundation (NKF) chief T.T. Durai or former Ren Ci head Ming Yi, some concluded that there was a need to be warier of the charismatic among us, because charisma is like a super power that is deadly in the wrong hands.</p>
              <p>  But if people are aware of the risk, why do they leave themselves vulnerable? Why do they not learn their lesson? And what exactly is it about charisma that seems to disable even the best defences?</p>
              <p>  Like any super power, there is nothing intrinsically bad about charisma. The ability to attract people and inspire them to follow you is actually very valuable.</p>
              <p>  For every Jim Jones, the charismatic leader responsible for the mass suicide of over 900 people, there is a Steve Jobs or a Richard Branson.</p>
              <p>  In fact, an argument could be made that charismatic leaders actually saved many companies because they pushed through change that was needed.</p>
              <p>  The problem with charisma does not lie with just the charismatic leader. Rather, the trouble tends to stem from how charisma changes the way the followers relate to the leader and the organisation.</p>
              <p>  Political scientist Marty Linsky once wrote that effective leadership meant "disappointing followers at a rate they can absorb".</p>
              <p>  He reasoned that a leader who disappointed his followers too much would be turfed out while one who did not disappoint at all was not leading anyone anywhere.</p>
              <p>  The idea implies a sort of social contract between a leader and a follower. In the absence of charisma, this contract has to include a shared sense of mission. The follower goes along with the leader because he believes the leader is taking him where he wants to go.</p>
              <p>  If the leader then starts to head off in a different direction, that social contract is violated and the leader may find he has lost his followers.</p>
              <p>  This arrangement, however, can be eroded by the presence of a a magnetic personality. A very charismatic leader does not have the same social contract. He does not need to be on the same page as his followers.</p>
              <p>  In this situation, people follow not because of some aligned sense of purpose. They are there because they are drawn to this outgoing, dynamic, passionate person.</p>
              <p>  One clear sign that an organisation has come under the spell of a charismatic leader is a sharp distinction between the way he is viewed inside and outside the organisation.</p>
              <p>  Many outside the NKF seethed when Mr Durai's lavish lifestyle came to light, so much so that the building was vandalised.</p>
              <p>  Yet, when he resigned shortly after, NKF staff members gave him a grand, emotional send-off. At the end of his farewell speech, they gave him a standing ovation.</p>
              <p>  "I've seen him work. It's his passion. He works seven days a week, by choice, for a larger cause," a manager was reported as saying that day.</p>
              <p>  All this despite the court proceeding just days earlier showing that Mr Durai had, among other things, travelled on first class flights and had a gold-plated tap installed in his office toilet.</p>
              <p>  The results of the Steve Jobs survey give an insight into how powerful the effect can be. The group that watched a 20-minute video of Jobs invested on average three times more in Apple shares than the group that did not.</p>
              <p>  They all had the same facts, but the sheer force of personality coloured their perceptions of those facts.</p>
              <p>  The charismatic leader can thus disempower his followers. They do things not because they have reasoned that it is the right thing to do but because they have ceded a lot of independence to the person asking them to do it.</p>
              <p>  Suddenly, there is no amount of disappointment they cannot absorb.</p>
              <p>  And often, not enough attention is paid to this supporting cast. When we look back on the NKF now, we tell the story of how Mr Durai compromised the organisation. But the story is not complete without including the role of his close associates.</p>
              <p>  Even if we argue that he put them there, he could not have achieved that manoeuvre without others watching it and choosing to look the other way.</p>
              <p>  To understand that is to see that no amount of new safeguards against a leader will ever be sufficient if the followers are weak. The bars of the cell may be thick but they are useless if the inmates hold all the keys.</p>
              <p>  And it is in the very nature of charisma to create weak followers.</p>
              <p>  Thus, in trying to protect organisations from abuse, what is needed may not just be more regulations or more procedures.</p>
              <p>  Instead, it is about making sure we never turn a blind eye to our own reasoning just because a flashy leader passionately and articulately tells us to.</p>

              can absorb".</p>
              <p>  He reasoned that a leader who disappointed his followers
              too much would be turfed out while one who did not disappoint at
              all was not leading anyone anywhere.</p>
              <p>  The idea implies a sort of social contract between a
              leader and a follower. In the absence of charisma, this contract
              has to include a shared sense of mission. The follower goes along
              with the leader because he believes the leader is taking him where
              he wants to go.</p>
              <p>  If the leader then starts to head off in a different
              direction, that social contract is violated and the leader may find
              he has lost his followers.</p>
              <p>  This arrangement, however, can be eroded by the presence
              of a a magnetic personality. A very charismatic leader does not
              have the same social contract. He does not need to be on the same
              page as his followers.</p>
              <p>  In this situation, people follow not because of some
              aligned sense of purpose. They are there because they are drawn to
              this outgoing, dynamic, passionate person.</p>
              <p>  One clear sign that an organisation has come under the
              spell of a charismatic leader is a sharp distinction between the
              way he is viewed inside and outside the organisation.</p>
              <p>  Many outside the NKF seethed when Mr Durai's lavish
              lifestyle came to light, so much so that the building was
              vandalised.</p>
              <p>  Yet, when he resigned shortly after, NKF staff members
              gave him a grand, emotional send-off. At the end of his farewell
              speech, they gave him a standing ovation.</p>
              <p>  "I've seen him work. It's his passion. He works seven
              days a week, by choice, for a larger cause," a manager was reported
              as saying that day.</p>
              <p>  All this despite the court proceeding just days earlier
              showing that Mr Durai had, among other things, travelled on first
              class flights and had a gold-plated tap installed in his office
              toilet.</p>
              <p>  The results of the Steve Jobs survey give an insight into
              how powerful the effect can be. The group that watched a 20-minute
              video of Jobs invested on average three times more in Apple shares
              than the group that did not.</p>
              <p>  They all had the same facts, but the sheer force of
              personality coloured their perceptions of those facts.</p>
              <p>  The charismatic leader can thus disempower his followers.
              They do things not because they have reasoned that it is the right
              thing to do but because they have ceded a lot of independence to
              the person asking them to do it.</p>
              <p>  Suddenly, there is no amount of disappointment they
              cannot absorb.</p>
              <p>  And often, not enough attention is paid to this
              supporting cast. When we look back on the NKF now, we tell the
              story of how Mr Durai compromised the organisation. But the story
              is not complete without including the role of his close
              associates.</p>
              <p>  Even if we argue that he put them there, he could not
              have achieved that manoeuvre without others watching it and
              choosing to look the other way.</p>
              <p>  To understand that is to see that no amount of new
              safeguards against a leader will ever be sufficient if the
              followers are weak. The bars of the cell may be thick but they are
              useless if the inmates hold all the keys.</p>
              <p>  And it is in the very nature of charisma to create weak
              followers.</p>
              <p>  Thus, in trying to protect organisations from abuse, what
              is needed may not just be more regulations or more procedures.</p>
              <p>  Instead, it is about making sure we never turn a blind
              eye to our own reasoning just because a flashy leader passionately
              and articulately tells us to.</p>

              <p>Depending on the eye of the beholder some people consider LKY, Michael Jackson, Joseph Prince, Hugh Jackman, Jay chou,... charismatic. So how? Put all charismatics in prison?</p>
              <p>Thanks to being charismatic, Pastor Kong and Pastor Sun would not have been able to do so much good in the world. With the money donated, Pastor Kong and Pastor Sun opened up hundreds of schools and shelters in Taiwan and China. But this does not matter to us. Even if Pastor Kong would have burned the money, we would still continue to give, because we trust him.</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">We know this is all a conspiracy. Take our dearest charismatic Chan Chun Sing: "...a governance review is not meant to discover fraud...". He made up his mind ordi. It was fraud. I ask you: "Is this fair or objective?"</p>
              <p style="text-align: -webkit-auto;">It does not matter. Even if Pastor Kong goes to prison, we will be there waiting for him when he comes out. <span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: #333333;"><span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;"> </span></span></p>

              by James Tan from Author James Watt - posted: 04/ 2/11 <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jack-watts/selfdeprecating-narcissis_b_843434.html">here</a> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 12.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">In light
              of the recent affairs with City Harvest Church,  I like to address  an issue avoided by most Christians.<br> <br> The  first time I entered a CHC Service
              in Suntec City I had no idea about what to expect. As  a Christian, I was shocked and ill prepared
              by what I witnessed. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Within a
              few minutes of my entrance, the City Harvest Saturday Afternoon Show commenced
              live, complete with 10 headed rockband, 6  singers and overzealous choir . It was a
              performance worthy of a Las Vegas or Broadway production: polished,
              professional, well-choreographed and upbeat, as well as disingenuous,
              pretentious and slick.<br> <br> At the center of attention, amid all of the acclaim, were Pastor Kong Hee and
              his wife Sun Ho, both exquisitely dressed, well-manicured and perfectly coifed.
              My astonishment didn't end there, however. Not even close. The congregation was
              on their feet, more or less in trance, arms outstretched, some jumping up and
              down, others crying, a multitude uttering funny sounds.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.5pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">As I
              witnessed this display of pretension in stunned silence, I couldn't help but
              wonder if the Lord walked in, would He be carrying a whip just like He did when
              He cast the moneychangers out of the Temple, nearly two millennia earlier. I
              wondered what Christ -- who was born of humble means, never pursued affluence
              and died ignominiously on a cross -- would think about what was occurring in
              the exhibition hall of Suntec City convention center..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Even
              after the arrest of Kong Hee and his accomplishes, which came as a shock for
              the CHC flock, but to no surprise for the outside world, Kong Hee refuses to
              admit to the obvious, refuses to repent, continues to tweet, blog willy nilly
              bible versus, as if nothing happened.  A strong
              undercurrent of self-deprecating narcissism remains within Kong Hee the
              anointed one, the lord of evangelicalism. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><br> The concept of "self-deprecating narcissism" may seem like an
              oxymoron, but is it really?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Yes it
              is, however, it requires defining. As a caveat, let me acknowledge that not all
              of the stars of charismatic  Christianity
              have this character flaw, but a substantial number do. Benny Hinn, Joel Osteen,
              Joyce Meyer, John Avanzini, Phil Pringle, Joseph Prince, David Yonggi Cho, Todd
              Bentley, … to name a few. Within the prosperity movement, there are a few
              exceptions -- precious few.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Like
              others who have a narcissistic personality disorder, Kong Hee is self-centered
              but, unlike his secular counterparts, Kong hee is not outwardly boastful, at
              least not noticeable to the flock. People may be forgiving of narcissism in
              movie stars, beauty queens and exceptional athletes, but certainly not of
              Christian leaders. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">This is
              where Kong Hee differs from the classic model of narcissism. Because Christ was
              humble, Kong Hee is expected to behave similarly. Outwardly, Kong Hee will,
              especially by the message he conveys  to the
              CHC congregation. Kong hee’s demeanor is always that of a humble servant, eager
              to follow God's will. Kong Hee has taken self-deprecating humility and made it
              an art form, cleverly masking his compulsive craving for attention, approbation
              and admiration.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"><br> <br> Many outside of the CHC indoctrination will recognize Kong Hee’s behavior for
              what and believe he is  conning his followers,
              but that's not accurate.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> In fact, it's the exact opposite. A con knows
              what he or she is doing but chooses to do it anyway, despite the harm it
              causes. Kong Hee genuinely believes that what he is doing is right, which makes
              him far more dangerous. In his mind, he has a higher calling than others -- a
              closer relationship with God -- making whatever he does seen justifiable to him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.5pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">If
              someone gets in his way, especially someone employed by him, that person is
              perceived as thwarting God's will and fully deserving of the retribution they
              receive from the narcissistic leader. Ask Ronald Spoon. Because Kong Hee
              genuinely believes himself to be better than others, he will insist that each
              of the CHC members and employees fall in line, regardless of how outrageous or
              bizarre the superstar's demands become. Like sending 23 Million dollar to Sun
              Ho bank account.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">To make
              matters worse, nearly all narcissists are hypersensitive to criticism. For
              insulation from disapproval, narcissists surround themselves with weak-willed
              sycophants who wouldn't dream of disagreeing. Instead, these well-paid
              non-entities consistently validate perceptions and behavior that deviate
              substantially from biblical standards. WithinCHC  there are two sets of rules: those for the
              narcissist and those for everyone else.<br> <br> Within CHC, a tacit "no-talk" rule has been and still is maintained,
              which keeps the eccentricities of Kong Hee a secret from the rest of the world.
              And this rule is aggressively enforced. Whenever an underling balks, that
              person is shamed, castigated and humiliated, while -- at the same time -- being
              told that their "bad attitude" is being prayed for. If that doesn't
              shame the person into submission, the verbal abuse is intensified and the
              person is eventually terminated. Wounded, the discarded person often abandons
              his or her beliefs, while blaming God for what happened, saying, "God
              should have done something to stop it." CHC refers to these as “backsliders”.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.5pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.5pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Undeterred
              by hurting others in the process of building God's Kingdom on Earth, which just
              happens to be his kingdom as well, Kong Hee will regularly take advantage of
              others, routinely abusing those they are "called to serve." Reasoning
              that the ends justify the means, Kong hee will use God's name to wound others. Very
              often with a smile.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 10.5pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">Whenever
              someone gets in his  way, Kong Hee will
              misuse God's authority to enforce their will, which certainly takes His name in
              vain. Believing that he has a higher calling, Kong Hee is certain that God
              condones his behavior and methods, which the sycophants who surround them
              eagerly affirm.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 15.0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Georgia, serif;">The
              emotional carnage of wrecked lives left behind by Kong hee today is still
              hidden to the public. Several CHC members do know the Pastor Kong can be “cocky”
              and has a “Temper”. CHC members do know that Pastor Kong has a tendency to
              break down his direct employees, who eventually will quit their job.  This behavior is translated as Pastor Kong
              preparing the employee for life, teaching him important lessons. So  few are willing to call him to task, exposing his
              behavior to the light, reasoning that such whistle blowing would harm God's
              work.<br> <br> Luckily, COC disagrees with that conclusion and is finally exposing him. Let’s
              all hope it will be a fair trial, without any interference of politics or
              money.</span></p>
