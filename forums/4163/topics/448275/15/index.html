              <p>2. You might as well say that when we donate to a church or charity, it is voluntary therefore the church or charity can spend it however it wishes.</p>

              <p>BroInChrist, can you share with us how this obligation to tithe and the percentage to be tithed came about?</p>
              <p>From what I know, NCC requires that "those serving in any ministry should tithe faithfully".Among other things, they also cannot have premarital sex or "a lifestyle of frequenting nightspots" and are to be "submissive to their superiors".</p>

              <p>Tithing is instituted for the nation of Israel for the support of the temple and the priesthood. There was more than one tithe mandated. In fact it may be up to 23.33%! It functions more like a tax to run the nation of Israel. See <a href="http://www.tithing-russkelly.com/id29.html">http://www.tithing-russkelly.com/id29.html</a></p>
              <p>According to Frank Viola who writes prolifically about church history and church life, tithing came into the church in the 8th century.</p>

              <p>As to what NCC teaches, not having premarital sex is God's command so as not to defile the marriage bed. Jesus had a "notorious" reputation of mingling with sinners because He was reaching the lost. Do believers who frequent nightspots and clubbing and pubbling have these intentions? The Bible did not say we are to submit to our superiors. Submission to believers is mutual. The Bible teaches that we be persuaded by those who are older/mature in the faith and yield to them. In other words, it is not a blinded hierarchical submission but one whereby moral suasion is practiced.</p>

              <p>Yes, the Bible teaches us to support the elders who work hard at preaching and teaching. But the "pay" may not necessarily be in terms of a monthly stipend aka salary. It is important to distinguish between voluntarily supporting these elders by providing them with food, shelter or money according to one's ability and desire, and paying them a monthly salary. The former is Biblical but not the latter. See <a href="http://www.5solas.org/media.php?id=88">http://www.5solas.org/media.php?id=88</a></p>
              <p>I think you need to be realistic and honest about it. You tithe because you have been taught that you need to tithe. And you want to tithe because you are being told that it brings financial rewards. As to how the tithes are being used, I think James has mentioned that. A mega church is resource-hungry, and a large part of the money would be for building and salaries to run the machinery and upkeep it, with only a small portion being actually used for the saints.</p>

              <p>I agree that believers who frequent nightspots are not reaching the lost, but I wonder if they are breaking of God's commands. If they club responsibly and avoid the evils of drunkeness, it is not NCC's business to regulate how often they can club.</p>
              <p>In any case, church members' rights come foremost. All citizens have constitutional rights 1) to practice religion 2) to live by their religion's tenets 3) to choose whether to live by their religion's tenets 4) to be free of intereference to these rights.</p>
              <p>Any organisation's, including the church's, rights to impose rules come second to these rights. For example, a Christian school cannot expel a Muslim pupil or deny him time for Friday prayers, because the child has rights to religion and to education.</p>
              <p>An example: The Catholic Church does not believe in premarital sex or using contraception, and in the US, does not want to buy health insurance for its members' that covers contraception. The White House ruled that they must purchase the insurance because to do otherwise interferes with members' rights to choose to practice the tenets of their religion.

              <p>Likewise, NCC cannot force members to tithe. They can exercise employer's rights to hire ministry members as they please, or charge admission to cover their costs. The source of this right is not derived from Christian doctrine.</p>

              <p>Of course there is no command in the Bible to say that one cannot go clubbing. Personally I see it as a matter of Christian liberty, though I would encourage believers to go to more conducive places if they wish to chill and relax and spend time with friends.</p>
              <p>Regarding rights and rules I think this may be another topic for discussion. Briefly I take the view that he who owns the place sets the rules. If I run a Christian school (no govt funding involved) then I will run it the Christian way. In the first place I may not even admit a non-Christian into the school. But perhaps another Christian may choose to do otherwise. It's his prerogative.</p>
              <p>In regards to tithes, while it was taxes to Israel it is not treated as taxes today. A tithe is not defined as taxes because the church is not the government. Govt collect taxes but not churches. In fact I would argue that the tithe has no place in the church because it was never taught by Jesus or the apostles to the church.</p>

              <p>Of course there is no command in the Bible to say that one
              cannot go clubbing. Personally I see it as a matter of Christian
              liberty, though I would encourage believers to go to more conducive
              places if they wish to chill and relax and spend time with
              friends.</p>
              <p>Regarding rights and rules I think this may be another topic for
              discussion. Briefly I take the view that he who owns the place sets
              the rules. If I run a Christian school (no govt funding involved)
              then I will run it the Christian way. In the first place I may not
              even admit a non-Christian into the school. But perhaps another
              Christian may choose to do otherwise. It's his prerogative.</p>
              <p>In regards to tithes, while it was taxes to Israel it is not
              treated as taxes today. A tithe is not defined as taxes
              because the church is not the government. Govt collect taxes but
              not churches. In fact I would argue that the tithe has no place in
              the church because it was never taught by Jesus or the apostles to
              the church.</p>

              <p>Regarding tithes, I was saying that the church has no right to levy a compulsory contribution. I agree that today there is no justification for it in the first place.</p>
              <p>I assume when you said tithes were intended to support the temples and priesthood of Israel, you meant Israel of biblical times. How did tithing disappear and reappear with a fresh justification in the 8th century? Was it to support the Catholic Church's properties and later military campaigns?</p>

              <p>Here's what Frank Viola has to say in his well-researched book "Pagan Christianity" about tithing</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The New Testament urges believers to give according to their ability.</span><strong> </strong>Christians in the early church gave to help other believers as well as to support apostolic workers, enabling them to travel and plant churches. One of the most outstanding testimonies of the early church has to dowith how generous the Christians were to the poor and needy. This iswhat provoked outsiders, including the philosopher Galen, to watch the awesome, winsome power of the early church and say: "Behold how they love one another." </span></p>
              <p>
              </p><p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">
              </span></span></p><p>In the third century, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cyprian of Carthage was the first Christian writer to mention the practice of financially supporting the clergy. </span>He argued that just as the Levites were supported by the tithe, so theChristian clergy should be supported by the tithe. But this is mis-guided thinking. Today, the Levitical system has been abolished. We are all priests now. So if a priest demands a tithe, then all Christians should tithe to one another! Cyprian's plea was exceedingly rare for his time. It was neither picked up nor echoed by the Christian populace until much later. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other than Cyprian, no Christian writer before Constantine ever used Old Testament references to advocate tithing. </span></p>
              <span style="font-size: small;">It was not until the fourth century, three hundred years after Christ, that some Christian leaders began to advocate tithing as a Christian practice to support the clergy. But it did not become widespread among Christians until the eighth century. According to one <span style="font-size: small;">scholar, "For the first seven hundred years they [tithes] are hardly ever mentioned."</span></span><p></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Charting the history of Christian tithing is a fascinating exercise. Tithing spread from the state to the church. </span></span><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">Here's the story. In the seventh and eighth centuries, leasing land was a familiar characteristic of the European economy. The use of the tithe, or the tenth, was commonly used to calculate payments <span style="font-size: small;">to landlords. As the church increased its ownership of land across Europe, the 10 percent rent-charge shifted from secular landlords to the church. Ecclesiastical leaders became the landlords. And the tithe became the ecclesiastical tax. This gave the 10 percent rent charge new meaning. It was creatively applied to the Old Testament law and came to be identified with the Levitical tithe! Consequently, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the Christian tithe as an institution was based on a fusion of Old Testament practice and a common system of land-leasing in medieval Europe.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: small;">   </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style="font-size: small;">
              </span></span></p><p>By the eighth century, the tithe became required by law in many areas of Western Europe. But by the end of the tenth century, the tithe as a rent charge for leasing land had all but faded. The tithe,however, remained and it came to be viewed as a moral requirement supported by the Old Testament. The tithe had evolved into a legally mandatory religious practice throughout Christian Europe. <span style="font-size: small;">To put it another way, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">before the eighth century the tithe was practiced as a voluntary offering. But by the end of the tenth century,it had devolved into a legal requirement to fund the state church—demanded by the clergy and enforced by the secular authorities!</span></span></p>
              <p></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: small;"></span><span style="font-size: small;">Today, the tithe is no longer a legal requirement in any nation. Yet the obligatory practice of tithing is as much alive today as it was when it was legally binding. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sure, you may not be physically punished if you fail to tithe. But in many ministries you will either be told or be made to feel that you are sinning. </span>In fact, in some churches, if you are not a tither, you will be barred from holding a ministry position. A friend of mine was considered for eldership in one well-known congregation. However, because he believed in giving anonymously (he didn't use checks), he was barred from being an elder. The reason? He was told that the church had to know who was obeying God by tithing and who wasn't. This was the across-the-board policy of that particular denomination. Only tithers could be elders.</span></p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">As far as clergy salaries go, ministers were unsalaried for the first three centuries.</span> But when Constantine appeared, he instituted the practice of paying a fixed salary to the clergy from church funds and municipal and imperial treasuries. Thus was born the clergy salary,a harmful practice that has no root in the New Testament.</p>
              <p>There is no doubt that it is imperative for believers to support the Lord's work financially and to give generously to the poor. Scripture enjoins both, and the Kingdom of God desperately needs both. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The issue under scrutiny in this chapter is the appropriateness of the tithe as a Christian "law" and how it is normally used: to fund clergy salaries, operational costs, and church building overhead.</span></p>

              <p>Regardless of the intents behind enforcing celibacy, the Bible does not demand it of anyone as far as the teachings of Christ and the apostles are concerned. Again this is more the domain of Roman Catholicism, not Biblical Christianity.</p>

              <p>@alize: Giving is supposed to be done out of the giver's will. After clarifying this issue with some mature Christians, it is not right for a leader to approach members to give. We are judged not based on whether or how much we gave, but how we steward our finances. God does not need our money, giving is just one of the many ways we should do to prevent covetousness and support church leaders in their work.</p>
              <p>How the church leaders account for the money is a different matter. They are to be good stewards; spending wisely and reporting transparent details for accountability.</p>
              <p>@Xiao^P: We do not know how true Jame's story about his friend is. After all, his first post is not supported by accurate information, but rather opinionated. The church builds up a spiritual family that provides a platform for one another to grow in the body of Christ. Of course there will be some others who may desert you in times of crisis, indifferent from the secular setting, but which organization and its people are perfect? Based on personal experiences alone, I know that there're church friends who stood by me when I struggled. No one can promise that all friends can be there for you and this remains true within and outside the walls of the church. It doesn't work to judge Christ based on your encounters with church attendees alone. I hope one day you realize how much He loves you.</p>
              <p>@Zeeleewong: Your faith has made you strong. Loving God wholeheartedly and loving people fervently are the foundations of CHC's beliefs. Arguing does no one justice. Some of their points are worth thinking through- Entrusting your life in Pastor Kong's teaching and actions is not healthy Christian living, rather, be open to constructive criticism. Leave them be if their opinions cannot agree, keeping hurtful remarks out of discussion. Blessed are the peacemakers. ;)</p>
