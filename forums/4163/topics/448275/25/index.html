              <p>Actually... I agree with broinchrist leh. That's my position.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I'm not going to try to convince you of God's existence. That's your private spiritual life and personal beliefs.</p>
              <p>You wrote:</p>

              <p>In the world we live in, there is an 
              unwritten/unspoken expectation to "play by the rules" so as to maximize 
              benefits for the poeple - "society". This isn't morality at all. It is 
              called playing your cards right. It's about looking out for personal 
              interest - It is personal interest not to murder others, because I know 
              in a 100% free world, some guy will "one-up" me with a knife-wielding 
              gang, and escalate up to guns and armies. This ensures that nobody wins.
               "Society" unspokenly "agreed" to have civil laws to prevent this so the
               rules are set to ensure there is some predictibility in society. It is 
              in everybody's interest. This is explained in Rosseau's "Social 
              Contract". It isn't morality at all. It's political science. It's mutual
               benefit. It's called "I scratch your back, you scratch mine."</p>

              source.</p>
              <p>You are talking about civil laws here. I see a difference 
              between civil laws and moral standards. Civil laws are passed by the 
              legislators and is a form of regulation - which regulates a man's 
              behavior, not define morality.</p>
              <p>If a tree falls down on the south 
              side and nobody saw it, did it fall on the south side? Or did it fall on
               the south side regardless if someone saw it. If someone commited a 
              crime and there are no policmen around, was there a crime? There is a 
              reason why policemen are also called Law ENFORCERS. They enforce the 
              law.</p>
              <p>Now would you not agree that murder is pretty universal? Now
               if someone murdered another, and no one saw it and therefore cannot be 
              charged in a human court. Did the person commit wrong? I'm not even 
              asking why in some cases there are instances of guilt despite commiting a
               crime in private. Is guilt a subjective and arbitrary emotion?</p>
              <p>You wrote:</p>
              <p>3. if god's morality is absolute it should leave no room for

              disagree.</p>
              <p>Do you have children? Do you give them everything they 
              want? Or do you have to make judgement calls, where every situation is 
              different? Do you list in black and white in detail everything that is 
              right and wrong for your kid? How does one have a decent relationship 
              based on love, trust and respect with that sort of arrangement? (There's
               a reason why God gave the law - and reluctantly I must add, which I 
              won't go in detail here. God does prefer another system where it is not 
              based on "black and white" precisely for this reason, it's impossible to
               have a decent relationship.)</p>
              <p>In my basic understanding of civil laws (EVEN civil laws), 
              intention makes a difference. What is the difference between culpible 
              homicide (manslaughter) vs. murder? The difference is premeditation. Who
               can objectivly tell what is in a man's heart, since he has every 
              possible means to lie to fabricate false evidences, not just in civil 
              courts, but in everyday life, children lie too. Even in secular life, 
              all attempts to have a standard are consider "arbitrary" by your 
              worldview. Do you know, in civil courts, it is in the judge's discretion
               to mete a heavy sentence or a light one? And it's not an exact science,
               I tell you. You should ask those who work in law agencies and in law 
              enforcement. Black and white isn't 100% black and white.</p>
              <p>There is also such a thing called grace in theology. Please read 
              my previous posts in detail - Christ makes a way for God's standards to 
              be fulfilled by those who cannot possibly achieve it.</p>
              <p>Your
               conflict and tension is correct. All humans are imperfect. How can the 
              imperfect reach a perfect God? God is JUST in condemning the one who is 
              imperfect, and He has to, otherwise He isn't God.</p>
              <p>So how can God 
              claim to be love at the same time? The reconciliation is found in 
              Christ. In case no one gave the message correctly. It's a <strong>FREE</strong> gift - 
              you don't have to earn it. You are right and perfectly holy before God 
              because of Christ. And you have to understand it isn't "free love" where
               it's sweeping the dirt under the carpet.</p>
              <p>God is righteous in making you righteous in Christ. <strong>It's judicial, it's a legal term.</strong></p>

              <p>1. Don't say I spoke of law or mutually beneficial trading, I did not.</p>
              <p>The common experience of unpleasantness or pain can indeed result in the formation of morality.</p>
              <p>BroInChrist stated that animals are sinless and they do not commit immoral acts. This leads to there being no morality in animals, and yet they are capable of compassion when they are aware a human or fellow animal is in pain or need. Could this motive not be in humans and be the origin of our concept of morality?</p>
              <p>That morality is a concept, there is no doubt. The question is why this concept can only be given by god. There is no requirement for morality to have necessarily come out of nowhere, without development or origins in animalistic compassion or self-interest or any other source, to be called morality.</p>
              <p>2. Don't say I spoke of different understanding of laws. I spoke of people having different understandings of morality.</p>
              <p>I agree that murder is universally considered immoral. I disagree that a crime is a crime regardless of whether it is seen or where it is committed. For example: forcing people or children or women to do things is not always considered immoral. People differ on whether autocracy is immoral or not. Some see it as good. This is quite apart from legality, which is irrelevant because laws can be drawn as one sees fit.</p>

              <p>I think too many people think that the "bad news" is caused by
              God, hence, all the debate about why did God allow it? How can a
              perfect God create an imperfect creation? blah blah blah. There are
              theological answers, but I won't rehash them, I think atheists have
              heard them enough and an intellectual debate is not my aim
              (although I think intellectual debates are fun!).</p>
              <p>The issue in the end is a heart issue. I personally think that
              atheists took the easy way out and threw the baby out with the bath
              water. The best way to deal with it all is to reject God altogether
              and what better way than to discredit the integrity of the
              sciptures?</p>
              <p>The opening of the Red Sea, resurrection from the dead, bearing
              a child at 99 years old, humans living thousands of years old,
              giants, solid walls falling down from a blow of a trumpet! So many
              "incredible" tales. 6 day creation is the most "ludicrious"! How
              can something as complex as a world (complete with living things
              from bacteria to whales) be created in 6 days, when a swiss watch
              takes months to complete? It's very easy to use science to reason
              it all as folklore. WAY TOO EASY! So much that it should be a joke,
              but to atheists they take it very seriously, rather strange for
              "logical" people. It's rather like trying to prove ice is cold and
              water is wet. Why? Because of their heart is in conflict. They
              cannot believe in an angry God. They might not have the scriptures
              to prove it, but they intuitively discern correctly that it's not
              God's nature to being wrathful.</p>
              <p>And so what is the answer when talking to atheists? I don't have
              all the answers yet, but I'm not so sure the best way is to use
              intellectual debate, because it's the conflict in their **hearts**
              that is what is the problem. And getting into an intellectual
              discussion is like trying to treat a heart disease with
              neuroscience.</p>
              <p>To me (and to me only - my opinion, not universal), the best way
              is just to give the Message of Christ and the forgivenss of sins.
              For it is the Holy Spirit who convicts. It is also the Holy Spirit
              who knows the deep waters of a man's heart and what are the fears
              and conflicts within it that is preventing a person from opening
              his heart to Christ.</p>
              <p>But if you don't give the message of Christ, the Holy Spirit has
              nothing to bear witness to or convict. It's not my responsibility
              to convince them (it is the Holy Spirit's job to convict others,
              not me. For Romans 2:14 also says: even those without the Law are a
              law unto themselves - all of us know our human shortcomings), my
              responsibility is to make sure I am a proper ambassador of God's

              are a sinner (i.e. imperfect under God's perfect standards), the
              important Person to admit to is God. And they can do it privately,
              not necessarily under duress by a Christian trying to push them. I
              certainly did open to Christ in my own privacy. I HATED (back then)
              Christians pushing religion off of me. I HATED (back then)
              discussing creationism. Looking back, I learned a lot what not to
              do. It wasn't science that converted me. It was faith (in a loving

              <p>Lastly, it is the message of Christ that is the power unto
              salvation. The focus is Christ, not creationist theology. We know
              that blindness has affected those who don't see and the enemy is
              responsible for that blindness. The enemy isn't afraid of Bible
              info - in fact, he quotes scriptures when tempting Christ. It
              doesn't bother the enemy.</p>
              <p>So, what actually does bother the enemy? I believe it is Christ,
              His message and His work, because it destroys and "disarms

              <p>Just food for thought.</p>

              Thanks again for the sharing. There is much to agree with you. I would say that for nonbelievers it is both a heart and mind issue, but more of the heart than the mind. And for the more hardcore atheists I think it may be more a moral issue. Bertrand Russell was a womaniser, and was it Julian Huxley who said that God would interfere with his sexual mores? Someone said that when he met with a hardcore atheist he would cut to the chase and ask what sin the atheist could not give up.
              
              <p>Anyway, I think there are people with genuine intellectual issues, or present them as reasons for rejecting Christ. My style would be to show that their objections are not as tough as they make it out to be. Paul debated and reasoned and demolished the arguments of those who opposed the faith. Acts 17 is insightful. Paul was reasoning with the Greeks and he started with a creation talk. Why? Because unlike the Jews in Acts 2, the Greeks did not have a creation foundation and the knowledge of sin based in Genesis. So Paul had to put that foundation in before he could talk about the need for a Redeemer. I believe today's society is like the Greeks. Evolution theory has deceives people into thinking that there is no God to whom they owe their lives to and are accountable to.

              <p>I think too many people think that the "bad news" is caused by
              God, hence, all the debate about why did God allow it? How can a
              perfect God create an imperfect creation? blah blah blah. There are
              theological answers, but I won't rehash them, I think atheists have
              heard them enough and an intellectual debate is not my aim
              (although I think intellectual debates are fun!).</p>
              <p>The issue in the end is a heart issue. I personally think that
              atheists took the easy way out and threw the baby out with the bath
              water. The best way to deal with it all is to reject God altogether
              and what better way than to discredit the integrity of the
              sciptures?</p>
              <p>The opening of the Red Sea, resurrection from the dead, bearing
              a child at 99 years old, humans living thousands of years old,
              giants, solid walls falling down from a blow of a trumpet! So many
              "incredible" tales. 6 day creation is the most "ludicrious"! How
              can something as complex as a world (complete with living things
              from bacteria to whales) be created in 6 days, when a swiss watch
              takes months to complete? It's very easy to use science to reason
              it all as folklore. WAY TOO EASY! So much that it should be a joke,
              but to atheists they take it very seriously, rather strange for
              "logical" people. It's rather like trying to prove ice is cold and
              water is wet. Why? Because of their heart is in conflict. They
              cannot believe in an angry God. They might not have the scriptures
              to prove it, but they intuitively discern correctly that it's not
              God's nature to being wrathful.</p>
              <p>And so what is the answer when talking to atheists? I don't have
              all the answers yet, but I'm not so sure the best way is to use
              intellectual debate, because it's the conflict in their **hearts**
              that is what is the problem. And getting into an intellectual
              discussion is like trying to treat a heart disease with
              neuroscience.</p>
              <p>To me (and to me only - my opinion, not universal), the best way
              is just to give the Message of Christ and the forgivenss of sins.
              For it is the Holy Spirit who convicts. It is also the Holy Spirit
              who knows the deep waters of a man's heart and what are the fears
              and conflicts within it that is preventing a person from opening
              his heart to Christ.</p>
              <p>But if you don't give the message of Christ, the Holy Spirit has
              nothing to bear witness to or convict. It's not my responsibility
              to convince them (it is the Holy Spirit's job to convict others,
              not me. For Romans 2:14 also says: even those without the Law are a
              law unto themselves - all of us know our human shortcomings), my
              responsibility is to make sure I am a proper ambassador of God's
              intention of saving people by giving them the right message. That
              is, the message of reconciliation - reconciling them to God through

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p><br> Thanks again for the sharing. There is much to agree with you. I
                  would say that for nonbelievers it is both a heart and mind issue,
                  but more of the heart than the mind. And for the more hardcore
                  atheists I think it may be more a moral issue. Bertrand Russell was
                  a womaniser, and was it Julian Huxley who said that God would
                  interfere with his sexual mores? Someone said that when he met with
                  a hardcore atheist he would cut to the chase and ask what sin the
                  atheist could not give up.</p>
              <p>Anyway, I think there are people with genuine intellectual
                  issues, or present them as reasons for rejecting Christ. My style
                  would be to show that their objections are not as tough as they
                  make it out to be. Paul debated and reasoned and demolished the
                  arguments of those who opposed the faith. Acts 17 is insightful.
                  Paul was reasoning with the Greeks and he started with a creation
                  talk. Why? Because unlike the Jews in Acts 2, the Greeks did not
                  have a creation foundation and the knowledge of sin based in
                  Genesis. So Paul had to put that foundation in before he could talk
                  about the need for a Redeemer. I believe today's society is like
                  the Greeks. Evolution theory has deceives people into thinking that
                  there is no God to whom they owe their lives to and are accountable
                  to.</p>

              <p>Same here. I try to explain to them as much as I can for those who are genuinely seeking. But some folks have decided, so there's nothing more you can do after giving the Word of Reconciliation. I don't like crossing swords for the sake of crossing swords. I can if I want to and I am well able to. But I keep in mind, why? And for what ends?</p>
              <p>Since they have decided - It really doesn't matter what you say, so I just discontinue the conversation for edification sake.</p>
              <p>Those who seek, find. Those who don't seek?  Well, don't cast your pearls unto.... .. those who can't appreciate.</p>
              <p>"Paul was reasoning with the Greeks and he started with a creation

              <p>Hey! Very good point! And this is my reason and motivation for debate - I learned something today. (I'm not trying to convert and push religion, and neither am I trying to win an argument. I like to learn something new.)</p>
              <p>For the Greeks, they seek wisdom, for the Jews, they seek a sign (with an attitude of unbelief - a prove-me-wrong! attitude). But God will give neither - Not meaning that God will never give His power or his wisdom. Evidently, there is power and wisdom, but in the church. I think the key here is faith, for He is a rewarder of those who seek Him.</p>
              <p>I try to listen to a person's heart when they speak. Surprisingly, even on the web, it is not entirely impossible!</p>

              <p>It shouldn't be a surprise... The internet provide a veil of protection to the user. Such enables them to be themselves, to be more outspoken than in real life. I believe these expressions are more truthful, of course wisdom is required to discern those playing the fool... and those expressing nakedly.</p>

              <p>Actually, I must say, CHC members honestly are not bad people at all in my various experience with them, although imo sometimes a little... misguided? My best experiences with them is when they know that when KH is against the teaching of another pastor, they just give the teaching and try to convince, but it never becomes personal. There's no hatred, no jealousy, no bad vibes at all.</p>
              <p>They are also very helpful, when I was down, CHC people offered encouragement, despite me not joining their church. So far, I haven't had a bad experience with them.</p>
              <p>I'm only uncomfortable with the structure, and their top down heirarchy and the way some things are done. It's a big no-no for me. But maybe because my experience is good because I haven't served in their Ministry, and never had to be hounded for a tithe??? Oops!!! Heehee! I personally believe tithing should be voluntary (broinchrist might disagree, that the tithe is 100% abolished under the NT).</p>
              <p>I don't know, but I wish to keep the good impressions and good memories I've had.</p>
              <p>Zeeweelong, just want to say (and I'm not pouring cold water, I know you have faith ok?) that whatever happens to KH, just know that there are other Christians who will still accept you and there are other churches that will welcome you.</p>
              <p>I know you have faith, and I know you believe that KH will have no problem. But just know you have this hand extended out to you as a safety net; and you can be at ease in the worst-possible-case scenario - I'm sure KH always taught you all to be well prepared.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those who are unbelievers here reading this, while I believe in grace, I also believe that a man (whoever he is) should be jailed if found to be dishonest - pastor or not. So, the best way is to let the (civil) law take its course, and CHC members can continue to pray.</p>

              <p>Christians are often asked whether they would still believe
                      despite not being able to explain biblical impossibilities or
                      contradictions- and say yes. Some christian scientists say the
                      same.</p>
              <p>It shows that those who believe, came to believe through the
                      emotional process. Few are christians who came to believe through

              <p>The above, however, does not lead to the conclusion that an

              <p>Reading some of the things you have written previously regarding objectivity in morality.... I'm sure in real life, both me and broinchrist will look at each other and smile knowingly at some of the things you said...</p>
              <p>Atheists are moral people, and like any people, they are also human beings with feelings like anger, fear, joy, happiness. I'm sure an atheist who wins a lottery will jump up and pump their fists!! Feel disappointed when their favorite soccer team loses a game... or, smile at one another when we both see a particularly attractive female. We both share many similar "human qualities". I see people as people, not Christians vs. non-Christians. I think where we differ is the issue of the existence of God.</p>
              <p>If your beliefs work for you, I personally just leave them alone, though other Christians might disagree with me. I'll be happy to explain *my* reasons for believing in God, regardless if they agree or not.</p>
              <p>There is a saying in the Bible and I'm sure you will agree with it regardless of its origin: "Each heart knows its own sorrows, and another does not share its joy"</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it is all about resting on your pillow (alone or not) and having a peace in your heart, and if faith and spirituality fills that, hey, why not?</p>
              <p>You are right in your distinction of faith from reason, but faith isn't emotion, although it CAN give rise to emotions. I believe man has faith, precisely for reasons that *faith is not reason.* And faith fills in those gaps in people's lives - whether they are Buddhists or Muslims or Christians. For things such as happiness and minimizing pain and suffering, spirituality attempts to deal with those painful events in life that is so unreasonable, or simply to give hope to those who don't have one, or a person dealing with the unknown after death. It seems so cruel to derive people of that hope, even if by your understanding it is a lie.</p>
              <p>And maybe you don't need it - "it's for weak people", one might say... Well, each man pursues his own happiness and surely by the moral standards of atheists, there is such a thing as individual free choice rather than coercion to renounce all faith (i.e. to turn atheist), no?</p>

              <p>Misguided is a good definition. Gullible saying the same but with more negative connotation.
                  
                  Both believers and non-believers are frustrated with the (hidden?) exploitation of seemingly helpless (or non-thinking) people. My dear friend forgot his responsibilities towards his wife and children, and I am convinced this would not have happened if not CHC. The many "good" members in CHC are doing nothing to protect the helpless youth who are so easily influenced
                  
                  A good example is following article (read below).  
                  How many CHC members will dig in their pockets to support their pastor? How many students will give their pennies to Kong? How many financially troubled CHC members will their last money, delaying plans, to help out Kong Hee? 
                  
                  Kong Hee is living a lavish lifestyle with penthouse in Sentosa Cove, and only God knows what else. He has obviously no issue of paying 1,000,000 bail. Does he really need the help? What if he is found guilty? Refund?
                          
                  Do you think this is a good thing? Is this the example we want to be for our children? "Sorry my dear princess, we cannot buy your dress because we need to save Pastor Kong who has so much hardship in his life right now" ???
                  
                  Surely there were plenty of good people in Jonestown, right before they poisoned their children...
                  I have seen with my own eyes, how a seemingly kindhearted and wonderfull Kong Hee can destroy a perfectly healthy family. This guy is more dangerous then Hee himself realizes.
