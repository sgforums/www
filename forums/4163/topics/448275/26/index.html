              <p>Misguided is a good definition. Gullible saying the same but
              with more negative connotation. Both believers and non-believers
              are frustrated with the (hidden?) exploitation of seemingly
              helpless (or non-thinking) people. My dear friend forgot his
              responsibilities towards his wife and children, and I am convinced
              this would not have happened if not CHC. The many "good" members in
              CHC are doing nothing to protect the helpless youth who are so
              easily influenced A good example is following article (read below).
              How many CHC members will dig in their pockets to support their
              pastor? How many students will give their pennies to Kong? How many
              financially troubled CHC members will their last money, delaying
              plans, to help out Kong Hee? Kong Hee is living a lavish lifestyle
              with penthouse in Sentosa Cove, and only God knows what else. He
              has obviously no issue of paying 1,000,000 bail. Does he really
              need the help? What if he is found guilty? Refund? Do you think
              this is a good thing? Is this the example we want to be for our
              children? "Sorry my dear princess, we cannot buy your dress because
              we need to save Pastor Kong who has so much hardship in his life
              right now" ??? Surely there were plenty of good people in
              Jonestown, right before they poisoned their children... I have seen
              with my own eyes, how a seemingly kindhearted and wonderfull Kong
              Hee can destroy a perfectly healthy family. This guy is more
              dangerous then Hee himself realizes. (source:

              <p>"City Harvest Church members who want to give money to help offset the
               legal and court fees of their founder Kong Hee may now do so in their 
              own capacity. Mr Aries Zulkarnain, the church’s executive pastor, has given his consent to this.</p>
              <p>The Straits Times reported that during the meeting, the executive 
              members of the board indicated their support for their leaders. Three 
              members suggested that the board should ask the Commissioner of Charity 
              to allow the church to use its funds to pay for the lawyer and court 
              fees for the six people embroiled in the court case. They also said that
               if their request is rejected, they will raise money through the 
              members.</p>
              <p>Mr Zulkarnian responded by saying that while the church cannot use its 
              funds to help the six, individual members are free to raise money for 
              them as long as they adhere to the relevant laws and regulations."</p>

              <p>Pastor Aries supporting raising money for Kong Hee's defence is really thick skinned!!!</p>
              <p>Kong Hee is on trial, not CHC. Pastor Aries allowing to raise members funds is completely voluntary.</p>
              <p>So far, KH's legal fees have been paid by insurance. In the event he is guilty, he will have to pay back the insurance company. But for the members, guilty or
                                      not guilty, their money is gone!!!</p>
              <p>Insurance won't pay once it's maxed out. These members will probably give as much as they are asked.</p>
              <p>This is a very interesting Pastor and board indeed.</p>

That is all that matters.<br><br>
                  
                  Pastor Kong has done so many good things for society, for the youth, disabled, elderly, ... in and out of Singapore. Pastor Kong has touched and changed the lives of so many people. Pastor Kong deserve all the abundance that the Lord provided to him. Pastor Kong deserves to live in Sentosa. He deserves to live well as he had to face a lot of hardship in doing the Lord's work.<br><br>
                  
                  If in the process, Pastor Kong did not follow any secular laws, we know he will receive secular punishment. Christians have been persecuted since the start of the church. This still does not make him guilty in our view. <br><br>
                  
                  Outsiders do not know this, but we have known from the start that Pastor Sun's music was going to be used to bring people to Christ. As a result, 150,000 people have found Jesus, including Jay Chou.<br><br>

              <p>Kong Hee will return la, there's no reason not to. Even if he's convicted he will still appear as a victim to his followers and the hardcore will rally around him even more.</p>
              <p>Now's the time to make money, so he needs to go pay back Pringle and Co for preaching here, by accepting invitations and speaking assignments (at top dollar) in various countries.</p>
              <p>Now will he be found guilty of the 3 charges?</p>
              <p>I think that's not his main concern now, the main thing is to find which of the other 5 idiots will take the rap for him. </p>
              <p>If 1 or more of them will raise their hands and say yes, we did all these but never told Kong hee or he never gave permission, we did this as part for the Crossover like obedient and willing sheep, then Kong hee may well be having the last laugh.</p>
              <p>His only worry, is that 1 or 2 get cold feet and on their lawyer's advise plead guilty for a lighter sentence and admit in the statement of facts that Kong hee was instrumental in the whole process.</p>
              <p>Of course the 3rd possibilty is that all 6 fight the charges and pin the blame of each other, resulting in all 6 getting convicted of 1 or more charges.</p>
              <p>So Kong hee has done superbly well to come from small time to the big league and the big bucks, converting and conning many sheep. Now he has to do it 1 more time - can he succeed?</p>

              <p>The Commissioner of Charities (COC) has issued a Restriction Order to 
              the Board of City Harvest Church (CHC) to restrict CHC from paying the 
              legal fees of its disgraced pastor Kong Hee and five other accused 
              persons and entering into transactions relating to payment of services 
              to the suspended individuals and their related entities, without the 
              approval of the COC.</p>
              <p>The COC has informed CHC that the church and/or its employees should 
              not be involved in raising funds for the legal expenses or setting up a 
              specific fund for this purpose.</p>
              <p>Earlier reports by the state media claimed that several members of 
              City Harvest Church (CHC) are privately raising funds to help pay for 
              the legal fees of Kong Hee as well as five other leaders who were 
              charged for misusing up to $50 million dollars of the church’s funds to 
              further the music career of his wife Ho Yeow Sun.</p>
              <p>The unofficial fundraising campaign was reportedly started by an 
              executive member named Dawn Lee who mobilized individuals who wanted to 
              offer Kong and others financial support during CHC’s AGM three weeks 
              ago.</p>
              <p>She then suggested that interested members meet her after the meeting before distributing her contact details.</p>
              <p>Executive pastor Aries Zulkarnain had earlier rejected four proposals
               from other members suggesting the use of church funds to bankroll the 
              six charged leaders’ legal fees.</p>
              <p>Despite the gravity of the criminal charges slapped on him, Kong Hee remains defiant and maintains his ‘integrity’.</p>
              <p>In his latest posting on Facebook, Kong Hee wrote:</p>
              <p><strong>“ä¿¡é� é †æœ�ï¼Œåˆ¥ç„¡ä»–é€”ï¼›é� è€¶ç©Œå–œæ¨‚ .”</strong></p>

              <p>ANOTHER accused involved in the City Harvest case has been allowed to travel out of Singapore.</p>
              <p>  Chew Eng Han, an investment manager and senior member of the church, was granted permission yesterday. His bail was doubled to $1 million. He said outside the court that life goes on and he has "every reason" to be upbeat," reported Channel NewsAsia.</p>
              <p>  Chew, one of the six church members accused of helping to transfer $24 million to finance fellow member Ho Yeow Sun's music career, said he plans to travel several times. Church founder and Ho's husband Kong Hee was given permission to travel in July. The case, arguably the charity sector's largest financial scandal, will be heard again on Oct 4.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>By BRYNA SIM <br>and JENNANI DURAI</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A THIRD man in the City Harvest Church saga has successfully applied to travel overseas.</p>
              <p>  Deputy pastor Tan Ye Peng  (above), who is among six senior members of the church charged with criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts, will go on a four-day mission trip to Indonesia this month.</p>
              <p>  The 39-year-old is the third defendant to have sought approval for overseas travel after Chiew Eng Han, the church's investment manager, and founding pastor Kong Hee.</p>
              <p>  Tan's bail amount has been doubled to $1 million, silmilar to what Chew and Kong had to put up.</p>
              <p>  Chew, 52, had said at the end of August that he was going overseas for personal reasons, while Kong, 47, whose application to travel was granted in July, is believed to have flown to the United States and Taiwan for church events.</p>
              <p>  Tan was the only one of the six accused to show up in court yesterday for the second pre-trial conference, where lawyers exchange information or evidence with the prosecution.</p>
              <p>  Looking relaxed, he told The Straits Times that he has been carrying on with church work and his family has been supportive. He is married with four children.</p>
              <p>  "I'm continuing my pastoral duties, and will be doing some teaching in our affiliated churches overseas," he said.</p>
              <p>  The case centres on the six senior church figures allegedly funnelling $24 million in church building funds to sham bond investments.</p>
              <p>  This was apparently to conceal the diversion of money to finance the career of Kong's wife, singer Ho Yeow Sun, 42.</p>
              <p>  The six also allegedly conspired to use another $26.6 million of church funds to repay the sums owned. The transactions reportedly occurred between August 2007 and November 2009.</p>
              <p>  Kong and former church management board member John Lam Leng Hung, 44, each face three charges of breach of trust.</p>
              <p>  Tan, church finance manager Sharon Tan, 36, former finance manager Serina Wee, 35, and Chew face between seven and 10 charges of criminal breach of trust and falsifying accounts.</p>
              <p>  All six, whose passwords were impounded, have indicated that they are likely to plead not guilty and will claim trial.</p>
              <p>  The next pre-trial conference, believed to be the last meeting before the case goes to trial, has been scheduled for Nov 22.</p>
