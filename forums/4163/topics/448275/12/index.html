              <p>According to CHC Sheep, Zeeleewong, all of 'Pastor' Sun song is about Christian worship, even China wine!!</p>
              <p>Funny part I can't understand is why a 'pastor' is also known as a 'geisha'?</p>
              <p>Maybe in Singapore she 'pastor', in US she is 'geisha' to to her black boyfriends?</p>
              <p>Anyway when you listen to china wine must pay attention ok! Listening to it is christian music for worship, so concentrate fully and meditate on it.</p>

              Please please please, anybody, try your best to convince me how songs &amp; music videos like China wine bring even anyone closer to Jesus can? 
                                                                                      
              Perhaps people do get closer to Jesus, because they call out to God for salvation after listening how awful her songs are?
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
              Oh ya Zeeleewong, your pastors teached you alright.. to be a mindless drone and worship capitalism.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
              Let me just quote a doctrine from CHC :
                                                                                      
              "God wants us all to be successful in all aspects of our lives ... I don't see [why] Christians should live a poor, pitiful, and suffered life ... it is not victory that is questionable, but failure ... success is good testimony. Of course people want to join successful people. Is it sensible to join a group of losers?"
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
              Do you know just how outrageously lavish those baffoons are dressed up in CHC for church service? Full suit and tie !! Excuse me, are you attending a weekend service or a ball ?!
                                                                                      
              So if i come dressed in shorts, T shirts and slippers, i cant worship God then? So CHC regards those who are not successful as losers lah? F**K you. Honto ni, F**K you.
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
              Lol. Horse Songs You Should Worship To. Seriously WTF right?
                                                                                      
              Crap, if the song lyrics got put one or 2 God words inside then it can be considered a hymn of worship one..
                                                                                      
              Goodness, then alot of other singers are also pastors liao !! We should start praying to Joan Osborne or Lady Gaga songs !!
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
                                                                                      
              Seriously, a geisha meaning hooker loh. 
                                                                                      
              How you ever heard of pasteurized milk ?

              <p>Pastor Sun is using the profits of her music to build churches and raise shelters around the world. Other stars do not do this. Besides she gave up her career at the peak to stand by her husband in difficult times.</p>

              <p>Dear zeeleewong,</p>
              <p>1. Just for your info, I am not a christain, so definitely not a bapist. The links I posted makes sense to as what I understand of the Bible's teachnings.  You must know that the Bible is meant for christians as well as non christian and some of the teachings are easily understandable by non believers, these links are some of those and its common sense.</p>
              <p>2. I noticed that you make no effort to refute to what the websites said, and I do believe somewhere in your heart you know that MTV is wrong.</p>
              <p>3. I am very shocked that you chose to mock fellow christians from other denominations. Sure enough that they might not sure your views but just like you, they believe in John 3:16. I hope it is only done as a jest but it still reflect badly.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal">Ever wonder why some people are actually exactly achieving
              the above. So how? </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The thoughts of Singaporeans, and citizens all over the
              world, are non-stop hit by an endless flow of messages from television, radio,
              newspapers, stomp...This advertising shapes our behaviour. It shows us the
              "right" way of life. Without being aware, we have become part what is
              called "mainstream".</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">We want an iPhone because? Who really stops to think about
              this? </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Mainstream means we follow the general flow. In other words,
              we have become predictable. Mainstream is easier to control than variety. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Following is a simple 5 step strategy elaborating how master
              manipulators manage to change a person’s way of thinking, and why it has become
              impossible for the people involved to change back to reality. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Case study:</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Imagine we want to change the mind of a young woman, and instil
              in her a "Jump-How high?"-behaviour. Let's call this young woman "Zee".</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 1: A new environment.</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">If we want to reorient Zee, the first step we need to do is
              move her away from her old environment. How to do? We are lucky that at the
              moment things are not going perfectly well for Zee. She is struggling in
              school, she is not sure if she can trust her boyfriend, her mother and father
              have lost interest in Zee. Lucky for her, her friend tells her about City
              Harvest Church, how wonderful it is, how it improved her life so much. Zee
              finds her friend overreacting a little bit, but hey, no harm in taking a look. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When Zee walked into the door, experiencing displeasure with
              her present life, she can be manipulated. The reorientation starts from day
              one. To learn the beliefs of City Harvest Church, Zee will be asked to come to
              CHC as often as possible. Zee will be asked to join a cell group. Zee will be
              asked to join events. Compared to her old life, City harvest Church is a
              welcome change, everybody is so friendly and happy. Indoctrination has started. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">To be honest, Zee sometimes has no clue what people talking
              about when they say "anointing" or "atonement" or
              "tithing". It is important for her, to get closer to her new friends,
              to learn this CHC language. This will be step number 2 in the reorientation of
              Zee.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 2: Learning the CHC language</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Slowly Zee is learning the CHC lingo. The more time Zee is
              spending with her new CHC friends the faster she is learning the language.  The faster Zee is learning the language, the
              quicker she is getting recognition and acceptance in the new group. She is even
              enlisting in the 8 months none-stop bible school. She really starts to like her
              new CHC friends more and more...They have so much in common. In the old world,
              things have not changed, they do not understand the CHC language, mom/dad is
              nagging, and the boyfriend is long gone. The "Good" old friends have
              already complained that Zee has no more time for them. They claim she has
              changed but she does not really care as doors in CHC are always open. CHC
              friends never complain. Time for step 3.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 3: Deprogramming old beliefs and values</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Deprogramming the old beliefs and values is the next logical
              step. It is very subtle but also very important for step 4 to succeed. Here's
              what happens in step 3. In CHC environment, physical force cannot be used to
              deprogram so a very subtle (hidden) threat of emotional forces will be applied.
              Zee, who has now learned the CHC language, is slowly being deprogrammed. Zee is
              gently shown how her old friends are mistaken. She is gently convinced how
              wrong her mother and father are behaving. Zee is gently shown how all of the
              old world are missing out. Zee is told that her old beliefs and values simply
              do not match the "Truth". Some point in time, Zee will be asked to
              share in public to point out to the group where she was previously misled. Zee
              will be asked to agree that her previous life was flawed. This can be done with
              great subtlety. The important point: Zee was wrong before, and now she has
              discovered the truth. The final part of the deprogramming is the perceived
              value of contacts outside CHC. Zee is not asked to give up her old contacts but
              will be cautioned to be careful not to endanger the truth.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 4: Reprogramming</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Reprogramming the individuals with new beliefs and values to
              replace the erased old ones. We all have some very basic needs. We all need
              food, clothing, and shelter. We need to feel secure. We each need to have a
              "mother figure" in our life whom we bond to, who takes care of our
              needs, regardless of whether we like or not. Once the void in step 3 is
              created, this void will be filled with the new group's leader. Zee really
              admires Pastor Sun and Pastor Kong. They are her new father and mother.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Old beliefs are replaced with new beliefs. Old authority
              figures are now replaced with new authority figures. Truth replaces fiction.
              CHC is rewarding Zee's excellent behaviour to condition her towards obedience.
              At this point, to ever leave CHC and return to the old ways would mean the
              greatest punishment for Zee. CHC has taught Zee well that once the truth is
              found, it is unforgivable to turn ones back on it. There is absolutely no need
              for CHC to be negative. The values and beliefs become rearranged. And once in
              place, it becomes very difficult to change them. Reorientation is now complete.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Step 5: Disciples become teachers</strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">When Zee is fully reoriented, she is ready to spread the
              good news. When communication with people on the outside, like those people on
              SGForum, Zee is surprised that not everybody see the CHC Truth as clearly as
              she does. The best way to learn something is to teach. Zee becomes a cell group
              leader. It is well known (law of consistency) that once you teach something to
              someone, it is very hard, almost impossible, to admit that you were incorrect
              in any respect. Zee must believe. Once in step 5, turning back is impossible. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The cycle is now complete. The process is reinforced daily
              by Zee herself. Every day that passes, Zee will perceive CHC as more clear and
              more real. Zee is spending a maximum amount of time with CHC so Zee gets very
              little resistance from outsiders. Zee no longer needs outsiders.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

              <p>I don't like megachurches - too many rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>I once join a megachurch (Petaling Jaya) in my country. I was very interested in joining the music ministry because i can learn how to use the synthesizers, lighting eq and video cameras. So I join it and was under probation for 2 months. But the church workers were nasty. They told me that i was new and they don't trust me because they think i would learn how to use the music equipment and profit from them when i go outside and sell my knowledge. I was so insulted by that comment. Then they made me undergo some exams which i have to ask some senior volunteers there how to use the equipment and answer the exam questions. The seniors were selfish - they refused to teach me and whenever i tried to make friends with some guys there, i was reprimanded by the uncle there in charge of the music eq ministry. Then they made me stand there n do nothing during service and rehearsal - 8 hours a week. When i came late - by mere 10 minutes - they punished me by extending my probation. I told them it was after work and i was caught in traffic. But i receive no mercy.</p>

              <p>I was so angry that when I pass my offering/tithe - i wrote on offering letter that not a cent of my $$$ goes to that stupid ministry but other ministry ok.</p>
              <p>Some more I hated the worship sessions because the church spent so much $$$ on expensive speakers - lighting - equipment worth more than $300k and it made the whole worship session so noisy. My ears almost burst because so loud. I am the typewho like soft music. The musicians were ok but the music eq ministry screw up with the sound and made it too loud and hurt our ears.</p>
              <p>That day i went to another church more conservative baptist. Music was lighter and can hear the lyrics - so can worrship better.</p>

              <p>I don't like megachurches - too many rules and regulations.</p>
              <p>I once join a megachurch (Petaling Jaya) in my country. I was
              very interested in joining the music ministry because i can learn
              how to use the synthesizers, lighting eq and video cameras. So I
              join it and was under probation for 2 months. But the church
              workers were nasty. They told me that i was new and they don't
              trust me because they think i would learn how to use the music
              equipment and profit from them when i go outside and sell my
              knowledge. I was so insulted by that comment. Then they made me
              undergo some exams which i have to ask some senior volunteers there
              how to use the equipment and answer the exam questions. The seniors
              were selfish - they refused to teach me and whenever i tried to
              make friends with some guys there, i was reprimanded by the uncle
              there in charge of the music eq ministry. Then they made me stand
              there n do nothing during service and rehearsal - 8 hours a week.
              When i came late - by mere 10 minutes - they punished me by
              extending my probation. I told them it was after work and i was
              caught in traffic. But i receive no mercy.</p>
              <p>At end of the probation - they extended my probation by another
              month. whereas another guy who had contacts with the people in the
              music eq ministry (bcause he came from the same cell group as them)
              - he receive a lot of help and support. He pass within a month.
              Politics n favortism !</p>
              <p>I was so angry that when I pass my offering/tithe - i wrote on
              offering letter that not a cent of my $$$ goes to that stupid
              ministry but other ministry ok.</p>
              <p>Some more I hated the worship sessions because the church spent
              so much $$$ on expensive speakers - lighting - equipment worth
              more than $300k and it made the whole worship session so noisy. My
              ears almost burst because so loud. I am the typewho like soft
              music. The musicians were ok but the music eq ministry screw
              up with the sound and made it too loud and hurt our ears.</p>

              Music was lighter and can hear the lyrics - so can worrship

              </p><p>News update from my CHC (x)-friend.</p>
              <p>The law finally caught up with him. Banks filled for bancruptcy. The wife called me to say that my friend has been declared bancrupt.</p>
              <p>She is scared but in a way she said it's a relief. The court assigned a OA (Official Assignee) to mediate between my friend and his creditors, but also to monitor his expenses.</p>
              <p>He must deliver to the OA a monthly Income and Expenditure Statement. Failing to do so will get him in prison. OA will check expenses in detail. If my friend takes a taxi, he must have a very good reason (rushing to the hospital) otherwise he gets into trouble. </p>
              <p>This brings me to the relief parts: </p>
              <p>My friend has no longer any justification to tithe and offer to City Harvest Church. Paying to CHC instead of paying his creditors can get him into even more trouble. OA literally told my friend: "This is not first time I handle case of CHC member - you will want to try and continue to pay - I officially warn you to stop until your debts have been cleared or bancruptcy discharged - and even than I urge you to use your brains".</p>
              <p>I wonder how CHC will react since tithing is mandatory for every CHC member. Will CHC kick him out? Let's not get our hopes up.</p>
              <p>OA already told my friend he can no longer work for CHC as an errand boy. He is advised to find a job in accordance to his degree i.e. engineering. (If he can still find a job being bancrupt). His so-called degree from the City Harvest School of Technology is bogus and of no value in real life.</p>
              <p>His wife is convinced, and so am I, that without his involvement in CHC it would never have come to the bancrupty. For my friend: he is still in denial. CHC is the best and Pastor Kong is the greatest. Poor soul. Hopefully reality catches up soon enough.</p>
