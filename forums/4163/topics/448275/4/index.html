              <p>Mayb you might want to explore the CHC crowd? probably there are other kinds of followers there. By other kinds i mean followers who have examined whatever that is being taught there and comes to a rational conclusion that it is totally nowhere near a cult and that it can be accepted?</p>

              <p>I think as fellow believers we need also to watch over one another in some sense. If we have knowledge or good reasons to warn about something, then we can do so in good conscience, even if it has to be confrontational. Our intentions should be self-examined and proceed out of a sincere desire to help and encourage.</p>

              <p>I think this can only be answered by those who are long time CHC members who can tell us what the thrust of the messages have consistently been, or those who have sat through a good number of sermons by the pastor.</p>
              <p>Prosperity gospel is defined as the teaching that believers have a right to the blessings of health and wealth and that they can obtain these blessings through positive confessions of faith and the "sowing of seeds" through the faithful payments of tithes and offerings. See <a href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=86009">http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/article_print.html?id=86009</a></p>
              <p>Thus the logic is that if believers have a right to health and wealth, then not having it must then means that God is withholding His blessings that is rightfully due to the believers because of sin or lack of faith or both.</p>

              <p>One of the key emphasis of H&amp;W churches is, I believe, the faithful giving of tithes at the least and generous giving of free-willed donations. It is understandable that a resource hungry mega-church must have a constant (and increasing?) flow of funds to sustain the machinery. Of course, smaller churches can also emphasize on tithing but I suppose this is very much more critical to big churches. So the next question to ask is a doctrinal or teaching question: Is tithing Biblical? The answer is not surprising. It is! But perhaps the correct question to ask is "Is tithing Christian?" The answer may be surprising to many. It's not!</p>

              <p>we do not care whether you call us christians anot, we are city harvest church. WOW!! seriously i tot churches are meant for ppl of the christian faith as place of worship and now we've got ppl who have the church as its family and life but not the christian faith. BIC does it coincide with any of the faith/teaching thats supposed to be related to a church? I hope im right to tink that it is unrelated.</p>

              </p><p>Focussing on the first friendly churches on Zeeleewong's list (Thank you dear - keep up the good work)</p>
              <p>David Yonggi Cho is an old friend and business associate of Kong Hee. There relationship goes way back. David is the very same who gave Kong Hee his MBA title. Besides religious ideas, Kong Hee copy/paste Yonggi Cho's organizational structure and implemented in City Harvest Church Singapore.</p>
              <p>For those of you interested in a factual description, I recommend to read the book "McDonaldization of religion - Case Study: City Harvest Church Singapore" by sociology researcher Joy Tong (Purdue University and National University of Singapore).</p>
              <p>By inviting David Cho into his house, Kong Hee is exposing his CHC flock to the teachings of David Cho. </p>
              <p>As such, we are not wrong to say that Kong Hee and City Harvest Church endorse the teachings of David Cho. Lucky for us. with alledged 500,000 members, the David Cho's Yoido Full Gospel Church largely exceeds the 23,000 in CHC resulting in a lot more literature on David Cho than Kong Hee. (Flash - It just occurred to me that very little is written about Kong Hee if you discount his own publications about himself)</p>
              <p><strong>So what is David Cho, with approval from Kong Hee teaching my friend, your friends, your relatives in CHC?   And how Christian are the teachings?</strong></p>
              <p>The Yiodo Full Gospel Church is the Korean version of a US Pentacostal church with one unique belief: </p>
              <p>The Belief in the fourth dimension</p>
              <p>Quoting David Cho: "Then God spoke to my heart, 'Son, as the second dimension includes and controls the first dimension, and the third dimension includes and controls the second dimension, so the fourth dimension includes and controls the third dimension, producing a creation of order and beauty. The spirit is the fourth dimension. Every human being is a spiritual being as well as a physical being. They have the fourth dimension as well as the third dimension in their hearts.' So men, by exploring their spiritual sphere of the fourth dimension through the development of concentrated visions and dreams in their imaginations, can brood over and incubate the third dimension, influencing and changing it. This is what the Holy Spirit taught me." — Cho, The Fourth Dimension 1979: p 40</p>
              <p><strong>Is this Christian? How do the CHC members respond to these teachings? Acceptance? Rejection? Indifference? </strong></p>
              <p>I asked my friend, and his reply was: It all makes sense to me, you would not understand. David Cho is a great man. God speaks to him.</p>
              <p>I am baffled??? I wonder how the relatives and other friends react?</p>
              <p>There are too many controversies to print - here are the last 3:</p>
              <p>March 2011: Cho again became a subject of controversy when he reportedly made comments suggesting that the 2011 tsunami "could be a warning from God to Japan, which has become an increasingly materiallistic, secular and idol-worshiping country."</p>
              <p>April, 2011: Cho was accused of nepotism by assigning his relatives to key church positions after his retirement.</p>
              <p>September 2011: Korean federal prosecutors began an investigation on Cho, over the embezzlement of 23 billion won ($20 million USD) from the Yoido Full Gospel Church's funds, after 29 church elders filed complaints. A national broadcaster, MBC, released a documentary that claimed the money had been used to buy properties in the United States. At least Kong Hee beat his master on the timing of the investigation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yonggi will visit CHC in April. I will be there.</p>

              <p>James, you are welcome.</p>
              <p>I am considering the possibility that our society is not at an advanced enough level to discern differences between leaders and philosophies.</p>
              <p>The majority in society have barely the intellect to contemplate political policies that have direct impact on their lives. Some can't even tell that casinos are not a means to increase their wealth. What more notions of other-worldly realms and promises of eternal paradise? Don't  get started on the various possible interpretations of any book that continues to interest the most learned scholars.</p>

              </p><p>@ Alize</p>
              <p>Finally had the time to review your response from March 9. </p>
              <p>I did understand "deeper level" wrongly, thanks for clearing up. </p>
              <p>You wrote:" I think much also depends on the individual's predisposition to such teachings" I deduct from this that "unquestioned belief" is something that can he "teached".</p>
              <p>How would you "teach" someone "unquestioned" belief? </p>
              <p>Following your expose on "Emotion trumps logic quite easily", I can see how advertiser's use emotions to create a need. I ended up buying an iPhone against my logic. The mere fact that "everybody has an iPhone" played an important part. Looking back, it's quite amazing how I framed myself into buying this gadget. I am still making excuses to justify the buy. </p>
              <p>However, this is just a phone. You can call it foolish but it is not irresponsible behaviour. To make me do something irresponsible, like stacking up debts or neglecting wife/children, it requires more than a sexy lady in a brochure. I doubt if advertisements could bring me to the point of acting irresponsible. It would take a non-stop indoctrination of my inner thoughts.</p>
              <p>The more I read on this stuff, I am getting convinced that the only thing that is capable of changing my "Self", and spends enough time around me to have a lasting effect, is myself or my own mind/thoughts.</p>
              <p>(I realize this sounds weird - hope I am making sense). </p>
              <p>This leads me to believe that something just kicks off the thought-process. Once the thought-process is running, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to stop the thought-train. </p>
              <p>I watch this experiment showing how easy your brain conspires against us.  Once we make a decision, we defend our decision vigourously without any insights or details about the criteria. In the experiment people motivate decisions which they did not make. It shows that once we made up our minds, there is too much invested to backpaddle. Humans prefer to post-rationalize and prefer it was a great choice all along. </p>
              <p>If people cannot win an argument against themselves, what changes do we have to make them see reason?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life-changing thoughts do not appear in someone's head "out of nowhere". </p>
              <p>People are responsible for their own choices, I agree. </p>
              <p>Yet history shows that smart and intelligent people have done not so smart things. </p>
              <p>What triggered them into acting against their reason? </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>or differently posed:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you wanted to seed a thought in the head of a group of people, how would you do it?</p>

              <p>Did not see your reply...</p>
              <p>Those are some harsh statements you make. Truth often hurts.</p>
              <p>I do tend to believe that deep down, people that go to casinos, know they will not increase their health, but something more powerful is overriding the logic. I do not understand enough about the topic to see if body chemistry, endorphines, etc... or other factors play a role as well.</p>
