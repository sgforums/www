              Zeeleewong is one of those sheep manipulated and brainwashed by Con Hee to think everything Con says is the gospel truth. I think even if Con asks him to feed on his own waste material, he wouldnt even think twice about it. How pathetic.
                                                  
                                                  
              Yeah man, how dubious is that to list his occupation as just a Businessman. What sort of a businessman is he? Most CHC members dont even know this.
                                                  
                                                  
              Upon attending CHC's service before, Con Hee comes to me as a real arrogant braggard &amp; hypocrite. He has a persistent habit to repeat, repeat and repeat his typical mother goose stories about how he built up CHC with his own determination, blah blah blah, claiming to make the most of sacrifices, taking all the credit for himself. 
                                                  
                                                  
              If you are truly honouring the Lord, then you do not need to seek gratitude or recognition from your followers. God will reward you accordingly. Real vain.
                                                  
                                                  
              He also makes it a point to constantly talk about his so called cinderella love story with Sunny Horse. He romanticizes the whole thing and makes it sound like as though he and Sunny Horse are the modern living Romeo and Juliet, and what other people has done for them, such as make a nice biography out of their love story together. You know, he just wanna make themselves the envy of everyone in CHC and bask in all the glory of it. How conceited of a person he is.
                                                  
                                                  
              But who cares about your relationship with a horse ?! Seriously what does a horse-porridge relationship got to do with God and his religion at all ?
                                                  
                                                  
              Oh, talking about horses, one of the most disgusting things about CHC has to be Sunny Horse, the so called Pastor Sun, this is what everybody calls her at CHC.
                                                  
                                                  
              It is obvious the sole reason why she is a singer now is because of the influence of the mindless sheep and the pulling of strings by some you know who. Honestly how would you expect someone like her to get famous on her own? Who will be interested in a haggy middle aged horse when there are so much more hot babes and chicks out there to choose from?
                                                  
                                                  
              I remember the CHC service called her a singing pastor abd proclaimed that she is attempting the spread the gospel of god throughout the world through singing. Wow, how magnanimous. Cept for the fact that none of her album songs carry God's word in it. Frankly is she singing for the Church or is she singing for herself ? 
                                                  
                                                  
              However later on what scandals broke out about her dressing and song codes all that, she denied ever being a pastor. You know its not day one she was called Pastor Sun in CHC, this term has followed her long before CHC even moved to Jurong West, long before she ever became a singer ! 
                                                  
                                                  
              Yet the most sickening displays has to do with the peddling of her CDs in the church itself. Good lord the CHC services are like her CD selling campaigns. Yeah yeah, they can deny everything, but their cell group leaders actually make it a point that each member purchase at least 3 copies of Sunny Horse's albums. 
                                                  
                                                  
              Hello, just what does buying her albums have anything to do with worshipping christianity? Also, they always like to give announcements about Sunny Horse topping this billboard chart and that singers chart blah blah blah, again.. what in the world has that got to do with the religion? 
                                                  
                                                  
              By the way, where is she staying now? Its some prestige area where some big Hollywood stars also have residences in. 
                                                  
              I wonder, you know, I question somebody's agenda to claim to have a real interest in doing charity and spreading God's word have to always associate herself with big names and glamour. 
                                                  
              Shes a wannabe and a sham. Thats who she is, thats all she is.
