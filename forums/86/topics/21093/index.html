Others may admire you, wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.<br><br>51 TO 60 POINTS:<br>Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile, rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to make decisions, though not always the right ones. They see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They enjoy  being in your company because of the excitement you  radiate.<br><br>41 TO 50 POINTS:<br>Others see you as fresh, lively, charming, amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always cheer them up and help them out.<br><br>31 TO 40 POINTS:<br>Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &amp; Practical.They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but modest...  Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it if that trust is ever broken.<br><br>21 TO 30 POINTS:<br>Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and steady plodder It'd really surprise them if you ever did something impulsively  or on the spur of the moment, expecting you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then, usually decide against it. They think this reaction is caused partly by your careful nature.<br><br>UNDER 21 POINTS:<br>People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive, someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone else to make the decisions &amp; who doesn't want to get involved with anyone or anything. They see you as a worrier who always sees problems that don't exist. Some people think you're boring. Only those who know you well know that you aren't.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Find out about our Secret Self from an All About you Magazine<br><br>1. You're walking down a path. What do you see all around you?<br><br>A. A deep, dark forest. The trees are so thick that only a bit of sky shows through. B. A cornfield. It stretches as far as you can see, under a bright-blue sky.<br>C. Green rolling hills, dotted with trees.  Beyond them you can almost see mountains.<br><br>2. You spot an object by your feet. What is it?<br>A. A mirror<br>B. A ring<br>C. A bottle.<br><br>3. Do you pick it up?<br>A. Yes.<br>B. No.<br><br>4. Continuing along the path, you come across some water. What form is the water in?<br>A. A cool, clear, serene lake.<br>B. A crashing waterfall.<br>C. A babbling brook.<br><br>5. You see a key in the water and reach down to pick it up. What does it look like?<br>A. A simple house key.<br>B. A fancy antique key.<br>C. A small padlock key.<br><br>6. As you walk farther along the path, you come to a house. What kind of house is it? A. A Hollywood-style mansion.<br>B. A cottage with a well-tended lawn.<br>C. A beautiful castle in ruins.<br><br>7. What do you do?<br>A. Look in the window.<br>B. Go inside.<br>C. Walk on.<br><br>8. Suddenly, something jumps out and scares you. What is it?<br>A. A bear<br>B. A wizard.<br>C. A troll.<br><br>9. You run down the path until you reach a wall with a door in it. You peek through the keyhole. What's on the other side?<br>A. The lush gardens of an awesome house.<br>B. A pond in the middle of the desert.<br>C. A sandy beach with crashing waves.<br><br>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>Question 1 - shows your attitude toward life<br><br>A. If you chose the forest, you're deep, quiet and calm. People find you incredibly interesting  because you don't show your  true self right away. Pals love you because you're a good listener.<br><br>B. If you chose the cornfield, you're bright, honest and likable. You make friends easily and rarely get bummed. You've got a rep for being entertaining and fun, and you're always the center of attention.<br><br>C. If you chose the rolling hills, you're practical and down-to-earth, and you attract people with your straightforward nature. A great problem solver, you always listen to both points of view before taking a side.<br><br>Question 2 - reveals what kind of boyfriend/girlfriend you're looking for<br><br>A. If you chose the mirror, you're searching for a guy/gal who shares your outlook on life. You've got a pretty good idea of what your ideal boyfriend/girlfriend is like, but you keep an open mind - the perfect guy may be someone you normally wouldn't look at twice!<br><br>B. If you chose the ring, you are a true romantic.  When you're in a relationship, you work hard at keeping things mushy. You believe true love is forever, and although you might not admit it, you want your guy/gal care about you.<br><br>C. If you chose the bottle, you want someone who's not afraid to show his intelligence. Ambitious, hard-working guys/gals turn you on - drop-dead gorgeous just isn't enough for you.<br><br>Question 3 - tells how commitment-ready you are<br><br>A. If you said yes, you're dying to pick the right person.<br><br>B. If you said no, you're into playing the field for now.<br><br>Question 4 - symbolizes your passion potential<br><br>A. If you chose the lake, you're not interested in having a superficial relationship. Once you meet someone you're really into, your love runs deep.<br><br>B. If you chose the waterfall, opposite sex think you're ultrasexy. You're good at turning on the charm, and loads of guys/gals lust after you.<br><br>C. If you chose the brook, you're always crushing on someone new.  You're an expert flirt, and you're frequently on the move from one guy to the next.<br><br>Question 5 - expresses your views on school<br><br>A. If you saw the housekey, education is less important to you than the world beyond. Secretly, you may be dying to start a career and a home of your own.<br><br>B. If you saw the antique key, you consider education to be crucial.  You want to work hard and want to absorb as much knowledge as you possibly can.<br><br>C. If you saw the padlock key, you may not be too into school, but you still have plenty of great ideas. You follow your intuition, so you may eventually end up in an offbeat career.<br><br>Question 6 - gives clues about your ambitions<br><br>A. If you chose the mansion, you've got tons of goals. You strive to be the best at whatever you do, and you're attracted to jobs that let you express your energetic personality. Being successful makes you superpsyched.<br><br>B. If you chose the cottage, you have a realistic attitude toward a future profession. Because your feet are planted firmly on the ground, you'll probably rock at whatever career you pick.<br><br>C. If you chose the castle, your career dreams could be a little unrealistic. Becoming a mega-star would be fab, but aim for something closer to home first. Otherwise, you may wind up being a little disappointed.<br><br>Question 7 - shows your attitude towards success<br><br>A. If you looked through the window, you're a little afraid of failing. Taking that first step toward reaching a goal is the most intimidating to you, so don't give up before you've actually tried.<br><br>B. If you went inside, you feel confident about success. Nothing is going to stand in your way!<br><br>C. If you kept walking, success isn't a big deal for you. You're content with simple things, and you'd rather be around people you love than spend your life trying to get to the top.<br><br>Question 8 - reveals your worst fears<br><br>A. If you chose the bear, you worry about being able to stand on your own two feet. Independence is totally key.<br><br>B. If you chose the wizard, you're scared about things that are often beyond your control. So, to make up for it, you sometimes go on a heavy-duty power amperage.<br><br>C. If you chose the troll, you tend to obsess over how others see you. It's crucial that people like you - you're desperate to fit into the in crowd. You need to learn to trust your own judgment.<br><br>Question 9 - represents your innermost self<br><br>A. If you chose the gardens, you're mature and honest.  You believe in speaking your mind, and people rely on you to provide a sensible viewpoint. However, you may come across problems in the future that you'll have to solve with your heart, not your head.<br><br>B. If you chose the desert pond, you have a deep need for your own space. You're always analyzing your thoughts, and you've been known to do a disappearing act when things get tough. Sharing your feelings with someone you trust can help you feel better.<br><br>C. If you chose the beach, you are passionate about life and have strong opinions that you aren't afraid to reveal. But you're unpredictable, and you change those opinions often. Sometimes, like the ocean, you'll show your calmer side - but usually not for long!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>On the sixth day of Christmas<br>my true love gave to me<br>6 Geese a Laying<br>...<br>and a Partridge in a Pear Tree</div>
