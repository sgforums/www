The more rascettes you have, the more years of quality life you will have. This does NOT indicate how many years you will live; just how many of those years will be filled with joy, fortune, and extreme happiness. Your number of rascettes tell me that:<br><br><strong>You better live life to the fullest because you only have a total 15 - 35 years of quality life left in you. Before you have a panic attack, realize that this is an online palm reading; The Great Goosini has been wrong before. Once.</strong><br>(means i die early?????)<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your index finger across your palm is your Head Line. Your head line determines your strength of character and your mental power. Your head line tells me that:<br><br><strong>You often lack self-confidence. You are also very task oriented and like to feel safe and secure. Your strong desire for order and structure indicate that you have particularly strong mental capabilities when dealing with math or sciences. You are a good Samaritan and often make charitable donations. The Great Goosini implores you, help the United Goose College Fund. A Goose is a terrible thing to waste.</strong><br>(this one opposite to tt handwriting one leh...so which one true????)<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your pinky across your palm is your Heart Line. Your heart line has everything to do with love and relationships. It also tells you about your romantic life. Your heart line indicates that:<br><br><strong>You are a particularly caring person. The Great Goosini is in awe of the hard work and effort you put in for the good of mankind. Because of your kind heart, you shall be rewarded with tremendous luck later in life.</strong><br>(caring? i tot im the bochup, self-centred type more?)<br><br>The line that curves from above your thumb down to your wrist is called your Life Line (no relation to Regis). Your life line is the measure of your life force, the strength of your family ties, and the general happiness you will find in life. Your life line shows me that:<br><br><strong>Unlike The Great Goosini, you do not wish to travel the world; you are content to be where are you are. In order to reach the highest levels of happiness, you should constantly push yourself to achieve and experiment with life. If you change your career path to something completely unexpected, you will be pleasantly rewarded. Perhaps a career as a prognosticating swami goose?... </strong><br>(not dun want to travel..is no $$$...and lazy oso lah..heheheh...change career path? so it means tt i need to give up looking for rich old man????)<br><br>------------------<br>~~EviL AngeL~~<br>[/i:vel eindzel/]<br><br>more affectionately known as...<br><strong>tHe eXtrA-oRdiNaRy eCCenTriC PaRanOid BiTch wiF thE PaiZaBor aTTiTudE</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(that happens to love prata...and Quickly PearlTofu)</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The lines on your wrist are called Rascettes, also known as "The Bracelets of Life." The more rascettes you have, the more years of quality life you will have. This does NOT indicate how many years you will live; just how many of those years will be filled with joy, fortune, and extreme happiness. Your number of rascettes tell me that:<br><br>The Great Goosini is bewildered by the fact that you will live to be particularly old... at least until the age of 85! And those years will all be wonderful! Steady your smiling face, human. The Great Goosini will not let your longevity get in the way of giving you a beat down.<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your index finger across your palm is your Head Line. Your head line determines your strength of character and your mental power. Your head line tells me that:<br><br>You are highly sensitive to the world around you, and you are extremely empathatic. (Hey, it's better than being plain pathetic!) As a result, your intellect suggests that you would make a good teacher, therapist, or any other occupation which involves high levels of interaction with others. You sometimes doubt yourself, though, and because of this, are very close to your family. You might be a bit eccentric, too. That doesn't surprise us... anybody who gets their palm read by a goose is a little loopy.<br><br>The line that runs from underneath your pinky across your palm is your Heart Line.
