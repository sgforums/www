People like you can only discourage this type of relationships just because you did not try and you just presume that it wont work.<br>I believe you got those little girls around you as your sisters and dont tell me you dont have any sexual fantasies on them.<br>This only you yourself knows.<br><br>and do you treat them as your 'sisters' only?? This only you know too.<br><br>so, I would gladly thank you for keeping the comments to yourself as I strongly think that you are not in a position to comment on this relationship.<br><br>Thank you very much and have a nice day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>vivian82</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Inzhagi,<br>She's jus trying to be nice, but for me, ppl who knows me knows dat i'm the kind of person who speaks out what my mind think. I'm sorry if i have embarass u, but i'm not sorry for saying all this.<br><br>io<br>As i have said, i'm not sorry for saying all those things, i'm jus sorry to pai seh him. n i jus dun wan to sour the friendship by saying such things, but I hate to see him saying such discouraging things. And i'm not stabbing him at his back okay, i directed the note to HIM, n only HIM. Ashley n FnU already so troubled, if he has got nothing gd to say, might as well keep quiet. No point trying to add salt n give others the impression of trying to break ppl up. Jus my humble opinion.<br><br>Anyway, I myself have also seen a lot of cases whr the age gap is very big n are living a happy life. He shdn't have been so judgementaln try so hard to dishearten ppl, nothing is impossible if u have the faith.<br><br>And, FnU, if you are reading this, n if you care abt Ashley, U better wake up, or you'll really lose her!! Go for what you have, and what you want, as i have always told u. Dun wait until u lost her then u cry...by then, its too late. Female can be VERY stubborn when mind is make up.<br><br>------------------<br>Why do i sometimes get the feeling that i am being ignored?

            <div class='col-md body'>I posted this topic as i treat everyone in fatty forum as my friend. I believe that me and FnU are both friends of all of you, thus i should inform you all about it, so that you wouldn't treat us like a couple anymore.<br><br>As for the comment by inzaghi, i'm sorry but to say, i really don't feel like seeing those disheartening words. UbA was right when she said i was just being nice. As you are a regular of fatty, i don't want to openly critcise you, but i hope that you don't take what UbA said personally. However i do agree with her that the last thing i wish to see are what you've commented. No offence.<br><br>UbA, thanx for speaking up for me.You've said what i didn't dare to say. I do admire you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. I have to thank you too, thanx for your encouraging words, i would say, it helps. Now i have enough courage to face him and all the forumites. I believe if two persons are in love, nothing can't be solved. I will make those who bu kan how me and FnU know that, i am not going to give up so easily, i will try to make things right and hopefully all of you can be invited to our wedding dinner  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But provided he thinks the same way as me.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take. If you<br>think  something will make you happy, go for it. Remember that we pass this way only  once.<br>Bottomline :<br>Time don't wait. If you think you might have found the  right one, treasure him/her. Don't let he/she go away. Don't let fear hold you  back.<br>Give it a try else you might regret later... No one other than  yourself<br>knows what can truly make you  happy.</div>
