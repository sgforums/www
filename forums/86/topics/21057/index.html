            <div class='col-md body'>When a person is in NS,he will be facing a lot of physical and mental stress while agirl going on to Uni or working life will be adapting to a totally new environment and meeting new people altogether.Somemore the guy only gets to come out on weekends which are spents mostly sleeping to make up for lost sleep or out clubbing to make the most of the weekends.There is also a loss of communication compared to last time when the couple could talk every night till the cow comes home as in NS,the phone is not so easy to reach for.But not all relationships end up in the dump when the guy goes NS.One of my good friend knew his gf in poly and are still going strong even though he is a navy regular and she is studying in Uni,ehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Makan begins with a drool, grows with a chomp, ends with a burp.When you were born, you were hungry and everyone around you was full.
