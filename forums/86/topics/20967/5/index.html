As humans, we all have all sorts of emotions and feelings.  No one, not even the cheeriest of all men, can smile at all times.  Often, we only show the happy and sunny side of ourselves to our friends, but little do we know that we should share our sorrow and sadness too.  Friends may not be able to erase all the pain and hurt, but they are likely, very likely, to be able to make it fade just a little.</div>

From your msg, i gather that you are having some probs right now and probably got quite hurt and disappointed.  Maybe now you feel that after what you've been through, you are simply too exhausted to tackle new problems that life throws you.<br><br>C'mon dear girl, I'm sure you have more spunk than that.  When problems arrive, face them squarely and look for solutions.  With your dear and all your friends &amp; family, you have nothing to fear.  You are never alone when tackling your problems, just remember that. When you are saying that you will want a shorter life span just coz you don't wanna handle more problems, its like a child who refuses to learn to walk after falling her first steps.  If she stops just there, how can she know the wonders of strolling, running, skipping or just walking?<br><br>My dear Belle, I've seen kids, even toddlers, stricken with terminal illnesses and yet courageously battling it out for their lives.  How can you, a wonderful girl with loves, friends, and family, just give up on life?<br><br>Stay strong girl.   Just remember, you'll never be alone.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Sometimes i find that there is really a limit to what i can do, you have tried doesn't mean you will succeed.<br><br>I'm certainly quite similar with you belle, i'm a weak person too. I can't face stress and all the challenges, i'm emotionally weak. Everytime when there is a problem, i try to run away from it. I know i'm a coward, but i can't seem to let myself grow stronger.<br><br>But belle, i wouldn't ask for a shorter life span, because i still have my love ones, those love and supported me throughout all the rough times, i can't bear to leave them, esp that someone that i want to be with forever.<br><br>I may be weak, but somehow deep in my heart i know that whatever happens, he is always behind me.<br><br>I'm sure you are surrounded with love too, although love itself can give you lots of disappoinments, but thats part and parcel of a relationship.<br><br>Belle, i sincerely hope that you will be happier and stronger, whatever happens we will always be here for you.<br><br>------------------<br>The  greatest regrets in our lives are the risks we did not take.
