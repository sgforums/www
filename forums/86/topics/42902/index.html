            <div class='col-md body'>My turn to share some story with my ex.<br><br>On the fateful day of year 2000 chirstmas eve, i met a gal who most probably the one who i wouldn't be able to forget. I met my friend together with his gf at Orchid Country Club to play pool. My friend introduce me to his gf and the gal. The first impression given to me about the gal is very normal looking with bad attitude, poor upbringing, speak lot of vulgarities. I was wondering which unlucky guy would be her bf. After the game, the gal offer to drive me home as it is already late night. To my surprise a gal with such bad attitude would offer to drive me home and to me it is rather uncommon for gal to drive guy home. On my way back, she ask for my contact number, i gave her without hesitation.<br><br>The following day, i sent her a sms to thanks her for driving me home. At the same time, she asked me out for movie, i agreed. Since than we met up everyday until last day of 2000, year 2001 new year eve, we were walking among the crowd at Orchard Road, i grab her hand while walking pass the crowded underpass. Till now i was still wondering what made me grab her hand. I let go her hand immediately after getting out of the crowded underpass, at the same time, she grab back my hand. From than on, we were officially dating. I couldn't believe i would like this type of gal with bad attitude.<br><br>After few weeks together, i started to find that apart from her bad attitude and speak lot of vulgarities. She was very caring and kind hearted to people, I began to like her. I cut down on playing mahjong which i knew she hated. I learnt how to play billiard cos i knew she likes, learnt things about car as she has interest in car, pay attention and learn things on whatever she interested in. At the same time, i advised her to change a bit on her bad and rude attitude. She cut down a lot of smoking and clubbing as she knew i don't really like. I was already taking part time course before knowing her, she was very supportive and always accompany me to library and find reference for my projects.<br><br>There were up and down in the relationship, both of us had quarrels due to our strong character. We had a heated agruement over my friend who introduce her to me. My friend was having problem with his gf that time and my view with her was totally different. Things didn't improve, instead it got from bad to worst everytime we talked over the issue. Soon i couldn't take it anymore and initiated to break, till now i still can't believe i would initiate a break over the issue. The relationship lasted for slightly more than 1 year.<br><br>I thought i could get over it easily, to my surprise i couldn't. That time i knew she hated me, i couldn't bring myself to ask for reconcile. Time past very slowly, my exam result for that semester was the worst throughout my whole course. Since than i knew i can't forget her easily, i quitted my job and took up a new job which was constantly under stress and long working hours. I put all my concentration on the job and my studies. It took me nearly 1 year to forget the relationship. I quitted the long working hour job after 8 months and started my current job.<br><br>3 weeks ago, i met her again at my work place. I didn't see her as i was busy working, she walked to me and say hello. I was shocked to hear the familiar voice and see the familiar face. We went to one of the fast food restaurant and had some drinks. She took out her hp and asked whether i still using the same home and hp number, i couldn't believe she still keeping my number after broke off more than a year. I had deleted her number long ago as i don't want to think of her whenever i see it. She told me she had changed a few bf and is not attached at the moment. Ever since her reappearance, all those places we went and things we done started appearing on my mind.<br><br>Since than we came out for dinner and movie twice. I was very worried we would fall in love again and restart the relationship. I tried to avoid meeting up with her. She knew i was avoiding her, few days later, she called me saying she was downstairs of my house, it was a shocking phonecall to me. I went to nearby 7-eleven to have some drinks before sending her home. We started chatting about the past and i knew she had the intention to reconcile. We met up almost every evening for dinner or just meet up for coffee.<br><br>She told me she likes SHE lian ren wei man and re dai yu lin, i couldn't believe i actually went to help her find and even asked friend to help and compose the melody and send to her. I went all the way to a place to buy a vcd she wanted when i knew the vcd is available there.<br><br>Why must she appear at this time when i finally manage to forget her? I don't want to go through the slow and difficult days to forget her again if things don't go well.<br><br>My friends, what you think I should do?<br><br></div>
