This is to avoid traffic congestion as well as the problem of parking as a large number is expected to turn up for this rally.<br><br>The members of the public are advised not to bring objects that could be used as missiles or weapons. Marshalls would be posted at the entrances and elsewhere to monitor the situation with the help of CISCO officers.<br><br>As this is a one-of-a-kind event in Singapore's history the success of this rally and any future such events hinges also on the full co-operation of those attending!<br><br>With that...<br>Enjoy the SHOW!<br><br>Anyone interested in going?

            <div class='col-md body'>Attended the rally that night. There were about 1000-1500 people, didn't expect many to care anyway. Bought JBJ's book and as well as the Shame magazine by Think Centre. Oh, and a T-Shirt too. Listened to speeches made by various members of the Worker's Party, National Solidarity Party (I think), Singapore Democratic Party and Think Centre. Final conclusion by dear old Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam himself. I managed to get his autograph, and see him face to face for the first time. Can't say I know much about him. I was born too late, and by the time I knew what politics was, a lot of things had passed. But I'm going to read everything very carefully. And I'm going to get James Gomez book on self-censorship too. Always had a sneaky feeling that something doesn't feel quite right, but had no idea what it was. Maybe I'll find out.<br><br>[This message has been edited by KTE (edited 01 May 2001).]</div>

Younger generation can't be bothered. Most people just simply said :"we are living so well now, why bother to change anything?". Some will said :"they had been doing so well for decades, why bother to change?". From 97 elections, isn't it obvious what the younger generations are thinking from the result of Paris Ris GRC?<br><br>------------------<br>It is true that we don't know what we have got until we lose it<br>It is also true that we don't know what we have been missing until it arrives.</div>
