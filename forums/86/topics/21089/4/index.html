            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ashley:</div><div class="quote_body">For Ming (saggi):<br><br>Don't believe everything you hear. Someone is trying to pull the wool over your eyes, and if you're too gullible you can bet that it will cost you dearly.<br><br>The Moon remains in Pisces indicating that you should express your thoughts to those able to help you achieve your goals. The more you communicate the more help you will receive.<br><br>For moose (virgo):<br><br>Don't expect people to be as organized as usual. And it probably won't matter in the least how many times you bark out orders about getting back in line. People are simply freedom-loving by nature, a condition that the Pisces Moon tends to accentuate in various ways. So while the whole team may not be communicating very well, the individual members will be reaching deeper and deeper into what drives them and makes them individuals. If you can figure out each person's personal drama, you will be ahead of the game. But first, you need to examine yourself.<br><br>For Mille (Aquarius):<br>Although you recently ended up with less money than you had originally planned on, perhaps you should make extra charitable efforts, if for no other reason than to take you out of yourself and put yourself at the service of the rest of the universe. Compassion, like love, is a decision you make rather than a condition that befalls you, and even though you may be scrounging for change lately, you know quite well that you are pretty lucky in the grand scheme of things. So reevaluate your values and see what is before you<br><br>For Xiaobell(scopio):<br>Bells are ringing as sunsets and intimate dinners are calling your name. So don't be afraid to take off a mask or two and bear your soul to that special person in your life. If you are unattached, you should probably keep in mind that sheer and unadulterated honesty will be a more potent recipe for meeting someone to your liking than will be putting on airs. The romantic in you is also the vulnerable person in you, and people tend to get cozy when they are feeling safe. So let the music start playing and feel free to dance -- even if your steps are to that of a different drummer.<br><br>for inzaghi(Aries):<br>The core issue is not one of competence or one of commitment, but rather one of the celestial spheres simply not being conducive to experimentation. So rather than force the issue, give yourself another day or two of rest -- at least until you see the proverbial skies opening up. Then, you will be able to venture forth and the plans you plan and designs you design will come off with hardly a hitch. Even if people come along now and try to help you, you may want to be a little extra cautious and keep on the lookout for ulterior motives.<br><br>Enjoy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>Ashley :I don't have one ??? so sad la......<br><br>------------------<br>SUS<br>-------------------<br>Woman is to be love Woman not to be hurt Don't made me cried,<br>Don't said thing bad<br>So be good to me and<br>don't hurt me bad !!</div>
