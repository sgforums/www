            <div class='col-md body'>Your score = 80<br><br>You are romance typified! You believe in the magic of love and your imagination drifts when sweet songs play. Rose petals, poignant poetry, tall glasses of wine, touching moments, and sweet words are all a part of your romantic relationships (or would be if it were solely up to you).<br><br>Problems may arise if you are matched up with someone who isn't into full-blown romance. If you look forward to Valentine's Day to express your love and your partner doesn't even know when it is, you might end up feeling neglected. If your partner isn't as romantically inclined as you, it might be necessary for you to notice the effort your partner does make. Perhaps s/he doesn't display her affection in screamingly romantic ways, but if you tune into his/her subtle displays of adoration, your heart will soar with appreciation. And you can always encourage your partner to act romantically by rewarding him/her when s/he does try to woo you. If you were in a relationship with someone equally romantic, your relationship would be a story-book classic, but if your lover is a little more pragmatic Â— don't worry. It can still be a magical journey!<br><br>------------------<br>I am American Badass???<br>Dunno leh got people say i got attitude problem which is similiar to an american punk biker.</div>

If you are not aware of your slight tendency to be possessive and don't learn to keep it in check, it may explode in your face one day. Yes, occasional bouts of jealousy are normal and the odd visit from the green-eyed monster may be unavoidable. You may often be torn in two directions - flattered if someone finds your mate attractive, yet somewhat threatened. The important thing, however, is how you react to these feelings.<br><br>There are various possible reasons for your jealous tendencies; you may have been burned in the past by someone that you trusted, be afraid of having your heart stomped on, or have slight doubts about your ability to keep your partner interested. This is an issue you may want to investigate - do you sometimes feel unworthy, or suffer from low self-esteem? You may want to remind yourself that your partner chose to be with you for a reason, and being jealous will certainly not make you more attractive in his/her eyes. People with confidence are less jealous, and when they do experience this nasty emotion they keep it under control. You already seem to have this awareness, but may need to work on it. Notice your reactions when your trust is testedÂ…do you over-react? Do you think before you accuse your partner or jump to conclusions? Do you try to control or monitor him/her? Promise yourself that you will stop and think before you resort to these relationship-damaging behaviors. If you find that the problem grows or you are no longer able to control yourself, you may want to probe into the roots of these feelings. Be honest with your partner about your difficulties with trust, work on yourself, and remember; jealousy is poisonous to any healthy relationship.<br><br>Security<br>Your results show that you generally feel secure in your relationship, but may have occasional moments of doubt. You may not be completely confident in the strength of your relationship. In that case, you may want to examine the following questions: Is this a result of some difficulties in your relationship at the moment, or is it a reoccurring issue? Do you, for example, feel that it could fall apart if under pressure or in situations of conflict? This may be either a reflection of the actual relationship or a personal issue. Have you reached a level of closeness and intimacy in your relationship, or is it still in the forming stages? Or does your partner give you real reasons to question the stability of your relationship? For example, is he/she inconsistent with his/her affection or actions? Is he/she distant at times, or unreliable? If you truly feel the problem is this relationship, you should consider having a serious talk with your partner. Voice your concerns, without making angry accusations, and try to find ways that you could build the strength of your relationship. If you have a tendency to question all your relationships, however, you might benefit from examining your own insecurities. Do you worry about losing your partner without any real threats in sight? Do you wonder if you are good enough for him/her, or think that you could break up from any little fight? The root of doubt in love is sometimes a lack of self-confidence - it takes two stable individuals to build a strong relationship, after all. Try doing some soul-searching, and you may discover that if you work on your self-esteem your relationship has more chance of blossoming.<br><br>Conflict Resolution<br>Congratulations! Like the great politicians and businessmen of history, you know that compromise is the key to success. Your results show that you are generally able to listen to your partner, consider his/her opinions and present your views in a diplomatic way. This doesn't mean that you can't assert yourself; when it's an important issue, you are able to stand your ground, but you have the common sense to know when it is worth your while to just let it go. As we all know, couples often argue about the silliest things, like toilet seats and the best way to wash the dishes. You seem able to talk about these small, day-to-day things in a calm, non-threatening way so they don't escalate into a relationship-damaging war. In general, you fight the big battles, and let the little ones go. This is a reflection of the confidence you have in yourself - you know that your partner won't judge you or fall out of love with you if you express a different opinion. In fact, he/she most likely respects that you are unique individuals with different views. Perhaps you still enjoy the occasional argument (let's be honest- who doesn't?) but it's the way you fight that allows this to be a natural, harmless part of your relationship. You are aware of the common pitfalls of arguing, such as personal attacks ("You're an idiot!"), generalizations ("You never ask me how I feel!"), dredging up old issues from the past ("Remember two years ago, when you ate the last donut!"), accusations ("You're in love with my best friend, aren't you!"), and mind-reading ("You think my family is boring!"). You realize that occasional arguing is a natural event in any relationship, and does not mean the end. A great way to learn more is by taking Queendom's Arguing Styles Test.<br><br>Keep up the good work, and your relationship shouldn't fall into the pit of constant bickering. Happy arguing!<br><br>Sexuality<br>You had a high score on the sexuality aspect of the test, indicating an adventurous attitude. You are comfortable with your sexual side, which probably stems as much from your confidence as from lust and sensuality. You are willing to try new things your partner suggests, and are able to come up with new ideas yourself. This openness will allow you and your partner to keep the flames of passion burning with a sense of fun and creativity. You know that routine can be the killer of a vibrant sex-life, and have got the perspective necessary to avoid such a trap.<br><br>------------------<br>Theory Of Relativity<br>Eating a lot of good food will make 1 hour seem like 5 minutes while eating lotsa horrigible cooked veggies will make 5 minutes seem like 1 hour <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">~~~<br>Waiting for Diablo 2 Add-on <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Your test results show that have a high level of confidence in your relationship. You seem to realize that every couple occasionally faces hard times, but your sense of security will guide you through. You and your partner have a level of intimacy and closeness that allows you to truly be there to support and respect each other. Your relationship is generally solid and secure, providing a foundation of strength that keeps you both from cracking under pressure. When you fight, for example, you don't get worked up into a panic that the relationship is over. You know that you are able to survive moments of tension or conflict, and come out of it together. Continue with the level of respect, communication and trust that you now display and this relationship just may reach new heights!<br><br>Conflict Resolution<br>Congratulations!

Happy arguing!<br><br>Sexuality<br>Your score on the sexuality component of the test was average, indicating that you are open to some new possibilities but have your limits. You are generally comfortable with your own sexuality, and are sometimes creative and adventurous in the sac. You are most likely aware that a couple must try new things and avoid routine in order to keep the flames of passion burning, but may sometimes find yourself stuck in a rut anyway. This may not pose any problems, if both you and your partner are happy with the way things are. But if you are concerned about falling into a routine, you may want to think about possible reasons for your hesitancy in this area and work on them. Are you shy, thinking that your partner will judge or laugh at you if you make suggestions? Chances are he/she is thinking the same thing, and would welcome the surprise. Sexuality is natural and healthy, and nothing to be ashamed of. Do you feel uncomfortable with your own body, and wish your were more attractive? Depending on the root of this feeling, there are various steps you can take to get over it. First, consider the fact that everyone has insecurities and faults. Your partner probably doesn't notice them, or may even think they are endearing. 99.9% of the human race have body image issues, or at least see qualities they would like to change about themselves<br><br>------------------<br><strong>"Gravity cannot be held responsible for two people falling in love"<br>~Abert Einstein~</strong></div>
