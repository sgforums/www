            <div class='col-md body'>It was Friday again, smilling to herself, while she picked wat she wanted to wear to report to work. "Hmm...  What should I wear eh... " So she thought, since its Friday, maybe she'll just grab her fav pink T-shirt and jeans skirt.<br><br>Grabbing her bag, and she's off for work. The bus doesn't seems crowded for e day, and it was unusally empty. "Good Start of a day to hop on to empty bus...", she thought to herself.<br><br>However once she reached that super mini office, things took a different turn. Her boss questioned her of misplacing some applications into a place where it should not be. Her boss is a forgetful person, but she isn't. She is very clear that she'll never do something like tat.<br><br>After some unfair harsh words, the boss was blaming her for e mistake she did not make. She felt unfair, not to mention anger, however as usual, she kept it to herself, and continue with her daily work. There was not much work today. She thought about it, why does she have to bear with her boss's mood swings and to have keep quiet to things tat were non of her business?<br><br>Since she had already summitted her resignation letter a week ago, her boss temper has been even worst, almost unpredictable, even worst then a lady's PMS period... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> She took things in her stride and keep her cool, even smile at him when he lost his temper at her.<br><br>Her new company, (a job of her dreams) has decided to take her recently, and she is over e moon because of it. Her direct boss in her new company, had requested her to start work early, and had asked her to talk to the current one. After much thinking, and what happen this morning, She decided, perhaps.... she should really ask.<br><br>She told her the problem, and had tell him tat she had initally have the intention of not asking the current company to release her early, and she shall fulfill the two weeks notice as stated in the letter of appointment. (she has already serve one week of notice.) "Sir, since you are so unhappy about my work, and I'm of no help to you, y not letting me off early?" His reaction was a rude, and even commented tat she will not last long in her new company, and she is an unkind gal and stuffs.<br><br>okie, she thought, this is the last straw that break the carmel's back. He left the company, and for the rest of e day, not giving any work. She starts to experience cramps (ok, time of e mth) and feeling very uncomfortable. His wife came in office, and was doing some important documents, so the gal decided to talk to her only after she's done.<br><br>However, she's in such a bad condition tat she blacked out before she's able to say what she wanted. when she awake, she's already at home. She tried to clarify what is going on with the wife, but she still inssit tat she comes to work on monday.<br><br>The whole company only have the boss, and the gal, with the wife coming in once in a while. So if the gal can't communicate with the boss, how is she going to finish her resignation notice? She's determine not going back to office, even if she doesn't start work at her new company next week, at the max, she'll just take a week's break.<br><br>She thinks tis boss is bring this upon himself. she's only taken in as a admin asst. However, she's e maid, admin asst, coordinator... etc. This boss is a computer idiot, and is lazy. sometimes, the files are right under his nose, he still ask, " where is the file for so and so?" kinda of stuff...<br><br>What a horrible day, sometimes try to cry to ease the pain... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Friday, what a way to end Friday....</div>
