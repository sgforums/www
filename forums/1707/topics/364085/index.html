              <p id="article_credit">TOKYO —</p>
              <p>In the first half of the 20th century, Tokyo was bitten by the modernist bug. 
              The violent upheavals seen in Western art, literature, music and fashion found 
              parallels over here—but it was architecture that provided the most visible and 
              lasting testament to the changes underfoot.</p>
              <p>Buildings like the Tokyo Central Post Office (1931) in Marunouchi 
              demonstrated the increasing influence of such Western architects as Le Corbusier 
              and concepts like Bauhaus. In the decades following World War II, with 
              industrialization suffocating creativity, postmodernism came to the forefront. 
              Experts considered architect Minoru Takeyama’s colorful Ichibankan (1969) and 
              monochrome Nibankan (1970), situated in the nightlife quarter of Kabukicho, to 
              be the first examples of this new avant-garde spirit.</p>
              <p>Today, Ichibankan is completely closed, and Nibankan, whose exterior is 
              riddled with chipped paint and cracked concrete, maintains only a first-floor 
              restaurant in operation. Ownership changed two years ago. During a meeting with 
              the buildings’ present owner, Sankei Hotel, a lodging operator that specializes 
              in business and love hotels, representatives of the company indicated that the 
              future use of the structures has not been decided.</p>
              <p>Such a potential reprieve is rare, as the elimination of Japan’s landmark 
              properties becomes routine and calls for preservation are crushed by developers’ 
              wrecking balls.</p>
              <p>The challenges facing preservationists are numerous.</p>
              <p>Last October, entertainment company Shochiku announced that the Kabuki-za 
              theater in Ginza, Japan’s home for kabuki since it was founded in 1889, will 
              close next year and be reinstalled inside a large office complex by 2013. 
              Reconstructed twice, its 1924 incarnation incorporated a new style of 
              non-burnable building materials. The current five-decade-old building achieved 
              tangible cultural property status in 2002.</p>
              <p>Shochiku said in an email statement that the Kabuki-za is an aging structure 
              that is susceptible to earthquakes. “Taking into consideration that its 
              facilities are not barrier-free, we decided that it would be in the best 
              interest of our customers for us to rebuild the theater.”</p>
              <p>In addition to the financial hurdles inherent in upgrading aging mechanical 
              and electrical systems, architects believe that revisions to earthquake-proofing 
              requirements within the Building Standards Law in recent decades are also 
              burdensome. “You have to spend a lot of money to make a building seismically 
              sound, and there is no aid from the government to do that,” explains Jun Mitsui, 
              principal architect of JMA Architects in Meguro. “The owner has to basically 
              assume the financial burden himself.”</p>
              <p><strong>Financial incentives given to developers</strong></p>
              <p>Crucial, too, has been the financial incentive given to developers. In 2002, 
              then Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi passed legislation that lifted regulations 
              on zoning and building height in exchange for the establishment of public parks 
              or plazas on any newly constructed properties. Often referred to as an “urban 
              renaissance,” the deregulation was intended to maintain Tokyo’s competitive 
              status with nearby metropolises Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore.</p>
              <p>“That was the stimulus to Japan’s economic upturn,” says Mitsui of the 
              economic expansion that took place in the middle of this decade. “Property 
              owners wanted to maximize their buildings’ floor space because that is what 
              makes more money.”</p>
              <p>Non-property firms with robust real estate assets, like Shochiku, have also 
              been taking notice. Japan Post, which became a pseudo-private entity two years 
              ago, is in the process of constructing a 200-meter-tall building on the site of 
              the 78-year-old Tokyo Central Post Office on the Marunouchi side of Tokyo 
              station. The curved brick building will eventually incorporate parts of the 
              older structure’s exterior facade in the new design. Last-ditch attempts to save 
              the original building resulted in Japan Post announcing that it will seek 
              tangible cultural property status for the property and retain more of the 
              structure than first planned.</p>
              <p>Last year, film studio Toho acquired Kabukicho’s Koma Stadium theater, a 
              popular venue for enka and musical shows that dates back to 1956. Toho also owns 
              the adjacent Shinjuku Toho Kaikan and plans to redevelop both plots. Publisher 
              Kodansha’s Noma Dojo training facility, established in 1925, was knocked down in 
              late 2007 in favor of a more modern complex.</p>
              <p>“In Japan, the idea of scrap-and-build has been dominant for a long time,” 
              explains Kengo Kuma, a leading architect whose firm designed the Suntory Museum 
              of Art at Tokyo Midtown. “So there hadn’t been much attention paid to the 
              preservation of buildings. The debate over the Tokyo Central Post Office, 
              however, has provided a good opportunity for the public to think carefully about 
              the preservation of old architecture.”</p>
              <p>Many other preservation pushes have failed. The Sanshin Building (1930), an 
              eight-floor structure that overlooked Hibiya Park and contained elaborate 
              ceilings and columns, was demolished by developer Mitsui Fudosan in 2007. The 
              concrete Dojunkai apartments were innovative housing structures—featuring trash 
              chutes and gas lines—upon their completion between 1924 and 1934 at 16 locations 
              in Tokyo and Yokohama. In 2003, the five-story Otsuka Women’s Apartment House 
              was demolished, and the Aoyama site was replaced three years later by Tadao 
              Ando’s concrete and glass Omotesando Hills shopping center. Just two apartment 
              blocks remain today.</p>
              <p>Mitsui believes that as a solution to here-today-gone-tomorrow, Tokyo needs 
              to adopt master planning. “The formation of a master plan will define such 
              things as the height and use of the building,” he says, adding that 
              complications within private land ownership and a lack of government impetus 
              thus far have made such a concept very difficult.</p>
              <p>Yet the government does offer some support—albeit through a tradeoff that 
              benefits developers. In exchange for preservation of its notable Mitsui Honkan 
              (1929), Mitsui Fudosan was allowed to develop a nearby site into the 39-floor 
              Nihonbashi Mitsui Tower (2005). The height of the new structure exceeded that 
              permitted by law, but Mitsui was allowed to transfer the unused air rights 
              (i.e., potential additional floor area) of the old building following its 
              preservation.</p>
              <p>The Paris-based conservation group Docomomo International, which works to 
              preserve modern buildings, established a Japanese branch in 2000. Its group of 
              experts has designated over 135 local structures as important. In addition to 
              the remaining Dojunkai units and the Tokyo Central Post Office, the list 
              includes Frank Lloyd Wright’s Myonichikan (1921), Tokyo Bunka Kaikan (1961) and 
              the Nakagin Capsule Tower (1972), the Kisho Kurokawa-designed structure of 
              stacked concrete residential modules.</p>
              <p>Hiroyuki Suzuki, chairperson of Docomomo Japan and a professor of 
              architecture at Tokyo University, says that the group submits appeals to 
              landowners of listed buildings scheduled for demolition. He sees some hope with 
              regards to preservation, citing the restoration of Tokyo Station’s red brick 
              building, set to be completed in 2013, as an example. “Progress is small to this 
              point,” he says, “but we will continue to make appeals against the demolition of 
              important works because it is essential we do so.”</p>
              <p>The group is now focusing its attention on buildings from the 1970s—a move 
              probably too late for the Kenzo Tange-designed Hanae Mori building (1977), the 
              glass-walled Omotesando landmark that is scheduled to be pulled down following 
              the removal of its tenants this year.</p>
              <p>As to Ichibankan and Nibankan, Docomomo’s Suzuki says that the group finds 
              Takeyama’s work to be very significant. Yet an approach and time frame for 
              preservation of his buildings has not been determined. “At Docomomo, we realize 
              that there is a connection between modernism and postmodernism that needs to be 
              discussed,” he explains.</p>
              <p>Should the near future bring an end to the Kabukicho creations of Takeyama, 
              the man himself says says he would not be irritated, knowing that the business 
              is financially driven. He also looks at Ise Jingu, a Shinto complex in Mie 
              Prefecture whose buildings are dismantled and rebuilt every 20 years in an 
              effort to ensure a new appearance. “I can’t really say if it is positive or 
              negative,” Takeyama explains. “They have been up for 40 years. That’s not too 
              bad. Maybe it is time.”</p>
