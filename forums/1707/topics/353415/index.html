              <p><strong><span style="color: #8ec616;">Project Description<br></span></strong>The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) has restored the Old Ford Factory, a gazetted national monument, because of its historical significance as the venue of the British Surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. The building of a new repository block was carried out together with the restoration of the Old Ford Factory to meet the long term storage needs of NAS. The restored Old Ford Factory now houses a permanent gallery featuring the exhibition Syonan Years: Singapore Under Japanese Rule, 1942 - 1945?.</p>

              <li>The National Archives of Singapore (NAS) has restored the Old Ford Factory, a gazetted national monument, because of its historical significance as the venue of the British Surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. </li>
              <li>The building of a new repository block was carried out together with the restoration of the Old Ford Factory to meet the long term storage needs of NAS. </li>
              <li>The restored Old Ford Factory now houses a permanent gallery featuring the exhibition “Syonan Years: Singapore Under Japanese Rule, 1942 - 1945”. Memories at Old Ford Factory Going Green </li>
              <li>In the development of Memories at Old Ford Factory (Memories), sustainability and efficient resource management were two key considerations of NAS besides authenticity and faithfulness in the restoration processes. The four principles of waste management – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle &amp; Recover - were deeply entrenched in the philosophy of site management and redevelopment throughout the 20 odds months of building and restoring works - both the construction of the new archives repository as well as the set up of the exhibition gallery. Through a number of ‘Green’ innovations, NAS hopes to see MOFF turns into a model site where energy and resource consumption is efficient and running cost is maintained at low levels over time. However, the implementation of these ‘Green’ features does not only bring cost benefits to the operation of the facilities and compound. Instead, these features also serve as illustrations of the relevance of the stories and lessons on innovation and perseverance told in the exhibition to our lives today. These lessons emphasize the importance of sustainability in the use of resources as well as the value of perseverance in finding creative ways to adapt and get around resource scarcity. </li>
              <li>For example, part of the exhibition is about the critical role of water in the Malayan Campaign. When key reservoirs in Singapore fell into Japanese hands during the campaign, the loss of water supply became one of the key considerations of the British in making the decision to surrender. Likewise today, water continues to be a vital resource for Singapore. Without unlimited access to fresh water, conservation of water and its sustainable management is more important than ever before for Singapore. In this context, the implementation of the rainwater harvesting system thus has greater meaning and connection to the exhibition at Memories. 1. Lighting exhibition displays with cool lights instead of conventional halogen lights traditionally used in museums </li>
              <li>Within the exhibition gallery, Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) and Fibre Optic lighting (FOL) systems are adopted as the only sources of display lighting. The objective is to steer the gallery away from the use of conventional halogen systems that are traditionally found in many museums and art galleries. While this move may have resulted a slight higher set up cost in the beginning, we were motivated by other long-term benefits that we could harvest from the use of LEDs and FOL, as outlined below:  </li>
              <li>i. The combination of LEDs and FOLs in the gallery at Memories, presents an advantage over the halogen system in terms of their lower energy consumption. Based on the required usage of the gallery, had we adopted the halogen system, we would have consumed 7,883W more power, or nearly 80% more than what the gallery now consumed: 2,192W. (Annex 1 shows the breakdown &amp; comparison)  </li>
              <li>ii. Although the gallery did not display many original records that are extremely sensitive to UV, reproduction of exhibits is expensive too and if we could prolong the exhibit lifespan, it means reduction of recurrent cost. The use of UV-free LED and FOL thus poses a tremendous advantage over the halogen system as the exhibits will be less susceptible to fading and light damages arising from heat, etc. Furthermore, with significantly lower heat emission from LED and FOL, the amount of stress exerted on the gallery air-conditioning is also reduced.2. Harnessing of solar energy to supplement exhibition display lightingTaking energy conservation efforts in the gallery a step further, we have been harnessing solar energy at Memories since September 2006 to supplement the powering of exhibition display lights. Currently, 86.4 kWh of power consumed by LED light fixtures within the gallery monthly is totally drawn from solar energy. Correspondingly, 1,036.8 kWh of “clean” solar energy is used yearly. This was possible also because LED lights in general consume much lower power than halogen lights.  </li>
              <li>In line with the principles of waste management, various materials from the original building as well as other building projects were recycled and integrated into the exhibition gallery as displays. From the original Ford building, damaged mosaic tiles and green tinted glass were re-used in a mosaic map display, which is the center piece of the gallery.Fences that once surrounded the Old Parliament House are now used in the gallery as an installation art, lending a symbolic meaning from their distinctly colonial design to exhibits at the “Internment of POWs” section, as well as in the external landscape of Memories as a safety barrier to prevent visitors from wandering unknowingly to the steep slopes at the corners of our compound.4. Recovering of rainwater to irrigate plants and food crops in the garden and natural landscapes of Memories. </li>
              <li>Beyond the gallery premises, the exhibition continues in the “Syonan Garden” which cultivates wartime food crops such as rice, sweet potatoes and tapioca. With rainwater harvesting technology, rainwater is collected and channeled for watering the garden. Memories is able to collect up to 9 m3 of rainwater weekly, with a day of continuous rainfall or equivalent in a week.With sufficient rainfall, the system is able to provide recycled rainwater to irrigate the garden and surrounding landscapes of Memories for two hours each day. This saves approximately 468 m3 of potable water used yearly. Come September 2007, the capacity of the system will be expanded further to a total of 1,508 m3 of potable water. The larger capacity will allow the landscapes of Memories to be fully watered by harvested rainwater, and generating further savings. 5. Roof garden at the archives repository block.   </li>
              <li>The installation of a high density, low maintenance garden on the roof of the repository building is an innovative means of insulating our repositories from the Sun’s direct heat. Planted with hardy plants that requires little care, the roof garden is easily maintained. More importantly, the garden also reduces the temperature and area of the heat source that accumulates on the concrete roof. This brings down the amount of external heat that penetrates into the repositories directly below the roof. </li>
              <li>With the roof garden and layers of insulation applied to the roof, a consistent 1-2 degrees drop in temperature in the repository immediately below the roof was achieved. 6. Eco-friendly functions and sustainable practices. In order to achieve sustainable resource management in the long term, eco-friendly functions and practices are observed in our daily operations. For example, the use of natural lighting is integrated as a display and presentation technique in several parts of the gallery. Other eco-friendly practices that have been integrated into the operations also include fertilizing and maintaining plants and landscapes with organic fertilizers rather than chemical fertilizers as well as the use of motion-sensor taps rather than push taps that can generate significant wastage of water. Dried leaves and weeds that are removed from the garden and landscapes are also recycled and made into organic fertilizers with a compose-maker. Plants and landscapes are also cleverly used in various parts of the centre for functional purposes. Bamboos, for example, are used in place of conventional steel screens to form a natural and aesthetically pleasing screen to shield the AHU from sight and dampen noise from the units. Similarly, plants are also planted along the slopes and driveway to act as natural safety barriers, in place of steel fences. </li>
