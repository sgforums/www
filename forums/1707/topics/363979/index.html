              </div>
              <p></p>
              <p>So when a lighting designer two years ago proposed installing light 
              emitting diodes or LEDs, an emerging lighting technology, the royal family 
              readily assented. The new lights, the designer said, would last more than 22 
              years and enormously reduce energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions — a 
              big plus for Prince 
              Charles, an ardent environmentalist. Since then, the palace has installed 
              the lighting in chandeliers and on the exterior, where illuminating the entire 
              facade uses less electricity than running an electric teakettle.</p>
              <p>In shifting to LED lighting, the palace is part of a small but fast-growing 
              trend that is redefining the century-old conception of lighting, replacing 
              energy-wasting disposable bulbs with efficient fixtures that are often 
              semi-permanent, like those used in plumbing.</p>
              <p>Studies suggest that a complete conversion to the lights could decrease 
              carbon dioxide emissions from electric power use for lighting by up to 50 
              percent in just over 20 years; in the United States, lighting accounts for about 
              6 percent of all energy use. A recent report by McKinsey &amp; Company cited 
              conversion to LED lighting as potentially the most cost effective of a number of 
              simple approaches to tackling global 
              warming using existing technology.</p>

              <p>LED lighting was once relegated to basketball scoreboards, cellphone 
              consoles, traffic lights and colored Christmas lights. But as a result of rapid 
              developments in the technology, it is now poised to become common on streets and 
              in buildings, as well as in homes and offices. Some American cities, including 
              Ann Arbor, Mich., and Raleigh, N.C., are using the lights to illuminate streets 
              and parking garages, and dozens more are exploring the technology. And the 
              lighting now adorns the conference rooms and bars of some Renaissance hotels, a 
              corridor in the Pentagon and a new green building at Stanford.</p>
              <p>LEDs are more than twice as efficient as compact 
              fluorescent bulbs, currently the standard for greener lighting. Unlike 
              compact fluorescents, LEDs turn on quickly and are compatible with dimmer 
              switches. And while fluorescent bulbs contain mercury, which requires special 
              disposal, LED bulbs contain no toxic elements, and last so long that disposal is 
              not much of an issue.</p>
              <p>“It is fit-and-forget-lighting that is essentially there for as long as you 
              live,” said Colin Humphreys, a researcher at Cambridge 
              University who works on gallium nitride LED lights, which now adorn 
              structures in Britain.</p>
              <p>The switch to LEDs is proceeding far more rapidly than experts had predicted 
              just two years ago. President 
              Obama’s stimulus package, which offers money for “green” infrastructure 
              investment, will accelerate that pace, experts say. San Jose, Calif., plans to 
              use $2 million in energy-efficiency grants to install 1,500 LED streetlights.</p>
              <p>Thanks in part to the injection of federal cash, sales of the lights in new 
              “solid state” fixtures — a $297 million industry in 2007 — are likely to become 
              a near-billion-dollar industry by 2013, said Stephen Montgomery, director of LED 
              research projects at Electronicast, a California consultancy. And after years of 
              resisting what they had dismissed as a fringe technology, giants like General 
              Electric and Philips have begun making LEDs.</p>
              <p>Though the United 
              States Department of Energy calls LED “a pivotal emerging technology,” there 
              remain significant barriers. Homeowners may balk at the high initial cost, which 
              lighting experts say currently will take 5 to 10 years to recoup in electricity 
              savings. An outdoor LED spotlight today costs $100, as opposed to $7 for a 
              regular bulb.</p>
              <p>Another issue is that current LEDs generally provide only “directional light” 
              rather than a 360-degree glow, meaning they are better suited to downward facing 
              streetlights and ceiling lights than to many lamp-type settings.</p>
              <p>And in the rush to make cheaper LED lights, poorly made products could erase 
              the technology’s natural advantage, experts warn. LEDs are tiny sandwiches of 
              two different materials that release light as electrons jump from one to the 
              other. The lights must be carefully designed so heat does not damage them, 
              reducing their lifespan to months from decades. And technological advances that 
              receive rave reviews in a university laboratory may not perform as well when 
              mass produced for the real world.</p>
              <p>Britain’s Low Carbon Trust, an environmental nonprofit group, has replaced 
              the 12 LED fixtures bought three years ago for its offices with conventional 
              bulbs, because the LED lights were not bright enough, said Mischa Hewitt, a 
              program manager at the trust. But he says he still thinks the technology is 
              important.</p>
              <p>Brian Owen, a contributor to the trade magazine LEDs, said that while it is 
              good that cities are exploring LED lighting: “They have to do their due 
              diligence. Rash decisions can result in disappointment or disaster.”</p>
              <p>At the same time, nearly monthly scientific advances are addressing many of 
              the problems, decreasing the high price of the bulbs somewhat and improving 
              their ability to provide normal white light bright enough to illuminate rooms 
              and streets.</p>
              </div>
              <p>For example, many LEDs are currently made on precious materials like 
              sapphire. But scientists at a government-financed laboratory at Cambridge 
              University have figured out how to grow them on silicon wafers, potentially 
              making the lights far cheaper. While the original LEDs gave off only glowing red 
              or green light, newer versions produce a blue light that, increasingly, can be 
              manipulated to simulate incandescent bulbs. And researchers at dozens of 
              universities are working to make the bulbs more usable.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>“This is a technology on a very fast learning curve,” said Jon Creyts, an 
              author of the McKinsey report, who predicted that the technology could be in 
              widespread use within five years.</p>
              <p>So far, the use of LEDs has been predominantly in outdoor settings. Toronto, 
              Raleigh, Ann Arbor and Anchorage — not to mention Tianjin, China, and Torraca, 
              Italy — have adopted LEDs for street and parking garage lighting, forsaking the 
              yellow glow of traditional high-pressure sodium lamps. Three major California 
              cities — Los Angeles (140,000 streetlights), San Jose (62,000) and San Francisco 
              (30,000) — have embarked on some LED conversions.</p>
              <p>Ann Arbor adopted the technology early, working with Relume Technologies, of 
              Oxford, Mich., to design LEDs that would fit the globes of downtown fixtures. 
              The $515 cost of installing each light will be paid back in reduced maintenance 
              and electrical costs in four years and four months, said Mike Bergren, the 
              city’s field-operations manager.</p>
              <p>Because the light from LEDs can be modulated, in Ann Arbor they have been 
              programmed to perform various useful tricks — to become brighter when someone 
              walks under a light or to flicker outside of a home to guide paramedics to an 
              emergency. And because they do not emit ultraviolet light, they attract no bugs.</p>
              <p>People who live around Carolina Pines Park in Raleigh say they are pleased 
              with the park’s new LED lights because they can be directed downward, away from 
              home windows.</p>
              <p>The lights are also rapidly moving indoors, where they could have an enormous 
              effect on climate change. About 20 percent of carbon dioxide emissions 
              associated with buildings in the United States and the United Kingdom are 
              related to indoor lighting; in some houses the number is as high as 40 percent.</p>
              <p>This month, LED lights were for the first time the centerpiece at two of the 
              world’s major trade shows for lighting, Lightfare International in New York and 
              EuroLuce in Milan. A growing number of builders are starting to fit them into 
              public buildings, offices and homes.</p>
              <p>Ted Van Hyning, director of event technology at the Renaissance Hotel in 
              Cleveland, said the new LED lights in the hotel’s conference rooms use 10 
              percent of the electricity of the fluorescent lights they replaced. And 
              maintenance costs are far lower: A fluorescent bulb might last 3,000 hours while 
              an LED fixture lasts more than 100,000 hours, Mr. Van Hyning said, adding: “We 
              have six-figure energy costs a year, and these lights could represent a huge 
              saving. Besides, they’re cool and sexy and fun.”</p>
              <p>Buoyed by the improvements in the technology, Peter Byrne, a lighting 
              designer and energy consultant for Buckingham Palace, installed the 32,000 
              custom LEDs in the ceiling of the grand stairwell when older fixtures wore 
              out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Byrne recognizes that Buckingham Palace is not the average home. “They 
              need high-quality light — they have a lot of gold,” he said, “and gold tends to 
              look silver if you light it poorly.”</p>
              <p>Still he has started using the technology in other projects, for their light 
              and their environmental benefit. He estimates that half of lights in homes, and 
              particularly those in offices and stores can already be replaced by LEDs.</p>
              <p>“At this point, LEDs can’t be used in all lights but that’s changing every 
              month,” Mr. Byrne said. “If you go into Wal-Mart, and look at all those twin 
              8-foot fluorescents above every aisle, you realize that the potential is 
              enormous.”</p>
              <p>For example, many LEDs are currently made on precious materials like 
              sapphire. But scientists at a government-financed laboratory at Cambridge 
              University have figured out how to grow them on silicon wafers, potentially

              <p>Because the light from LEDs can be modulated, in Ann Arbor they have been 
              programmed to perform various useful tricks — to become brighter when someone 
              walks under a light or to flicker outside of a home to guide paramedics to an 
              emergency. And because they do not emit ultraviolet light, they attract no bugs.</p>
              <p>People who live around Carolina Pines Park in Raleigh say they are pleased 
              with the park’s new LED lights because they can be directed downward, away from 
              home windows.</p>
              <p>The lights are also rapidly moving indoors, where they could have an enormous 
              effect on climate change. About 20 percent of carbon dioxide emissions 
              associated with buildings in the United States and the United Kingdom are 
              related to indoor lighting; in some houses the number is as high as 40 percent.</p>
              <p>This month, LED lights were for the first time the centerpiece at two of the 
              world’s major trade shows for lighting, Lightfare International in New York and 
              EuroLuce in Milan. A growing number of builders are starting to fit them into 
              public buildings, offices and homes.</p>
              <p>Ted Van Hyning, director of event technology at the Renaissance Hotel in 
              Cleveland, said the new LED lights in the hotel’s conference rooms use 10 
              percent of the electricity of the fluorescent lights they replaced. And 
              maintenance costs are far lower: A fluorescent bulb might last 3,000 hours while 
              an LED fixture lasts more than 100,000 hours, Mr. Van Hyning said, adding: “We 
              have six-figure energy costs a year, and these lights could represent a huge 
              saving. Besides, they’re cool and sexy and fun.”</p>
              <p>Buoyed by the improvements in the technology, Peter Byrne, a lighting 
              designer and energy consultant for Buckingham Palace, installed the 32,000 
              custom LEDs in the ceiling of the grand stairwell when older fixtures wore 
              out.</p>
              <p>Mr. Byrne recognizes that Buckingham Palace is not the average home. “They 
              need high-quality light — they have a lot of gold,” he said, “and gold tends to 
              look silver if you light it poorly.”</p>
              <p>Still he has started using the technology in other projects, for their light 
              and their environmental benefit. He estimates that half of lights in homes, and 
              particularly those in offices and stores can already be replaced by LEDs.</p>
              <p>“At this point, LEDs can’t be used in all lights but that’s changing every 
              month,” Mr. Byrne said. “If you go into Wal-Mart, and look at all those twin 
              8-foot fluorescents above every aisle, you realize that the potential is 
              enormous.” </p>
