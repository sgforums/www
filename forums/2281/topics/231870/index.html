            <div class='col-md body'>Ian De Cotta<br>ian@mediacorp.com.sg<br><br>IT WILL be the only one of its kind and will surely generate huge interest.<br>.<br>With the National Stadium making way for a new Sports Hub, the National Day Parade on Aug 9 has taken on extra significance as it will be held on a floating platform built on Marina Bay.<br>.<br>There will also be another first, during the month-long celebration as Singapore turns 42.<br>.<br>Sources have revealed that organisers are looking at linking up with Motorsport Asia Ltd to hold a motor race sometime during the month, both as part of the birthday festivities and to also give Singaporeans a feel of motor-racing, as the country gears up to host a Formula 1 Grand Prix next year.<br>.<br>The National Day Parade (NDP) organising committee refused to comment on any development, with a spokeswoman saying yesterday that plans for events during August are still at an early stage.<br>.<br>"Details of NDP celebrations are still being firmed up right now. As such, it is premature to comment on this issue," she added.<br>.<br>Motorsport Asia Ltd organise the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia, Formula V6 Asia by Renault, Formula BMW Asia and the Asian Touring Car Championship.<br>.<br>They have been running Formula 1 support events for the Sepang Grand Prix since 2003 and the Shanghai Grand Prix since 2004. They will do so again this year, with the Sepang race on April 8 and the Shanghai showpiece on Oct 7.<br>.<br>When contacted yesterday, Motorsport Asia Ltd chief executive officer, David Sonenscher, also refused to comment on any link-up with Singapore.<br>.<br>"Any promoter would love to get involved with a motor racing event in Singapore," said the 43-year-old Englishman, who was in Singapore yesterday.<br>.<br>"If there is a possibility of organising one, we would certainly love to be a part of it.<br>.<br>"That said, it is a huge undertaking to organise a motor-racing event on a street, but we have the expertise and have designed circuits in Taiwan and elsewhere."<br>.<br>In exclusive reports last week, Today revealed that two groups, one led by hotel and property tycoon Ong Beng Seng and the other by ONEÂ°15 luxury marina club developer Arthur Tay, were bidding to snag hosting rights for a Formula 1 race in Singapore next year.<br>.<br>Negotiations with Bernie Ecclestone's Formula One Management company are thought to be at an advanced stage and if successful a street circuit would be the feature of the Singapore leg.<br>.<br>Sonenscher was part of a consortium formed to design a Formula 1 street circuit in Singapore, but lost the bid to German Hermann Tilke.<br>.<br>When asked about the viability of holding a street race here in August, he said: "Studies need to be conducted to get a street track up. The logistics and the costs are high, but it should be possible with the help of the Singapore Motor Sports Association."<br>.<br>Meanwhile, Paul Cherry, whose A1 Grand Prix series is also bidding to hold a street race here, welcomed the news of the possibility of Formula 1 coming to Singapore.<br>.<br>"We are happy that the idea of Singapore hosting a motor race is gaining momentum," said the A1GP general manager.<br>.<br>"We too, have our own proposal for a street track showcasing all that is gloriously Singapore. We will be presenting to the relevant authorities soon so that Â… they can decide what suits Singapore." Formula 1 support event could be part of National Day celebrations<br><br></div>
