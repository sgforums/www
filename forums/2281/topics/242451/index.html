            <div class='col-md body'>Decision on F1 racing deal could come Sunday<br>A go-ahead will put S'pore on world motor racing map<br><br>By SAMUEL EE<br><br>(SINGAPORE) Singaporeans, get ready to start your engines. After years of waiting, you could know as early as this weekend whether you are going to get your own Formula One motor race.<br><br>Mr Ong: Had talks with Formula One Management supremo Bernie Ecclestone<br>Formula One Management (FOM) supremo Bernie Ecclestone, who stopped off here en route to the season's first F1 race in Melbourne this Sunday, may say when he gets Down Under that a draft deal has been reached to hold a race in Singapore.<br><br>Mr Ecclestone had talks with local property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. The deal is not in the bag yet but sources say key people working for Mr Ong are already in Melbourne working on the fine print.<br><br>If Mr Ecclestone does announce a Singapore race to the world media gathered there for this Sunday's event, it would catapult Singapore to the world motor racing stage.<br><br>Under a draft deal, the rights to host an F1 race here for seven years from next year could be awarded by FOM.<br><br>It is understood that a stumbling block could be the upfront 'sanction' fee required by FOM - the amount paid for the right to stage an F1 race. Apparently, the total fee for all seven years is being sought - and it is rumoured to be around US$250 million.<br><br>Mr Ecclestone, who arrived in Singapore on Monday night, is said to be seeking a guarantee from the Singapore government rather than from Mr Ong, who bid for the rights in his personal capacity and not with his listed HPL group. Despite not being involved in the F1 bid, HPL shares yesterday closed 32 cents higher at $4.52.<br><br>Parliament was told last week that the government is willing to provide financial and other support for any venture staging an F1 event here. It is keen to pick up half the tab, which is crucial because a typical race weekend can cost anything from US$70 million to US$75 million, including the sanction fee and organising costs.<br><br>Besides Mr Ong, SUTL Group's Arthur Tay - best known as the developer of the luxury marina at Sentosa Cove - has been linked to the F1 bid.<br><br>At one point in discussions with FOM, Mr Ong and Mr Tay were said to have considered joining forces to put forward a combined proposal. But it has now turned out that Mr Ong is the front-runner in the race to the chequered flag.<br></div>
