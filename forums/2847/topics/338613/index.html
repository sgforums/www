              <p>MediaCorp Radio YES933 FM's DJ Dennis Chew is lately referred to as the
              "Duke Zhou". But this is not the usual "Duke of Zhou" whom we also
              commonly refer to as the "God of Dreams" but one who speaks of ghosts,
              gets your hair standing and gives you nightmares. And if you are ready,
              Dennis he is about to share a true ghost story with us.</p>
              <p>"I'm not a superstitious person but I would rather believe in it
              (ghosts)," he says. Dennis has not only heard "them" speaking but has
              also seen them with his own naked eye.</p>
              <p>He was filming a music
              video in an old dilapidated hut which used to be a French embassy when
              something out of the world happened.</p>
              <p>A "third party" appeared and
              stood listening to Dennis and the director's discussion. "He (an old
              man) has grey skin and was wearing a colored security guard's uniform,"
              he describes. Dennis tried to signal the "third party's" existence but
              the director did not seem to get it.</p>
              <p>Dennis went numbed on seeing
              the "uninvited grey-skinned guest" but in order not to frighten the
              rest of crew, he chose to keep mum, bit his teeth and got over with the
              filming. He was trickling cold sweat when the director shot him close
              the door. "At that moment, it was in front of me and behind the door.
              When I close the door, he suddenly appeared beside me! How is that
              possible within such a short period of time?" he exclaims.</p>
              <p>The
              last scene was at the top floor of the hut. Dennis was absolutely
              unwilling, nonetheless obliged. "Director is this shot confirmed the
              last?" he asked. They proceed after getting a positive reply. Just when
              the director was about to give instructions, they heard heavy footsteps.</p>
              <p>The
              director was still oblivious to what was happening until the moment
              when they were taking the last shot, the director started coughing
              badly. Then they heard footsteps again coming from the next room and it
              was even louder than the previous. The director pretended to be
              indifferent then he suddenly shouted "Wrap!" for the crew to pack up
              and leave. The cameraman was just glad to knock off.</p>
              <p>Dennis and
              the director then left in the same vehicle but none of them spoke,
              except to make an appointment for a meeting at night. When Dennis was
              home, he went straight to bath and was devastated the moment he took
              off his clothes. His entire body was full of scratch marks. Though it
              does not hurt, he was so afraid he just cried.</p>
              <p>When he met the
              director that night, they began discussing about the strange encounters
              earlier on. Though the director did not see the "third party" but he
              did sense it. And it happened that the director's abrupt cough earlier
              on was because "someone" was strangling him. Dennis was not the only
              victim; the director also has bruises all over his body.</p>
              <p>When the
              cameraman finally met up with them, he said, "I was napping in the car
              when I had a nightmare. I dreamt of a security guard strangling me!"
              Dennis and the director stared at each other, speechless. "Perhaps it
              was because the group of us was noisy and not respecting them; they
              didn't like it, so" Dennis says.</p>
              <p>Postscript</p>
              <p>"Actually they (ghosts) are everywhere; morning and night."</p>
              <p>This
              interview was done in broad daylight but the above sentence turned the
              entire atmosphere cold. Dennis usually narrates ghost stories on
              weekend nights over the radio waves; the lack of facial expressions and
              actions seem to have downplayed the scare factor. The entire interview
              session face-to-face made hairs stand, but was hilarious too.</p>
              <p>"We suspect that the cameraman is a virgin, pure and innocent; that's why he was undisturbed," Dennis laughs.</p>
              <p>It is Dennis's distinctive flavor to inject humor into ghost stories and lighten the cold atmosphere with laughter.</p>
              <p>He has also recently released a collection of ghost stories on compact discs.</p>
