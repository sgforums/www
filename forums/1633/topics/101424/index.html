            <div class='col-md body'>Jacques Santini has quit as coach of Tottenham Hotspur.<br><br>The former France coach has left White Hart Lane because of personal reasons, after just five months and 13 matches in charge.<br><br><img src="http://www.soccernet.com/images/ph.1/Santini_PC.jpg"><br><span style="color: cyan;">Santini: Returning to France<br>(PhilCole/GettyImages)</span><br><br>His decision to quit is a massive blow to Spurs, who had begun the Barclays Premiership season well - albeit with a scarcity of goals - under the Frenchman.<br><br>Assistant coach Martin Jol will take charge of the team for tomorrow's match at home to Charlton, and Spurs will make no further statement on the situation until Monday.<br><br>Santini said: 'My time at Tottenham has been memorable, and it is with deep regret that I take my leave.<br><br>'Private issues in my personal life have arisen which caused my decision. I have therefore requested to return to France.<br><br>'I very much hope that the wonderful fans will respect my decision. I should like to thank (sporting director) Frank Arnesen and (chairman) Daniel Levy for their understanding. I wish the club and the supporters all the best for the season.'<br><br>Arnesen has voiced the club's disappointment at Santini's decision but wished him well.<br><br>Arnesen said: 'We are obviously disappointed that Jacques is leaving us. We fully respect his decision.<br><br>'I can assure you that the club will act swiftly to minimise the impact of Jacques' departure. Our priority is to ensure that this season's performance remains unaffected by this move.<br><br>'I shall make a further statement on Monday, clarifying our position. We wish Jacques well.'<br><br>After a long search following the decision to sack Glenn Hoddle last season, Spurs appointed Santini in July.<br><br>He helped Spurs to a fine start, but they have slipped down the Premiership table to 11th in recent weeks.<br><br>Former Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt does not believe the club will be seriously affected by Santini's departure because Jol and Arnesen are still in place.<br><br>However, he does foresee continuing problems if Spurs cannot improve on their goalscoring record of six goals in 11 league games.<br><br>Mabbutt told Five Live: 'I don't think it'll be a huge problem because he hasn't been there that long.<br><br>'As far as the club's concerned, they brought in the management team of Jacques Santini, Martin Jol and Frank Arnesen to work together so it'll be interesting to see if they bring anyone else in.<br><br>'The team has worked very hard defensively but if you look at the games, the fans would say that going forward we've been lacking.'<br><br>Earlier this season Santini revealed he was working so hard he was still living out of a suitcase.<br><br>He said: 'I am always working and I don't have Sky or anything in the hotel. I am disappointed because I have no time for the Olympic Games - can you tell me who won the 200 metres?<br><br>'I only know the football results from the Premiership on Wednesday. I finish the day at 10pm or 11pm and I start at 7am. This is all Tottenham.<br><br>'My wife and I do not have an apartment after two months here. We are still in a hotel, because I've not had the time to look for a house.<br><br>'Even after meeting the press I've got a meeting with my assistant coaches, then there is training, then a meeting with my advisers about my national insurance. I'm far too busy to watch television.'<br><br>Former Tottenham director of football David Pleat, who stepped down before Santini's appointment, urged the fans not to panic.<br><br>He told Five Live: 'People should not over-react, they'll find someone quick and hopefully they will have a good season. They have some very good players there.'<br><br>- from <a href="http://www.soccernet.com" rel="nofollow">Soccernet.com</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Santini has been enduring a difficult relationship with the board. Namely Frank Arnesen.<br><br>Its a blow to Spurs, to lose any manager so early in the season. I wonder who will step in to take charge. There are several qualified candidates available at the moment. Bobby Robson? Gerard Houllier? Gordan Strachan?<br><br></div>
