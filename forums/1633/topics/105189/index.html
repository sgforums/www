            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie To Stick With Young Guns</strong><br><br>Giuseppe Rossi In With Starting Chance<br><br>"Rossi comes into the picture [against Arsenal]. We've been really impressed with him."<br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is pondering starting United youngsters Giuseppe Rossi and Chris Eagles in United's Carling Cup clash with Arsenal on Wednesday night.<br><br>The Reds boss confirmed to reporters he will field a similar side to the one deployed against Crystal Palace in the last round of the competition, adding that both young forward Rossi and midfielder Eagles have a chance of making the starting eleven.<br><br>"I will play the same squad as against Crystal Palace, albeit with Louis Saha not involved," confirmed the boss. "Young Giuseppe Rossi comes into the picture, as does Chris Eagles.<br><br>"Rossi is one we would like to include," said Ferguson. "He has impressed us with the games he has played since he arrived at the club from Italy. Rossi, Gerard Pique and Floribert N'Galula have been absolutely fantastic. WeÂ’re very pleased with them.<br><br>"You always learn about your players in these matches. It is an area where you can test the players; test their character, their temperament and their ability to play at the top level. ItÂ’s a great moment for all the young players here."<br><br>There has been a buzz around the club and among supporters about RossiÂ’s performances in the reserves this season. Chris Eagles has also been receiving positive reviews for his displays for UnitedÂ’s second string.<br><br>"Young Giuseppe Rossi comes into the picture. He has impressed us since he arrived at the club from Italy."<br>Sir Alex Ferguson<br><br>Rossi, a 17-year-old summer signing from Serie A side Parma, does not turn 18 until February but has earned himself a place in the managerÂ’s plans for the quarter final clash with Arsenal.<br><br>And it may be the ideal time to include the younger players in the squad. A run of seven matches unbeaten in November will have doubtless filtered down through the squad and is a far better environment for the young players to gain first-team experience.<br><br>"YouÂ’re seeing the return of confidence," remarked Sir Alex ahead of the game. "There is no doubt that has played a part. With the return of confidence you see the results we are getting now."<br><br>The Reds boss expects his opposite number at Arsenal, Arsene Wenger, to stick to his policy of using young players in the competition when he brings his team to Old Trafford.<br><br>"It's really good to see the young players getting a chance. It's a fantastic opportunity to show the manager they are good enough."<br>Rio Ferdinand<br><br>"I think he will keep to his promise," Sir Alex said. "I only know of one or two of their young players. They have got some good, impressive results against Everton and Manchester City.<br><br>"It will be a game of high quality and I am looking forward to it. ItÂ’s the quarter final of the league cup, so you expect it to be a competitive game.<br><br>"It doesnÂ’t matter who you play against or what game it is. On Tuesday night there is Fulham-Chelsea and Watford-Portsmouth, on Wednesday there is Tottenham-Liverpool. You have a chance of getting to the semi final and everyone wants to get there.<br><br>"I think whoever wins our game has a great chance of reaching the final," he added.</div>

We are very pleased with him," Ferguson said of the teenager who joined United from Parma in the summer.<br><br>Rossi could find himself in opposition to another 17-year-old former Parma striker, Arturo Lupoli, who scored twice against Everton in the previous round.
