I think the player's power in the dressing room is a bit too much. I recalled that Camacho was Real's coach in 1998 (I think) but only lasted like 23 days cos he was not given full control of the team selction, transfers..etc.<br><br>As usual.... Wenger is tightly linked as Real's next coach. Thing is... he hasn't sign a new contract at Highbury as yet and it ends at this Season. </div></blockquote>I think it's jus some contractual clauses being sorted out, he gambled with Viera n came out the winner. They have a new stadium soon, nope of his top players r leaving, he unearthed a gem of a player in Reyes n brought through a few like Fabregas, Glichy, Toure. Got rid of dead weights like Kanu, Wiltord. Tell me who in their right mind will walk away from all these? If he did managed 2 win the European Cup with Arsenal, then it might b a different story. With resources soon 2b at his disposal, albeit a few years 2 go. A stable core group of players he built, won't he like 2 see it thru? At the very least getting his hand on the European Cup is concerned.<br><br>Camacho was never gonna stay with his hardliner stance n traditional method. Look wat he did to the Spanish national team... If a new coach came into any new side n prove that his methods work. The player will grudgingly have 2 repect him 4 that.<br><br>Chelsea was one such example, Mourinho brought confidence n better organisation 2 the club, they were not an attacking team, so his job was made much easier, when Chelsea start becoming like England or the Arsenal of 80s, winning by 1 goal or else remaining unbeaten.<br><br>Juve is another where Capello brought in Zebina from Roma, Cannavaro from Inter. He knows his attacking flair is there with Nedved, Trezeguet n Del Piero. As an additional safeguard, he went n got hold of Ibrahamovic from Ajax. With Buffon, Thuram n Cannavaro as his defensive rock. The team has the confidence 2 sweep forward n attack with ease, sweet pressure of how 2 pierce the opponents' defence instead of worrying abt the defence letting in goals.<br><br>Real is an attacking team who thrives when going 4ward, regardless of the criticism that Carlos got last season. Real still looks like scoring every match they play last season. This season is a disaster where attacking is concerned, n the new recruit Walter Samuel is looking a dud in defence. With Camacho playing defensive n upsetting the players, how can he not get the sack? Well at least he did resign 1st...</div>
