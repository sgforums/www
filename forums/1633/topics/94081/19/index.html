Technically, Morientes ain't that bad too.

Jaoquin would be another excellent import but with Liverpool's financial ability he is out of reach man. Even if Jaoquin wants to come to Liverpool, the release fee stamped by Real Betis would cost them at least 2 players plus top-up in exchange.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

In a midfield center consisting of Aimar(hopefully), Alonso n Gerard. They will outpass their opponents with minimum need to tackles.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Also employing Alonso in front of the back 4 will enable him to launch his precise, crossfield passes to the wide players when possession is won back. He was quite adept at this role while at Real Sociedad. Not saying that he isn't a playmaker, but if they really land Aimar, he will b more of a backup.</div>

That's why i think both will take at least a season or 2 to handle themselves well at least on the physical side. (Well Alonso is out 4 6 wks after the strong tackle from Lampard). Aimar also missed most of last season with injuries. So they r both dodgy when against tight n rough treatment by opposition. So it might not b Benitez's wish if Aimar is kept on the bench due to injury rather than choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Garcia's a bit lightweight for my liking, perhaps that's why Barca let him go, it's true he's versatile n get into good position, But his decision making n coolness under pressure are suspect. He could have bag a goal against Chelsea but balloon instead of being on target. Against Norwich, he was non existent bside the goal. As a collegue commented, "for a guy with such a huge price tag, his performance to-date is not comparable to Joe Cole's 15 mins on field". He shld b an impact player but sadly that's not the case, whereas Traore n Riise are making a bigger impact than him in recent weeks.<br></div>
