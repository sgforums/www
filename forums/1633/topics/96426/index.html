            <div class='col-md body'>Sven: Beckham to stay England captain<br><br>Sven-Goran Eriksson has reaffirmed that David Beckham will remain England captain.<br><br>Beckham: Facing Real friendly (MikeEgerton/Empics)<br><br>Reports this morning suggested Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand could lead his country 'in the future'.<br><br>But Eriksson said that Real Madrid midfielder Beckham will carry on as England's captain on the pitch.<br><br>He said: 'I have no intention of changing the captain - not today, tomorrow, not even the day after.<br><br>'There is no reason why I should do it.'<br><br>Eriksson also confirmed his backing for striker Michael Owen, whose role as his country's number one front man is under threat as he struggles to win a place in the Real Madrid team.<br><br>The Swede said: 'I haven't talked recently to Michael. I hope he will take part in Real's game tonight [against Deportivo La Coruna]. Then we will have three strikers - (Wayne) Rooney, (Jermain) Defoe and Owen.'<br><br>However, Eriksson admits he could find it difficult to select the former Liverpool striker if he never plays for Real.<br><br>He said: 'Owen said he was concerned, and I as his manager am concerned as well. It is the beginning of the season, so I hope he will have a lot of chances to play.<br><br>'I will talk to him, see how he trains, see his form. Michael Owen is a big goalscorer for England, as he was for Liverpool.<br><br>'If he never plays football then it is difficult to keep a place in the England team - but I still believe he will play a lot for Real Madrid.'<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Base on this report, i think Eriksson practice favourism. I hope he goes! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>
