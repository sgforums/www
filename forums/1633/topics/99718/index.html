            <div class='col-md body'>Poor Arsenal... they lost not becos they played the match poorly, but due to referee Mike Riley..<br><br>Met a frenz who is a Man Utd fan and he thght the same way... The 3 most obvious cases...<br><br>1. Tackles from G. Neville toward Reyes.. man, Nevilla should be awarded more than 1 yellow cards for his tackles.. plus other players' tackles.. i almost thght I watching WWW on soccer field..<br><br>2. Rio denying Ljungberg 1 on 1 chance.. Rio should have given a yellow card and a free kick to Arsenal.. but what the hell referee thinking? Or he need to go for eyesight checkup... Not blaming Rio as he done his best for his role, but the referee failed his role..<br><br>3. Penalty kick.. <span style="font-style: italic;">This referee Riley has a history of awarding penalties for the Old Trafford side, including two in one game against Liverpool a couple of seasons ago. (soccernet)</span> Damn.. my frenz dun think it should be a penalty even he was a fan and bet on Man Utd... Eventually, this wrongly given penalty lead to 2nd goal as Arsenal go all out wanting to fight back... A mistaken given turnkey point by the lamer referee...<br><br>TMD... Man Utd had to rely on the 13 player cum referee on the pitch to win the match, show that they are really gone with the days of a fearsome team... although Arsenal lost this match, they are much more better than Man Utd in many ways...<br><br>Perhap only one thing not up to Man Utd standard, acting in the box....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Van pleads not guilty to attack</strong></span></span><br><br>Ruud van Nistelrooy says he is innocent of charges he tried deliberately to hurt Arsenal full-back Ashley Cole during Manchester United's controversial 2-0 win at Old Trafford on Sunday.<br><br>The Dutch international has been charged with serious foul play by the Football Association for kicking the England defender on the knee and could face a three-match ban.<br><br>However, van Nistelrooy told The Sun: "We both just went for the ball. It was a 50-50 ball and in these situations two players can collide."<br><br>Under the FA's new fast-track disciplinary system, his case will be dealt with on Thursday.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy's challenge, missed by referee Mike Riley, was branded 'a disgrace' by BBC TV pundit and former Liverpool defender Alan Hansen, who claimed the forward's actions were 'nasty and cynical'.<br><br>They also brought a 'cheat' jibe from Arsene Wenger which is thought to have played some part in a tunnel fracas that erupted after the game that ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten run.<br><br>"We know how Ruud van Nistelrooy behaves," said Wenger. "He can only cheat people - we know him very well."<br><br>Wenger has been asked by the FA to explain those comments while van Nistelrooy has to answer the charge for serious foul play by Tuesday.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy has however admitted to having doubts over his penalty which put United ahead.<br><br>Wayne Rooney went down after colliding with Sol Campbell but television replays later suggested there had been minimal contact.<br><br>"At first sight I thought it was a penalty," said van Nistelrooy. "I can understand why the referee gave it because of the angle he was looking from. But afterwards, when I saw it on television, I had doubts."<br><br>Arsenal striker Jose Reyes has also hit out at Manchester United's tough tackling.<br><br>"In all my sporting life I have never received so many kicks as in Manchester," said Reyes.<br><br>"It was the hardest match I have played in England and the referee should have stopped the violence of the Manchester United players.<br><br>"I received more blows in that match than I have ever done in the Spanish League and I finished on the ground covered in bruises."<br><br>Reyes also took a swipe at Rooney, accusing the England striker of diving to secure the penalty which helped van Nistelrooy put United ahead.<br><br>"The referee made so many mistakes and didn't perform well," added Reyes. "The penalty should not have been given - but now we all know what a good actor Wayne Rooney is in the penalty area."<br><br>However, Reyes insists the Gunners will not sulk for too long and has vowed to gain revenge over United both in the return fixture at Highbury and in the race for the title.<br><br>"I already have a big desire to play the return match in London. We want to give back the defeat to them and by more goals," he said.<br><br>"Everybody is still OK. The record was nice, but losing it won't prove decisive for the championship."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/041026/1/3o0tx.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo News</a>)</div>

Meanwhile their three-man panel will still review Thursday van Nistelrooy's challenge.<br><br>However, their verdict appears all but academic as United have publicly stated they expect the Dutch forward to serve a three-game ban.<br><br>That suspension could start with Tuesday's League Cup third-round tie at Crewe. If not, the ban will begin with Saturday's Premiership trip to Portsmouth, which is followed by the Old Trafford encounter with Manchester City on November 7.<br><br>The potential third match of the suspension would then either be a League Cup fourth-round tie or - if United fail to beat Crewe at Gresty Road on Tuesday - the high-profile trip to Newcastle on November 14.<br><br>"Ruud van Nistelrooy has decided to accept the FA's charge of misconduct relating to the incident with Ashley Cole," said a United statement.<br><br>"Ruud has accepted the automatic penalty of a three-match suspension, and Manchester United fully supports Ruud's decision."<br><br>Van Nistelrooy said: "Throughout my 10-year career I believe my disciplinary record is very good, not only for Manchester United but at all my previous clubs," he said.<br><br>"I accept the charge brought by the FA and I take full responsibility for this incident," added the striker who scored the first of United's two goals, a 73rd minute penalty, against Arsenal.<br><br>"However, there was no deliberate intent to harm Ashley Cole and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to him."<br><br>(source: <a href="http://sg.sports.yahoo.com/041026/1/3o13x.html" rel="nofollow">Yahoo News</a>)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My, the Old Trafford food fight has thrown up a list of suspects who were responsible for throwing food at Fergie, with hilarious results. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><strong>Papers: Man U boss pelted with food</strong><br><br>BY CHOI TUCK WO<br><br>Newspaper in Briain are agog with stories of the Man Utd manager being pelted with food while Wenger lets rip after Man Utd won the historic showdown on Sunday.<br>LONDON: So, was it pizza, sandwich, French onion soup or even a piece of flying beef?<br><br>The hunt is on for the mystery Old Trafford chucker even as an extensive cover-up by Arsenal and Manchester United is underway to avoid a full-scale probe by the police and the Football Association (FA).<br><br>According to The Times, the controversy took another twist when the post-match rumpus that saw Sir Alex Ferguson pelted with soup and pizza by an Arsenal player took place in full view of Greater Manchester Police officers.<br><br>The paper quoted sources as confirming that police stationed inside the tunnel to guard against a flare-up witnessed the attack on the United manager, which came seconds after he was involved in a slanging match with his Arsenal counterpart, Arsene Wenger.<br><br>Ferguson was asked whether he intended to press charges but declined, said the paper.<br><br>The FA, according to the paper, had announced that it was Â“looking into reports of an alleged incident in the tunnel after the match.<br><br>Â“But with no camera footage available and no individual from either club willing to go on record about what happened, it has no hard evidence on which to base its investigation.<br><br>Â“The FA would be prepared to listen to evidence from independent witnesses, such as the police, but no such evidence had been offered or sought,Â” it added.<br><br>The paper said the post-match episode marked a nadir in the hostile relations between United and Arsenal in recent seasons.<br><br>But the clubs do at least appear to have agreed upon a pact of silence about what took place.<br><br>UnitedÂ’s players, it added, were sworn to secrecy, although Old Trafford officials were angered by a couple of minor leaks from the Highbury end.<br><br>According to The Sun, Ferguson was pelted with pizza, soup and sandwiches while Gunners boss Wenger yelled abuse at Fergie, branded United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy a cheat and ripped into Wayne Rooney.<br><br>In its front-page headline, Â“War and PizzaÂ”, the paper reported that all hell broke loose as tempers exploded in the tunnel after the match.<br><br>Â“Van Nistelrooy, who scored a disputed penalty, lit the fuse by tapping Wenger on the arm and making a comment.<br><br>Â“Wenger then turned on Fergie and started screaming and finger-prodding him,Â” a United insider told the paper.<br><br>Â“He also gave Rooney a character assassination, yelling all the time. Fergie looked shocked as no one had ever seen Wenger lose it like this.<br><br>Â“ThatÂ’s when food was hurled from the Arsenal dressing room. FergieÂ’s shirt and blazer were covered in soup and pizza Â– and all the time Wenger was still ranting at him,Â” it said.<br><br>Eventually, the United security staff bundled off the Arsenal group while the United players waited in their dressing room until their rivals had left.<br><br>In its special report, the Evening Standard launched a hunt for the mystery chucker although initial reports indicated it was not soup but a sandwich thrown by accident.<br><br>The paper provided five suspects:<br><br>Â·SOL CAMPBELL Â– suspicion immediately falls on him because he shares a surname with the soup manufacturer. And his blood would have been brought to a boil following the penalty awarded for his mistimed tackle on Rooney.<br><br>Â·JENS LEHMANN Â– He might have mistaken Fergie for Oliver Kahn, his sworn enemy and rival for the national goalkeeperÂ’s jersey. Would have been antagonised by the penalty awarded to Rooney Â– which van Nistelrooy slotted effortlessly past him.<br><br>Â·THIERRY HENRY Â– Frustrated by a rare lacklustre performance and whispers that he fails to rise on big occasions. But Henry is the king of cool and lobbing pea (or tomato) soup at Fergie is not his style. Would obviously have preferred French onion.<br><br>Â·PATRICK VIEIRA Â– Sizzling with indignation following the end of his clubÂ’s unbeaten run, the French midfielder might have felt it necessary to let Fergie and United know what type of reception to expect when they come to London in February.<br><br>Â·GABRIEL HEINZE Â– With a surname like that, he cannot be ignored. As a newcomer to Old Trafford, the Argentine might have thought it was traditional to mark a famous victory by anointing his manager.</blockquote>Source: The Star Online, 27/10/04 (courtesy of IK)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I Don't support Arsenal and ManU. But while watching the match, I already think that this referee is either bad or kelong. ManU players make so many rough tackles. Btw, Rio make a bad tackle on Junberg, but junberg also kick the ball a bit too far.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If I don't consider my alliance towards Spurs.<br><br>I'll call this fair and equal since Arsenal was rioting the last time at OT.<br><br>An eye for an eye.<br><br>We shouldn't look at how Mike Riley handled the match. It was horribly hard for such a toughly-contested match.<br><br>Arsenal had no chances of beating Man U at OT from the way they played. If you're a soccer player. You got to stand up and keep running even if you had been tacked badly since tackling is part of the game.<br><br>As for Rooney. He did not press for penalty claims when he fell. I don't think it's right to call him a cheat.<br><br>RvN may have kicked the shin of Ashley Cole, but from the way I looked at it, This isn't the first time he mistimed his tackling. RVN SIMPLY SUCKED AT STEALING BALLS. If I wanted to kick at someone, I'll BREAK the person totally. It's not like Ashley Cole himself isn't guilty of mistimed tackling too.<br><br>My personal views. Arsene Wenger is a sore loser. Screaming cheats and things like rough when their players did the same to RvN last season. Ferguson isn't any better. Someone should gut his neck so they can keep the scotch bas**** silent.<br><br>And even if Rio Ferdinand got yellow at Fredi, it's not a guaranteed goal anyway.<br><br>Talking about running away from yellows. Shame on Ashley Cole. If there's one person who escapes yellow, he is the one. Oftenly trying to overlap and forced to tackle from the back, a straight red.<br><br>Wenger shouldn't complain abt Man U not playing football. TACKLING is part of football. If he wants to see players untouched, he should be the manager of a netball team.</div>
