            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BIG-MATCH FACTS<br><br>MANCHESTER UNITED</strong> are unlikely to feel too generous to the less well off this Christmas, when fourth bottom Crystal Palace visit the Red devils, who are fourth top. Indeed, while victory will see Sir Alex Ferguson take closer order on the top three, they cannot climb any higher before the festive break. Going into this game United have won exactly 300 matches and scored 950 goals in Premier League history.<br><br>The eight times champions were on course for a fifth successive Premiership victory when Pape Bouba Diop equalised for Fulham with three minutes remaining at Craven Cottage on Monday. But United have only been beaten once in the League since their opening fixture. They've undefeated in any competition at home, have gone six Premiership matches without a loss and have picked up 14 points from the last 18 available, rising from seventh in early November to a top four berth now. However they're still nine points off the pace, and four points behind champions Arsenal.<br><br>United have only dropped two points in six Premiership meetings with Crystal Palace. They have won three times as many League games as they have lost against the south London club (18 to six), and hold a 100% home Premiership record against them.<br><br><strong>CRYSTAL PALACE</strong> have been slipping steadily while United have been moving in the opposite direction. Indeed the form of Iain Dowie's side is the antithesis of the Red devils. The Eagles have not won in six Premiership games, claiming just three points from the 18.<br><br>The Londoners visit the Theatre of Dreams hovering above the drop zone on goal difference. They've won just three Premiership matches under Dowie, and finished all square five times. Another draw here will bring their all-time total of top flight stalemates to 150.<br><br>The Eagles have lost all five previous League visits to Old Trafford without scoring a single goal. They have only won twice in 15 visists in their entire history. The most recent of those was 1-2 in the top flight on 9 December 1989.</div>

But FergieÂ’s success has not been built on whimsical dreams of coming encounters. UnitedÂ’s ability to see off the smaller teams has always been their hallmark and a driving force behind their success. Their inability to do this in recent times, particularly on Monday night against Fulham has seen their aura eroded somewhat. So a return to their roots in very much the order of the day on Saturday.<br><br>Crystal Palace will travel in hope but not without a little expectation. Their Carling Cup defeat at the same ground earlier this season will have no baring, that was reserves against reserves. This is something entirely different.<br><br>Palace have begun to stutter, but have shown already that they can match it with the bigger teams. A narrow loss to Chelsea and a creditable draw with Arsenal have displayed their fighting spirit, but those both came at home. This is their first away day at one of the big three, and coming before the television cameras, could be an important psychological moment of the season.<br><br>Christmas with its abundance of games is very close now. So a heavy defeat now gives a team little chance to recover before the festive programme that can make or break a season.<br><br>Dowie, one of the brightest managers in the game, is about to be tested. He will need to rise to the challenge, drain every last drop of energy, of fight from his team and send them out on to the field of play.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Fergie Admits To Fulham Hammer Blow</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson admits FulhamÂ’s late goal on Monday night was a crushing blow to UnitedÂ’s title hopes Â– but has been pleased by his playersÂ’ subsequent reaction.<br><br>Pape Bouba DiopÂ’s 87th-minute strike scuppered UnitedÂ’s chances of closing the gap on Chelsea at the top of the Premiership to seven points, and was a hammer blow for Ferguson.<br><br>Â”Monday night Â– I still canÂ’t get over it,Â” he told Manchester United Radio. "It was one of these gutting experiences that you hope you donÂ’t get very often. But when you do get it, it lasts for a long time.<br><br>"The only thing I can console myself with is that we played so well and made so many chances that there is nothing wrong with the form. But to lose that goal right at the death was a real kick in the teeth to us.Â”<br><br>However, the midweek reaction from his players has been one of responsibility, a sign that has given Ferguson hope.<br><br>"I donÂ’t think it will affect our confidence, but it can affect the result of the league Â– and the players know that.<br><br>"I wasnÂ’t at training on Wednesday, but Carlos Queiroz told me there was a deep sense of disappointment running right through the team. I think they all felt responsible. And thatÂ’s not a bad thing.<br><br>"If you see that reaction, it is good. Too often in the game these days, too many players abstain from responsibility; their patch is clear. But Carlos was telling me that there was a deep sense of responsibility among all the players.<br><br>"It will only be proved in the next few weeks if the players have that determination to put it right."<br><br>FergusonÂ’s right-hand man has seen at close hand the mood among UnitedÂ’s players, and says there is a mental toughness among the squad that can carry the team through a hectic festive schedule that sees the Reds play a game every three days.<br><br>"The schedule is tough, but so are we," he said. "We are well prepared going into the New Year. We have a very difficult schedule coming up. But we have everything under control Â– the preparation is fantastic.<br><br>"The best teams will take advantage from this period; we believe we can do that."<br><br>And the Reds assistant refuses to see the draw at Craven Cottage, which leaves United nine points adrift of Chelsea, as a backwards step.<br><br>"I wouldn't say it was a step back," Carlos added. "I would say that we feel disappointed and frustrated, especially because we believe we performed well.<br><br>"The players did the right things most of the time. But there are things in football you cannot control - like luck.<br><br>"I feel more comfortable if we play well, create opportunities but drop points once in a while, than doing the opposite: not performing and winning games 1-0.<br><br>"We have to believe we are doing the right things. We have to believe that, if we  perform against other teams like we did against Fulham, we will score three or four goals.<br><br>"We just have to be cool, rational and take the right approach. We are not perfect. We cannot say that our performances are always perfect. But we were happy with how we performed against Fulham."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Reds Enter Crucial Festive Period</strong><br><br>The next couple of weeks could well prove crucial as United continue their pursuit of the teams currently above them in the Premiership table.<br><br>The rush of games over the Christmas holiday has always been a testing time of the season and this year itÂ’s going to be even more important that usual for United.<br><br>Success in all four of those fixtures, Crystal Palace, Bolton Wanderers (both home), Aston Villa and Middlesbrough (both away) would surely thrust United right back into the maelstrom of the title.<br><br>That, needless to say, is a good deal easier said than done considering that all of the above mentioned teams are more than capable of giving any team a run for their money. Furthermore, they are all managed by one of the gameÂ’s new breed of young, and already hugely respected, managers.<br><br>McClaren, Allardyce, OÂ’Leary and Dowie may not have the experience of Sir Alex Ferguson, but the RedsÂ’ boss would be the first to acknowledge that any side selected and sent out by all of those named demands respect.<br><br>Iain DowieÂ’s Palace havenÂ’t exactly set the Premiership alight since they graduated from the first division in the summer, but they are nevertheless a team that is always capable of springing a shock result.<br><br>Having said that, their away record to date doesnÂ’t really add weight to the assumption that they are going to cause a major surprise at Old Trafford.<br><br>To date they have completed eight away Premiership fixtures winning just the one against Steve BruceÂ’s Birmingham City. Three others (Norwich City, Aston Villa and Southampton) ended with the points being shared but the came away from Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, Bolton Wanderers and Liverpool empty-handed.<br><br>The Eagles are currently hovering just above the feared drop-zone in the table, so victories from now on are the order of the day for DowieÂ’s men.<br><br>They were, of course, at Old Trafford on Carling Cup duty a few weeks ago, but that contest, which United won comfortably 2-0, cannot be used as any kind of guide ahead of this latest meeting between the clubs.<br><br>Both sides were well below their full strength that night in what turned out to be a pretty painless passage through to that last eight for United.<br><br>Both United and Palace, for vastly contrasting reasons, are in desperate need of the points on offer this weekend. United to kick-start their assault on the top places following the blip at Fulham last Monday and Palace to ease the anxiety of their lowly position as the holiday rush kicks in.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Man Utd vs Crystal Palace</strong><br><br>Sir Alex Ferguson is willing to write Ruud van Nistelrooy out of Manchester United's Premiership title push for the next two months to ensure he is ready for their assault on Europe.<br><br>Van Nistelrooy has been sent for a scan on the calf problem which first surfaced six weeks ago and has kept the Dutch striker sidelined for the last five games.<br><br>Despite the rest, Ferguson is no nearer learning the extent of the injury and is fearful of causing further damage which may affect Van Nistelrooy's Achilles.<br><br>And though his side's title ambitions are hanging by a thread following Monday's 1-1 draw at Fulham, Ferguson is looking towards the mouth-watering Champions League clash with six-time champions AC Milan in February as the time he really wants Van Nistelrooy available.<br><br>"Ruud's injury has not cleared up," admitted Ferguson. "There is a bit of concern because he is the best striker in the business and we want him back, particularly with the European campaign coming.<br><br>"Hopefully, we will have a better idea once he has seen the specialist because at the moment we just don't know and that is concerning."<br><br>With Van Nistelrooy in the side this season, United have won seven of their nine Premiership matches. Without him their record is just two wins from eight.<br><br>The 28-year-old's contribution in Europe is even more startling, with 36 goals in 37 European appearances.<br><br>But, while his presence will be required if United are to stand any chance of finding a way past Jaap Stam and Paulo Maldini, Ferguson is more than happy to let seven-goal Alan Smith lead the line against Crystal Palace.<br><br>Ferguson was thrilled by Smith's effort at Craven Cottage, including the tackle on Sylvain Legwinski which set up his goal.<br><br>And although the former Leeds man has picked up a foot injury in training, he should be fit to face Iain Dowie's men.<br><br>"Alan has been a real hero for us," said Ferguson. "Only the old fashioned type of forward gets that kind of goal. Forwards like Thierry Henry, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo can manufacture goals by beating men - but there are very few who can create one with a tackle like that.<br><br>"I can't be speak more highly of him for what he has done and he won't be phased by having to lead the line."<br><br>With Gabriel Heinze and Cristiano Ronaldo handed a long-awaited break, Ferguson is committed to making changes, with John O'Shea and Darren Fletcher favourites to fill the vacancies. Kleberson (ankle) and Louis Saha (knee) are definitely out.<br><br>Dowie accepts his Crystal Palace players must show United the "ultimate respect," but maintains they will not be in awe of their star-studded opponents.<br><br>For Eagles fans, trips to such venues as Old Trafford are what they have been dreaming about since their six-year exile from the top flight came to an end last season.<br><br>However, with his side now struggling to keep out of the relegation zone following a winless run of six Barclays Premiership matches, Dowie is determined to keep the players focused on getting what would be an unlikely positive result rather than just enjoying the occasion.<br><br>"What you have got to do is pay people the ultimate respect," the Palace manager said.<br><br>"We hope at our football club we are a very respectful team - we won't be talking out of turn about other teams or managers, that is not what we do.<br><br>"In the end, it is 11 against 11. They are individuals, people - whether they are better than us at football is for other people to judge."<br><br>Dowie may stick with a lone striker role for Andy Johnson and pack the midfield, despite Palace having drawn blanks in their last two outings.<br><br>Wayne Andrews, though, is one attacking option open to Dowie having shrugged off the flu following an impressive debut against Blackburn<br><br>With the games coming thick-and-fast over the next two weeks, Dowie admits being able to keep out of the relegation zone come the turn of the year would give everyone at the club a lift.<br><br>He reflected: "It is an important boost. We need to push on, we have got to make sure that whatever curve ball the season throws us, we are able to deal with that."<br><br>Uruguayan defender Gonzalo Sorondo came through his run-out for the second string unscathed and is likely to be in the squad following a lengthy absence with a hamstring injury.<br><br>Tommy Black, however, is set for several weeks on the sidelines after breaking his leg during a reserve game against Arsenal.</div>
