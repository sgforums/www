The leaders might change god knows how many time from now till Jan. Well if the likes of the above 3 teams can maintain their charge, it b a flash in the pan 4 their appearances in the EPL 4 one season.<br><br>Seriously of the 3 promoted teams, Norwich, Palace n WBA, who has the likeliest chance of staying up? The answer is not a chance. When push come 2 shove, they definitely lack that extra quality 2 kill a game off n held on 2 the lead n the points.<br><br>Palace has a dodgy keeper, n I still dun't understand how Andy Johnson can keep scoring n doing well, but all power 2 him... but 4 all his hardwork, if the defence lets in goals easily, then his efforts r going down the drain. Case in point, the away game 2 Portsmouth. They equalise almost immediately after a Berger special but was ruled offside, then another chance goes a begging in a penalty kick missed. Portmouth storms upfield the other side n score thru the help of a Palace defender, Popovic. If my memory serves me correctly, that's his 3rd goal of the season, a record 4 any defenders but a dreaded one since THEY r all OWN GOALS!!!<br><br>Norwich lacks firepower, how serious can u b taken if u depends on Huckerby, famous abt  10 yrs ago n a defender-turned-striker in Gary Doherty that even Spurs let go? N in soccer, if u can't score, u can't win n 1 pt is not getting u out of the relegation quarmire.<br><br>WBA is jus so average. They r hard 2 break down, hardworking n like a Everton side without the classy players. Altho they have Kanu n managed a win over a deflated Bolton, who seems 2 hit the ground after lofty results against the big 3. Seriously, will u b afraid of a side containing 1 Kanu n how many goals can he get u in a match? Definitely a struggler.<br><br>This early in the league, only Blackburn n Southampton looks like candidates going 2b embroiled in relegation battle all season. But in cases like this, the key 2 avoiding relegation is the results of the strugglers against each other which will prove significant in the coming months.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah, they hav to grab all points where possible.<br>drawing with fellow relegation-favourites wun save your own asses...<br>wats impt is that you grab the 3 pts frm them, push urself up, and push them down.<br><br>sounds bad, but well, to survive in the premiership is definitely not easy.<br>when coming to big matches, dun concede plentiful of goals, you will nv know when the GD are so impt to keep you up... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
