Arsenal won 2-0.<br><br>Bennett said at the time that Jenas had used excessive force.<br><br>Newcastle manager Graeme Souness was so angry he refused to conduct any post-match interviews and also banned his players from doing so.<br><br>Bennett wrote to Newcastle on Monday to apologize for an "error of judgment."<br><br>Newcastle said in a statement: "He has requested that the Football Association downgrade the dismissal to a yellow card and this has been confirmed by the FA."<br><br>The FA said a disciplinary commission had agreed with Bennett's request to downgrade the red card to a caution.<br><br>"Fair play to the referee for having another look at the incident and making this decision," Souness said. "We have to be happy that he has made it.<br><br>"I said after the game that it was never a sending-off offence. There was no doubt in my mind that the tackle from JJ didn't deserve a red card."<br><br>Earlier Monday, Souness blamed himself for Jenas' sending off.<br><br>"I blame myself to be honest," Souness said. "About 10 seconds before the sending-off, I was standing on the touchline shouting to Jermaine to be stronger in the tackle.<br><br>"He was strong in the tackle, and that happens to him. He is very down about it, and he has every right to be because it was a wrong decision."<br><br>Souness, who has been punished in the past by the Football Association for criticizing referees, said he wasn't going to make the same mistake.<br><br>"If you speak your mind, you end up in trouble, so I'm not going to speak about him and the same goes for my players," Souness said.<br><br>Souness said the sending off changed the match<br><br>"I'm certain that with 11 men on the field we would have got something from the match," Souness said. "We defended well with 10 men, we were frustrating them, and I believed we were going to get something." - http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/2005/08/15/1174245-ap.html<br></div>
