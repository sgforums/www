            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Inter Â– Brescia </strong><br><br>Looking at InterÂ’s statistics, with just 3 wins and 12 draws, you would be safer betting on a draw for this encounter. However the Nerazzuri can and must win this match against relegation-battlers Brescia. ManciniÂ’s side is now definitely out of the title race but at least can still reach the third place. To do so Inter must win games, starting from SundayÂ’s encounter against De BiasiÂ’s Brescia.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Javier Zanetti most present Inter player in 2004  </strong><br><br>With 50 appearances for Inter in 2004, captain Javier Zanetti is Italian football's most present player this year. With one match to go, there is no catching El Tractor, who is also top of the list for the number of minutes played (4292).<br><br><strong>Adriano top scorer in 2004  </strong><br><br>2004 has been Adriano's year. With ninety minutes of the footballing year to go, the Brazilian is top of the Serie A scorers list and also that which includes all competitions. Since January Adriano has scored 24 league goals, the same as Gilardino and one more than Ballon d'Or winner Shevchenko. Including all competitive matches, Adriano has netted 34 times, two more than Shevchenko and Livorno's Cristiano Lucarelli.<br><br><strong>Vieri hot in December  </strong><br><br>According to the statistics, December is Christian Vieri's most prolific month. Of his 147 goals in the Serie A and B, Bobogol has scored 26 in the twelfth calendar month (19 in A and 7 in B). With goals against Messina and Siena this year, December is indeed a Vieri hot month for the Nerazzurri striker.<br><br><strong>Milestone appearances for C.Zanetti, Materazzi  </strong><br><br>If they play in Sunday's Lombardy derby, Cristiano Zanetti and Marco Materazzi will make their 100th appearances for Inter. Zanetti, who made his debut in Skonto Riga 1-3 Inter in the Champions League qualifying round on 26 August 1998, has played 69 matches in the Serie A, 4 in the Coppa Italia and 26 in Europe. Materazzi made his Nerazzurri debut in the 4-1 win at home to Perugia on 26 August 2001 and has played 67 league matches, 1 in the domestic cup and 31 in continental cup competitions.<br><br><strong>Inter unbeaten for 26 matches  </strong><br><br>Christian Vieri's late equaliser at Siena made sure Inter continue their long unbeaten run. The Nerazzurri have now gone 26 matches without defeat, their last zero-pointer the 2-1 loss to Lecce at the Via del Mare Stadium last 2 May. Since then Inter have recorded 11 victories and 15 draws in Serie A, Coppa Italia and Champions League matches.<br><br><strong>Brescia &amp; substitutions  </strong><br><br>Brescia are one of four Serie A sides who have used all 45 substitutions in the first 15 matches of the 2004/05 Serie A season. The other three are Lazio, Livorno and ChievoVerona.<br><br><strong>Brescia &amp; discipline  </strong><br><br>With 9 red cards in 2004/05, Brescia finished last season as the Serie AÂ’s most undisciplined team. And they're back on top of the bad boys table after 15 matches this season, with 5 sendings-off for De Biasi's Brescia. Zoboli has been sent marching twice, while Almeyda, Di Biagio and Nygaard have also seen red.<br><br><strong>Brescia 'records' in 2004  </strong><br><br>Lombardy derby opponents Brescia can 'boast' several Serie A records in 2004. Del Nero has come on as a substitute 22 times, more than any other Serie A player. With 11 red cards the Swallows are top of the sendings-off list, while Caracciolo is the one of the two most booked players with 11 yellow cards. Siena defender Cirillo is the other player.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Preview   </strong><br><br>Internazionale midfielder Dejan Stankovic believes the Nerazzurri's inability to convert draws into wins this season is down to a lack of concentration and communication.<br><br>Roberto Mancini's side - who take on struggling Brescia on Sunday - are the only team in Italy's professional ranks that has yet to lose this season, but an incredible 12 draws in 15 games has all but ruined their title chances with Juventus and AC Milan way ahead in the Scudetto race.<br><br>Mancini, nicknamed `Mr X' due to the team's large number of matches in the draw column, has often said luck deserted them, while striker Adriano has claimed the pressure for the club to win its first Serie A crown since the glorious 1988-89 season has weighed too heavily on them.<br><br>The latest excuse has come from Inter's Dejan Stankovic, the Serbo-Montenegrin midfielder. ``I think our main problem is lack of concentration at times,'' he said.<br><br>``We also lack, at times, communication which helps in the difficult moments of a game. Obviously the advantage that Juventus and AC Milan have burns us but we have to think about the present.<br><br>``They deserve to be in the top positions but let us not forget that neither have been able to beat us so far. We have to be the ones to change.''<br><br>The latest draw, a 2-2 result at Siena, truly irked owner Massimo Moratti. Inter had earned a point against Juventus, and followed that with a comprehensive victory over Messina, and Moratti thought his players were starting to build some momentum.<br><br>``We really should have won at Messina - period,'' Moratti said. ``We should have given a display of continuity considering what we had achieved in the previous two weeks, but this was not the case.<br><br>``Certainly the missed penalty by Adriano influenced the draw, but then again it's not as if he missed it.<br><br>``When you hit the post, it means you've been unlucky.'' The real problem for Inter is that the team have given away too many goals from set pieces. Free-kicks and corners have cost them 12 points.<br><br>``I'm really fed up,'' Moratti said. ``How can it be that you give away goals in dead-ball situations? They really need to find a solution to this problem.''<br><br>Fortunately for Inter, they are so good going forward with Adriano that the woeful defending has not put them in the lower part of the table.<br><br>If Inter believe they have been unlucky, Brescia have a right to feel even more aggrieved after last week's defeat against Roma left them fifth bottom.<br><br>Two minutes into injury time, Brescia defender Victor Maresco gave away a penalty after handling the ball.<br><br>Mancini, Roma's Brazilian midfielder, converted the spot-kick for the only goal of the match. Brescia boss Gigi De Biasi said: ``We still have an advantage over the teams in the relegation zone and I believe the fact that we have a team of new, and young players, that we would have accepted to be in this position at this point of the season.''<br><br>Inter winger Kily Gonzalez has already returned to Argentina for the Christmas break as he is still injured and unable to play while defender Giuseppe Favalli serves a one-match ban.<br><br>The good news for Brescia is the return of captain Luigi Di Biagio, who missed last weekend's game through injury.<br><br>Otherwise, Brescia are set to play with the same starting line-up that lost against Roma last weekend.</div>
