            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Preview</strong><br><br>MILAN, December 11 (Serie A) - Rui Costa admits he will show no sentiment on Sunday when his AC Milan side host Fiorentina, the team where he became one of the hottest properties in world football.<br><br>The Portuguese midfielder moved to the San Siro in 2001 as Fiorentina sought to offload their star players in a desperate and vain attempt to stave off the financial crisis that engulfed them a year later.<br><br>So highly thought of was Rui Costa when he played with Fiorentina that there was a constant debate in Italy as to whether he was better than Zinedine Zidane, then at Juventus, and whether he deserved the accolade of best playmaker in Italy.<br><br>Rui Costa admits he still has a strong affection for the Tuscany-based club.<br><br>He told www.acmilan.com: ``Every player who faces one of his previous teams feels emotional when he goes down that road again.<br><br>``A bit of emotion can be expected, I still have great respect for the Viola shirt, but now I play for the Rossoneri who have given much to me.<br><br>``The best memory I have of Florence is the way they said goodbye to me on the last day. If a whole city bids you such a farewell when you are leaving, then it means that you had a real and important relationship with them.<br><br>``Some people in Florence now back Milan because they are still fond of me. My respect for Florence has never ended. On Sunday, I expect the Viola fans just to greet me, nothing particularly special. Now they have to think about their team.''<br><br>Fiorentina ceased to exist when in the summer of 2002 the financial crisis reached its zenith only for the club to be relaunched as Florentia Viola in the fourth division.<br><br>They earned two promotions on the pitch but also were controversially awarded a special dispensation promotion to Serie B in 2003 by the Lega Calcio.<br><br>But they have performed solidly since returning to Serie A and since Sergio Buso replaced the sacked Emiliano Mondonico at the helm they have risen to eighth place in the Serie A table.<br><br>Milan are in second and only four points behind leaders Juventus and therefore little sentiment will be shown to Fiorentina on Sunday at the San Siro.<br><br>It has been a week to celebrate for AC Milan president Silvio Berlusconi, who also happens to be Italian prime minister, following his acquittal on bribery charges.<br><br>A win for the Italian champions on Sunday would be the perfect way to celebrate for the football-loving premier.<br><br>In the Fiorentina side will be veteran campaigner Angelo Di Livio who was part of the great Juve side of the late 1990s but became a legend in Florence for sticking with the club through all its troubles.<br><br>In June 2002 he was playing World Cup football for Italy before in July joining up with the newly relaunched Florentia Viola (since renamed Fiorentina) in Serie D.<br><br>At 38 Di Livio is now once more a Serie A footballer and he told www.fiorentina.it: ``I will change jerseys at the end with Rui Costa or (Paolo) Maldini.<br><br>``Milan are not playing as well as they did last year but they will be fighting it out with Juve for the title right to the end.''</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Serie A Preview: Milan-Fiorentina</strong><br><br>Possibly the most intriguing match in Italy this weekend will be when Fiorentina visits the San Siro to play Milan. These teams have been in good form as of late, as they both sit in the top half of the standings.<br><br><strong>BACKGROUND </strong><br><br>Milan is hot as can be, winning their last three Â…Serie A fixtures. Around this time last month, they defeated bottom-feeders Siena, 2-1 at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. Ukrainian striker Andriy Shevchenko started the scoring with a goal in the 25th minute. Stefano Argilli answered just six minutes later, but Â“ShevaÂ” was not to be outdone, and quickly restored the lead in the 37th to secure the home victory. The next match was a tough 1-0 road win over Chievo of Verona. The goal was supplied by Hernan Crespo, who finally got his first Serie A goal for Milan after jeers had started to come from even the rossoneri supporters. Last Sunday, Milan came on late to defeat struggling Parma 2-1 at the latterÂ’s Stadio Ennio Tardini. Italian wunderkind Alberto Gilardino grabbed the lead for Parma twenty minutes after the restart, but Kaka leveled a quarter of an hour later in the 82nd. The quintessential deep-lying playmaker, Andrea Pirlo, scored the game-winner for Milan in the 89th minute, and Parma were crushed.<br><br>Fiorentina has not quite had the better of the results, but have played very respectfully against some of the supposed Italian giants. On the first weekend of November, the viola played to a hard-fought 1-1 home draw versus Internazionale of Milan. Defender Dario Dainelli gave Fiorentina the lead in the 26th minute, but goal machine Adriano was able to salvage another draw for Inter. Three days later, they went down 1-0 at Serie A leaders Juventus on a second half goal by Ruben Olivera. That was followed by two further 1-1 draws, the first against Livorno at home, then away to Messina. Their most recent result was a home victory, by a 1-0 score line, over Bologna. Enzo Maresca has been credited with the goal, but striker Christian Rigano claims to have gotten an ever so slight touch to the ball before it went in the goal. Whoever did get the final touch gave his side three valuable points in the standings.</div>

We want to get a positive result ahead of the game with Juve.<br><br><strong>Will Rui play? </strong><br><br>It is possible, heÂ’s available.<br>It will be a particular day for ShevaÂ…<br>He didnÂ’t play for twenty games and just came back and itÂ’s not yet certain he has won the Golden Ball.<br><br><strong>Have you been thinking about Juve? </strong><br><br>ItÂ’s best to think as little as possible.<br><br><strong>How is the team at the moment? </strong><br><br>They are all fine apart from Serginho who had a problem yesterday but seems to be recovering.<br><br><strong>Who would you like to face in the Champions League? </strong><br><br>I have a side in mind but I am not saying Â…<br>You have been conceding goals from set-pieces once againÂ…<br>We have changed the line-up a lot, itÂ’s a problem of attention and maybe we need to improve that after having such a positive period.<br><br><strong>Juve are facing Bologna. Are they more diffuclt opponents than Fiorentina? </strong><br><br>Fiorentina are more difficult, they are having a good period unlike Bologna. Fabrizio Miccoli is a difficult opponent, with a great shot, weÂ’ll have to mark him closely.<br><br><strong>How is Crespo? </strong><br><br>He can improve, he received a knock against Chieva which kept him back but in any case heÂ’s in good shape.</div>
