            <div class='col-md body'>Connected story:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large">Soccer player worth his weight in prawns</span></span></strong><br><strong>Two third division Norwegian soccer teams have agreed one of the oddest transfer deals ever. Vindbjart will sell striker Kenneth Kristensen to rivals FlekkerÃ¸y for his weight in fresh prawns.</strong><br><br>The lower divisions of Norway's soccer system don't hum with high finance, but some kind of compensation for a top player was needed, newspaper Faedrelandsvennen reports. A board meeting decided that Kristensen would be weighed and turned over in return for an equal weight of crustaceans.<br><br>"Kenneth was in top form when he left us in the winter but he has had a relaxed summer eating seafood on FlekkerÃ¸y. I think this will be a good deal for us," Vindbjart club foreman Vidar Ulstein told Faedrelandsvennen.<br><br>Vindbjart will be taking their own scales when the two teams meet on Saturday. FlekkerÃ¸y boss Rolf Guttormsen said the team has plenty of shellfish ready.<br><br>"I had no idea if it was a joke or deadly serious. When I called the Vindbjart chairman he said that it was a bit of both but they wanted the prawns. So we had no choice," Guttormsen said.<br><br>(source: <a href="http://www.aftenposten.no/english/sports/article403389.ece" rel="nofollow">Aftenposten - News from Norway</a>)</div>
