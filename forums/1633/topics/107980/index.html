            <div class='col-md body'><strong>BIG-MATCH FACTS<br><br>CHELSEA</strong> will celebrate Christmas top of the tree, irrespective of the result against struggling Norwich, and could go into the festivities revelling seven points clear at the apex. Jose Mourinho's side have lost just twice in 26 matches since his arrival. They top the Premiership by four points from Everton, having won more games (12), lost fewer (one) and shipped fewer goals (eight) than any other club. It's the first time in their history the Blues have been top on Christmas Day, but the side leading the way on 25 December have only gone on to the win the title in 44 of 105 previous occasions, and just three times in the 12 preceding seasons of the Premiership era.<br><br>The Londoners have accumulated 20 points from a possible 24 since losing to Manchester City in mid October. They've also not lost a Premiership match at Stamford Bridge in ten months, winning ten and drawing four since the loss to Arsenal.<br><br>Goals from Frank Sinclair and Paul Furlong on the first day of the 1994/95 season were enough for Chelsea to complete a 2-0 victory over Norwich for their first and only Premiership victory against the East Anglians in six Premiership meetings.<br><br><strong>NORWICH CITY</strong> doubled their winning tally with an odd goal in five victory over Bolton last time out. That lifted them out of the relegation zone, one point above the danger line with four teams underneath them in the table. But they still go to Stamford Bridge with the Christmas wish of becoming the first side to take three points from the venue this season, with their first maximum on the road in the top flight for one day over ten years. The last one was also in London, against Crystal Palace.<br><br>The match pits the Premiership's weakest first half team with the strongest second half outfit. The Canaries have scored just three goals in the first period this season and turned round in front just once. By comparison, Chelsea have ended only one second half with less goals than the opposition. Indeed they've netted 22 of their 33 Premiership goals after the break, and have been particularly dangerous in the first 15 minutes following the interval, when they've scored nine times.<br><br>The Canaries have enjoyed the better of the exchanges against Chelsea in the League since their first contest in 1961. They lead the head-to-head standings by 12 wins to eight and have won four of the six Premiership meetings.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Chelsea vs Norwich</strong><br><br>Manager Jose Mourinho insists he has no plans to make any new signings during the January transfer window, despite reports Chelsea have had a bid for Spanish winger Joaquin turned down by Real Betis.<br><br>Mourinho admitted there are a host of players around the world he admires, from Carlos Alberto at his former club Porto to Milan's Brazilian striker Kaka, but he stressed Chelsea do not need to add to their superstar squad.<br><br>In fact, Mourinho is having enough trouble trying to keep all his current players happy. He responded to reports that Joe Cole has been frozen out by urging authorities to increase the number of substitutes so he can include all his star names in the match-day squad.<br><br>"I do not want to sign any players in the January transfer window. I just want to keep my players and avoid injuries," said Mourinho.<br><br>"The hard thing for me in England is to have only five players on the bench. I go to Arsenal and have to leave Joe Cole and Alexei Smertin in the stands. Why? They should be there to give me more options."<br><br>Mourinho believes his side can achieve things domestically and added: "I think we can do good things in England. We need to do something special. For Chelsea to win the Premiership would be something special.<br><br>"They did it once in their history, 50 years ago, and if we can do it with a young team and a manager just arrived in the country, it would be special."<br><br>Mourinho has no major injury worries for the clash with struggling Norwich at Stamford Bridge and received a boost as German international Robert Huth returned to training following the ankle injury he picked up while on international duty.<br><br>However, he is unlikely to be included in the squad as Mourinho is almost certain to stick with the line-up that started against Arsenal.<br><br>Almost all of the Chelsea players cost more individually than the entire Norwich squad put together.<br><br>But Canaries boss Nigel Worthington believes if his side concentrate on playing to the best of their abilities, the Barclays Premiership leaders could be in for a surprise.<br><br>"It's not something that scares me," said Worthington. "Chelsea are highlighted every week and we know all about them.<br><br>"We'll be looking to work hard, pass the ball and play well. If we do all those things anything can happen.<br><br>"Chelsea haven't lost a home game this season and we haven't won an away game - football is a crazy game and shocks do happen."<br><br>However, Worthington accepts his side will be up against some of the game's top talent.<br><br>"They are all good players first and foremost," the Ulsterman added.<br><br>"I think Frank Lampard will need to be watched very closely because he's got a great knack of breaking forward and scoring goals.<br><br>"Eidur Gudjohnsen is a very good goalscorer and obviously Damien Duff and Arjen Robben pose a big threat on the flanks with their skill and pace - that's four to start with."<br><br>Norwich chalked up only their second league win of the season last weekend, when they twice came from behind to beat Bolton 3-2 at Carrow Road and move out of the relegation zone.<br><br>That was achieved with a depleted team following injuries to midfield regulars Gary Holt, Damien Francis and Phil Mulryne.<br><br>It has, though, allowed the likes of Thomas Helveg and youngster David Bentley to step into the gaps, and Worthington is pleased with the way his players have responded.<br><br>"It's about players adapting to different roles within the team and being prepared to work hard - and that's exactly what we saw last week," he said.<br><br>"The lads are looking bright, they are enjoying their work and now it's about carrying that over."<br><br>Worthington is likely to stick with the same starting XI from the Bolton game.<br><br>Striker Leon McKenzie is fit again following a back injury, but will probably have make do with a place among the substitutes after Mathias Svensson`s double strike against the Trotters.<br><br>Skipper Adam Drury is expected to be on the bench after the full-back was dropped for the first time in his Norwich career last week, with Simon Charlton stepping in.<br><br>Holt (lung infection), Francis (fractured cheekbone) and Mulryne (groin) are still out.</div>
