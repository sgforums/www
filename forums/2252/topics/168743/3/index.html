            <div class='col-md body'>After reading all the threads, I feel that you --&gt; mentallyimpaired is not fit to be a doctor. Either that, you are just someone out there to show off your knowledge.<br><br>From my experience (not very long, but they have enough threads for me to tell), renorenal, thinkdifferent, oxford mushroom and alfagal are genuine doctors, whether or not you agree. They really want to help, and they do it sincerely. They spend their free time here, answering questions that forumers have. They also tried to make the forum lively by having medical mysteries. As forumers try to solve them, they learn something new.<br><br>Just something for you: If you are a Singaporean and a doctor, you are truly damaging Singapore's reputation as having good and caring doctors. I have not seen a doctor like you. Even when I asked questions to senior doctors at TTSH, they don't behave like you.<br>If you are not a Singaporean, I hope you would go somewhere other than Singapore.<br></div>

Eat your red herring, Consultant Mushroom, MD, FRCP, FAMS, 15 years service award medal.<br><br>If you didnÂ’t realize, any sore looser on this forum can be a Â“ConsultantÂ”. I have a Ph.D. in Advance Pedantry, and I guess thatÂ’s impressive from a fungal perspective?<br><br>From a Â“ConsultantÂ” Fungus point of view, what Â“medical knowledgeÂ” have I boasted, other than lambasting a phony 23 y.o. Bomoh from Malaysia? Just because one can use some vulgarities on a forum doesnÂ’t prove oneÂ’s medical qualifications. It only shows DR RenorenalÂ’s (MD, FRCP) Â“desperate need to show off one's knowledgeÂ”, and his Â“deep sense of insecurity and perceived inadequaciesÂ”.<br><br>OM, reserve your double entendre for your fellow fungus and household plants.<br><br>At last, canÂ’t the grown up, post-pubertal Dr Renorenal stop using hired guns on this forum? It lowers his status from a coward, phony bomoh to a sissy who needs to hide behind mummyÂ’s panties.</div></blockquote>Dear doctor with a PhD, I see that our education has failed to instill the correct moral values.<br><br>oxford mushroom is just a nickname used in forums. Why do you have to call this doctor a fungal? I may not have medical knowledge, and I can't answer your questions, but I am brought up properly by my parents. It is not right to call other people names, unless they introduce their other name to you.<br><br>renorenal is not a coward nor is he a phony doctor. You may call me naive, but the answers they give are similar to what I have read from books, learn from my teacher and what my doctors are telling me.<br><br>Hope you will not disturb him and the other doctors here.<br><br>mayi</div>
