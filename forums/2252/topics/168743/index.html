            <div class='col-md body'>This thread is directed to DR Renorenal and company.<br><br>Oh dear, you closed the thread just before I can quiz you! Why do you do that?<br><br>My questions can be answered by any medical students in their clinical years.<br><br>Nevertheless, I appreciate your private mail to me, and your answer.<br><br>You thought Prazosin is a good anti-hypertensive for a 30 year old male with Gout and 2nd degree heart block.<br><br>HereÂ’s my 5 cents worth:<br><br>30 y.o. sexually active Male, gout, 2nd degree block: Ideally ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin II receptor antagonists. I believe any MRCPs would agree with me. BTW, this is SingaporeÂ’s guideline for HTN.<br><br>With regard to alpha blockers (i.e. Prazosin) Â– best drugs for elderly with BPH or prostatic symptoms, but not a 30 y.o. sod.<br><br>Prazosin Â– personally, i donÂ’t use this anymore. Try some of the newer alpha blockers i.e. Hytrin or Pencor. As urologists use to say, Â“Give Prazosin to your enemies.Â” Nevertheless, itÂ’s dirt cheap to feed the poor old sod Prazosin, at least until you sign him off to the mortuary.<br><br>The following OSCE is a very basic Â“bread-and-butterÂ” question for any house officer.<br><br><strong>If you are a bona fide "doctor", answer me.</strong> Don't feed your fantasy by <strong>deleting my replies in your thread, and subsequently closing the thread under the guise of Â“peaceÂ”.</strong><br><br>I refer to our previous question for discussion: The same 30 y.o. buddy (male with gout, 2nd degree block, sexually active) has the following parameters on your morning rounds today. The following is what your house officer wrote after having been up all night doing on-call:<br><br>Date 13 Dec 2005<br>Time 6:28am<br><br>c/o dizziness, non-vertiginous x 2/7<br><br>No GI symptoms<br>No weakness/numbness<br><br>Smoker 40 cigarettes/day<br><br>BP 200/95 HR 60 RR 12<br>Temp 36.8 C<br><br>HS1 HS2 Lungs clear<br>Abd L0S0K0 SNT<br>PEARL<br>Fundus NAD<br>CNS NAD<br>Cranial nn intact<br>Negative RombergÂ’s<br>Neck supple<br><br>Blood tests: CCT 40ml/min, UTP 1500 g/day, ALT 20 u/L, LDL 5.72 mmol/L, TG 3.2 mmol/L, Fasting Glucose 8.0 mmol/L, K 3.0 mmol/L.<br><br>ECG: ST depression on V4-V6, delta wave present. Sinus rhythm.<br><br>Your house officer prescribed Stugeron 1/1 stat. No further ix ordered.<br><br>Questions:<br><br>What would be your choice of medication for his hypertension after reading his medical record today?<br>What other crucial physical examination did your HO left out for Â“dizzinessÂ”?<br>Would you order further ix? If so, what ix?<br></div>

I can safely say that I am one of them because I hardly created or stirred any problems in here to another forumnite. You were an exception.<br><br>Your persistent attitude to look down on your fellow colleague is your first intention even in the beginning of your first post. If you are a Singaporean doctor, it is understood that you think highly of yourself more than others. I am a humble lot, and I did not delete any of your post. I closed it and I apologized through PM. It's up to you to accept it, but posting such hurtful words and statements even up to the point of being strangers yet colleagues, I see that you have reached that critical point of being unprofessional.<br><br>If you were my head of dept or any seniors whom I KNOW, I would accept any criticism. But I do not know you or do you know me, and your allegations are unfair. I believe you do learn what is evidence based in medical school, and I hope that you can apply it in your daily life as well. Do not simply criticize people or test people at your own peril.<br><br>Would you like it if I were to ask you a question and I quote from sexiest_stud_in_the_world in the sense of not seeing and hence not believing, that whether have you seen your father's cum drip into your mother's vagina? If not, I suspect that you should begin to question your parentage now.<br><br>That my friend, is my last criticism for you, and if you so like to threaten me with your guise and knife at hand, I'd gladly be the humble man and leave you alone. Let you be the doctor and answer all the questions posted by my fellow beloved forumnite. I hope you have the time, you knowledgeable unemotional and uncaring doctor. I can allegedly say so too, if you can allegedly claim me to be a medical student without any evidence. This is a taste for your own medicine.<br><br>Don't bother reply either, this is my last post, and I am officially signing off from this forum. Heck, I don't even care to read your reply, no matter how hurtful it may be or how sarcastic it may be. I wish you good luck in your future just like you criticise people and put a cheers in the end of your message, so would I pretend to offer peace after a heated argument.<br><br>Come to think of it, you do not deserve any of my piece of professionalism, so I can just tell you to FARK OFF!</div>
