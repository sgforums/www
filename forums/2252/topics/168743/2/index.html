            <div class='col-md body'>Dear mentallyimpaired,<br><br>what have you intended to reach with this thread? Why are you attacking renorenal in the public? If you have some problem with him, why not to solve it via PM?<br><br>Renorenal is a young doctor, he doesn't play the god of medicine nor the all knowing doctor of the century. He loves his work and sacrifices his free time, sleep and eyes to hang on the net and answer the questions of the forumers, advises them and tries to help them. If he can't answer some questions, he tells it directly, he admits it.<br>Do you feel good when attacking a young doctor who has started to practice not long time ago? Does it feed your ego?<br><br>What makes renorenal special is the fact, that he does this job here in the forum with HEART. All will agree with me in this.<br><br>I can tell you what you have with your thread reached.<br>You have reached, that all sympathise with reno even more and stand by him. You have reached to make a vicious idiot out of yourself. Congratulation!<br><br>You are free to criticize anyone, but the point is how you do it. What you have done here is a mean way of attacking a nice and sincere person.<br><br>And you have reached that me, reno's forum friends and renorenal himself can't get a proper sleep tonight.<br><br>You can be really proud of yourself.<br></div>

You were an exception.<br><br>Your persistent attitude to look down on your fellow colleague is your first intention even in the beginning of your first post. If you are a Singaporean doctor, it is understood that you think highly of yourself more than others. I am a humble lot, and I did not delete any of your post.

But I do not know you or do you know me, and your allegations are unfair. I believe you do learn what is evidence based in medical school, and I hope that you can apply it in your daily life as well. Do not simply criticize people or test people at your own peril.<br><br>Would you like it if I were to ask you a question and I quote from sexiest_stud_in_the_world in the sense of not seeing and hence not believing, that <strong>whether have you seen your father's cum drip into your mother's vagina?

Let you be the doctor and answer all the questions posted by my fellow beloved forumnite. I hope you have the time, you knowledgeable unemotional and uncaring doctor. I can allegedly say so too, if you can allegedly claim me to be a medical student without any evidence.

Heck, I don't even care to read your reply, no matter how hurtful it may be or how sarcastic it may be.

            <div class='col-md body'>Obviously mentallyimpaired is out to get some attention and our best course of action is to ignore him.<br><br>As a Consultant in medical practice for more than 15 years, I have been happy with Reno's responses in the forum. Our obnoxious friend mentallyimpaired has pointed out that Reno's responses are taken from and are in line with well accepted medical texts. There is nothing wrong in that and indeed it is reassuring that he is keeping well within the body of respected medical opinion.<br><br>An online forum is NOT a consultation room. Your doctor is the best person to make diagnosis and treat your medical condition. No one should substitute information gleaned from the internet with a proper medical consultation but such information serves a useful purpose of public education. The object of such a forum is to disseminate health information and re-direct people to appropriate health attendants as the need arises.<br><br>Neither is this the place to show off your knowledge. Mentallyimpaired appears to be jealous of the attention Renorenal is getting and wants a share of it, but is proceeding in the worse possible way. From my experience, the desperate need to show off one's knowledge bespeaks a deep sense of insecurity and perceived inadequacies.</div>

Our obnoxious friend mentallyimpaired has pointed out that Reno's responses are taken from and are in line with well accepted medical texts. There is nothing wrong in that and indeed it is reassuring that he is keeping well within the body of respected medical opinion.<br><br>Neither is this the place to show off your knowledge. Mentallyimpaired appears to be jealous of the attention Renorenal is getting and wants a share of it, but is proceeding in the worse possible way. From my experience, the desperate need to show off one's knowledge bespeaks a deep sense of insecurity and perceived inadequacies.</div></blockquote>Dear Consultant OM,<br><br>Is there a better defense for an ignoramus, other than a diversion tactic (from the real issue of answering a simple, moronic OSCE), to a rabid ad hominem attack on the questioner?

I have a Ph.D. in Advance Pedantry, and I guess thatÂ’s impressive from a fungal perspective?<br><br>From a Â“ConsultantÂ” Fungus point of view, what Â“medical knowledgeÂ” have I boasted, other than lambasting a phony 23 y.o. Bomoh from Malaysia? Just because one can use some vulgarities on a forum doesnÂ’t prove oneÂ’s medical qualifications.

It lowers his status from a coward, phony bomoh to a sissy who needs to hide behind mummyÂ’s panties.</div>

I amlosing confidence already. Scodling patient somemore one. Waht kind of doctor are you anyway? The one who has poor communication skills I think. I can remember that very daywhen my grandma was scolded by the doctor so harshly, he ask, who doktor, you or me? when we were just asking whether the change of medication would bring any problems cauze we stay so far away and if anything happen, very hard to fly all the way from Medan.<br><br>//<br><br>My advise to you is that you need to find a wife so you can be not lonely cause we Indons have a way of understanding that if you are lack of sex and lack of ejaculation, all the bad stuffs will accumulate and come out from your mouth. You need to start to be a better doktor if you wna to help the helth ministry of singapore.<br><br>//<br><br>Me not siding anyone anyway, but I think a voluntary job should not be criticized like what you did.
