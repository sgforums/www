Hope the probs can b rectified asap.<br><br>I wrote in another tread claiming the 93 to be the best in its class w/o factoring the reliability of it. Seems like it is just as "unpredictable" as the S60 - w/ heaps of faults.<br><br>Fingers crossed for Saabee or Saabie whom has just gotten his new wheels.<br><br>About the brake pads some of u have mentioned, wouldn't it be a norm for a continental car to be like that w new pads? Was told by the C&amp;C SE when I test drove the A-class. VEry loud cranky noise when the brakes were depressed. She claimed that it was due to new, unworn brake pads which caused the noise. Could TE have changed worn-out pads for u guys instead? Hope not!? Just my doubt &amp; possibly ignorance.</div>
