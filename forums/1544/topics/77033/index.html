So annoying.. almost reached my place and was turning right at a traffic light, this stupid little goods van was coming from the opposite direction and turning left into the same road via the slip lane. I had the right of way of course, but I just KNEW what the bugger would try to do.<br><br>Sure enough, despite my flashing of headlights and horning his stupid ass, the idiot still squeezed his way in instead of giving way. Probably didn't realise that if I hit him, the Saab would only suffer minor dents but the van would be scrap.<br><br>All right, I am going full speed ahead with my plan to obtain RPGs and fit them to the front wings.<br></div>

It's the law of the jungle, like driving in Malaysia: "who big...win"<br><br>I had a goods truck back up into my then 1-week old Renault. I parked in front of a mini-mart (mistake). It was hit-and-run. I knew it was a truck cos he smashed the top of my bumper, headlights, and caused my bonnet to cave-in. Left blue paint scrapes all over. I asked around for witnesses, but you know how it is...<br><br>Since then, I have personally witnessed 2 parking hit-and-runs. Both times I took down the regn. plate and left my number under the wiper of the victim's car. Funny, only one of them bothered to call me.<br><br>Nowadays, if I park behind or in front of a goods truck, I use my T610 and snap a pic of the vehicle before I leave.<br><br>And I NEVER park next to one.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

Nowadays when I sense a hazardous situation coming up, my first instinct is to hit the gas rather than the brakes. After becoming familiar with the abilities of the 9-3ss, I'm quite confident that it can drive its way out of most tricky situations and can out-accelerate almost anything else on the road. Of course for situations where it's 50-50 (eg vehicle coming from the opposite direction and I don't know whether he'll give way or not), I'd still step on the brake. Better safe than sorry.<br><br>I have also had to make sudden right-left swerves at quite high speed to avoid vehicles which cut into my path without signalling (of course I was sure that no other vehicles were next to me at the time) and there was absolutely no sense of instability or losing control. Would have been quite dangerous to e-brake in such circumstances because I ran the risk of being hit from behind.<br><br></div>

They drive like motorcycles, cut in and out, without signalling!!  Wallop them man!<br><br>Buses:  They never check for traffic.  Just signal and shoot straight out of the bus stop!  Their "give way" sticker on the back very tuah one!<br><br>Taxis:  Passenger wave arm, they zip across 3 lanes of traffic and come to an IMMEDIATE STOP right in front of you!  Or passenger say stop now, and the gundu driver also stop!  Kanna sai!!<br><br>Motorcycles:  Weave in and out of traffic (especially delivery ones like Pizza Hut, KFC,etc).  Squeeze to get right up front at the lights park themselves right in front of you.  When the light changes, they hog the lane!<br><br>Lorries:  Biggest road bullies!!  Never give way.  Speeding all the time, and the load (sand or whatever) spilling from the back onto the road!!  Phui!<br><br>MPVs:  Driven by uncles with low s3x drive!  Always on lane 1 of express way and keep to speed limit!!  Otherwise, follow very close behind and the lights (at night) glare directly at you through the windscreen and mirrors!<br><br>Don't know what our TP doing sometimes.  Tidoh!</div>

Seems that right now the emphasis is on speeding, which is not necessarily the main cause of accidents.<br><br>I have to use the KJE every morning and naturally the expressway shoulder is used as a motorcycle lane by hordes of motorcyclists, but lots of cars and goods vehicles also use it as a convenient "express lane".
