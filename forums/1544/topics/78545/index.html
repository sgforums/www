            <div class='col-md body'>Coincidentally, the May issue of Torque also had an article on Audi A4 2.0 vs Saab 93SS 2.0t vs Volvo S40 2.4i "cars that can give the 318i a run for its money".<br><br>I was also surprised like Doodler on the choice of using S40 instead of S60 for<br>the comparison, as the S40 is really half a size smaller than either the A4 or the 93.<br><br>The S40 was the "winner", whatever that means, but the Saab "could have won and almost did".<br><br>I do agree with the reviewer's comments on so-so interior quality of the 93 - lots of areas where the cost cutting is pretty glaring.

            <div class='col-md body'>what we are taking here are the junior exec class cars, which pretty much sums up the S40, 9-3, A4 and 3 Series. Hence I would feel that it is fair to compare the S40 to the 9-3. If you were to take one model up for the volvo then it would be one model up for everyone else too. i do not quite view the S60 as a junior exec car since it is actually capable of fighting in the same class as the 5 series, and has a hot model, the S60 R, to rival(but not quite) the uber-saloons like M5, E55 AMG, RS6 and S-Type R.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One of the mags that swayed me towards the 9-3SS was the Nov 2002 edition of Top Gear. It was a 4-way shootout - BMW 318iSE, Jaguar X-Type 2.0, Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector <span style="font-style: italic;">(same as our 9-3SS 2.0t)</span> and Volvo S60 2.0T S. Remind me to bring the mag when we next meet.<br><br>Here are excerpts:<br><br><strong>Styling:</strong> "Sometimes a new car's appearance grows on you, sometimes it's the reverse and sometimes you're certain from the start. But with the new 9-3, we knew we liked it before we set off, and then it grew on us."<br><br><strong>Performance:</strong> "On the road the new Saab feels every bit as eager as the Volvo. Though its turbo motor is a cylinder down on the S60's and its up to 20bhp shy, but it certainly doesn't feel it - the 9-3's throttle response is terrific. Turbo lag? Those days are long gone..."<br><br><strong>Ride &amp; Handling:</strong> "So if your priority is 'sports' then its either the Saab or, no surprise, the BMW... We didn't think we'd find ourselves saying this about the new 9-3, but in the high mileage week we had with these cars, these two remained hard to split in the final analysis"<br><br><strong>Accomodation:</strong> "For driver and passenger comfort, the two Swedes win hands down. There's something about their shape or dimensions, their springs or their stuffing, or a combination of all four, which sets the Volvo and Saab front seats apart from not only the BMW and Jag, but most other cars on the road... The Saab has the biggest, best boot with a nice easy-action lid..."<br><br><strong>Verdict:</strong> "And so to the winner: the new Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector. It looks great, drives superbly, is spacious, extremely comfy, very practical, very well specced, seemingly well screwed together and fast. It represents not only a big advance on the old 9-3, but strongly deserves to loosen the 3-Series' long-term stranglehold on this class. And if anyone tells you that deep beneath the skin it's fundamentally just a Vectra, you just tell 'em to sod off."<br><br><strong>Styling:</strong><br>BMW 318iSE           ****<br>Jaguar X-Type 2.0    **<br>Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector *****<br>Volvo S60 2.0T S     ***<br><br><strong>Performance:</strong><br>BMW 318iSE           ***<br>Jaguar X-Type 2.0    ***<br>Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector ****<br>Volvo S60 2.0T S     ****<br><br><strong>Ride &amp; Handling:</strong><br>BMW 318iSE           *****<br>Jaguar X-Type 2.0    ***<br>Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector *****<br>Volvo S60 2.0T S     ****<br><br><strong>Accomodation:</strong><br>BMW 318iSE           ***<br>Jaguar X-Type 2.0    **<br>Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector *****<br>Volvo S60 2.0T S     ****<br><br><strong>Overall:</strong><br>BMW 318iSE           ****<br>Jaguar X-Type 2.0    ***<br>Saab 9-3 1.8t Vector *****<br>Volvo S60 2.0T S     ***<br><br><span style="color: blue;">IMO, don't really agree with the part about it being "..seemingly well screwed together.."</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> enuff said <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

If you were to take one model up for the volvo then it would be one model up for everyone else too. i do not quite view the S60 as a junior exec car since it is actually capable of fighting in the same class as the 5 series, and has a hot model, the S60 R, to rival(but not quite) the uber-saloons like M5, E55 AMG, RS6 and S-Type R.</div></blockquote>Hmm... but then the S40 is based on the same platform as the new Focus and the Mazda3, which one could argue, puts it in the "family sedan" class  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  However Volvo has gone and stuffed a big engine in it which blurs the lines somewhat.<br><br>Pity Saab doesn't have any model below the 9-3 which could be pitted against the S40... however if the 9-2 makes it here, that might be a possible candidate... both NA base models are quite close in terms of capacity and output.<br><br>Bro, thanks for bringing up the subject of 'hot' models!
