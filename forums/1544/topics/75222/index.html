            <div class='col-md body'>Can we ask your cousin for a test drive?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I really like the design of the new S40, and the build quality and equipment level sound good as well. I think the price is right too yes?<br><br>On the other hand, the wheelbase is slightly shorter so is it a bit less spacious than the 9-3? Will have to take a look at the actual thing. And 170hp for a 2.4 with no possibility of tweaking the turbo...tsk tsk.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another thing - I'm really bummed that the local 9-3's don't have retractable wing mirrors. TE said that they didn't specify them because they may not be reliable in the local climate, but look how many other cars have them!<br><br></div>

Car park lots here are just too small !<br><br>btw, my 2004 2.0t doesn't come with the autodimming rear view mirror (among others). bloody cheap skates! :-)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I just enquired. Apparently they have a 220BHP T5 for $137K, $2K less because this one has no "car-phone", whatever that means.<br><br>Personally I think the 9-3 looks waaaa-a-ay better. Wonder if the V50 will change my mind, especially if it comes with sport suspension and Haldex 4-wheel drive!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After sitting in Swedesport's cousin's S40, I like it even more! But it is definitely about half a class smaller in terms of size.<br><br>It has some features which the 9-3ss doesn't have, but then it lacks some which we do have. So I'd call it a tie in terms of features.<br><br>The clincher would probably be how it drives but since I haven't driven it, will reserve comment.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Over the weekend, I had a good chance to be better acquainted with the S40.<br><br>1.  Get this, SM does not provide a breakdown triangle with the S40!  Penny pinchers!<br><br>2.  The balancing weights are attached to the outer edge of the rim, on the outside.  So it can be seen!  Duh!!<br><br>3.  Seat belt reminder only for the driver, SM disabled the rest because some dinky customers got irritated when they placed their "fat ass" bag on the seat and it triggered the alarm!<br><br>4.  There are only 2 tiedown loops in the booth, like the 2004 93.<br><br>5.  Does not have EBD (Electronic Brakeforce Distribution).  The 93 brakes are much, much better.  Apparently, this is true for all non-T or non-R Volvos!  So if we race with a normal Volvo, and we need to brake in an emergency, the Volvo will be WAY ahead of us!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>6.  No pass-thru ski hatch.<br><br>I think if I can improve the ride quality, my 93 will come up on top.<br><br></div>
