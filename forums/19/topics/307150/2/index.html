              <p>It was a practical suggestion.</p>
              <p>If you find no buyers, you have to give it to SPCA to be destroyed, or you have to give it away. So in the end, you still don't get your money back. Unless of course the pet shop is willing to take it back. Perhaps you could offer the shop some kind of restocking fee.</p>
              <p>So your priority should be to find the dog a good home. The amount of money you can get for the dog should be considered a bonus.</p>
              <p>Unless of course, you're the type of person who is willing to say, "unless someone pays me $1100, I will give the dog to SPCA to be destroyed."</p>

              <p>Okay. Let's examine what you have said.</p>
              <p>You said you would sell your dog "cheapest is $1100.. i just bought it yest at $1400."</p>
              <p>You also said, "but too bad, my daughter is allergic to dogs."</p>
              <p>And now you say you will not give your dog to SPCA to be destroyed.</p>
              <p>So I don't understand why you have a problem with anything I've said? Since you are not a heartless guy and you will not give your dog to SPCA to be destroyed, and obviously you don't want to sacrifice the health of your daughter, the thing you have to compromise on is the price right?</p>
              <p>I wonder where your defensiveness comes from.</p>

              <p>I've a dog before, my mother bought first hand for lots of money also, then the dog die thats why actively looking for another dog, cannot?</p>
              <p>If my price too low, can just say too low and ignore. And do your homework at pets.com.sg first, and other forums.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you want the bottom line, she brought it on herself and nothing else. By buying the dog home and unable to keep it, who is it to blame? why dont she make sure everything is well before getting it home?</p>

              <p>Of course it's not his fault that his child is allergic to dogs. In fact, it is irrelevent why he needs to get rid of the dog. That's not the point. The fact remains that he has a dog and he can't keep it.</p>
              <p>I don't see where I was sarcastic to him.</p>
              <p>In any case, he has basically conceded my point. He said he can afford to lose 1.4K. So it's great if he can find someone to buy the dog from him. But ultimately, if he wants to ensure the dog can find a home, he must be willing to compromise on the price.</p>
              <p>Now I will be sarcastic, just so that you know what sarcasm is.</p>
              <p>I must say, your two posts (which also happens to be your first two
              posts) are the most incoherent I've ever read. Period. You must have
              learned English at EDMW. Good lord, I had to ask my niece to translate
              what you wrote. But I don't think she translated it well. She was
              giggling too much. However, I concede that your language skills are the
              least of your problems.</p>
              <p>I must say I am thankful that your version of common sense does not seem very common at all. If it was, we would be in big trouble. I'm curious though about how you would apply your "common sense" to the problem at hand. What would you do if you need to get rid of a dog and you can't sell it?</p>
