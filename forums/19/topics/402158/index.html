            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Hi I am selling my few months old iPod nano lastest 5th generation at a great price of <strong>S$170</strong>. Apple store price/PC show price: $228 <strong>(Whooping $58 discount!)</strong></p>
              <p>I had went to a great extent to take great care of this product from the day I purchase it from Apple by investing in lots of way for example, purchasing a premium hard gel silicon case at a price of S$15.99 as a result I am very proud to announce that my iPod is FREE OF SCRATCHES OR DENTS.</p>
              <p>Totally no scraches or dents I can detect, it is as good as new! 10/10</p>
              <p>It was purchased in December 2009 and warranty is valid till December 2010.</p>
              <p>This iPod is packed with lots of great features for examples:</p>
              <p>1. High resolution video camera</p>
              <p>2. Great amount of 8GB memory for your songs and video</p>
              <p>3. Built in FM radio</p>
              <p>4. Built in Pedometer where you can send you workout data to Nike Plus service</p>
              <p>5. Built in voice recorder</p>
              <p>6. There are tons of other things inside this great little device, most importantly a extremely high resolution display.</p>
              <p>However I am sad to announce that I had misplaced my apple original earphones, however as a form of compensation for that earphone to the buyer, I am offering, <strong>2 Genuine New Philips SHE9000 earphone</strong> or 3 if you want a free used headset.</p>
              <p>I can reset the device for you making it as good as new or add in my 6GB of music library into the iPod specially for you.</p>
              <p>If you wonders since I took so much effort to take care of this iPod, why am I selling it? The reason is, this iPod have been a great distraction for me and knowing that I have only 4 months left to my final year examination, I can't afford to let this device affect my grades and regret it for a lifetime.</p>
              <p>If you are interested in this product, please feel free to contact me at max_maniac@ymail.com or PM me.</p>
              <p>May god bless you.</p>
              <p>Note: The iPod is green in colour.</p>

              <p>Ahhh... Interesting. Well... I personally thought you were a smart guy however seems like your comment you have written isn't.</p>
              <p>1. S$58.00 is clearly not a small amount for a typical teenager in Singapore, I am pretty sure that most of the forum-ers and teenagers know that. For that you can't deny.</p>
              <p>2. I stated that the exterior is free from any scratches or dents, for that you are purchasing a second hand device that is as good as a new iPod nano 5th generation.</p>
              <p>3. I written clearly that this device is free from any fault as I had taken care of this device very well as such you mentioned that you will need to head down to the Apple HQ to get it repaired is irrelevant UNLESS you spoil it after you had purchased it from me (if).</p>
              <p>4. I mentioned that you can get a 1 to 1 exchange for my iPod nano 5th generation to reassure buyer that this device come with a assurance that you are getting a WORKING iPod and Apple will provide the necessary assistance if it is malfunctioning.</p>
              <p>5. All this at a discount of S$58 I strongly believe that it is very worth it as you are getting a product that is as good as new however at a discounted price. I believe that even Apple refurbished iPods does not provide such an awesome price.</p>
              <p>6. Lastly, you stated that "Again, because of your $58 dicount, I've to travel down to get
              it change, best part: because of your doing somemore! okie meh like
              that?", I find statement very extraneous. May I question what does your because of your doing someone you had to spend you precious time to travel down to a location?</p>
              <p>Would you kindly please clarify? I believe fellows readers are extremely interested in your reply regarding this post which you are reading.</p>

              It has come to my attention that you are hoping to sell your ipod, however i notice there have been some misunderstandings. Would you be so kind to clear my doubts?
              
              1) If S$58 is not a small amount to an average teenager, what is S$170? 
              
              2) So what if the exterior of your ipod is in mint condition, you could have dropped it with your "premium hard gel silicon case" on. Please enlighten me on how a 2nd hand item is comparable to a brand new item?
              
              3) I see that you have stated clearly that your device is in perfect working condition, but how can I be sure that what you have said is credible? You've also stated the you have taken very good care of your device, but to what am I supposed to compare your "very good care" with? My understanding of "very good care" might not be the same as yours.  Judging by what you have said, I infer that your ipod has some supernatural powers so that will not have any issues or get spoilt unless a user has spoilt it. If so, I believe that you if you don't get killed.etc you will not die but live forever. Am I right to say that? Im also interested to know how you managed to lose your earpiece if you took such good care of your ipod. 
              
              4) You mentioned that I could have a one-for-one exchange or be given the necessary assistance if the device malfunctioned. So let's say I encounter some issues after 8 months, can I be sure that I will be able to enjoy a one-for-one exchange or be given the necessary assistance for free since the warranty period has expired?
              
              5) As you have stated above, I understand that you believe that Apple does not offer such good deals for refurbished ipods, I, however, think otherwise, a refurbished ipod nano 5th generation from Apple comes with  the same one-year warranty that a new one would come with, all the manuals and accessories and a pair of unopened earbuds, a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, as well as free shipping/delivery
               for the price of S$158. You might be interested to take a look: http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/home/specialdeals/ipod
              
              6) I believe that my answer in (5) will answer your question. 
              
              In your previous post, you mentioned that you will let the buyer the the interior of your ipod. If so, I'm will to buy it for S$200. Since you allow the buyer to check the interior, Im sure you will be fine with me taking your ipod apart so that i can check the motherboard.etc. If your ipod is still available, will you be so kind to give me a pm?
              
              My question is, after reading the above, do you still believe that you offer a better price as compared to Apple? Would YOU kindly clarify. I'm sure our fellow readers would be  interested to read your explanation.

              that I will be able to enjoy a one-for-one exchange or be given the
              necessary assistance for free since the warranty period has
              expired?</p>
              <p>5) As you have stated above, I understand that you believe that
              Apple does not offer such good deals for refurbished ipods, I,
              however, think otherwise, a refurbished ipod nano 5th generation
              from Apple comes with the same one-year warranty that a new one
              would come with, all the manuals and accessories and a pair of
              unopened earbuds, a new battery and outer shell, a new white box,
              as well as free shipping/delivery for the price of S$158. You might
              be interested to take a look: <a rel="nofollow" href="http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/home/specialdeals/ipod">http://store.apple.com/sg/browse/home/specialde…</a></p>
              <p>6) I believe that my answer in (5) will answer your
              question.</p>
              <p>In your previous post, you mentioned that you will let the buyer
              the the interior of your ipod. If so, I’m will to buy it for S$200.
              Since you allow the buyer to check the interior, Im sure you will
              be fine with me taking your ipod apart so that i can check the
              motherboard.etc. If your ipod is still available, will you be so
              kind to give me a pm?</p>
              <p>My question is, after reading the above, do you still believe
              that you offer a better price as compared to Apple? Would
              <span>YOU</span> kindly clarify. I’m sure our fellow
              readers would be interested to read your explanation.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Yes indeed, many forum-ers are very 'interested' in this topic I believe however there are several pointers I will like to clarify as you had requested -'Would you be kind to clear my doubts?'</p>
              <p>1.</p>
              <p><br>Yes I am selling this product at a price of S$170 after a discount of S$58. I agree S$58 is not a small sum; this applies to my selling price of my iPod nano at S$170. However considering that a brand new iPod would have cost S$228 if the student had purchased it from apple store and compared to purchasing this product from me would have cost S$170. That S$58 saved is still a sum of money saved.</p>
              <p>Also to add on to your statement that S$170 is a big sum which I can infer from your statement, I will like to suggest that a good and nicely designed gadget is never cheap take for example, the iPod nano 5th generation. It is made by a renowned company, Apple Inc. with their price of their share higher than the software giant Microsoft. The devices they sell are never cheap for example, an iPhone 3GS in Singapore on the lowest data plan under SingTel will have cost S$518. But despite the expensive price that Apple had approved SingTel to sell the phone, iPhone is the most popular phone in Singapore as mentioned in The Straits Times. People are still very willing to fork out this high price are mainly due to the fact that they are purchasing a quality product with great user interface and hundreds of thousands applications to choose from in the App store.</p>
              <p>This goes the same for the iPods, do you know that the iPod is the world’s most popular music player having more than 260 million of players sold since October 2001 yet the price Apple sold it wasn't cheap. But Apple still managed to sell this incredible amount of iPods at high price. In conclusion, yes S$170 is not a small amount particularly for a teenager but because there is a discount in price compared to purchasing it in Apple store, because there is still 6 months’ worth of valid warranty, because there is totally no scratches on the iPod, because it is so well kept, because great gadget deserve the high price tag due to their great advancement in technology as such I believe that S$170 is worth the price for a second hand well-kept gadget.</p>
              <p>2.</p>
              <p><br>Yes my iPod is in mint conditions and you stated that I could have dropped it with the gel case on. Well... let say if I were to drop it, the item that will come contact with the floor would be the case itself but not the iPod. The iPod will still be nicely protected. As such I see no link in your statement.</p>
              <p><br>I believe firstly you know the obvious on how a second hand item is better than a new item, the main advantage is lower price. Compared to the brand new iPod indeed you will find yourself lacking of the apple earphone however to compensate for it, I offer 3 additional Philips earphone, additional used gel case, other than that all other accessories that come with the iPod are intact for example, the case, apple logo sticker etc.</p>
              <p><br>Since the buyer is getting most of the items that come with the iPod which is in mint conditions, since the buyer is is getting it with 2 extra better Philips earphone SH9000, since it comes with a lower price tag, it seems to me that it is a better deal to purchase it from me compared to purchasing it from a Apple Store.</p>
              <p>3.</p>
              <p><br>You doubted that my product is not in perfect working conditions, to ensure what I said was true, I offered cash on delivery as a service to allow the buyer to check for any fault before purchasing it, and this will definitely prove my credibility.<br>I stated that I had taken very good care of my iPod which in other words it is comparable to the ones that are sold in the Apple store. I believe that since it is comparable to a new Apple iPod purchased from a Apple store, it will definitely fit your idea of 'very well taken care of'.</p>
              <p><br>I will like to clarify your statement that my iPod have supernatural power. From the beginning of my post to this, I never stated that my iPod possess of any supernatural power. I am stating the fact that a device won't be spoilt if it is well taken care of, well frankly speaking if no one go and misuse this device, will it not be in working conditions? If the user use it appropriately, will it be damaged? Yes maybe when Apple contract company staff were assembling this product have some workmanship fault however if I can use this iPod without any problems for 6 months, the chances of a workmanship fault is nearly zero or maybe it is really zero since Apple have sure a strict quality control.</p>
              <p><br>I see that you mentioned "I believe that you if you don’t get killed.etc you will not die but live forever." Well it is true, if you are not killed by a virus, if you are not killed by a infection, if you are not killed by an accident, you may even live forever. I shall explain this, even if you say that you may be killed due to old age, before you die you will develop some kind of illness that will put your illness down before you die for example, low white blood cells count, even for this it is an illness. Please debate about this if you believe my reasoning about this is untrue.</p>
              <p><br>I stated that I had taken great care of my iPod, but I CLEARLY DID NOT state that I had taken great care of my earphone, so maybe you may want to go back to my first post of re-read several times before you gave me a reply?</p>
              <p>4.</p>
              <p><br>I find your question very hilarious. You states that after 8 months of purchasing my product you may encounter some issues and you want it to the exchanged or given the necessary assistance after the warranty is over. I clearly stated that the warranty period is valid till December 2010, you would have clearly know that once warranty is over you will not be offered any assistance for the iPod. In my previous post, my purpose of stating that you will be entitled for a 1 to 1 exchange was to assure buyer that he or she is purchasing a working product and will be provided with the necessary assistance if it malfunctions during the next 6 months.</p>
              <p>5.</p>
              <p>I had seen the website you had provided me with the link. Please refer to my previous post, I stated that I BELIEVED that apple do not offer a price lower than mine. And since I BELIEVED so I have totally no idea that Apple Inc. will provide a better deal as such will hold no liability for the fact that Apple offer a price lower than mine.<br>After browsing through the website I noticed that Apple stated that the iPod that maybe shipped may come with cosmetics imperfection ie dents and scratches which you are unable. So why risk to save S$12 when you could get a product as good as new without any scratches or dents? Yes it comes with a new earbuds, however here am I offering 2 new earbuds from Philips with an options of 1 used additional earbuds. So I do not understand why am I not offering a better deal or comparable deal compared to Apple store when everything that came with the retail box are intact but also, more accessories are given ie. Philips earbuds and gel case worth $29.90.</p>
              <p>6.</p>
              <p>I apologise for my bad English. Yes I admit that I allowed buyer to check the interior of iPod nano. What I actually meant was to allow buyers to check for the user interface, if the interface is functional and working which will definitely work.<br>I am afraid that I am not able to provide you to open up the interior and have a look as this will void the warranty.</p>
              <p>7.</p>
              <p><br>To answer you final question, after spending time writing this post in my opinion I believe that I offer a better value compared to Apple.<br></p>

              I Do Not see a reason for you to pm me. I'm sure we can have a public conversation with ease. 
              
              Thank you for clarifying my doubts, however I still have some points which I disagree to.
              
              1)Judging by what you have mention, I believe you have not fully understood what I meant in my previous post. I understand you believe that for S$170, buying your ipod is a bargain compared to purchasing it directly from Apple for S$228. However, I will like to point out again that your ipod is 2nd hand. To be fair, I will compare your ipod to a similar ipod refurbished ipod of the identical model from Apple. As Apple's official website states, a refurbished ipod cost only S$158 which already proves that the price you're offering is higher, furthermore, I will enjoy a new battery as well as a new outer shell, hence I'm very certain that I will not have to worry about the battery life and cosmetic condition. Suppose I buy your ipod, i will have a remaining 6 months warranty, however if I were to buy a refurbished set from Apple, I will enjoy a fresh, 1 year warranty. 
              Comparing an ipod to an iphone, is comparing a cat to a tiger. If S$170 is a good bargain, Im not surprised if you're already sold it.
              
              2) So what you are trying to say is that as long as your ipod has not suffered any external damages, it is fine internally? So is it possible for the buyer to soak your ipod in water before buying it from you?
              I hope you're aware that Apple offers a lower price for similar refurbished ipod.
              
              3) Definitely you have to let the buyer check your ipod before purchase. However if there is a software issue, the problem may only crop up occasionally. 
              Sorry, but I find what you say amusing. How would you know the condition of the ipods from Apple if you were not the user?
              I'm the one who questioned your ipod's "supernatural power." Am I right to say that neither your ipod nor any device will get spoilt unless misused? If thats the case, I'm sure all companies would close down.  
              Now, I don't want to know the chances of workmanship problems , I want a simple Yes or No.
              I dare say that hardly anyone would buy an ipod to use the built-in speaker, but I'll give you the benefit of doubt.
              
              4) Exactly, your ipod has about 6 months of warranty remaining, however a refurbished one comes with a 1 year warranty period, hence I'm at an advantage if I get a refurbished set.
              
              5) Sure they may have some cosmetic imperfections, however if you refer to (1), you mentioned that Apple is a well established company, Im sure they would give me a replacement. Yes, you may have bought your accessories for $29.90, but since you bought you ipod for $228, why don't you sell your ipod back to Apple for the same price.

              <p>I will also like to clarify with you that my purpose of PMing you was ensure that my message was properly sent accross to you as you can see from above I had some trouble posting a post in this forum,<strong> if</strong> in any sense you are inferring that I PM you was to avoid the public, it was never my idea. You <strong>seems</strong> to be trying to convey a message to fellow forum-er that I will like to run away from this problem and you are right and I am at fault.</p>
              <p>1.</p>
              <p>Oh yes, I forgotten to annouce my sucessful acomplishment, I had sold this product to a 15 years old young teen at a price of S$170 by meeting her in a public area and all her to examine this wonderful piece of music player she is very happy with it and paid for it and also at the same time took away the bundled free gift with her.</p>
              <p>You stated that you had compared my sold product with the one at Apple store I will like to state that the refurbished version is clearly <strong>OUT OF STOCK</strong> for quite some time. For this reason, buyers who will like to have a iPod need to wait, and usually they will not be getting it since after the product is listed in Apple online store it will be quickly purchased away and the quantity are very limited.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is why for the fact that Apple online store offer lower price but at a very low quantity and people are unable to purchase this awesome gadget as such they seek alternative to get it in a shorter amount of time and is willing to fork out additional money for it  at $12.</p>
              <p>Also since I am providing cash on delivery at buyer convinience, I don't see how will I not match up with Apple free local delivery service as I even offer the service which allows buyers to check for cosmestic damages and reject it if desired. However apple store DO NOT permit that since you MUST PAY BEFORE THEY SEND IT TO YOU!</p>
              <p>2.</p>
              <p>I am clearly aware that Apple offer a lower price which is OUT OF STOCK, you are really a laughing stock. Since you are so well informed about the Apple product or you seems to be, you should know that Apple product have moisture indicator on the end of the headphone jack. If it is red, it had came in contact with moisture.</p>
              <p>SO since I offer buyer to check THEY WOULD HAVE KNOWN if the product is INTERNALLY DAMAGED as claimed by you.</p>
              <p>3.</p>
              <p>The software interface crop up? The software damage? How? Please enlighten me how will it happen immediately after he had checked that it is working and paid for the product when he DID NOT CONNECT it to a PC that may have virus to damage the SOFTWARE INSIDE THE IPOD? Huh? How?</p>
              <p>You may find it amusing but I don't seems to be finding it amusing as you may seems to be. You stated that how would you know the conditions of the ipods from Apple if you were not the user. COME ON, I am a user, you are just CONTRADICTING YOUR STATEMENT.</p>
              <p>Mr ~~~~~~~~, I HAD CLEARLY STATED THAT THE IPOD ARE SOLD IS CLEARLY NOT IN POSSESSION OF ANY SUPERNATURAL POWER IN MY PREVIOUS POST. Seems like you do not understand it. I stated that most of the prodcut that require warranty services are due to the fact of MISUSE, and it is true according to some articles from credible sources. I also stated that minority of product that require warranty issues are due to workmanship which are poor. BUT IN ANY SENSE USE YOUR BRAIN, WILL APPLE INC. BE SO DUMB TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS IN MILLIONS WHICH HAVE WORKMANSHIP PROBLEMS AND LOSE THEIR POSITION AS THE WORLD BEST TECH COMPANY BY SHARE VALUE?</p>
              <p>So I can really conclude that most people who use Apple product and require warranty services are due to the fact that they had misused their product.</p>
              <p>Also you stated that all company will go bankrupt if all people are not misusing their product. COME ON, PEOPLE WILL WANT TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE BY UPGRADING THEIR GADGET, so how will it GO BANKRUPT LIKE YOU HAD SUGGESTED?</p>
              <p>4.</p>
              <p>Oh yes, totally true. I did not frabricate any details and it is true. But like what I had mentioned, I provided the buyer who just bought my product 3 FREE HEADPHONES, 1 FREE CASE, WITHIN 3 HOURS MEET UP AT SELLER CONVIENCE, FREE CASE AND A DISCOUNT OF S$58. I think that it is enough to compensate for the  6 month less warranty since the extra 1 year warranty would have cost US$39 so in other words 6 months of warranty cost US$20. AND CLEARLY 3 FREE HEADPHONES, 1 FREE CASE, WITHIN 3 HOURS MEET UP AT SELLER 
              CONVIENCE, FREE CASE AND A DISCOUNT OF S$58 ARE WORTH MORE THAN US$20.</p>
              <p>Plus if buyer wants extra protection, he can get the APPLE PROTECTION PLAN AT ADDITIONAL US$39.</p>
              <p>Yes some cosmetic imprefection. Why the heck will APPLE INC. provide you with a replacement when they clearly stated in their warranty booklet that they DO NOT COVER cosmestic damages? AND IF YOU BOUGHT YOUR ITEM FROM APPLE, YOU CLEARLY KNEW THAT IT MAY HAVE COSMESTIC IMPERFECTION? Apple is smart enough to know that she is NOT OBLIGATED to warranty your product due to cosmestic damages.</p>
              <p>PLEASE ENLIGHTEN ME WHY SHOULD I SELL MY PRODUCT BACK TO APPLE WHEN IT PRODUCES THOUSANDS OF iPod TO SELL IT WORLDWIDE? AND APPLE KNEW THAT THE COST PRICE OF THIS PRODUCT IS LOW AND THEY SELL IT AT THIS HIGH PRICE TO PROFIT OTHERWISE WHY WILL THEIR SHARE PRICE BE HIGHER THAN MICROSOFT?</p>
              <p>So WHY SHOULD I SELL BACK TO APPLE WHEN THEY CAN BUILD ONE AT MAYBE S$10? WHO THE HECK WILL BE SO DUMB TO DO THAT?</p>
              <p>I WILL BE DAMN INTERESTED IN YOUR REPLY BUT YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO DO SO IF YOU THINK YOU ARE VERY WRONG AND I AM ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.</p>
