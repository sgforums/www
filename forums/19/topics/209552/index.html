            <div class='col-md body'>Our NEW Auto vent WORKS on Dark Tinted Glasses!<br><br>Why should I buy a Auto Vent for my car?<br>A working Auto Ventilator does not only lower temperature inside your car. There are proven scientific reports on air inside a car could be more contaminated than air outside, due to unfiltered air from exhaust fumes and chemical from your seats, equipment and air freshener.<br>Not only that. It is extremely unhealthy to enter a car parked under the hot sun and could cause skin problem in a long run.<br><br>Hottest Solar Powered Ventilator, Auto Cool...<br>The Hottest innovative product of the year could easily goto Auto Cool. Since the launch of this incredible god sent product, it caused an uproar and Auto Cool<br>was short on stock! Customers have to be placed on waiting list of up to 4 weeks while their china manufacturers are working hard on mass productions.<br>However, Auto Cool glory days are limited... as soon as most customers received their goods and eagerly put the product to test.. but to their dismay, the heavily advertised product doesnt works as describe on TV.<br><br>Soon enough, a local TV station has decided to broadcast a Test for Auto Cool, it clearly shows that Auto Cool not only does not vent hot air out instead, it<br>increased the temperature inside your car. Below is the URL to view the short test clip on YouTube.<br><br><a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=KQazefDVclE" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/watch?v=KQazefDVclE</a><br><br>Comparison between our Auto Vent VS  "As seen on TV" scam product Auto Cool:<br>China manufactured Auto Vent uses cheap thin flim PV (Amorphous) with a maximum output of 50mA under direct sunlight and the solar panel itself is incorporated inside a plastic case that breaks easily and has 0 output when blocked by tinted glass.<br><br><img src="http://www.renevous.com/autocool.jpg"><br><br>As you can see clearly, Auto Cool, solar panel is almost suitable to run solar powered calculator instead.<br><br>Our auto Vent uses Single Crystalline Silicon solar cells with Remote Array that generate up to1000mA output under direct sunlight and around 350-500mA when blocked by tinted glasses. We also use Japan branded motor fan name "Mabuchi" to assure that it vent out hot air effectively.<br><br><img src="http://www.renevous.com/pic1.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.renevous.com/pic2.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.renevous.com/pic3.jpg"><br><img src="http://www.renevous.com/pic4.jpg"><br><br>What caused the downfall of AutoCool?<br>Refer to the problems below:<br><br>1: Car has to park in an awkward position to get direct sunlight on the solar panel for it to work.<br><br>2: Hey! the fan moving... but no air is being vented out of the inlet.. why?<br>Caused: Because there is not enough power.<br><br>3: Auto vent fell off too easily and resulted in crack or damage to the case when you open/close the door.<br><br>4: What caused the increase in temperature?..<br>Cause: Fan was moving in a slow speed due to lack of power. Instead of venting air out, its actually circulating hot air inside your car.<br><br>5: Air Inlet is big, might cause security issue and water getting into the car when it rains..<br><br>6: Weak solar panel that does not even generate enough power.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Our Auto Vent are Improvise with Enhanced Features:  *All New Superior Quality Materials Only*<br><br>*Remote Array Solar Panel:<br>This solve problem for Dark Tinted glasses, as the solar panel could be placed anywhere you want, inside or outside the car.<br>With Remote array solar pad, you're NOT restricted to park your car in a position just to get sunlight on your solar panel.<br><br>*Superior Quality Crystalline Silicon Solar Cells :<br>Crystalline silicon solar cells does not only provide powerful solar output upto 1000mA.
