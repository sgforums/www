            <div class='col-md body'>How to differentiate when both real and fake are made in China?<br>Most Nike products are made in China, some are made in Vietnam. Will buying fake Nike that is made in China and buying real Nike that is made in China make any difference?<br>i read an article from Fortune magazine last year. It is not really fake because some are produced by the same factory in China.<br>For example:<br>Nike company in US ordered a company in China to make 100,000 pairs of sneakers but the company somehow produced 125,000. the extra 25,000 pairs are not authorized by the company and therefore are deemed fake by the Nike.<br>So the question: Is it really fake?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is actually very hard to determine if your sneakers are fake.<br>1. Unlike those branded Parisian or Italian high-ends label (LV, Prada, Hermes), Nike and adidas do not issue Cert of authenticity. Even now cert of authenticity can be faked but not close to the original one. Occasional typo error in fake cert and the quality looks very cheap. (example: Creed Green Irish Tweed is sold in CK Tangs for $268 per 75 ml. But in eBay US, you can find one 120 ml bottle at US$35 but with typo error Frich instead of Irish. these are obvious fake)<br>2. Only certain lines of adidas and nike are numbered (i.e. they are definitely limited editions and they have serial numbers. Nike lines that are limited edition and mostly faked are Nike SB. Adidas: Y3. Puma: I haven't seen Puma by Alexander Mcqueen being faked but I believe it exists). Unless you are a die-hard fan of Nike SB, don't buy any Nike SB that is less than $200. The limited SB can be sold for $1k+++.<br>3. Since you can only know the quality after you bought it and by that time it will be late to know that it is fake. check the buyer's feedback ratings (if you are using eBay or Yahoo). If the sellers sell so many limited edition shoes at cheap price or sell so many shoes of the same design. Beware. higher chance, they are fake<br><br>And if you are familiar with the product, check for typo error in the box and ask the sellers to give you more pictures. I don't think it matters if you buy Nike AF just for normal wear (not for sports).<br>fake nike is very cheap in China. I got one Super limited edition Nike SB for less than S$70 in China. Definitely fake but who cares. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
