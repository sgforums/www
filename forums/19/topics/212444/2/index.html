Actually please scroll to all your other replies and tell me how many were actually questions? You're delving way deeper into a thread which you obviously have no interest in, simply because you are one of those Singaporeans who simply does not know when to keep quiet because whatever's being said is way out of his/her league. You epitomize the lowest form of Singapore, the form that everyone is trying to get rid off actually.<br><br>Firstly you dont exactly have a stellar reputation in this forum, seeing that I can only guess that your last nickname (fyi everyone cyberrr1980 or something along those lines) was banned, causing you to be forced to make a new nickname. Your previous thread<br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=211752&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=211752&amp;page=0</a><br>wasnt exactly smittened with praises. There was a whole lot of criticism about your attitude in general actually. Have you provided any proof that those supposed "gold bars" you are selling are in fact real? Other than a bunch of pictures you've obviously taken from Google Images or somewhere else in the internet? No.<br><br>Secondly, I've already stated that I'm willing to guarantee that every single gemstone i sell is what i say it is earlier on in the thread, and that I'm willing to explain how to differentiate between gems to interested buyers, if they are to PM. Interested buyers. You are obviously just some 20 odd year old loser who has nothing better to do but to hang around in this forum trying to make a fool of yourself. Do you sound like an interested buyer?No, I don't think so. Do I therefore need to even talk to you? No. Should you even be replying in this thread then? No.<br><br>As compared to this, exactly what guarantees were you offering when you wanted to sell those "gold bars" of yours? Other forumers highlighted time and again the lack of certification present throughout your post and you just ignored them.<br><br>I've been backed up by both Master -_- as well as other forumers throughout this post, and yet you carry on with childish arguments.
