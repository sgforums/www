            <div class='col-md body'>no no. what are the ingredients<br><br>if you google the ingredients of all these "detox" and whatever, you will find one or two ingredients which cause health problems..<br><br>besides, it's been scientifically proven that "detox" things do not work.. the body can detox much better than ANYTHING we eat.. infact, most "detox" diets and pills only cause problems to the body...<br><br>the liver grabs the toxins and binds them with chemicals which are created by the body, making the stuff water-soluble.. then the kidney expels the toxins through urine... no food or supplement has come anywhere near the efficiency and effectiveness of these two vital organs...<br><br>and slimming, everyone just kids themselves with pills and all that.. the bottom line is that a simple equation holds true no matter what... if we burn more calories in our daily routine than we do eating, we will lose weight...<br><br>calorie blockers, carb blockers and all that, just mess up the whole system and i bet there are other ingredients in there which is duretic... causing one to lose a lot of water.<br><br>after the weight it lost, it'll quickly come back...<br><br>and that is VERY unhealthy...<br><br>ask any dietician who is worth their salt and not paid to advertise, they'll tell you that the only way to be healthy and lose weight is to eat right and exercise..<br><br>btw, these things are all classified as "health supplements" right?<br><br>that's a marketing thing.. health supplements do not need to be tested until someone suffers ill-effects from it.. think: ma huang and slim-10<br><br>i hope you do well, but please check each ingredient.. and be careful when taking the stuff.. and if you sell the stuff for a living, please check what you are selling and don't just take the word of your supplier for it...<br><br>be well yah?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thing is, there have been people selling stuff which "was safe" until people were complaining..<br><br>remember.. Slim 10 was okay until people died..<br><br>Atkins Diet was "revolutionary" until Atkins himself was found to be obese and his heart all clogged up...<br><br>all i'm saying is, sell it if you want, but do it with your eyes opened and with all your research done...<br><br>there was someone who asked about a product in the market.. listed out the ingredients...<br><br>a simple google search turned up ingredients which will probably cause a lot of scary things like anxiety attacks, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, headaches, low sugar counts..<br><br>you name it...<br><br>be careful and be well..<br><br>all yours...</div>
