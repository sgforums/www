            <div class='col-md body'>Everything too much of course not good, everyone knows that it's common sense. Btw in market there is diff level of value when u r talking abt something or item. of course u can just drink tea, but don't complain the effect is very little because of lower value. So u r actually paying the price of the value, if u r comfortable with wht u r having then it's okies loh.<br><br>Anyway this is for pples who r concern for their family, frenz or themself and would like to know more can e-mail for more detail.<br><br>So comments r free.
