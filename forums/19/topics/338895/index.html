              fail to settle payment , than town council will take your house and... sell it. don't really need to go to MP yet, just write a letter telling them that you intend to settle the payment by selling your house with in a set deadline. with that letter, the town council will have legit reason to extend the deadline for you to pay.
              
              But if they guai lan you, go find MP.

              <p>suggestion on how to get 5k in a few days:</p>

              <p>- borrow fr ur relatives and friends (be thick-skinned)</p>
              <p>- take on extra part time or freelance jobs that can pay u immediately</p>
              <p>borrowing fr ah long is stupid, because u're just repaying one debt, and setting urself up for another big debt to pay off. especially since the interest is abt 20 percent.</p>
              <p>have u tot abt what will happen if u suddenly need the money fr the sale of the house for smth and realise tt u can't pay back the ah long?</p>

              <p>but to borrow from ah long is not really a gd solution because after that u will be burdened by a lot of trouble in returning the debts. there are other options, like talking to MP, or even neogiating with the town council or sumthing like that. seriously u do not want to consider borrowing from Ah Long</p>

              <p>no the best solution thats for sure, 1stly, ah long repayment will have to be weekly, can you service that? at 5k repayment should be 6k and base on their usual practise you'll have to pay them ard 500 weekly at least.. can you afford that before your house is sold? also these days ah long wouldn't wanna give loan to just abt anybody and worst if you're looking for 5k, hardly any ah long would me willing to loan you that amount,</p>
              <p>take their advise and get your MP to come into the picture, if you can sell your house at the soonest possible time there is no reason why HDB wouldn't take it since they have the 1st take to your payment if you have a wirtten agremment with them..</p>
              <p>if you need property agent then maybe more ppl ard here can help...</p>
              <p>hope you resolved your problem soon...</p>

              <p>the fact tt u may actually lose ur house already shows tt ur old method of managing money sucks.</p>
              <p>try the first few methods i mentioned to get ur 5k. and after tt, go find a finance counsellor who can advise u on the proper way to deal wif financial matters</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; To those who type the above (READ: CATHYKITTY), not all who got stucked with financial situation caused by their own stupid act. I don't have to elaborate all this to you... Though I appreciate your thoughts, but don't JUMP to conclusion.</p>
              <p>Secondly, if everybody has lots of jewellery or if everybody's relative willing to help, they'll be nobody involve in Ah Long... I guess one day when you are in desperate needs you will understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
              <p>To the rest... thanks for advice/idea/consent/thought (whatever you all might call it) I appreciate it...</p>

              <p><br>sorry man. i suppose i did jump to conclusions.</p>
              <p>let me ask u one question: if u have a son who is in financial trouble, will u encourage him to borrow fr ah long? </p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; I guess one day when you are in desperate needs you will understand what I'm trying to say.</p>
              <p>how u know i've nv been in similar situation before? u also jump to conclusion hor?</p>
              <p>i know very well what's the impact of borrowing fr ah long on a family. it is frightening for family members, especially if u have creditors banging on ur door at nite. <em>but i dun suppose u will understand, until u have experienced it for urself. </em></p>
              <p>if u dun wanna listen, and are so selfish to not consider how borrowing fr loansharks will affect ur family, then u hao zi wei zhi. but dun regret when ur family members lose their respect for u.</p>
              <p>it doesn't even matter tt u can pay them back promptly. the fact is, they are illegal. if u dunno how to solve ur problems thru legal means, u borrow once, next time when u have financial crisis (touchwood la), u are likely to borrow fr them again.</p>
              <p>i really hope u dun have children of ur own now. i wonder what they will tink of a father like tt.</p>
