            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;"><br><img src="http://sgbulk.com/images/cubeworldmain.jpg"><br>If you thought Tamagotchi were ludicrously compelling, wait until you feast your eyes upon the crazy characters that inhabit Cube World. And no, that's not a new superstore that sells boxes; it's an interactive place where pixellated stick people live, play and pester each other.<br><br>Basically each Cube World contains a little pixellated stick man who lives and plays inside. There are four characters to collect and each one has a different hobby:<br><br>Slim plays with a stick<br>Dodger enjoys kicking his ball<br>Scoop interacts with his dog<br>Whip is a dab hand at rope tricks.<br><br><img src="http://www.sgbulk.com/images/custom/cubeworld/3th.jpg"><br>Buttons on the front of each Cube allow you to play games with your virtual stick man - everything from kick ups and pull ups to snake charming and juggling depending on the character, but he will also entertain himself depending on his mood. And that's something you can influence, because each cube features motion sensors that allow you to tumble your stick man around so that he falls around the screen. On a particularly rough day he might even bang his head against the wall, talk to Ralph on the great white telephone or shake his fist at you!<br><br><img src="http://www.sgbulk.com/images/custom/cubeworld/4th.jpg"><br><br>But here's the really clever bit: when Cube Worlds are connected the stick men will interact with each other and leap into neighbouring screens, completely unaided. You can arrange your cubes in any configuration as long as the cubes are touching squarely. Once linked you never know what the characters will do. Put Slim and Dodger together and they could play baseball; Scoop and Slim might play fetch with the dog and stick. Your stick men might even perform an synchronised dance routine, play leapfrog, have a group hug, a tug of war, or indulge in a full on punch up!.<br></span><span style="color: purple;"><br>Features:<br>No. of player : 1 Player<br>Game - Each Cube/Character has a game.<br>Motion Sensors - Play with and pester each Stick Character by shaking or tumbling the cube.<br>Connect - Build a world by connecting up to 16 cubes with the magnetic sides.<br>Transfer - Stick Characters can visit connected cubes.
