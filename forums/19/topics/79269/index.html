            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Next Generation Of Nalgene Bottles Have Arrived in Singapore!!! </strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">Ever complained about your 400ml Nalgene Bottle being too small? Have to refill many times to satisfy your everyday needs. Or the 1000ml one being a little too bulky to carry around? </span><br>Now right here in Singapore, I bring to you the Brand New N-Gen Bottle from Nalgene. Made in USA.  You will be one of the first to parade your new water bottle in your workplace, school or even around your neighbourhood!!! You will be the envy of everyone with such a nice bottle.<br><br><span style="color: darkred;">It is COMPACT and SMALL. It holds only 750ml of water. Just enough, not too little, not too much. </span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">It is just a little bigger than the narrow mouthed bottles Nalgene previous models. So you will not have the problem of spilling water all over yourself when drinking on the move. </span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">It have got a nice molded-in loop. Unlike the previous Nalgene bottles, you no longer have to worry about the cap joint being scratched or broken. This will never happen in a N-Gen bottle. The molded-in loop is a convenient spot to clip or just a simple and nice finger loop for simple, comfortable carrying. The cap is also made of a soft touch material for easy gripping. </span><br><br><span style="color: indigo;">It adds color to your life!!! Comes in 3 different Vibrant colours, Vibrant Violet, Fire Engine Red and Parrot Green. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">It is covered in a plastic coating when you first get it, each and everyone. That means you will not have the problem of going through every single piece in order to find the one with the least scratches on it, which is very common in the old Nalgene bottles. Every piece is virtually scratch free when you first get it, isn't that just Great!!! </span><br><br><span style="color: red;">Best of all, you will be the first few to be holding these bottles!!! This series have just been launched in the States and even over there there are still not many shops selling these even as many still have got the old Nalgene bottles to clear, so you can be said to be one of the first few in the world to be getting hold of these bottles!!! ( =) maybe exaggerating...hehe..) </span><br><br>And like all Nalgene bottles, it is<br><br>Made with Polycarbonate<br>Extremely durable<br>Resistant to staining<br>Resistant to retaining odors<br>Recommended for "extreme" adventures<br>Dishwasher Safe (top rack only)<br>Withstands temperatures from -135ÂºC (-211ÂºF) to 135ÂºC (275ÂºF)<br>All Nalgene products are Made in USA.<br><br>Look at the reviews from one of the magazine overseas. Reviews &amp; Awards:<br>"Thought it was impossible to build a better water bottle? Grab NALGENE's svelte new 24-ounce N-GEN. Made of the very same odor-free, ding resistant polycarbonate used in Nalgene's traditional wide-mouth, this downsized model is more ergonomic and stows more easily, plus the cap's integrated loop won't wear out on you."  - Outside Magazine, May 2004<br><br><span style="color: blue;">3 Days Money Back Guarantee. If within 3 days upon receiving your N-Gen bottles and you do not like the bottle in any way, I will do a full refund back to you less a restocking and processing fee of $5. No question asked. However, bottles returned must be in good condition with the plastic coating still intact and without obvious visible scratches. This is a promise I give to you because I believe you will like this bottle more than any others you have had before. </span><br><br>So hurry!!! What are you waiting for? Get one today.
