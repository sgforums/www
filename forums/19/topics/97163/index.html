            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I am looking to sell my Nissan presea.<br><br>Reason for selling, I just booked a Kelisa as I think a 1.6 car is not suitable for me as I drive short distances only.<br><br>The details are as follows<br><br>Manual 1992 version<br><br>COE till 08-2011<br><br>Road tax just renewed only and valid till 03-2005<br><br>Clutch, Clutch cable, Battery just changed. Everything has been serviced, aircon, engine etc ...<br><br>No. of transfers: 4<br><br>Accessories included:<br>Enkei Sport Rims<br><br>I am looking to sell at $24000. I am making a loss already as my full settlement is more than this amount and one can still take a 6.5 year loan on my car.<br><br>I will service the car fully before handing the car over. If interested, please reply to this post or PM me. You can also contact me at 97460618 in the evening.<br><br>I have checked out the latest prices and if you get from a dealer, you will be paying around $27,000 minimum, while im selling at $25,000 negotiable.<br><br>Please reply if you are interested. Thank you<br><br>More information for everyone who is interested in this sincere deal.<br><br>2) I will do up the car before selling it to you. There are some minor scractches on the paintwork as well as a few small dents to be honest, as it is a 12 year old car. I will throw in <strong>free repainting, colour of your choice (worth $900 ++) </strong>before i sell it to you, which is what i believe to be fair.<br><br>3) There are many items in my car that has already been changed.<br>a) maintanence free battery, which dealers most probably will not provide<br>b) change of clutch cable<br>3) enkei sports rims<br>These items are new and will last you.<br><br>4) Lastly and most importantly, my road tax is until march 2005. I do not believe you will be able to find a presea with a roadtax until the above date at the dealers. I am still driving the car around, therefore i have only recently renewed the road tax. This is an important point as it means you can still drive the car for the next 5 months without worries over road tax. Most dealers only offer roadtax for maybe 2 - 3 months at the most.<br><br>5) Budget!! If you loan $24000 @ current interest rates, with $0 downpayment, it would cost you around<strong> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">$387 - $400 per month </span></strong>for 6.5 year loan. If you loan from dealers @ current interest rates with $ 0 downpayment, you will have to pay <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">$435 - $470 per month</span></strong> for 6.5 years loan. If you buy from owners, it will definitely hit your budget.<br><br>6) I will settle all the paperwork involved so it means less hassle for you.<br><br>All these going for a price lower than what you find at the dealers. As mentioned earlier, I am intending to sell as I booked a Kelisa for my everyday driving.<br><br>So contact me, as well as all those who are interested in a really good deal.<br><br>Its $24000 with free repainting of color of your choice.<br><br>This is going out to all who are interested. I really want to sell my car so im throwing in the free repainting freebie. If you do not want the repainting, we can negotiate the price to be lowered.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>It is a COE car so it is not accident free (without minor dents ). However, as I mentioned, i will do it up before you take over, with a free paint job thrown in. If you have your own lobang and would prefer to do up the car yourself, we can definitely settle on a lower price.<br><br>Reason for selling<br>Im a teacher and a 1.6 car is not suitable for me. I am changing to a kelisa (1 litre) which is more suitable for me.<br><br>I will let it go at 23 000 ( negotiable ). Do feel free to contact me</div>
