Coordination, Teamwork and Bottom-up Approach.<br>7. Adaptation to Changing Environments.<br>8. Creativity and Entrepreneurship<br>9. Leverage on Strengths and avoidance of Weakness. (Sun Sze Art<br>of War)<br><br>A moment of reflection will no doubt reveal that these secrets of success are only personal qualities and not something which can be applied by staff or workers.<br><br>PRACTICAL PROBLEMS<br><br>To be efficient, tasks must be translated into daily work routines of every worker to bring about successful implementation in team work.<br><br>There are too many management concepts and theories e.g. Taylorism, FAYOL, Neurological systems, technical, Organization Theory, Human Relation Theory, Financial Control and Analysis, Management-by-objective, Planning concepts and premises, Operation Research, Quantitative and Scientific Approach, Breakthrough Principle, Uniqueness Principle, Standard Operating Procedures (ISO), Sun Sze Art of War etc.<br><br>These concepts and theories are complex leading to inefficiencies, fire-fighting, idling and office politics in the work place.<br><br>No wonder there are too many problems as epitomised by the following common work-place humours or jokes:-<br><br>1. Jumping to conclusion<br><br>2. Beating around the bush<br><br>3. Running down the boss<br><br>4 Going around in circles<br><br>5. Dragging their feet<br><br>6. Passing the buck<br><br>7. Climbing the ladder<br><br>8. Wading through paperwork<br><br>9. Pulling strings<br><br>10. Throwing their weight around<br><br>11. Stretching the truth<br><br>12. Bending the rules<br><br>13. Pushing their luck<br><br>Moreover, as unveiled in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the root cause of malpractices has been attributable to self-centredness.<br><br>WHAT IS OBJECTIVE-STEPS PROCESSING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM<br><br>The most urgent task in management today is to translate all goals and challenges into smaller attainable steps to avoid malpractices, hypocrisy, cover-ups, complexities and uncertainties.<br><br>Objective-steps processing management System (OSP) lays out tasks in their natural logical lego-like building blocks or steps:<br><br>OSP Step (1) Study of Ideas, (Feasibility, Plan, Outline, Scheme, Details)<br>OSP Step (2) Enquiry,(Specifications, tender)<br>OSP Step (3) Securing Contracts,<br>OSP Step (4) Contract Administration (10 departments),<br><br>Whatever is your business, you can manage tasks in step set up in forms (administration) and 10-department work forms (operations) as follows:-<br><br>1.(General) 2.(Human Resource) 3.(Revenue) 4.(Accounts) 5.(Marketing) 6.(Services-all contracted activities) 7.(Facility) 8.(Enforcement) 9. (Production) 10.(Compliance).<br><br>Today, many business enterprises are increasingly managed in component work processes e.g. banking, trading, travel-ticketing, designing, transportation, logistics, stock-trading, accounting, telecommunications, government services, court administration etc.<br><br>DEPARTMENT REPORTS (10 DEPARTMENTS)<br><br>These work processes are set up in forms and work forms are listed in OSP Process File List.<br><br>You then process all tasks in these component work processes generating quantified feedbacks i.e. "1" for non-attainment, "2" for attainment and "3" for corrective action to reach excellence.<br><br>The variances or "1s" are communicated in two-way communication 4-part task-lines with corrective closing action done by all worker at weekly interval.<br><br>COORDINATION AND KNOWLEDGE APPLICATION<br><br>The processing these tasks ensures quality-time-cost control to reach goals and objectives with coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>For those who are accustomed to accounting and financial controls, OSP provides a hands-on quality-time-cost control to enable them to oversee revenue, expenditure, cost saving, enforcement, logistics etc.<br><br>Management becomes hassle free with all busy bosses managing tasks with a macro-overview on 3-level short-rein process structure controlled by OSP Process File List as follows:-<br><br>Level 1: Management Report (call centre)<br>Level 2- Form processes generate objective factual feedbacks.<br>Level 3 - Work-form processes provide for coordination and knowledge application.<br><br>FINAL GOAL - ORGANIZATIONAL EFFICIENCY<br><br>A simple Clearance Form doubly ensures coordination replacing intuitions and ad hoc year-end financial post-mortem reporting which are too complex and uncertain and are usually too late to solve problems.<br><br>All government services can be managed objectively and accountably without justification, hypocrisy and look-good presentation.<br><br>Whether you are a boss, a CEO or a worker, you can now manage all tasks in 4 steps.

            <div class='col-md body'>To: Paperchicken,<br><br>I confirm that The book "Objective-Steps Processing Management System" is available at National Library.<br><br>THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF OSP WITH OTHER COMMON MANAGEMENT APPROACHES:-<br><br><span style="color: green;"><strong>As an example, Stephen P. Robbins in his book: "MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND APPLICATION, PAGE 149, advocated the following planning practices:-<br><br>(a) Planning is a process of determining objectives and the way these objectives can best be achieved.<br><br>(b) Planning gives direction, reduces impact of change, minimize waste and redundancy and sets standards to facilitate control.<br><br>(c) Strategic plans cover an extensive time period (usually 3 or more years), broad issues and include formulation of objectives. Operational plans cover shorter periods of time, focus on specifics and assumed that objectives are already known.<br><br>(d) Directional plans are preferred over specific plans when uncertainty is high and when organization is in its formative and decline life-cycle stages.<br><br>(e) 5 Contingency factors in planning: (1) Size of organization (2) ManagerÂ’s level in organization (3) Life stage of organization (4) Degree of environmental uncertainty (5) Length of future commitment.<br><br>(f) A manager should plan just far enough ahead to see through those commitments he or she makes today.<br><br>(g) An organizationÂ’s stated objectives may not be real.<br><br>(h) MBO converts overall organizational objectives into specific objectives for organizational units and individual members in four steps: (1) Goal setting (2) Action planning (3) Self-control (4) Periodic review.<br><br>(i) MBO makes motivators out of goals, because with MBO, people what is expected of them.<br><br>(j) MBO most likely to succeed when organizationÂ’s culture allows as high degree of individual initiatives, lots of direction support risks.<br><br>Mr. Stephen further advises taking of the following planning steps to realise the plans:-<br><br>PLANNING STEPS<br><br>(a) Being aware of opportunities: setting realistic objectives depends on this.<br>(b) Establish objectives: setting objectives for entire enterprise and then for each subordinate unit. Objective indicates the end point of what is to be done, where the emphasis is to be placed and what is to be done, where the primary emphasis and what is to be accomplished by a network of policies, procedures, rules, budgets, programs and strategies.<br>(c) Premising: To establish obtain agreement to utilize and disseminate critical planning premises. These are forecast data of a factual nature applicable basic policies or existing company plans. Premises are planning assumptions the future setting in which planning takes place. Forecast is important to premising: what kind of market will there be? What quantity of sales? What prices? What products?<br><br>It is essential to understand the premises or assumptions about planning as follows:-<br><br>PLANNING PREMISES<br><br>(a) 3 groups (1) Uncontrollable such as population growth, future price levels (2) Semi-controllable Â– firmÂ’s assumption as to share of market, character of labour turnover and labour efficiency (3) Controllable Â– expansion into new market, adoption of aggressive research program.<br>(b) Because the future environment is so complex, it would not be profitable or realistic to make assumptions about every detail of future environments in a plan. Therefore, premises must be as a practical matter limited to those which are critical, strategic to a plan that is which most influence its operation.<br>(c) Lack of planning coordination through use of manager of different sets of premises can be extremely costly to a company.</strong></span><br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>COMMENTS:-<br><br>The planning steps sound plausible ...but plans are mere assumptions which may or may not turn out to be the right direction.<br><br>Moreover, the real issue is how to carry out such planning concepts and assumptions without setting out supportive follow-through work processes.<br><br>How to carry out the plans will be the practical problems.<br><br>Without supportive work processes, staff and workers will continue to be wasteful in double-handling, waiting for instructions and delays.<br><br>Will the enterprise guide the staff to follow-up with performance and corrective actions on variances to reach results with minimal instructions or meetings?<br><br>Actual tasks are more than mere conceptual assumptions which will add to existing problems due to complexities and uncertainties.</strong></span><br><br>Read the "Computerized Process Management" to see how it captures all ideas, enquiries, contracts in a workflow for easy performance by all with coordination and knowledge. The self-follow through of tasks by staff is the only means to empower masses to accomplish tasks on their own to attain results.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://www.mardigrasgalveston.com/images/salute.gif"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.sgforums.com<img src="http://66.199.240.115/photos/tn/sgGirls.com_tn_-_00117655.jpg"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, good evening to you, Ito San,<br><br>Thanks for the encouragement. I hope many people who ever learn about process management will one day implement such processes to produce efficiency and teamwork.<br><br>My staff are very happy and efficient feeling confident in getting results. Customers are full of praises for them.<br><br>One ex-staff has actually confirmed in an email later to express her frustration that she missed my processing efficiency and guidance in the new environment.<br><br>Intuitive or ad hoc management is extremely stressful as such management is self-centred and staff cannot contribute his or her knowledge except to be subjected the will and desire of bosses.<br><br>Many bosses are managing tasks intuitively taking full charge of executions to fine details imposing penalties resulting in office politics and inefficiencies. In such a system, bosses and many people look very important and intelligent but employees may be waiting instead of contributing very much.<br><br>If people want to improve efficiency they must change such management environment. Or else, people just bear with them that is all. A sad tale of individualism and self-centredness.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://elcanillita.com/images/calendario.gif"></a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by robertteh:<br><strong>How to be efficient or competitive ?<br><br>It is easy as ABC. Well, just follow the one-page DIY hands-on managing process (World's first and only doable managing process) as described below and you will transform your works or business efficiency and productivity immediately:-<br><br>REVIEW OF MANAGEMENT PRACTICES<br><br>First, a quick overview of management practices. According to Mark Twain, Â“The secret of getting ahead is to get started. The secret of getting started is breaking your complex and overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one.Â”<br><br>However, old habits die hard. Many people still manage tasks intuitively or in an ad hoc manner based on concepts like Leadership, Controls, Talents, Foresight &amp; Insight etc.<br><br>But how do expect employees or workers to perform or manage tasks by intuition, leadership and talents when these precepts are conceptual, abstract and undefined?<br><br>Whatever your management approach may be, many complex tasks in our daily works have become attainable being made doable in component smaller tasks with linkages to quality-time-cost parameters as demonstrated in on-line banking, real-time accounting, e-trading, travel-ticketing, e-transportation, tradenet, CAD-CAM, systemic logistics, stock-trading, telecommunications etc.<br><br>DOABLE WORK PROCESSES<br><br>Hence, administrative tasks will become attainable or doable by laying them down in smaller doable components or processes i.e.:  (1) Study of Ideas, (2) Enquiry, (3) Securing Contracts and (4) Contract Administration (Operations).<br><br>Similarly, routine operations (in step 4) can be laid down in doable component core activities for follow-through processing to attain quality-time-cost parameters defined within ten departments, namely: 1.(General)   2.(Human Resource)   3.(Revenue)   4.(Accounts)  5.(Marketing)  6.(Services-all outsourced activities)  7.(Facility)   8.(Enforcement)  9. (Production)   10.(Compliance) as follows:-<br><br>1.	Identify your department's  tasks in 3-4 Core Activities.<br>2.	Make core activities doable in 2-3 quality-time-cost parameters.<br>3.	Perform these Core Activities (guided by flow-chart work forms) to attain parameters.<br><br>Setting up tasks in universal doable work processes, i.e. dividing tasks in doable components and linking each to logical quality-time-cost parameters, all administration and operation can be followed through in sequential or logical workflow (in work forms) monitored by one-page department report generating feedbacks at the same time as Â“1Â”, Â“2Â” or Â“3Â” (or percentages) representing Â“non-attainmentÂ”, Â“attainmentÂ” and Â“excellent attainmentÂ” of parameters.<br><br>Such processing leads to accountability and transparency at every level doing away with intuitive egotism, called leadership or talents by some but are actually full of biased justifications and self-promoting reporting.<br><br>The variances "1s" or problems can be corrected in teamwork monitored by a two-way interactive communication task-line to attain results.<br><br>SEQUENTIAL WORK FORMS<br><br>Because the usual management environment is Intuitive and ad hoc giving rise to inefficiencies and malpractices, it becomes important or critical to take control of all tasks and monitor them to get results in doable processes set up in : (1) administrative forms, - head office (2) department reports - operations (3) work forms - knowledge application.<br><br>Each task will then be performed in easy processes with coordination (teamwork) and knowledge application (mass participation) to reach organizational efficiency.<br><br>Thus, by managing your operations (say production department) to monitor (1) manpower, (2) programs, (3) equipment and (4) work schedules, you will reach your organizational efficiency (as opposed to individual) to transform your works or businesses to get results.<br><br>TOTAL MANAGEMENT Â– COORDINATION AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED MANAGEMENT<br><br>Within three months of processing management, you will realize a transformation - self-motivated employees or colleagues capable of eliminating all the complexities, fuzziness or office politics caused by self-centredness, regulations, handbooks, SOPs, bureaucracy and controls which only stifle growths, creativity and entrepreneurship.<br><br>(Hi, the above-mentioned management process has been successfully implemented by me and people who came to know of such doable process.

The secret of getting started is breaking down your complex and overwhelming tasks into small manageable tasks and then starting on the first one."[/b]<br><br>However, most people manage tasks in an ad hoc manner, relying on impulse or intuition. This is evident from slogans that are commonly bandied about, such as:<br><br>(a) Focus and consistency<br>(b) Positive work attitude<br>(c) Foresight and insight<br>(d) Supportive environment<br>(e) Passion and determination<br>(f) Proactive hands-on approach<br>(g) Coordination<br>(h) Teamwork and bottom-up approach<br>(i) Adapting to changing environments<br>(j) Creativity and entrepreneurship<br>(k) Leveraging on strengths and avoidance of weakness.<br><br>Notwithstanding the obvious wisdom of such advice, these are nevetheless abstact attributes. Operational manuals, standard operating procedures, policies and decisions are often adopted because they look good rather than because they are effective.<br><br>The prevalence of an intuitive management approach may be attributable to the common habit of equating success to individual efficiency.<br><br>But, if you look around, you will come across many objectively-defined work processes that are taking over tradtional tasks with increased efficiency and productivity, such as online banking,, real-time ticketing, automations, telecommunications, computerized management and accounting applications and so on.<br><br>Enterprise activities may similarly be carried out in established small steps such as study of ideas, enquiry, securing contracts and contract administration (operations).<br><br>Studying of ideas may be carried out through forms for every staff member to submit his problem-solving ideas. This method also encourages mass participation.<br><br>Making enquiries can be performed using a quotation or tender form. This can facilitate the process of identifying and seeking after opportunities.<br><br>The third step, securing contracts, will result in proper evaluation and acting on opportunities by calculated risk.<br><br>Finally, contracts can be laid out in parameter-defined functional departments such as human resource, revenue, accounts, marketing, services (for all outsourced activities), facility, enforcement, production, compliance and a general category. This is to facilitate consistent and focused performance.<br><br>A typical department report may be set up to oversee operational tasks as follows:-<br><br><ul>Identify three or four core activities for consistent and focused performance<br></ul><br><ul>Assign two to three quality-time-cost parameters to make each core activity easy<br></ul><br><ul>Perform core activities according to time-schedules and parameters set up<br></ul><br><ul>Inspect or oversee performance in time-schedule and parameters.<br></ul><br><ul>Assess and provide quantified feedback on performance. You may want to rank them in percentages, with scales representing non-attainment, attainment and excellent attainment of parameters.</ul><br><ul>Submit all non-attainment performance areas in department reports with corrective actions.</ul><br><br>With these measures, a business can oversee overall tasks without hassles and regulate quality and standards in sequential work processes which are laid out in work forms and integrated to departmental parameters.<br><br>Having work processes defined and logged in a report enables personnel to engage in two-way interaction. It will also encourage mass participation and knowledge application.<br><br>This allows the company to have more control of its overall activities. It can practise total management and attain organizational efficiency as all requests, complaints and problems are input properly and processed holistically in self-regulated processes.<br><br>It is much more efficient and productive to process input tasks in department reports, application forms, work orders, quotations, salary, contracts, budget control and so on.<br><br>Inter-departmental activities are coordinated through a one-stop standard clearance form, thus saving on manpower.<br><br>Such a total management style enables management to forge consensus with a sense of fair-play. It also offers a practical means to ameliorate or resolve disputes, differences in opinion and hidden agenda.<br><br>The breakdown and malfunctioning of essential services can be avoided or minimised with hands-on time-scheduled corrective actions.<br><br>Inaction or tolerance of intuitive management habits exact a heavy toll on human captial in the form of wasted resources, office politics, fire-fighting or fault-finding.<br><br>Start managing your tasks with processes laid out in objective steps. Be an asset to your organization and make a difference to your workplace.<br><br>Article contributed by Robert Teh Kok Hua, who is author of Objective-Steps Processing Management System.

Operational plans cover shorter periods of time, focus on specifics and assumed that objectives are already known.<br><br>(4) Directional plans are preferred over specific plans when uncertainty is high and when organization is in its formative and decline life-cycle stages.<br><br>(5)  5 Contingency factors in planning: (1) Size of organization (2) ManagerÂ’s level in organization (3) Life stage of organization (4) Degree of environmental uncertainty (5) Length of future commitment.<br><br>(6)  A manager should plan just far enough ahead to see through those commitments he or she makes today.<br><br>(D-2) BY PLANNING STEPS<br><br>(1)  Being aware of opportunities: setting realistic objectives depends on this.<br>(2)  Establish objectives: setting objectives for entire enterprise and then for each subordinate unit.

These are forecast data of a factual nature applicable basic policies or existing company plans. Premises are planning assumptions the future setting in which planning takes place. Forecast is important to premising: what kind of market will there be? What quantity of sales? What prices? What products?<br><br>(4)  Premises are arranged in 3 groups (1) Uncontrollable such as population growth, future price level (2) Semi-controllable Â– firmÂ’s assumption as to share of market, character of labour turnover and labour efficiency (3) Controllable Â– expansion into new market, adoption of aggressive research program.<br><br>(5)  Because the future environment is so complex, it would not be profitable or realistic to make assumptions about every detail of future environments in a plan. Therefore, premises must be as a practical matter limited to those which are critical, strategic to a plan that is which most influence its operation.<br><br>(6)  Lack of planning coordination through use of manager of different sets of premises can be extremely costly to a company.<br><br>(F) BREAKTHROUGH APPROACH<br><br>Wide-ranging macro-level management skills are imparted by management writers and researchers to differentiate between various needs in practical result-oriented management approaches.<br><br>ADMINISTRATIVE, TECHNICAL AND SPECIALIST SKILLS<br><br>There is an unending array of administrative and technical management skills to suit different situations as given below:-<br><br>Managing TodayÂ’s IT and Technical Professionals<br>Managing a World-Class IT Department<br>Information Technology for the Non-IT Executive<br>Enhancement Skills<br><br>Fundamentals of Strategic Planning<br>Innovation and Creativity: How to Improve Performance and Foster Growth<br>Interviewing Skills for Managers and Supervisors<br>Managing a Multicultural Team<br>Women in Business: Strategies for Success<br>Coaching and Counseling for Outstanding Job Performance<br>How to Build a More Positive Work Environment<br>Planning and Managing Organizational Change<br>Strategies for Effective Problem Solving and Decision Making<br>Moving from an Operational Manager to a Strategic Thinker<br>Creating High Performing Teams Using the MBTIÂ® Instrument<br>Confronting the Tough Stuff: Advanced Management Skills for Supervisors<br>Mastering Organizational Politics, Influence and Alliances<br><br>OTHER MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE<br><br>Other technical detailed functional knowledge are regularly taught in certain areas:-<br><br>A ManagerÂ’s Guide to Human Behavior<br>The Complete Training Course for Managers<br>Communication Skills for Managers<br>Corporate Governance: What it Means for Managers<br>New!
