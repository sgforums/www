In SG everyone is too busy to read up on how to manage. Many people believe in ad hoc or self-centred judgmental management.<br><br>I hope you will find time to set up a call-centre book (or Management Report) and begin processing all your daily tasks in it.<br><br>All you need to do is to think simple and straightforward; leave all and whatever forms or processes you have alone. You don't have to do much about them but add a reference code to each for processing in "Input" and follow-up in "Output" of MR.<br><br>The above-stated sequencing of tasks in steps through existing forms that you have will comprise the entirety of your OSP as described in the pages. Indeed you can become competitive once you process all tasks in 3 major steps and 1 delegated contract administration step through the MR.<br><br>That is all you need to do. Read up the pages again in your own time to double check what I say here. You will soon take control of tasks and work towards results without being affected by complexities or uncertainties, the bane to competitive management.<br><br>Tell all your friends to come here to read this and if you all are really keen to be efficient as my staff are, I am quite willing to show you the powerpoint plus issuing you the forms and work forms to process tasks at nominal book price.

            <div class='col-md body'>ANOTHER VIEW OF MANAGEMENT<br><br>Given below is another conceptual management where tasks are defined along functional lines e.g. human resource, operational, marketing, financial..<br><br>As can be seen, the divisions of tasks into functions are too narrow or technical and are conceptual in nature. These functions being devoid of follow-through processes that can be performed naturally by workers are difficult of implementation.<br><br>Hence, divisions of tasks along functional line are conceptual and cannot be applied to actual works or management.<br><br>QUOTE:<br>Management" (from Old French, "mÃ©nagement"="the art of conducting, directing", from Latin "manum agere"="lead by the hand") characterises the process of leading and directing all or part of an organization, often a business one, through the deployment and manipulation of resources (human, financial, material, intellectual or intangible). One can also think of management functionally: as the action in measuring a quantity on a regular basis and adjusting an initial plan and the actions taken to reach one's intended goal. This applies even in situations where planning does not take place. Situational management may precede and subsume purposive management.<br>[Top]<br>Historical Development<br><br>Some writers trace the development of management thought back to Sumerian traders and ancient Egyptian pyramid builders, but modern management as a discipline began as an off-shoot of economics in the 19th century. Classical economists like Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill provided a theoretical background to resource allocation, production, and pricing issues. About the same time, innovators like Eli Whitney, James Watt, and Matthew Boulton developed technical production elements such as standardization, quality control procedures, cost accounting, interchangeability of parts, and work planning. By the middle of the 19th century people like Robert Owen, H. Poor, and M Laughlin introduced the human element with theories of worker training, motivation, organizational structure and span of control.<br><br>By the late 19th century marginal economists like Alfred Marshall and Leon Walras introduced a new layer of complexity to the theoretical underpinings of management. The first tertiary-level course in management was offered in 1881 by J. Wharton. By 1900 we find managers trying to place their theories on a thoroughly scientific basis. Examples include H. Towne's Science of management, Frederick Winslow Taylor's Scientific management, Frank Bunker Gilbreth's Science of motion study, and Henry L. Gantt's charts. J. Duncan wrote the first college management text book in 1911.<br><br>The first comprehensive theories of management appeared around 1920. People like H. Fayol and A. Church described the various branches of management and their inter-relationships. In the 1920s and 1930s people like O. Tead, W. Scott and J. Mooney applied the principles of psychology to management. Also in the early 20th century people like Elton Mayo, M. Follett, C. Barnard, Max Weber, Rensis Likert, and Chris Argyris applied the principles of sociology to management.<br><br>H. Dodge, R. Fisher, and T. Fry introduced statistical techniques into management. In the 1940s, Patrick Blackett combined these statistical theories with microeconomic theory and spawned the science of operations research was born. Operations research, sometimes known as "management science", has attempted to make a science of some aspects of management.<br><br>Some of the more recent developments include the theory of constraints, reengineering, and various information technology driven theories such as agile software development. The theory of constraints approach to management boils the effort down to a repetitive cycle of three basic questionsÂ—What to change? To what to change to? How to make the change happen?<br><br>At the end of the 20th century, management was seen as consisting of the following six subcategories:<br><br>1. Human resource management<br>2. Operations or production management<br>3. Strategic management<br>4. Marketing management<br>5. Financial management<br>6. Information Technology management<br><br>In the 21st century we find it increasingly difficult to think in terms of these six categories. More and more processes simultaneously involve several categories. Instead, we tend to think in terms of the various processes, tasks, and objects that one can manage.<br>[Top]<br>Different varieties/objects of management<br><br>* Change management<br>* Communications management<br>* Constraint Management<br>* Cost management<br>* Crisis management<br>* Customer relationship management<br>* Earned value management<br>* Enterprise management<br>* Facility management<br>* Integration management<br>* Knowledge management<br>* Marketing management<br>* Micromanagement<br>* Pain management<br>* Perception management<br>* Procurement management<br>* Program management<br>* Project management<br>* Process management<br>* Product management<br>* Quality management<br>* Resource management<br>* Risk management<br>* Scope management<br>* Skills management<br>* Spend management<br>* Supply chain management<br>* Systems management<br>* Time management<br>* Stress management<br><br>[Top]<br>See Also:<br><br>* Adhocracy<br>* Engineering management<br>* Management consulting<br>* Management development<br>* Management Technology<br>* Middle management<br>* Poor management<br>* Senior management<br>* Strategic management<br>* Virtual management<br>* Peter Drucker's management by objectives<br>* Eliyahu M.

At the risk of exposing myself as an ignoramous, I admit that I do not understand the majority of your posts.<br><br>I hate to say this, but i think most of your posts are filled with too much 'management speak'. large parts of your posts are gobbledeegoook to me i'm afraid. Now I think you need to review why you are posting. If it is to communicate to others your ideas, then I think you are going to achieve only llimited success. This is due to the fact that most (ithink) people dun understand what you are saying.</div></blockquote>I agree that it is a case of emperor's new clothes in our system. It is not easy to see one's own fault or shortcomings no matter how enlightened or intelligent one may be.<br><br>Therefore, I must admit the in my postings about process management, I might have committed certain errors too like the emperor's new clothes.<br><br>Anyway, I would take this opportunity to explain certain things about my posting.<br><br>I wish to say that my objective is not to impose any management ideas or concepts on anyone. Rather I had posted strongly in some instances on process management to show that there are alternative solutions to many of our current top-down intuitive autocracy based on the man and his ideas system or belief.<br><br>In my opinion any management or government that is based on such self-centred policies and intuitive controls practised by our top-down system of government will only achieve so much and no more. It has a lot of limitations.<br><br>Process management called OSP was posted at thread "Practical Efficiency and Productivity" in Market Place of this forum having been published in the Recruit of ST on 27.12.2004 of the same name. People may not find process management useful because of prevalent past habits with intuitive decisions and ad hoc management practices. It may take some time for people to discover its usefulness to go for processes to be objective, accountable and involve the whole team to produce implementation efficiency and results.<br><br>In Singapore, because we are too strongly based on intuitive personal efficiency, we have been encountering a great deal of problems with implementation to date. Many governemnt policies or economic restructuring plans do not receive the fullest implementation support of all staff of the whole governemnt because they have remained as intuitive - policies or assumptions. I need not elaborate for its merits or demerits as I believe my posts at Market Place of this forum can be read and verified by many of its own rationale and merits. May be it will take time and patience for people to test out the process management beneifits.<br><br><blockquote><strong>have you not realized that large numbers of your threads have very few relevent replies and that there have been very few responses to the specific issues raised in your posts?<br><br>Maybe Its me. I certainly do not have a business background. But i certainly do not consider myself illiterate.<br><br>In this case what you are saying is:<br><br>1)Develop the potential of our workers so that they become more highly skilled.<br><br>2)Be more efficient and increase productivity<br><br>3)Leaders should be mission orientated. How?</strong></blockquote>In posting in forum, we are all equal. My opinions are not higher than anyone. I feel that you should not feel constrained in any way by my views on management as they are just my opinions. Just be patient and read my rationale in those posts mentioned and test out the ideas if you will.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You said<br>---<br>"through internalizing natural efficiency and knowledge applications and teamwork into attainable accountable and transparent work processes."<br>---<br>wtf does that mean?  wtf is 'natural efficiency' and 'knowledge applications'?  I guess you are saying:<br><br>Have a focus on efficiency and applying knowledge (meaning wat? being able to apply what you help you complete the task at habnd?) and teamwork at every level. Set realistic targets, and monitor progress towards those targets.?</strong></blockquote>The existing management habits are too much entrenched in selfness and intuitions or talents or ability of individuals or the man at the helm or one man show. If we want to be good efficient or excellent or competitive, such a system will not work.<br><br>The alternative is to enable or empower staff through setting work processes so that they can take over the implementation if not part of the decisions making at the operation level. If Singapore is to succeed in competing with the world competitiveness, I personally believe it has to avoid and tone down on individualism and  top-heavy management system depending on one-man become efficient or competitive.<br><br>To do so, there has to be enabling work processes with organizations practising delegations through open and accountable work processes instead of going for micro-management as seen happening too often in our system.<br><br><blockquote><strong>You also said:<br><br>---<br>"Empower all staff and people and try not to be over-judgmental or overtake them with assumptions, ideas and concepts which at the end will only restrict creativity, entrepreneurship and contributions.<br><br>Mistakes in education streaming, CL2, over-promotion of academic talents at the expense of practical knowledge applications and oversight in economic restructuring to value-adding high technology model are all caused by top-down system which restrict our scholars  to move more shiftly and creatively forward to reach higher plain."</strong></blockquote>Many policies of our government did not succeed because there are abstract ideas, concepts or assumptions not easily understood or implemented by all.<br><br>There have been many feedbacks in forum pages of Straits Times on this topic - all talks and no actions or lack of midfielders in our systems.<br><br>It is sad but true that after many years we still hear a lot about the same policy and nothing much was accomplished due to lack of attainable empowering work processes below the senior officers or leaders to make things happen.<br><br>I have suggested in many posts how the policies should be made more attainable in processes. Read my posts about "Leaderships" at Market place.<br><br>---<br><br><blockquote><strong>huh?<br><br>Do you mean:<br><br>Leadesr should not stifle the Staff but should allow them leeway to contribute and exhibit creativity and entrepreneurship. To this end, Leaders should be open-minded and not stick rigidly to their own ideas and concepts.<br><br>(The governemnt) has made many mistakes.<br><br>In education, some of these mistakes include the streaming system, recent de-emphasis on the chinese langauge(?).  Other mistakes include over estimating the value of academic ability. Evidence of this policy is seen in the way the govt overpromotes scholars.<br><br>All of these have had a negative impact on Sinagpore. For isntance, you think there is an inability among many to apply their knowledge in a practical manner.<br><br>An oversight in economic restructuring to a value-adding high technology model have been caused by a rigid system of micro-management that has stifled out scholars. They are unable to exercise creativity, etc and their develpment have been handicapped as a result.<br><br></strong></blockquote>Our society has to change a lot of its past management habits and practices on developing personal efficiency, abilities and talents.<br><br>Such a system is too individualistic and cannot bring about change. Change can happen only in my opinion through the intervention of process management where staff will know what to do and how to implement all decisions and policies. We have as a top-down management system neglected coordination and mass knowledge applications which can happen only when all are practising process management. I hope you will now understand a little more about my posts concerning management.</div>

So human resource practices are to that extent unable to contribute effectively to good corporate governance.<br><br>To become more competitive, it is essential to recognise the shortcomings of relying on intuitions and judgmental and ad hoc staff's performance appraisal.<br><br>(Source:-MANAGEMENT CONCEPTS AND APPLICATION,<br>2ND EDITION, STEPHEN P. ROBBINGS 1988.<br>PAGE 149, PLANNING}<br><br>(a) Planning is a process of determining objectives and the way these objectives can best be achieved.<br><br>(b) Planning gives direction, reduces impact of change, minimize waste and redundancy and sets standards to facilitate control.<br><br>(c ) Strategic plans cover an extensive time period (usually 3 or more years),<br>broad issues and include formulation of objectives. Operational plans cover shorter periods of time, focus on specifics and assumed that objectives are already known.<br><br>(d) Directional plans are preferred over specific plans when uncertainty is high and when organization is in its formative and decline life-cycle stages.<br><br>(e) 5 Contingency factors in planning: (1) Size of organization (2) ManagerÂ’s level in organization (3) Life stage of organization (4) Degree of environmental uncertainty (5) Length of future commitment.<br><br>(f) A manager should plan just far enough ahead to see through those commitments he or she makes today.<br><br>(g) An organizationÂ’s stated objectives may not be real.<br><br>(h) MBO converts overall organizational objectives into specific objectives for organizational units and individual members in four steps: (1) Goal setting (2) Action planning (3) Self-control (4) Periodic review.<br><br>(i) MBO makes motivators out of goals, because with MBO, people what is expected of them.<br><br>(j) MBO most likely to succeed when organizationÂ’s culture allows as high degree of individual initiatives, lots of direction support risks.<br><br>Objective and hands-on quality-time-cost controls, regular inspections and feedbacks and coordination and knowledge applications will effectively lessen personal biases usually caused by intuitions of managers and supervisors.<br><br>(D) BY PLANNING STEPS<br><br>(a) Being aware of opportunities: setting realistic objectives depends on this.<br><br>(b) Establish objectives: setting objectives for entire enterprise and then for each subordinate unit. Objective indicates the end point of what is to be done, where the emphasis is to be placed and what is to be done, where the primary emphasis and what is to be accomplished by a network of policies, procedures, rules, budgets, programs and strategies.<br><br>(c) Premising: To establish obtain agreement to utilize and disseminate critical planning premises. These are forecast data of a factual nature applicable basic policies or existing company plans. Premises are planning assumptions the future setting in which planning takes place. Forecast is important to premising: what kind of market will there be? What quantity of sales? What prices? What products?<br><br>PLANNING PREMISES<br><br>(a) 3 groups (1) Uncontrollable population growth, future price level (2) Semi-controllable Â– firm's future share of market, character of labour turnover and labour efficiency (3) Controllable Â– expansion into new market, adoption of aggressive research program.<br><br>(b) Because the total management and future environment are complex, it would not be realistic to make too iron-clad assumptions in a plan. Therefore, premises must be limited to what are the most critical, strategic to a plan that influence the results.<br><br>(c) Lack of planning coordination among different sets of interrelated functions and premises can be extremely costly to a company.<br><br>Just ponder over the above-stated management courses, skills, organizational functions and planning precepts and decide how you could use OSP work processes set up in forms and work forms to implement various conceptual management solutions to problems.<br><br>(E) BY CREATIVE AND BREAKTHROUGH APPROACH<br><br>Many people like to talk about leadership and good corporate governance and CREATIVE MANAGEMENT as part of their management philosophy.
