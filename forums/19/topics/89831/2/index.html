Perhaps as lawyers and inexperienced corporate people, they are without views or passions in such areas and are waiting for further meetings and instructions.<br><br>It is critical to oversee tasks on the simple short-rein 3-level monitoring as seen below:-<br><br>Level (1) CALL CENTRE (Management Report)<br>Level (2) Department Reports or Forms. (Supervision/Feedbacks)<br>Level (3) Work Forms(Knowledge application)<br><br>Instead of telling all the ministers to come up with more and more ideas and some conceptual thinking, just attend to all existing unfulfilled policies and objectives with in-built coordination and knowledge applications through one-page Management Report (MR) in documentation thus:-<br><br>(1) Serial No. (2) Date (3) Code [Dept] (4) In - input (5) Out - Output.<br><br>Each minister should follow through all major challenges consistently with focus and oversee the whole tasks in sequence of "input" and "output" through call centre administrative and work forms. There is no workload created but only results and attainments coming through being hands-on and guided processes keeping track of doable and attainable actions.<br><br>Ministers should show all the status of performances and attainment through the Call-Centre OSP Process File List to the whole cabinet and finally be accountable to citizens of non-actions or failures.<br><br><a href="http://www.imbuddy.com&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;http://www.imbuddy.com<img src="http://www.imbuddy.net/buddyicons/1/111094999.gif"></a><br><br><a href="http://www.findSingapore.net/forum" rel="nofollow">http://www.findSingapore.net/forum</a> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

However apart from rhetorics about leadership and talents or the need to apply knowledge and technological excellence, considerable practical problems are encountered to restructure the company.<br><br>Recently there is more talk that "Efficiency and Productivity is not enough. The hard fact is "not enough is being done even about basic efficiency or productivity so how to talk about any innovative spirit or getting to solve bigger problems".<br><br>With all the hype about leadership, talent, or innovation, one should ask a more practical question finally: - HOW TO DO IT.<br><br>After reviewing the leadership and talent and all the public policies attempted it would seem that everything has been rhetoric and little about doing and management excellence.<br><br>What is the key to success ? Certainly not any more talks about ideas and more talents. Many companies simply have too many ideas, policies and plans but little actions or results. What need to be done which will enable the whole team to perform tasks with motivation ?<br><br>Many practical difficulties are actually attributable to self-centred biases and prejudices. If only one is prepared to be objective and carry out tasks naturally sequentially there would be improvements and results:-<br><br>(1)   Just do it. Manage tasks in your processes via your staff.<br><br>(2)   Go for actions and results.<br><br>(3)   Don't just talk but let your staff carry them out through these processes.<br><br>(4)   Treasure your staff and develop them to the fullest.<br><br>(5)   Before calling in consultant or guru to re-structure company in above-stated processes that will motivate staff and put the basics right.<br><br>---------------------------- after 3 months ---------------------------------<br>After exhausting the above-stated options, what else. Have you produced the desired results?<br><br>(1)   Are tasks delegated to staff through processes?<br><br>(2)   Are you allowing staff to coordinate, communicate or apply knowledge ?<br><br>These questions have been asked in the above-stated 10 case studies.<br><br>Company usually have no lack of ideas but because staff are not delegated properly in coordinating and knowledge application processes they are kept in the dark waiting to be empowered to work for you. The OSP work processes will provide the missing link to arrive at motivational knowledge-application in your works and services as established by you.<br><br><a href="http://&lt;img%20src=">" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"&gt;<img src="http://www.prankgag.com/funny.gif"></a></div>

Is there something they can do in their management so as to produce excellent products and services which are technologically value-adding and advanced.<br><br>The most competitive countries include USA, Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, France, Holland, Japan and Korea, Taiwan where businesses are actively applying new technologies in all aspects of the economy to earn higher standards of living.<br><br>How do the people in these countries strive to make their people more creative, entrepreneurial or innovative?<br><br>Here is a calendar of events on this topic:-<br><br>CHRONOLOGY OF MASTER-PLAN AND CORPORATE CHANGES:-<br><br>(1) 5.3.2005 - Government announced its 10-year masterplan IN2015 to chart the direction for infocomm technology.  After a while there is no more news about technology applications or new start-ups. What happen to this plan?<br><br>(2) EDB has been sending many scholars overseas to get them to become our new leaders of the future. What has happened to these scholars? Have they returned by now and started some new technology start-ups and created new jobs?<br><br>(3) MOE was supposed to have offered many foreign students new incentives and scholarships to study and find jobs here. Have these foreign talents served our objectives and succeeded in creating jobs and uplifted our people's competitiveness? What is the latest development? How many of them have succeeded in our objectives for us to do better ?<br><br>RECENT NEWS ABOUT FOREIGN TALENTS :-<br><br>Top Job Location for Silicon Valley Chinese Americans is Shanghai<br><br>News Report, Nancy Kuo,<br>World Journal, Mar 04, 2005<br>Which is the best location for personal career development according to Silicon Valley Chinese American semi-conductor professionals? The answer is Shanghai.<br><br>According to a recently released report, Shanghai, China's cosmopolitan and commercial hub, is viewed by Chinese American professionals as the city poised with the best development future. The USA, Taiwan and Beijing follow behind as choice locations. Among the decision factors to evaluate a job location, the most important is the potential for growth. The second is family and the third is quality of life.<br><br>The report further points out among all those surveyed, that half work in at least two locations. 93% work in America. Chen Jien Yun, a Taiwan University researcher and visiting scholar with the Stanford Project on Regions of Innovation and Entrepreneurship pointed out 51% of those surveyed work in one location, 34% work in two, 10% work in three, 4% work in four locations. There was also 1% who commute between five working locations. Thus, there seems to be quite many "seagulls", who fly between Silicon Valley and the Pacific Rim.<br><br>One point worth mentioning ,according to Chen, is people who had not worked in Taiwan do not want to work there. But those who hadnÂ’t worked in Beijing, still hold Taiwan, not Beijing as their least favorable career location. But whatever one's background, all held favorable views on Shanghai. Among those who had college degrees from China, Taiwan and U.S., all want to work in Shanghai. Their corresponding rates are 62% (China) 39%%(Taiwan) and 47%(U.S.)<br><br>"First choice still is Shanghai,Â” says Mr. Wu, past president and advisor for Chinese-American Semi-conductor Professional Association. Wu had served in Shanghai the past three years. He pointed out when Chinese American professionals decide on a change of work location, Shanghai is a first choice whether it was based on growth potential, family factors or quality of life.<br><br>"Shanghai's various conditions are the closest to America's, it is the best choice for a change of professional stage," another association past president , Mr. Wang pointed out. Shanghai has talents from other countries, and different cuisines. Whether one comes from Silicon Valley, Taiwan or other places, whether one comes to start up a business or be employed in one the adjustment is easier.<br><br>This survey is a joint project of the Chinese American Semi-conductor Professionals Association and Stanford University. The survey was conducted on the Internet. In addition, it interviewed five well-established and five newcomer semi-conductor workers for additional information. The Chinese American professionals mentioned in the survey work between Silicon Valley and other American cities and the greater China area encompassing Beijing, Shanghai, Taiwan and the Pearl Delta which includes Hong Kong.
