            <div class='col-md body'>Hello there, if you downloaded a trick from the website, it might not be safe you resell it. Unless you buy the DVD. Which is mailed to you. If not, you will still be sued by copyright law. I am also a magician so i know whats correct and whats not. So, unless you have the DVD itself, which means not the downloaded from ellusionist version, please do not sell it. Thanks!</div>

He only has the downloaded version from Ellusionist. Its soft copy. Anyways, honestly tell you, don't get stuff like inside magic and Crash course. They are very useless DVDs. Somemore Ellusionist selling at a very expensive price. If you want, you can just get MINDBENDER. I have mindbender. But not deciding to sell it. Anyways, I can try to help you find a copy[ original copy of cos ].</div>
