If you have been using Nikon F(or N) and D series, and lenses, fatihfully D80 should be very easy to pickup. may consider getting a 70s though. no need for such high pixel count. hd very big isit? everyday wana print A0 size isit? people blackhead wana inspect isit? haha... anywaya i personally prefer one with a high shutter rate. smt above 2.5fps is great.</div>

It's for editing purposes aka Photoshop. And do u think everyone can afford to buy a D2X? And hor, if u're using the DSLR juz for hobby purposes, most pple can't handle the weight of a D2X. Imagine walking ard with a D2X with a 18-200 VR lens. It will be too heavy by juz hanging it on ur neck. When the camera is too heavy for usage, it is hard for the user to control, which might result in blur images etc. D70s is currently being replaced by D80. The sharpness in D80 is much better than the 70s and 80 has more focal points.<br><br>OP might wanna hold back ur purchase. Xmas is coming, might have better deals. And D40 is rumoured to be coming out at that period.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But i would if i cannot afford to pay for them.<br><br>At this moment:<br>A Nikon D2x costs about sgd7,999<br>A canon 1DS MKII costs about sgd14,799<br>A Nikon D70 range caost at around sgd2,000<br><br>We should not be comparing an apple with a durian.<br><br>Although the models you mentioned are digital SLRs, they are classified under the entry level and professional level. If you are comparing entry level models (D70) to more professional models (MKII and D2X) then it is not the camera body concerned. Before you proceed to comtemplating that, it should be how big your monthly pay check that is in concern.<br><br>Pixel rate as high as 10 or over mega pixel is very crucial for professional photgraphers. They need the pixels for large print outs of their works. You can never take a 1 mega pixel photo and try to photoshop it and hope to print a good one out in A4. The most it can do is a ppostcard sized photo. The basic building block of a good photo print to retain the original colors is in the number of pixels a digital camera can capture and produce.<br><br>The similar range of D70s/80s though called SLRs are just entry level that even a rookie in photography can buy and familiarise and perfect over time. The large pixel and more advance settings and performance of the D2x and 1DS MKII are for professionals which i think you and i had better not touch on for now. Not that we don't know but that we may not be able to afford them.<br><br>And the next time if we have problems getting a grip over our cameras, we can always get ourselves a shoulder brace. Professional camera's are heavier no doubt.</div>

It's much more risky slinging it over the shoulder. With a camera as large as the D2X, there's a bigger chance of it slipping out of the hand and onto the floor.<br><br>That said, I sometimes shoot without a neckstrap during event assignments for convenience sake. Definitely unsafe though.</div>

Unless you are going the professional road or doing photograpgy for money (that is to sell and make people satisfied with parting their money for your photos), every photographer can should not be limited to what the book or the instructor says. Some people tends to have shaky hands and that explains why a fraction of a second's difference in the shutter speed can result in one guy taking a photo with some blurs while the other will not at the same shutter speed. Not only in photography, in game and shooting competitions too. You need a stable hand as part of the theory to achieve an accurate and steady shot on the target. Perhaps if you are trained professionally please quote the course or manual dictating that. If its just grumble or a thing the instructor had in his mind then trainees like you (as we all here know by now) should dismiss that and observe safety as the top first priority before you can even tinkle with photography.<br><br>If a neck strap should never be used, why are neckstraps still manufactured and seen with many photographers? If your friend fell down the Grand Canyon, its his fate or carelessness. Everyday many corpse are pushed to the morgue. No matter what you do observe saftey procedures. If you are rushed in a job and almost had an accident, i don't see why it should be related to someone who are just taking photos at his own pace? Tell your instructor to get more rest and take care of his own health. If his too old for the job just quit.</div>
