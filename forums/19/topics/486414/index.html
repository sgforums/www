              <p>Hello guys, girls and all Hatsune Miku fans alike,</p>
              <p>I am looking for anyone who is selling their Hatsune Miku Project Diva F PS-Vita Limited Edition 3G/Wi-Fi bundles (PCHAS-1006K).</p>
              <p>The edition I am looking for is the Asian Region Bundle with the 3G/Wi-Fi set (PCHAS-1006K), not the Wi-Fi only bundle (PCHAS-1007K) or the Japanese versions (PCHJ-10001 - 3G/Wi-Fi) or (PCHJ-10002 Wi-Fi only)</p>
              <p>Of course, the PS Vita set should still be working! The ideal condition should be new or at least like new, all other conditions please read on!</p>
              <p>PlayStation®Vita Hatsune Miku Limited Edition (Crystal White) ×1<br> ãƒ»PS Vita Exclusive software Hatsune Miku Project DIVA F ×1*<br> ãƒ»Memory Card 4GB<br> ãƒ»Original Design Protective Film<br> ãƒ»Original Design AR Card<br> ãƒ»Trooper Pack for PlayStation®Vita (Green)(MSY Co. Ltd.)**<br> ãƒ»USB Cable ×1<br> ãƒ»AC Adaptor ×1<br> ãƒ»Power Cord ×1<br> ãƒ»Booklet ×1<br><br>*The Hatsune Miku Project Diva F's DLC Code would have already expired by now, but still include it anyway for completeness :)</p>
              <p>**This is not expected but again would be good for completeness.<br><br>Those wanting to sell this product to me should send me a PM to it_geek, and must include the following details:</p>
              <ul>
              <li>Condition of the Set (and all of the associated items in it)<br></li>
              <li>Photos of the Set itself (and all of the associated products that you are going to include in the selling of the product).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Including your photos of the product itself will speed up the negotiation process, compared to just simply quoting the condition of the set :))</p>
              <p>Pricing and pickup location will be negotiated through the PM itself ;)</p>
              <p>NB: If you have this set but in other conditions (such as Very Good, Good, Fair and Acceptable), I am still very welcome to do business with you. Just send me a PM!<br><br>&lt;&lt;Guide for Sellers on Product Condition&gt;&gt;</p>
              <p>New - The entire set is still in its sealed protective wrapping, untampered. No dents or scratches on the box itself whatsoever.</p>
              <p><br>Like New - Product or products in the set have been unwrapped, played once or twice, but DLC has not been used. Product(s) are still in a flawless condition.</p>
              <p><br>Very Good - Product or products in the set may have one or two surface scratches, box may have a dent or have standard surface wear and tear, DLC has been used or is expired BUT no items in the set are missing or impaired in functionality.</p>
              <p><br>Good - Product or products in the set may have more than two surface scratches OR at least one deep scratch, such that a hole may have appeared in the product. Box may have wear and tear, and deep dents such as holes or minute tears in the corners. Products are still in good working condition but no longer as aesthetically appealing. Up to 1 item in the set may be missing or impaired in functionality.</p>
              <p><br>Fair - Product or products in the set may have at least three surface scratches 
              OR at least two deep scratches, such that a hole or serious tears may have appeared in the 
              product. Box has sustained serious damage due to improper storage conditions or box is already disposed of. Products may no longer be functioning properly, but still in working condition but no 
              longer as aesthetically appealing. Up to 2 items in the set may be 
              missing or impaired in functionality.</p>
              <p><br>Acceptable -  Product or products in the set may have more than three surface scratches 
              OR at least three deep scratches, such that a holes or serious tears may have appeared in 
              the 
              product. Box has sustained serious damage due to improper storage 
              conditions or box is already disposed of. Products may no longer be 
              functioning properly, but still in working condition but no 
              longer as aesthetically appealing. Up to 3 items in the set may be 
              missing or impaired in functionality.</p>
              <p><br>Junk - Many items in the set are missing, damaged or have impaired functionality, or may only include the main highlight of the product itself (e.g. the console). Product aesthetics have seen better days. Items in this category may not sell above $10, unless photos of the products are sent to be scrutinized.<br><br>Hope the seller's guide assists you in the classification of the product you are selling to me.</p>
              <p><br>(IMPORTANT: All sellers who are intending to sell the product mentioned in this topic to it_geek MUST abide by the seller's guide as crafted herein when classifying the product condition.
