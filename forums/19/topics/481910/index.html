              <p>Hello fellow players, enthusiasts and collectors! I am very very new to this forum but hopefully I won't get too much flak as I try to follow the forum rules as closely as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I started playing MTG in primary school (many, many years ago.. over 15 years..) and started collecting when I was in my early 20s. So now, hopefully I have some "ho liao" that you guys may be looking for. these cards have been opened from boosters, placed in card protector and slotted into my clear folder for collection. I don't really play MTG at all, just something I invested to spend more time with my younger brother back then because he loved this game. Now, he doesn't really have the time, nor do I, as we are already both working adults with individual responsibilities. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As I am not too familiar with the "market price" in here, I did abit of research on various card trading sites and came up with these prices which may or may not come with a "personal discount" from me. If my prices are not okay with you, please do let me know and I will make the necessary adjustments (provided it is a plausible reason, I'd appreciate the help.) </p>
              <p> </p>
