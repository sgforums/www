              <p>You always tried ways of improving your english but failed? have you ever tried reading a book?</p>
              <p><br><strong>Benefits of reading a book</strong><br>*1. Reading is an active mental process - Unlike TV, books make you to use your brain. By reading, you think more and become smarter.<br><br>*2. It is a fundamental skill builder - Every good course on the planet has a matching book to go with it. Why? Because books help clarify difficult subjects. Books provide information that goes deeper than just classroom discussion.<br><br>*3. Improves your vocabulary - Remember in elementary school when you learned how to infer the meaning of one word by reading the context of the other words in the sentence? You get the same benefit from book reading. While reading books, especially challenging ones, you will find yourself exposed to many new words you wouldn’t be otherwise.<br><br>*4. Improves memory - Many studies show if you don’t use your memory, you lose it. Crossword puzzles are an example of a word game that staves off Alzheimer’s. Reading, although not a game, helps you stretch your memory muscles in a similar way. Reading requires remembering details, facts and figures and in literature, plot lines, themes and characters.<br><br>and of course there are many more benefits, unless you want me to list them all out? ^_^<br><br>I've a few good books to introduce.<br><br>1)<strong>A Photogenic Life</strong>:</p>
              <p><img src="http://www.goodybooks.com/images/3daphotogeniclife.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="381"><br><br>A Photogenic Life, Low Kay Hwa's fifth book, touches on a dark and disturbing human trait: Why are we always trying to impress everyone around us?

Now on its second print, take flight from one of the most touching stories with a local touch!<br> (http://www.goodybooks.com/journey.htm)<br><br>3)<strong>You Are Here</strong>:<br><img src="http://www.goodybooks.com/images/youarehere.jpg" alt="" width="338" height="381"><br>You Are Here, Low Kay Hwa’s third novel, is a love story about a girl who “shrinks” younger in mindset instead of growing older.
