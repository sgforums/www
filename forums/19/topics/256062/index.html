            <div class='col-md body'>depends on the guitar itself, guitar can have many differen type of frets and depends on the tuning of the strings itself too.<br><br>But acoustic guitar and electric guitar playing are pretty similar, and classical are different play styles from that 2</div>

But it really depends on the type of music you wanna play. If you're just contended with playing chords then an acoustic is for you. If you're interested in things like shredding and speed picking then you will need an electric guitar to play those wicked solos.</div>

It depends on how interested you are in playing the guitar and the type of music you like that will determine which type of guitar to get.<br><br>About the pain of pressing acoustic guitar there is really no difference between training your muscles in the gym. While playing the electric guitar is less painful in a way, your wrists, forearms and fingers will still be tired from all the playing.<br><br>The most important is to buy the type of guitar to suit your type of music.
