            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>To all potential psp buyers out there. I strongly recommend u guys not to go SIM LIM SQUARE to buy psp because they really [B]cheat ur money[/B]. The price they quote is only tentative and they will keep adding on extra charges (like region free modding, umd free modding etc) until my friend bought a psp slim package modded for $460 when they say only $340 at first. So pls be very careful...<br><br>Just to make some pointers on [U]fat psp vs slim[/U]. General misconception is that psp slim is better than psp fat but that isnt true because SONY compromise on other things to achieve that smaller size.<br><br>1) Fat psp is [B]made in JAPAN[/B] while slim psp is made in CHINA (not that i have anything against china but...(<br><br>2) Fat psp is only fatter than slim psp at the two sides where u hold it which in fact give [B]better grip[/B] when playing games. <br><br>3) Fat psp umd casing has a spring inside that makes it [B]more sturdy[/B] than slim one. For slim one, u have to depress a catch to pull the umd out and it feels more flimsy.<br><br>4) Fat psp battery has [B]longer battery life[/B] since the battery is slightly bigger and is 1800mAh while slim one has lesser battery life since battery is smaller and is 1200mAh only.<br><br>5) Fat psp screen is [B]made by sharp[/B], only for first batch of japanese made psp, all now is made in china, sharp screen better colours (can compare with other psp, quite obvious)<br> <br>Basically, slim psp is developed by SONY to gain an edge in the market for females to buy their slim psp over NINTENDO DS. Dont believe ask around, i would say all fat psp users will swear that their fat psp is super sturdy and never sent for repairs one not like the slim ones always got some problem with screen and the buttons etc.<br><br>Back to my topic. I am selling a [B]fat piano blackPSP 1000[/B] (first generation of psp made in japan and definitely cannot buy liao because i [I]bought it in japan[/I] then) modded to [B]5.00M33-4[/B] (latest version currently i think). This modded psp [B]can play both UMD and memory stick games[/B] so u can practically play games with anyone who has a psp. <br><br>Package includes <br>- PSP 1000 set with warranty sticker on<br>- original SONY battery with warranty sticker on<br>- Condition 9.5/10 (only bad is a few scratches on the chrome circle thing on outside of umd casing which are not visible unless you put close to ur eyes and stare)<br>- original SONY charger (2pin since JAPAN uses 2 pin)<br>- Black psp pouch $15<br>- 2GB Memory Stick PRO Duo HIGH SPEED MagicGate worth $30 with games worth $150 such as BURNOUT DOMINATOR, WINNING ELEVEN, DJ MAX PORTABLE all preloaded inside<br>- Original box with manual (box is only thing made in china though)<br>- screen in 100% condition, bought a protector $15 since day 1 and still on it. (protector has absolutely no scratches cos i took care of it)<br>- Original US top favourite UMD GAMES worth $100 (Metal Gear Solid - Portable Ops) and (SOCOM US NAVY SEALS- Fireteam Bravo 2) with unfilled registration form for membership to PLAYSTATION UNDERGROUND<br><br>Starting Bid: $280<br>Buy Now Price: $370 (high because of UMD games which can be resold for at least $70)<br><br>Reason i selling now is that i in NS so no time play cos everytime go outfield. My sis has a slim one and she refuses to sell it so if u can persuade her u can try... but for wat unless u r a girl... oh just to add on, so far to my knowledge the latest psp slim 3000 all cannot be modded.<br><br>Btw my contact is 96781546 and only able to deal on weekends since in NS. Next weekend cannot since i got field camp.<br>Roy.<br><br>Thanks all :)</strong></p></div>
