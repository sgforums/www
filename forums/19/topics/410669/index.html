              <p>I was working on a friend's computer earlier, posting a reply to ShadowKnight's concern about trimming SIM cards to microSIM. Then the connection got lost and my posts were gone. So I'm posting this thread again. My answer to ShadowKnight's concern will be addressed in the second post.</p>
              <p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Ok, so you've just bought an iPad or iPhone 4 but don't have a MicroSIM to put into it. What do you do?<br> <br> Let me help you cut your existing SIM card into a MicroSIM so you don't
              have to pay ridiculous fees to upgrade your mobile plan just to change
              to a MicroSIM card.<br> <br> Local telcos typically force you to sign up/upgrade to a new line and
              pay ridiculous fees to change to a MicroSIM but I can help you trim
              your SIM card for only $5. With the money you save, you can buy a nice
              cover or pouch for your iPhone/iPad, pay your phone bills, or even
              treat your loved one to a nice meal <img class="inlineimg" title="Smile" src="http://talkback.stomp.com.sg/forums/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br> <br> As I'll be using a professional cutting tool and NOT by hand, it trims
              your SIM card neatly into the exact size, down to the millimeter, of a
              MicroSIM. This protects the plastic around your precious card with none
              of the crude mess left behind by a pair of scissors, penknife or heaven
              forbid, a kitchen cleaver! <br> <br> Don't waste precious hours fiddling around with your scissors or
              kitchen knife wondering which is the safest, most correct method to
              trim your SIM card. <br> <br> I will do it instantly on the spot for you and all it takes is a minute
              to cut your SIM card into a MicroSIM with the help of my professional
              cutter. I will also return you the remaining plastic border so you can
              fit your newly trimmed card back to become the original SIM card again.
              I recommend using a piece of scotch tape to secure the parts together. <br> <br> Book an appointment with me today at 9106 2185 and take advantage of my
              value-added service available to you from Monday to Friday. I work in
              the Bugis area and I can meet you during lunch or after office hours at
              a nearby MRT station.<br> <br> Cheers,<br> Marc</p>

              <p>Earlier, a reader by the name of ShadowKnight was concerned about the risks of damaging a precious SIM card by having it trimmed by someone else.</p>
              <p>He is not wrong to say that. But only if you misjudge the cut and do it by hand using scissors or penknife. In fact, someone I know used her mom's meat knife (!) to cut her own card. While she didn't damage her SIM card, she misjudged her cut by a few MM and ended up being hurt by the knife. That's even worse!</p>
              <p>Anyway, back to the ShadowKnight's concern -- how it works is there is a special slot in the cutter that I use that's shaped exactly in the size of an actual MicroSIM. All that's needed is to insert your SIM card into the slot, and the cutter trims the card exactly, right down to the millimeter, into the size of a MicroSIM. Only the plastic border gets trimmed away. It's like how you shape mooncakes in a mould and then pop them out in the right size.</p>
              <p>The interesting thing is, I helped someone with his SIM card last week, and trimmed away the plastic border and a little of the outer metal contact and it still worked. Here's why - all the neccessary, critical info is encoded only on the inner surface, at specific areas, of the SIM card's circuit board (the gold part) and the cutter I use is designed to avoid those sensitive areas.</p>
              <p>As a discerning person myself, I'd be concerned if I were ShadowKnight. But I also hope my explanation helps you understand little about how things work.</p>
              <p>I also want thank those who've supported this little intiative of mine. It's something that I thought would save you a bit of money, time and effort.</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, have fun with your Apple toys :)</p>
              <p>Cheers!</p>
