              Synopsis:
              
              Tong Yao from Sichuan province, China, was the champion in the National Competition "å°�åŸŽæ•…äº‹" singing contest held in China that sought to discover the individual who sounded most like the late Superstar Teresa Teng (é‚“ä¸½å�›).
              
              Since then, Tong Yao has been performing around Southeast Asia and in most parts of China receiving rave reviews as she resembles Teresa most in both voice and appearance. She has also bagged many awards with her sweet voice and won herself the title of 'Little Teresa Teng' (å°�é‚“ä¸½å�›).
              
              Tong Yao pays tribute to Teresa Teng as she belts out not only Teresa classic mandarin numbers such asã€Šç”œèœœèœœã€‹ï¼Œã€Šæœˆäº®ä»£è¡¨æˆ‘çš„å¿ƒã€‹ï¼Œã€ŠåŽŸä¹¡æƒ…æµ“ã€‹ï¼Œã€Šå°�åŸŽæ•…äº‹ã€‹ï¼Œã€Šä½•æ—¥å�›å†�æ�¥ã€‹ï¼Œã€Šæˆ‘å�ªåœ¨ä¹Žä½ ã€‹and more, but also Teresa Teng's English, Cantonese and Hokkien songs, in an effort to emulate Teresa's linguistic talent.
              
              Mark the date on your diary and indulge in a nostalgic night filled with classic hits that will bring you back to the 70's and 80's.

              Synopsis:
              
              W!LD RICE looks East for its 11th holiday musical extravaganza for the whole family! An affectionate and cheeky retelling of the beloved Chinese fantasy classic, Monkey Goes West is an epic thrill ride that will take you from Haw Par Villa to Jurong West - by way of a colourful world filled with mythical monsters and naughty fairies.
              
              When orphan Ah Tang runs away from home after quarrelling with his adoptive family, he finds himself transported to a new, strange land. There, he befriends a trio of fellow travellers: Wukong, the cheeky Monkey King; Pigsy, a brave but always-hungry warrior; and Sandy, a stubborn but loyal river ogre.
              
              Together, the fearless foursome embark on the adventure of a lifetime, one fraught with trials and dangers aplenty. Can they contain the rowdy mischief of the fire-breathing Red Boy? Will they be able to defeat the monstrous shape-shifting King Bull? How in the world will they get their hands on the magic fan of the man-eating Princess Iron Fan? Most importantly, will Ah Tang ever find a place that he can call home, truly?
              
              Written by Alfian Sa'at, with music composed by Elaine Chan, this production marks Broadway Beng Sebastian Tan's directing debut with W!LD RICE.
              
              Packed with catchy songs, hilarious gags, Wushu and magic, Monkey Goes West promises to brighten up your holiday season and keep you and your loved ones laughing well into the New Year. Come and be entertained... and enlightened!

              How To Save Using The GV &amp; SHAW Vouchers :
              
              Instead of paying $12.50/$12.00 for a movie ticket at the Box Office, just exchange the vouchers (which you get from me at a discount of $3 each - ie you already SAVE $6 per pair instantly!) WITHOUT further cash top-up needed at the Box Office for the SAME movie ticket (after the usual seat-selection by you as per normal as if you are paying by cash). Do note that you can't use the movie vouchers for online or internet booking (since the cinema chains need to scan the barcodes on the vouchers physically during tickets purchase). But you can exchange the vouchers for actual Mon - Sun, Eve of PH &amp; PH movie tickets and choose your preferred seats directly at the Box Office either on the day of watching the movies or even a few days earlier at ANY SHAW or GV Box Offices (since each of the cinema operators ticketing system is all linked &amp; seat-selection &amp; cross-booking of tickets across cinemas of the same operator is allowed). Plus imagine the amount of money you can SAVE (S$6 per pair x 52 weeks) the whole year round since the vouchers are valid till Aug 2015. Buy More Vouchers, Save More $$$!!!
