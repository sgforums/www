Well, it took me many years and reading to finally become a good owner for them. In the past, before my research... my hammies never really got good care... guilty. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Food: You can buy ready mixed dry food (but avoid those with too many sunflower seeds, because over consumption of these will cause serious problems later) Can supplement with fresh veges like: carrot cubes/slices, bean sprouts, tofu, oats, long bean, lil bit of cabbage, corn, etc.<br><br>Care:<br>Bedding - From my experimenting, Robos do well with Cat Litter (absorbs the urine and clusters up, and you can use the clusters as fertiliser), but other breeds may get skin irritation. Commonly used is wood shavings, but many hammie lovers prefer BC, Carefresh or other brands, where the bedding is soft kind.<br><br>Toys - No plastic in the tank.<br>Chew - Provide chews (you can put toilet rolls, best if with a few pieces of toilet paper on it.. because the hamsters love to tear it and make into a soft bed)<br><br>There's more... Do ask me ya!</div>

Thus there is this natural fear instilled. You have to let a hammie get accustomed to your smell before you are able to tame a hamster, and do not expect any hamsters to be naturally no-biting. There are cases where the person actually wear gloves... because they hamster is really agressive <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Robos are quite hard to handle, because they are hyper and panicky. I have friends whom managed to though, after a period of trying. Usually I observe my robos in their man-made habitat, and have a good smile at what they are doing. In Taiwan they are called "Lao Gong Gong shu" (Grandpa hamster), I think, due to the famous white brows. They are also famous for being the world's smallest hamster breed.<br><br>On the other hand, winter whites make very good hand pets. Provided your palm and fingers do not smell of KFC (finger licking good) when you are handling. One of my wws actually love me so much that she dozed on my palm, after playing a while.</div>

My hammies lived to a ripe 2-3 years, and except for one escaped one, the rest were healthy. Not sure if this will help, but in future when washing cages... remember to disinfect it with anti-bacterial solutions (careful not to let it enter your eyes) You can also get sprays (safe for animals and humans, of course), available for spraying onto corners and on bedding to prevent mites and etc.<br><br>It seemed contagious...

The invisible scent/oil on your finger will directly be passed onto the pup, and with cute rodents like hamsters, which are very dependant on smell (which is why scented bedding are rejected by hammie lovers) will therefore treat the pup as a stranger, and kill it. But this is done to protect the rest of the family.<br><br>Never introduce a stranger into a breeding tank. The result is total chaos. And never touch or disturb a mothering hammie. Avoid taking photos (the flash). Remove the running wheel. Avoid adding in new toys or new bedding, this will stress the mother too. Despite some people would add in additional soft bedding, this is not advisable, from my knowledge from other owners. Just increase the food quantity, nourish the mother, check for water bottle, and leave the family alone... Until the babies are able to eat by themselves. Which is why people often change the bedding days knowing the mommy is heavily due. Because for about 2 weeks, the bedding cannot be touched.</div>

I was very anti-selling too. I too have adopted, and most of my adopted hammies are already 1year plus close to 2. But I will not mind their age, because I don't see why they should be abandoned just because they are old. Until I discovered people had been adopting to feed their snakes, resell.. that I changed my mind. This may sound shocking to you, but it's true. I'll let the person decide for himself/herself, if they really are after free 'snake-food' or really keep as a pet. Frankly... hmm if the person is really sincere, i don't mind giving up for adoption too. But how am I to saperate the snake owners from the hamster lovers?<br><br>Ya, I'm giving up a part of my hamstery, so I can better manage my hams and clear up some 2ft+ tanks from my living room. You can PM me if you have other comments or worries k <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> No prob.<br><br>Thanks for your comments, no worries!
