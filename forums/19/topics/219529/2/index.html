            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Just like to share my experience with fellow hamster lovers and to debunk some of the myths. I reared winterwhites 7 yrs ago. Bought 2 - a male and female and they were such a joy. I played with them and let them out of the cage for daily walks. I think they started to trust people a lot though I was the only one who touched them coz my mother was afraid of them much as she cared for them a lot.<br><br>When the female one became pregnant, I still allowed her to take her daily walk in the house since she enjoyed it. But one day, when i was out at work, my mum let her out of her cage. Shockingly, she ran to my bedroom and gave birth to 7 babies, at the corner of the floor, under my bed! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> My mother witnessed the whole birth process!! My mother became worried for the babies as the floor was cold, so she quickly took a piece of cloth to put it near the hamster mummy. In my mum's panic, she picked up the babies with her bare hands (her scent must have been left on the babies)  and placed them on the cloth before putting them back to the cage.  The hamster mummy followed suit and returned to her cage. And guess what??? Every little hamster baby survived!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>So I guess it could be the implicit trust they had in us, esp since my mother had never touched the hamster mummy !! We only separated the father from the brood.  So I guess there are exceptions to the belief that we must never touch the babies with bare hands.  But perhaps it is generally true.<br><br>Anyway, after that experience, I saw how the female suffered after giving birth, having lost a lot of weight and stress from the babies suckling her wherever she went, I decided NEVER to breed hamsters again. So painful for the mother.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>WHen I saw your hammies I was really tempted to keep them again. So cute, they reminded me of my own brood.  But I know I now have very little time at home and is perpetually tired. So I dont think i am ready to shower them with the love and attention I used to give them. Perhaps,  I might keep them again in future when I have more time.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

The invisible scent/oil on your finger will directly be passed onto the pup, and with cute rodents like hamsters, which are very dependant on smell (which is why scented bedding are rejected by hammie lovers) will therefore treat the pup as a stranger, and kill it. But this is done to protect the rest of the family.<br>[quote]<br><br>A lot of people say so but I just want to share that it does not happen to every hamster. Probably becoz the bond we had with our hamsters was strong and they trusted us  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> With every pet, no matter how small, they can be close and trusting  if we invest time to build the relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi winterwhite, you are being very nice to share your experience. Hmm, but I really dare not take risks... Because I'll not know if the hamster has already trusted me that much to let me handle or touch her pups. So I'll still use a plastic spoon, to scoop the pup if there's a need, to play safe ba. But I doubt I'll have the chance, because my remaining tanks will go to my aging hammies. Will rear them till they die. I am more bonded with my older hammies, strange. Your hammie really is very special, just like my winter white ger who will nap on my palm, knowing I'll never hurt her.<br><br>I believe your hammie is very accustomed to the walking routine and therefore not feel stressed after giving birth at such a strange place/spot. Will bring my hams out for walks too, but must watch closely in case they run off. Usually hammies would pick a very dark and isolated spot (where they'll feel more secure) to give labor. Your mother is very knowledgeable too, to use a cloth! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yup, it is very important to get that special bond, in any pet that we have, even little hamsters! Because when we do, and we ever return home sad one day, we'll know looking and playing with the hamster will wash away all the sorrows. It's a lot like healing properties from a pet we love and vice versa.<br><br></div>

I would prefer tanks. I have 2 stands that can hold 3 2ft+ tanks ea,  as they minimises space. For the smaller tanks, they are kept in my room. If you are keeping hams in your room, keep one or 2 to a tank, so they'll produce lesser poo and pee, and won't make your room smell. Yup, remember not to get too addictive like me... And never keep hams at spots where the sun rays hit. Choose cool places, with lesser disturbances.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Onlined<br><br>Just like to ask you how do you manage to let your robos run around without losing them? They are so small and fast, isn't it a challenge to catch them?

She dashed about very fast and he could not keep up with her. She dropped into the squatting toilet bowl and when he found her, she was already dead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  So he advised us not to allow robos out of their cage.<br><br>What is your experience with them like?

            <div class='col-md body'>hi there winterwhite,<br>You have to set up barricades. Allocate a spot on the floor, and fence it up. On how to 'fence' it up, it's up to your creativity. For me, I use thick books, where they can't climb. And of course not to let them roam about without being observed. But even transporting the robo onto the floor would prove to be dangerous, because the hammie could jump. So maybe it's better to sit down or place soft cloth/bedding on the floor in case the hams do jump. Usually robos owners simply give them a big home, with toys and quietly observe their movements.<br><br>Robos in your opinions must be very hard to keep hammies. They may not be like winter whites or syrians, but they are very unique indeed. Robos are also not pets for children. I have never seen hamsters so beautiful, with their white brows and body so round and fluffy.<br><br>I used to find syrians smelly, because they appear to pee and poo very often, and it's quite big. But after keeping a teddy bear syrian ger (she's very very huge), I have now grown to adore her and her ways.<br><br>Hmm, if you are able to keep another hammie, do consider a robo <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Keeping robos are very addictive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe its true to a certain extent that if u touch the baby hamsters, the mother will eat it.<br><br>Last time i had a papa and mama hamster and soon the mother gave birth to 4 babies. The mother ate one baby soon after the birth because one day we noticed one baby disappeared.<br><br>Soon, the remaining 3 babies opened their eyes and had fur already. They could eat small food on their own and we thought we could play with it. One of them took after their father and was furry and very cute. My brother took it out and played with it on his palms.<br><br>But about the next day, we noticed that baby hamster is gone.. and there was 2 baby legs found in the nest... Very sad..<br><br>Then i read about these things about touching babies will make it get eaten, i realise it must have been my brother who had washed his palm with hand wash before playing with the baby... The scent must had been so foreign that the mother ate the baby.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know I know of someone who gave up her hammies for adoption, 3 different entire families... and this person actually wanted to adopt all, and she spent all her efforts to give valuable info, so they'll be taken care of properly... Luckily, just when she was ready to leave her home with her hams, she discovered the hams were actually going to be snake food. She got so upset, and paranoic that she only gave to her close friends. Got other cases, that is why I'm very cautious over ppl's intentions.<br><br>Which is why if you put a price (can be very low, if the person is sincere) - though will look materialistic to many pet lovers - it really gives snake/hammie-eating pet owners a back off. Unless the person is your trusted friend, whom you know doesn't own any of those meat eating pets.</div>
