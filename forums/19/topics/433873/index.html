I know there are alot of ppl who are concerned about cosmetic condition. will try to list them down as accurate as i can. Will list pictures tonight here. Working condition all 10/10. As u can see i own alot of mp3 players, so not much time to focus on each and every mp3 player. I own several vision M before.. (i just keep coming back for them..) but no more this time. Time to focus completely on cowon players. <br><br>1)Fiio e3 : $7 <br><br>good cosmestic condition. drive ur ipods really well will extra boost, same goes to e5, they do it even better.<br><br><br>2)Fiio e5 with cable: $17<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_012_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_011_.jpg[/img]<br><br>3)Creative zen Vision M 30gb :$90<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_010_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_009_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_007_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_008_.jpg[/img]<br><br>This one is bought to keep as collection and not being used. Comes with grey smoke silicon case. Has quite some age ( 3 year ) but really, not much use due to the intent of keeping it as collection. Had a silicon case since day one and yes, no scratches. Not one i can find. screen protector on. Just tested and 100% working no problem. Pics up later. oh it is black on front and white on back.<br>EDIT : usb cable is missing ! i'll buy one at buyer's request to reduce it all the way to $70. can be bought over ebay for $3 with free shipping.<br><br>4)Sony walkman s545 16gb RED sealed :$145 (239 @ sony style)<br>Given to me.

At least what i think so last time. It was never used. in a hard sony crystal case. The retail sticker is STILL pasted on the LCD screen of the s639. Only connected the player to computer once to test transfer of files. music playback &lt;1hr.<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_016_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_015_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_013_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_014_.jpg[/img]<br><br>6)8x Sansa e250. varying capacities 3 replacement batteries with tool. <br>8gb sansa e280 with griffin case : $55<br>8gb sansa e250 with griffin case : $50<br>6gb sansa e270 with griffin case : $45<br>4gb sansa e250 with griffin case : $40<br>3 replacement batteries with tool (sealed) : $5 each<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_017_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_018_.jpg[/img]<br>[img]http://forums.vr-zone.com/photopost/data/500/medium/07062011_001_.jpg[/img]<br><br>All the sansa e250 are in GRIFFIN hard case, MINT condition. only 2 of the 8 are lightly used. all the 8 have rockbox on them. I bought them with the intent to go rockbox and enjoy my music on these wonders. They have wonderful SQ and a responsive scroll wheel, with a micro-sdhc slot to integrate extra memory onto the player. since then ditched the idea cos too many players to carry around ! think of it as sansa clip + with bigger screen and easier navigation! These retails around 199usd but since dropped due to emergence of smaller player like the clip. 3 usb cable only ( i can't find the others! will order more from ebay soon!) all three are sealed in packaging as new as well. Btw, these sansas have lithium batteries that are replaceable just by taking out the 4 screws at the back (as simple as changing the hp battery, except need to unscrew 4 screws.)<br><br>3 8gb micro-sd (class 4) : $25 for all<br>7 4gb micro-sd (class 4) all kingston. 2 is in retail packaging sealed with adapters. $30 for all<br><br>10 micro-sd $50 for all.
