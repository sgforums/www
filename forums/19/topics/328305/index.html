              <p>Yes , Australia is better for some of us. Yes , some Singaporeans want to migrate. However , there are always alot of people who want to stay in Singapore because they have a good reason to do so or because they are happy doing what they do. It is their choice to do so and I respect them for it.</p>

              <p>How much is the rental of an apartment at the fringe of Orchard

              <p>So don't go disparaging anything with your frog in the well

              <p>People , especially Singaporeans , are not stupid. They can make
              the judgement for themselves on which country is better for them.
              Some like Singapore. Some want to migrate. If they are stupid to
              judge a country based on what is said about it in forums, then no
              one can help them .</p>

              <p>when u compare aus with ingapore, dont compare the superficial stuff, the purchasing power is more in Aus. and during tax break (June) u can get really good serious deals on consumer products. and at times like this the 50 inch HD plasma, good deal...</p>

              <p>Your point is? You have to rub Australia into other people's faces, giving LN ammunition. Why do you want to show off about Australia when you should have no justification to do so?</p>
              <p>Singapore's land is scarce and hence expensive.Australia is large , land is readily available hence cheaper.</p>
