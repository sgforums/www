              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">SOLD Reason for selling</span></p>
              <p>Hey guys, just trying to thin the herd, have too many basses and this one isnt getting as much attention as I hoped. Alembics just rock too hard. </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How much it will cost</span></p>
              <p>So, this bass was going to cost me 1900sgd. Bought it at roughly a 10% discount through a friend for 1700sgd. Looking to get <strong>800 sgd</strong> out of this, which is less than half of what I paid for it and half of the discounted store price in US this does not even including shipping to Singapore (haven't been able to find this bass locally recently and they wanted to charge me an exorbidant amount to import it). </p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fender's description.</span></p>
              <p>It's a faithful limited edition reproduction of Sting's trusty 1953 Precision Bass with his signature in a block inlay at the 12th fret. Contoured lightweight ash body with single-ply pickguard. Maple neck and fretboard with a 7.25" radius, a vintage 2-saddle bridge, and a vintage single-coil pickup. Enjoy this re-creation of the P Bass from the early days and pay homage to a great player at the same time. Includes Fender gig bag.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">My take on the bass.</span></p>
              <p>It is a great for somebody who wants the vintage tone and look but with all the modern technology in the bass(so none of that vintage fuzziness in the tone).</p>
              <p>It has a small, visible <strong>ding</strong> at the neck from trying to hang it on the wall but is barely noticible due to the position of it. I have taken a detailed picture of the ding to try and display the condition of the bass.</p>
              <p>Apart from that, the bass is in mint condition. It has the 1950s "smoker's voice" and its neck plays like butter. It's was made more for fingerstyle playing but I've been using it for slap because of the growl. For those who like a clear voice, don't let this throw you off, the bass maintains it's clarity and its "growl" is in no way distorted. Like all my basses, it has been babied. Cleaned, tuned everynight and strings maintained. Strings are not included because I cannot make too much of a loss from the heavily discounted price.  Took it to the store to make sure its set up properly, the guy said that everything was already in order which doesnt surprise me as I played this one less than my other basses.</p>
              <p>Overall, I haven't found a better price for this bass in sg. The tonal possibilities are endless with this bass and lets not forget that it looks awesome(To those who like the vintage look!).</p>
              <p>You can contact me at 9/6/4/6/2/3/2/3. Please do so only if you are interested. If you would like pictures sms me your email. You can  I do not want to make useless trips out and want to protect the integrity of the bass for its future owner. </p>
              <p>Thanks,</p>
              <p>Glenn</p>
