With one to two percent vitamin C, by dry weight, rose hips have a higher content than citrus fruit.In addition to their culinary uses, roses were also valued for their medicinal properties. In AD 77 the Roman writer Pliny recorded 32 disorders that responded to treatment with rose preparations. Medieval herbals contained many entries that tell of the restorative properties of rose preparations.<br><br>The anti-inflammatory properties of rose hips have recently been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients suffering from knee or hip osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease affecting over 20 million Americans. It is characterized by the breakdown of cartilage in the joint, allowing bones to rub against each other, causing pain and loss of movement.<br><br>Scientists in Denmark reported that patients who daily consumed standardized rose hip powder (made from dog rose) experienced significantly less joint stiffness and pain, and an improved general well-being and mood after 3 to 4 months of treatment. The use of rose hip powder also enabled the patients to considerably reduce their standard pain medication. Rosehips contain high levels of antioxidant flavonoids with known anti-inflammatory properties.<br><br>Thyme Tea Leaf: Thyme contains an essential oil that is rich in thymol, a powerful antiseptic, antibacterial, and a strong antioxidant. The oil of thyme is used in mouthwashes to treat inflammations of the mouth, and throat infections. It is a common component of cough drops. Because of its essential oil, thyme possesses expectorant and bronchial antispasmodic properties, making it useful in the treatment of acute and chronic bronchitis, whooping cough, and inflammation of the upper respiratory tract.<br><br><br>[COLOR="DarkOrchid"]Fructose Oligosaccharides :[/COLOR]FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years, even before 1990, when the Japanese government installed a "Functionalized Food Study Committee" of 22 experts to start regulate "special nutrition foods or functional foods" which contained the categories of fortified foods (e.g., vitamin-fortified wheat flour), ]and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as a substrate for microflora in the large intestine, increasing the overall gastrointestinal tract (GI Tract) health. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections<br>Several studies have found that FOS and inulin promote calcium absorption in both the animal and human gut.[4]The intestinal microflora in the lower gut can ferment FOS, which results in a reduced pH. Calcium is more soluble in acid and therefore more of it comes out of food and is available to move from the gut into the bloodstream.<br>FOS can be considered a small dietary fiber with (like all fibres) low caloric value. The fermentation of FOS results in the production of gasses and acids. The latter provide some energy to the body.<br><br>[COLOR="Red"]NOTE:<br><br>1.Not suitable for Pregnant ladies, people with digestion failure, Children and Chronically Ill patients<br><br>IMPT : There is another seller in one more other forum seller almost the same product as mine  at a cheaper price.
