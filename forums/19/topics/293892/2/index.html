You must be joking<br><br>I sold my wow account months ago, blizz doesnt care. The only way you get caught is if someone actually goes through the whole process trouble of taking screenies and spamming them with mails of the transaction. There are thousands of accounts on sale on the web during my research on the best price i should sell at. ANY blizz employee could fake a transaction to get the username of the seller's account, and ban it. Did they do it?<br><br>No<br><br>Selling of virtual items IS already rampant. It is even allowed in countries like US and China ie.
