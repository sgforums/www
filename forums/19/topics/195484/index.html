DO NOT PM DO NOT reply here</strong><br><br>Condition: 8/10 (bought it around 2 - 3 years back use it for less than 10 times before it became my clothes hanger)<br><br>Features:<br><br>a. 8 levels of resistance to choose from: level one to eight to add challenge to your exercise<br><br>imagine level 1 to be running on a normal road, and level 8 to be trying to trying to run in the swimming pool<br><br>b. 4 angles of elevation<br><br>Don't know the exact degree of elevation, but the max is around 15-20 degrees.  Unless u are going for a vertical marathon, this is GREAT!<br><br>c. Meter: Indicates speed, time, distance, calorie burnt<br><br>Extremely good to calculate your progress, and to pace yourself.  Great for young and old.  Pace yourself to pass your 2.4Km run, or keep the pace slow and steady to effectively burn that tummy away.<br><br>d. Wide and spaciaous "running area": Belt at 36cm wide and the running surface at 120cm long. furthermore, there is a space of 10cm to each side of the belt to enhance safety.<br><br>For those people who have huge feet, or are wide, or flat feet problems, this is an excellent choice.  Usually manual treadmills are small and narrow so make it easy to store.  However this means that the runner must keep the feet close to avoid stepping outside the belt and losing concentration or even fall off.   For girls its quite ok, but for wide men like myself, after trying so many models from other brands, I settled with this as I can take my mind off worrying about my footing.  How can you possible stride with a narrow belt!<br><br>e. Foldable and movable to allow easy storage, less than 1.6 x 0.7m!<br><br>The hand rails feel sturdy enough to support you and are in a good position to grip easily and not block your arm motion.  Though wider, it still provides the same ease of storage.  Though its not extremely low when folded, I still chose this model over the others as the placement of the handles are just nice to allow good grip, and still let my legs open wide in front to stride.<br><br>For a low price of $350, shock your friends after the holidays with your new waistline, without having to run in the tropical Singapore weather<br><br>Why I want to sell?<br><br>Bought it when I wanted to run and pass fitness test.  Stopped using it when I had a bad fall and cannot do any exercises that need me to land hard on my feet for fear of worsening my back condition.<br><br>Transportation<br><br>Please self collection.  If you insist for me to deliver, i will require a non refundable deposit of $30 to cover transport fee in case of getting played out.  Contact me for details.<br><br>If you do not see pictures here, sms me, and i'll send to your email.<br><br><strong>Please ONLY contact me at my mobile no. 9 [] 1 [] 5 [] 2 [] 5 [] 5 [] 6 [] 3  [<span style="color: red;">XIAN</span>].
