              <p><br><span class="medbold">The Effect</span><br><br> Learning card magic is like building a house. Everything starts with a strong foundation of basic building blocks. 
              <br><br> This DVD will start you at the beginning of card magic and take you to
              a working professional?s level. You'll progress faster than ever before
              by focusing on the most powerful moves. This is a complete course in
              card magic without the filler. There's no reason to spend hundreds of
              dollars buying a set of 3 or 8 or 10 DVDs when you can learn the core
              skills (the ones that get used over and over again in thousands of
              tricks) on one DVD. This is that DVD.
              <br><br> By the time you're finished you?ll have learned 4 full-length <strong><em>routines</em></strong>--including the Ambitious Card.  You'll have mastered the <strong><em>fundamentals</em></strong>, learned seven of the most powerful and practical <strong><em>controls</em></strong> (including the Classic Pass), developed two high-powered forces and  picked up eight ultra-visual <strong><em>flourishes</em></strong>.
              
              <br><br> This isn?t an encyclopedia... it?s an arsenal.  All of the most powerful weapons of card magic are included. 
              <br><br>Once you?ve mastered these key moves you?ll be able to perform
              anytime, anywhere, with just a regular deck of cards. Imagine how it?s
              going to feel to have that power to entertain. This is a technology
              that changes you. It?s like riding a bike, learning a new language, or
              flying an airplane. It?s freedom... with a deck of cards.

              <p><span class="medbold">OZ (Quote from Penguin Magic Discussion Forum)</span><br><br>"This
              DVD is NOT just for beginners. I feel that is a large misconception. I
              feel that you can always continue to learn and advance in your magic,
              and I go beyond just the moves on this DVD. <strong>The moment you think you are too good to learn more is when your magic suffers.</strong> And there is nothing more important than the basics; the foundations
              upon which all else is built. Learning more and more advanced sleights
              helps add to your arsenal. But without a solid foundation of sleights
              that feel and appear natural, not just to you but to everyone watching,
              as well as strong psychology to milk every ounce of astonishment out of
              the effects you choose to perform - THAT is what differentiates a guy
              who does some tricks, from a true magician in the eyes of your audience
              (the only eyes that count might I add). <br><br> The effects taught on the DVD are not new or original. However, the
              methods and psychology I teach differ from many out there. I focus
              entirely on the effect....on the MAGIC, and not on the moves. The
              routines appear seamless, and to the spectator it is as if you have
              done nothing, and yet magic occurred right there in their own hands. <br><br> The psychology is meant to disarm the spectator and create peak moments
              of misdirection, where you perform the sleights with ease and
              invisibility. It also emphasizes the effect, and not the technique.
              Instead of your spectators saying "ohhh he has really quick hands",
              they will have wide eyes, and gaspingly state "BUT he never touched my
              hands, the cards CHANGED in my own hands while I was holding them!"
              etc. The difference is subtle, but that difference is what creates the
              truly magical moments for your audience. <br><br> On a final note - with all the fancy moves and knucklebusting moves I
              have learned over the years since being bit by the magic bug, when
              somebody hands me a pack of cards and says do a trick, this is it. You
              will see me performing one of these 4 effects, in any situation, as
              they are that strong." -- Oz Pearlman, Born to Perform.</p>

Achingly slowly, with no cover, he let go of one of the pieces and the card was restored! Paul Harris shook his head and softly muttered "If this kid is not using some kind of sticky substance, he owns me." Daniel restored the third and fourth pieces in equally miraculous ways and handed Paul the card....no sticky substance! In lieu of Paul's mortal soul, Daniel agreed to let Paul get Torn out to the world. It really is the next great leap forward in this piece-by-piece restoration. Totally practical and even more magical than the original TV-only version With this DVD and a little work, you'll have a breathtaking magical effect you can do anywhere with any freely selected signed card.<br><br>Torn didn't just astonish Paul Harris. Daniel has owned just about every magician he has come across, and for sure every laymen he's shown the effect. Daniel Garcia's "Torn" is a must for anyone who wants to perform a truly miraculous piece-by-piece restoration. <br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">PRICE: SGD$15<br>Condition: USED<br>BY POST ONLY.<br>POSTAGE FREE.<br>STRICTLY NO MEET UP.<br>All enquiries, pls email to<br>gnolard@yahoo.com.sg<br>PLS DO NOT PM ME.<br>Thanx for reading.</span></p>

Get rid of "white noise" of shops selling stuff that doesn't teach you magic with razor-hot impact.<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Speed<br>The General Pace for the video is good. Not great for complete beginners but, if you've bought a beginners video like Born to Perform, Crash Course or Street Magic You won't have any problem. No great rush but sometimes it feels like things are glossed over a little bit.<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Communication Quality<br>As magic videos go in general very good, well thought out speech, which is to the point and helpful not distracting. Speech is well synced with the picture. Views are multi angle and well repeated along with full speed demos of the sleight in action. This was the first Ellusionist video ( I think) and the dialogue is very scripted, its is not as fluid or high quality as the later video's but it is still well above average.<br><br>Communication 4 stars<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Appearance<br>Very good, as with all the ellusionist material it is filmed broadcast quality in a professional studio with professional camera and sound recording. Multiple Camera angles and clear concise explanations are used. Bards make up is slightly strange but it doesn't affect the teaching.<br><br>Appearance 4.5 stars<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Difficulty of Tricks Taught<br>Quite high. This video is Ellsuionists contribution to learning the pass and this is themain focus of the tape. the pass is an extremely challenging move to get right and lots and lots of practice is required. Other moves are of imtermediate difficulty at an intermediate level rather than a beginner. A good progression toward becoming a Magician rather than someone who does a few tricks for their family/friends.<br><br>Difficulty 4 stars (the pass 5 stars)<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Teaching Quality<br>As with all ellusionist products the teaching quality is extremely high, no umming and ahhing, to the point explanations and visuals.<br><br>Teching 5 stars<br><br>Ellusionist Ninja 1 Quantity<br>The Pass, a few variations and a handful of other moves to be part of the Gambling Cheats Routine. As a gambling routine this sucks as it doesn't have second deals or any of the actual moves gamblers use, it focuses almost entirely on the pass and beating the cut. Having said that it does contain the One handed pass with is a fantastic move, and the current edition has extras including updated advice on the pass and the Spin Change tutorial.<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">PRICE: SGD$15<br>Condition: Used<br>BY POST ONLY.<br>POSTAGE FREE.<br>STRICTLY NO MEET UP.<br>All enquiries, pls email to gnolard@yahoo.com.sg<br>Thanx for reading.</span></p></div>
