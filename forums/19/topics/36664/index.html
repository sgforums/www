What you are trying to do over here is <strong>advertising</strong> your forum in another forum which is considered spam. You are redirecting people to your forum and your meaning of redirecting is that sgForum is not as good as your forum that you want the users here to move over to you forum and you didn't mention in your post that 'Only those who are interested are welcomed to come in'.  If you have read the rules before posting here, you will see this message sent out clearly to all newly registered users who Agrees to the terms before joining this forum - 'Please note that advertisements, chain letters, pyramid schemes, and solicitations are inappropriate on this BB.

            <div class='col-md body'>"Those that are interested are welcome to come in" means they are welcomed to enter this thread if they are interested in this topic title and I am trying to differentiate my case from those that spam people to enter their thread with misleading topic titles.<br><br>As for what you say about this forum is not as good as mine forum, why don't you put it in another perspective: this forum is so popular and so many people comes here, that I need this forum's popularity to boost my forum's popularity<br><br>As for my thread, its an invitation to another forum which I can say is more comphrensive in the topics of pets and animals. As a pet/animal lover, I am sad to say that there are many improper care for their pets around, partly on responsibilities, partly on knowledge. Last statistics shows 1000 pets being abandoned last month! From what I gather (I might be wrong, perhaps you could enlighten me then), there are no specific pets forum around here, which is able to gather all the discussion network.<br><br>From a generic view, my forum is based solely on pets, and there would not be any crowd dispersion into my forum which will affect here even a slight deal. If my forum is another network of forums, I would admit I am totaly unethical.<br><br>I believe that the creator of this forum is based on the idea of sharing information and not on "commerial competitions"</div>
