              <p>P.S. We all know that the 3G iphone's coming out. But rumour has it that it won't come cheap (i work in that tech industry now =P). USD$199's subsidised by AT&amp;T, meaning u have to subscribe to their 3G plans, which is not cheap. It'll probably work the same way here.<br>And when it launches the new software will be free for current iphone users. Just do a software upgrade and the only significant differences will be the color, assisted GPS and faster web surfing speed (which i don't think many singaporeans will subscribe to HSPDA etc over here). And this one's still the classic man. haha :)</p>

              <p>why would you even be getting so worked up? at least now we know what kinda seller you are. or say, a glimpse of your character. Who knows? You seem like a scheming person and would only wanna make quick bucks. There must be something wrong with the phone and you wanna get rid of it. (:</p>
              <p>and when iphone 2G version was launched, it's price was about 700+ to 800. With the 3G version coming out soon, won't the price drop? Common sense right? I won't be surprised it would drop drastically as people would rather wait a lil' while and go for 3G rather than 2G. Especially those who are already holding a 2G and would like to upgrade to 3G, and those who would go for a 3G straightaway.</p>
              <p>HSPDA - High-Speed Downlink Packet Access right? 3.5G. (: </p>
              <p>now look who's talking. (:</p>
              <p>and still, why do you even bother getting so defensive? When the hell did i say anything hostile or whatsoever. I guess you're far too sensitive. Gees.</p>

              <p>Apple has changed it's distribution for iPhone, it will only be available via telco/carrier and not over iPhone retail. Hence, the price will be determined by telco, either to sell subsidized with plan ($199), or retail at Apple price point. And no way did he state that $199's the maximum everywhere. If that's the case meaning u expect to get one over here for SGD$200+ $300? haha.</p>

              <p>i'm not too sure about this but i would seriously doubt the possibility of Singtel staff having collected their 3G iPhone before Steve Jobs gets to show the whole world..</p>
              <p>also the HTC Diamond hasn't landed in our shore yet so how would anyone be able to do trade with it???</p>
              <p>anyway, its good that when an offer seems abit out fellow forumers are willing to voice them out so that others can have an idea before comminting to it but the choice of words used could be better..</p>

              <p>sorry but after reading this whole topic, i cant stand but to interfere</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, we have no evidence that the phone is spoilt or whatever defects so i would suggest that all of you people stop flaming him. On top of that, there is COD available, unlike some other sellers</p>
              <p>second, do you people really think singtel's gonna sell it cheap? if iphone will to be sold at US199 in singapore, i think everyone will be holding now but that is if there is no contact. I personally do believe that there will be a contact involvement and it wouldnt be cheap, as for all you know, APPLE is an expensive brand</p>
              <p>so ... PLEASE do not post unnecessary inaccurate comments to defame people, i still believe he is a geniue seller</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              <p>He is genuine seller, I believe and agree. But honest one? No way.</p>
              <p>This post was posted on 11th June. After the conference on 9th June. This will give people an impression that he knows his 1st-gen iPhone is going to be worth nothing soon, and hence he's here trying to sell it away ASAP at a high price which I doubt anyone will be willing to pay especially when the 3G iPhone is going to be  out on 11th July.</p>
              <p>So forget it TS, you won't be able to sell it off ANYWHERE if you insist on $540 starting bid.</p>

              <p>^tamago^:  wad godpa godma r u talking about. It isn't even ready for launch.  like i've said. Even apple staffs haven't got theirs. and u're telling me singtel pple collected their set when singapore isn't even in the list of 22 countires first launching it on 11july? wanna bullshit to showoff pls make it sound more convincing at least</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>alleggerita:  this isn't about honesty. Yes i do know bout the conference.. N i do believe everyone read it. I'm selling @ this price only cause i bought it at a high price juz awhile ago. i didn't lie about anything did i? n i even stated in my post that the 3G one will go for usd$199.  It's up to u guys whether u wanna buy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, till now i've received a couple of offers for 550.  So i guess pple still wants it huh. haha but it's alright since u guys think my price is high i won't sell it here. i'm cool bout this. (:</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>anyway, just to conclude this saga...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>firstly, yes we all read the news. for me personally, i think it's too fast to speculate as to what the actual price of the 3G will be in singapore and how much the 2G will depreciate, as apple's goin to offer a software upgrade for free. usd$199 is heavily subsidised by telcos, so as far as we know, we may be induced to sign up for higher cost plans or other addons to make up for the cost singtel/starhub paid apple.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, that is my opinion. u can either agree or disagree. the 2G was floating around 700-780 for a new jailbreaked set over here just before the conference and yes, honesly i bought it @ that price just before the conference date was announced. (no matter how stupid u can say i was). So theoratically i'm already suffering a huge lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I seriously don't think anyone who's interested in the iphone will be stupid enough not to read the newsso frankly i'm not tryin to cheat or kotok or wad. those who agree with me and likes the 2G will bid, and those who dun, well it's pretty unfair to flame just cuz u think otherwise isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So y not just let this die off to save further fuss? and no hard feelings yeah :)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Guys,FYI, Steve Jobs said during the Keynote that the iphone 3G is gonna be a max of USD 199 around the world. That means Singtel can only place a maximum of abt $270 for the phone. So stop worrying that you would have to pay exorbitant amounts for the phone. </p></div>

              <p>yes. and that's cuz singtel's subsidising it. but he didn't say how much the telcos can charge us din he? Singtel can always make u sign a high-end plan or other bundled packages to make up for their cost. Moreover, u wouldn't be able to get one without signin a plan, that's how it works in 1st 22 countries launching it.In order for the "black market" to get a single iPhone, someone will have to sign up with the telcos and pay the monthly contract fees. Worse still, there's no commitment-free price for u to get the handset for more bucks but totally contract-free. So can u imagine how much a contract-less iPhone 3G will cost?</p>
