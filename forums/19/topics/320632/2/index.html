              <p><br>you don't need any data plans if you login using <a href="mailto:wireless@s'pore">wireless@s'pore</a> or if you're on wireless network, what all these data plans means is the used of "edge" or "GPRS" known on other phones, its only useful if you're at a place where there isn't any wireless conection, anyway, 3G didn't quite take off IMHO, the used of video call wasn't as successful as what it was projected, generally, it just makes the downloading slightly faster but if you guys had used a iPhone before you'll probably realised that its downloading speed isn't that bad afterall, at least when i'm connected to my own wireless connection the speed seems pretty decent.</p>
              <p>on the costing part, it was mentioned that the 3G iPhone will be selling at a lower rate then the 2G as its going for sales in another kinda pricing plan so its going to be pretty difficult to compare.</p>
              <p>just check around this afternoon and i've realised that a phone shop in Chinatown area is selling it for S$699 before jailbreaking.</p>
              <p>also on the issue of the so call "unlocked" iPhone being unstable, personnally i've not used a AT&amp;T issued iPhone so i don't know how stable it is but on my unlocked phone, i've not had any problem with it after using it for the past 6-7months or so.. and one thing is i would gather even if you used the legal iPhone you'll eventually still goes for some 3rd party software to enhance your iPhone..</p>
              <p>like i said, the choice of words in such a topic is very important so chill guys, let the guy sell his stuff..  </p>

              <p><br>its a must that all equipments mfg gave/loan their yet to be launched equipments to their staff to run tests and gain feedbacks but to have the sets available for non employee just doesn't sounds right to me and if the launched for 3G iPhone is officially on 11 July 2008, i don't see how would ppl be able to get their hands on one currently.</p>
              <p>anyone would have loved to be able to own a iPhone for a mere 199USD but i would gather it will comes complete with a longer contract plans, then again even with that plan its still going to be worth every single cents outlay.</p>

              <p>Anyway, it would be better for those wanting to get to wait... although you still can jailbreak the current ones to 3g iphone... just by updating the software... cos... you would get warranty for the released ones...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>not trying to help anyone here, just my 2cents worth...</p>
              <p>i can't be sure but i would gather there is going to be huge differences between owning the 2G iPhone vs 3G iPhone, reasons being 2G comes without contract, meaning you can just plug and play with any sim card that you're currently using and just login at any wireless connection to surf whereas 3G since its being brought in exclsively by Singtel (at least for the time being) they would try to tie down buyer with some kind of data package, which i would believe would be slight different with the current 3G plan available, (more "GPRS" or "Edge" enhanced package cause there would be no extra profit if they're to use the current 3G plan is more video call enhanced) hence if you're to get the 3G model and use it with another operator's sim card then you would have to pay for the data plan that comes with the 3G iPhone and pay again for the normal usage arised from the other operator, so in another word if you're not that into surfing the net while on the go as well as into GPS thingy, 2G iPhone might not be a bad choice afterall, not forgetting here in Singapore we have a pretty well covered by <a href="mailto:wireless@singapore">wireless@singapore</a> network, so IMHO, such data plan might not be as useful as in other parts of the world.   </p>

              <p>but i still do believe that iphone wouldnt be cheap at all, and i still do not understand why they do not wana release their pricing for the iphone, probably they are still discussing how much to sell it at ? or maybe prevent people from buying any phone that is released recently as the people may just choose to wait for the iphone ?</p>
              <p>by the way you can reserve the iphone at singtel website or at the IT show... but i wouldnt because im not sure about the price, Anyway i noticed that all of us are debating the price of the iphone so why are you people jumping into conclusions when his trying to sell his iphone ?</p>

              <p>actually it does makes sense for Singtel to delay the pricing package, 1stly, they'll have to check around fellow seller of the iPhone especially those in European countries to have a good understanding on how their packages for the data plans comes along, 2ndly, even thou we may be exposed to 3G services for a pretty long while but the fact is we are only generally using it as a video calling and wireless connection using either our personal connection or free wireless connection, however, the so called data plans are not for such use they're trying to promote surfing using "Edge" or "GPRS" which is not as exposed in our part of the world when compared to that of the European countries, 3rdly, the phone is selling at such a low price for a reason, Apple will wants to have a cut from the pricing plans but as with lots of countries, regulations doesn't permits the locking of phone for exculsive used by a single operator and Singtel would not wants to profit share the normal phone call charges with them hence i would believe Singtel only allows them to profit share the data charges, lastly, since the iPhone will not hit the market till July'08 they can just hold the pricing and keep everyone suspended hence making their ancipation high..</p>
              <p>as for those debating the pricing, its pretty common in local forums to have such cat fights, most Singaporean gets personal during such kind of engagement (i'm a Singaporean and i'm just as guilty as anyone out there) but the choice of words could be alot better to reduces such unwanted agruement, also as we can see, most that engaged in this post doesn't even holds a iPhone and yet wants to give their 2 cents worth, i would gather they've got no idea how this iPhone took the mobile phone world by storm and set a bench mark for mobile phone touch screen function which all phones are playing catchup now.</p>
              <p>but whatever it is, just take a chill pill and stay cool ya!!!! </p>

              <p>Firstly, I believe there were a lot of unnecessary comments, unfair comparison &amp; doubtful judgement that has been added to this post. Now, allow me to present in just 2 short points why the iphone will not be offered anywhere lesser than $500 from telco companies.</p>
              <p>1) Duties/taxes/license fee<br>If you are well aware, for shipment imports, there is usually a tax percentage which has to be paid out to the local customs. Moreover, there will be another cut for the license distribution in Singapore. Therefore, the phone will definitely cost more than US$199. And in the States, the phones are offered at US$199 tag to a mobile plan fyi.<br><br>2) Competitive Pricing<br>For a phone at that level of prestige, telco will not drop the margin by offering the gadget at a lower price without a catch. Usually, it will be tag to either a higher priced mobile plan if the cost price is low. I doubt local telco will be sacrificing the profitability of the iphone with the intention of making it available for the mass.<br><br>Moreover, for the new 3G series, cheaper materials (replacing the aluminimum back casing with plastic) and internal components were used with hope to reduce the price for the consumer.<br><br><a href="http://www.intomobile.com/2008/05/01/new-3g-iphone-design-rumors.html">http://www.intomobile.com/2008/05/01/new-3g-iphone-design-rumors.html</a></p>
