            <div class='col-md body'>Postal lottery: Turn $6 into $60,000 in 90 days, GUARANTEED!!!<br><br>I found this in a news group and decided to try it. A little while back, I<br>was browsing through news groups, just like you are now and came across a<br>message just like this, that said you could make thousands of dollars within<br>weeks with only an initial investment of $6.00!!!<br><br>So I thought yeah right, this must be a scam!!! But like most of us, I was<br>curious, so I kept reading. Anyway, it said that you send $1.00 to each of<br>the 6 names and addresses stated in the message. You then place your own<br>name and address at the bottom of the list at #6 and post the message in at<br>least 200 news groups. (There are thousands). No catch, that was it.<br><br>So after thinking it over, and talking to a few people first, I thought<br>about trying it. I figured, what have I got to lose except 6 stamps and<br>$6.00, right? So I invested the measly $6.00!!! Guess what? Within 7<br>days I started getting money in the mail!!! I was shocked!!! I figured it<br>would end soon, but the money just kept coming in!!! In my first week, I had<br>made about $25.00. By the end of the second week, I had made a total of over<br>$1,000.00!!! In the third week, I had over $10,000.00 and it is still<br>growing!!! This is now my fourth week and I have made a total of just over<br>$42,000.00 and it is still coming in rapidly!!! It's certainly worth $6.00<br>and 6 stamps!!! I have spent more than that on just tips at a restuarant!<br><br>Let me tell you how this works and most importantly, why it works!!! Also,<br>make sure you print a copy of this message now. So you can get the<br>information off of of it as you need it. I promise you that if you follow<br>the directions exactly, that you will start making more money than you<br>thought possible by doing something so easy!!!<br><br>Suggestion: Read this entire message carefully!!! (Print it out or download<br>it.) Follow the simple directions and watch the money come in!!! It's<br>easy!!! It's legal!!! Your investment is only $6.00 (plus<br>postage).<br><br>IMPORTANT: This is not a rip-off!!! It is not illegal!!! ? It is almost<br>entirely risk free and it really works!!! If all of the following<br>instructions are adhered to, you will receive extraordinary dividends!!!<br><br>Please note: Follow these directions EXACTLY, and $60,000.00 or more can be<br>yours in 20 to 90 days!!! This program remains successful because of the<br>honesty and the integrity of the participants!!! Please continue its success<br>by carefully adhering to the instructions.<br><br>You will now become part of the mail order business. In this business your<br>product is not solid or tangible, it is a service. You are in the business<br>of developing mailing lists. Many large corporations are happy to pay big<br>bucks for quality lists. However, the money made from a mailing list is<br>secondary to the income which is made from people like you and me asking to<br>be included on your mailing list!!!<br><br>Here are the 4 easy steps to success:<br><br>Step 1: Get 6 separate pieces of paper and write the following on each piece<br>of paper.<br><br>PLEASE PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST<br><br>Now get 6 U.S. dollar bills and place ONE inside each of the 6 pieces of<br>paper so the bills will not be seen through the envelopes (to prevent mail<br>theft). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes and seal them, you<br>should now have 6 sealed envelopes. Each with a piece of paper stating the<br>above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill.<br><br>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!!! YOU ARE REQUESTING A LEGITIMATE SERVICE AND YOU<br>ARE PAYING FOR IT!!!<br><br>Like most of us, I was a little skeptical and a little worried about the<br>legal aspect of it all. So I checked it out with the U.S. Postal Service and<br>they confirmed that it is indeed legal!!!<br><br>Mail the 6 envelopes to the following addresses:<br><br>Kyle Pate<br>P.o. Box 2046<br>Great Falls, MT 59403-2046<br>USA<br><br>G.H.L.<br>1600 N Thorntree Rd<br>Muncie, IN 47304-9710<br>USA<br><br>G. Skillen<br>32 Ebor Drive<br>Tates Avenue<br>Belfast, BT12 6NR<br>Northern Ireland<br><br>R Kliewer<br>2220 Tolmie Avenue<br>Coquitlam, B.C<br>Canada<br>V3K 3E2<br><br>R. Alex<br>304-11147 Groat rd.<br>Edmonton AB<br>Canada<br>T5M 3K1<br><br>Linda Pitchford<br>8650 Tansy Court<br>Antelope, California 95843<br>USA<br><br>Step 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the other<br>names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc.) and add your name as number 6 on<br>the list.<br><br>Step 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this message as close<br>to what you see as possible. Now, post your amended message to at least 200<br>news groups. I think there are close to 60,000 groups!!! All you need is<br>200, but remember, the more you post, the more money you<br>make!!! This is perfectly legal!! If you have any doubts, refer to Title18<br>sec. 1302 &amp; 1341 of the postal lottery laws. Keep a copy of these steps for<br>yourself and whenever you need money, you can use it<br>again. Please remember that this program remains successful because of the<br>honesty and the integrity of the participants and by their carefully<br>adhering to the directions!!!<br><br>Look at it this way. If you are of integrity, the program will continue and<br>the money that so many others have received will come your way!!!<br><br>Note: You may want to retain every name and address sent to you, either on<br>your computer or hard copy and keep the notes people send you. This verifies<br>that you are truly providing a service. Also, it might be a good Idea to<br>wrap the $1 bills in dark paper to reduce the risk of mail theft.<br><br>So, as each post is downloaded and the directions carefully followed, six<br>members will be reimbursed for their participation as a list developer with<br>one dollar each. Your name will move up the list geometrically so that when<br>your name reaches the #1 position, you will be receiving thousands of<br>dollars in cash!!! What an opportunity for only $6.00!!! ($1.00 for each of<br>the first six people listed above).<br><br>Send it now, add your own name to the list and your in business!!!<br><br>DIRECTIONS FOR HOW TO POST TO A NEWS GROUP!!!<br><br>Step 1: You do not need to re-type this entire message to do your own<br>posting. Simply put your cursor at the beginning of this message and drag<br>your cursor to the bottom of this message and select copy from the edit<br>menu. This will copy the entire message into the computer memory.<br><br>Step 2: Open a blank note pad file and place your cursor at the top of the<br>blank page. From the edit menu select paste. This will paste a copy of the<br>message into notepad so that you can add your name to the list.<br><br>Step 3: Save your new notepad file as a txt file. If you want to do your<br>posting in a different setting, you'll always have this file to go back to.<br><br>Step 4: Use Netscape or Internet Explorer and try searching for various news<br>groups (on-line forums, message boards, chat sites, discussions, etc.)<br><br>Step 5: Visit these message boards and post this message as a new message by<br>highlighting the text of this message from your notepad and selecting paste<br>from the edit menu. Fill in the subject, this will be<br>the header that everybody sees as they scroll through the list of postings<br>in a particular group. Click the post message button. You've done your first<br>one! Congratulations!!! All You have to do is jump to<br>different news groups and post away, after you get the hang of it, it will<br>take about 30 seconds for each news group!<br><br>REMEMBER, THE MORE NEWS GROUPS YOU POST IN, THE MORE MONEY YOU WILL<br>MAKE!!!! (But you have to post a minimum of 200).<br><br>That's it!!! You will begin receiving money from around the world within<br>days!!! You may eventually want to rent a P.O. Box due to the large amount<br>of mail you will receive. If you wish to stay anonymous, you can invent a<br>name to use, as long as the postman will deliver it.<br><br>JUST MAKE SURE ALL THE ADDRESSES ARE CORRECT!!!<br><br>Now the why part. Out of 200 postings, say you receive only 5 replies (a<br>very low example). So then you made $5.00 with your name at #6 on the<br>letter. Now, each of the 5 persons who sent you $1.00 make the minimum 200<br>postings, each with your name at #5 and only 5 persons respond to each of<br>the original 5, that is another $25.00 for you. Now those 25 each make 200<br>MINIMUM posts with your name at #4 and only 5 replies each, you will bring<br>in an additional $125.00!!!! Now, those 125 persons<br>turn around and post the minimum 200 with your name at #3 and only receive 5<br>replies each, you will make an additional $625.00!!! OK, now here is the fun<br>part, each of those 625 persons post a minimum 200 messages with your name<br>at #2 and they each only receive 5 replies, that just made you $3,125.00!!!<br>Those 3,125 persons will all deliver this message to 200 news groups, If<br>just 5 more reply you will receive $15,625.00!!! All with an original<br>investment of only $6.00!!! Amazing isn't it!!!! When your name is no longer<br>on the list, you just take the latest posting in the news groups and send<br>out another $6.00 to the names on the list, putting your name at number 6<br>again.<br><br>You must realize that thousands of people all over the world are joining the<br>internet and reading these messages every day!!! Just like you are now!!!<br>So, can you afford $6.00 and see if it really works? I'm glad I did!!!<br>People have said, "what if the plan is played out and no one sends you the<br>money?" So what!!! What are the chances of that happening, when there are<br>tons of new honest users and new honest people who are joining the internet<br>and news groups everyday and are willing to give it a try? Estimates are at<br>20,000 to 50,000 new users, every day!!!<br><br>REMEMBER PLAY HONESTLY AND FAIRLY AND THIS WILL REALLY WORK!!!<br><br>--comments/feedback(please post your feedback/experiences here)---<br><br>Not bad for 1 hr's work....made me around $5320 in roughly 35 days - Anthony<br>M Texas<br><br>Hello, I rcvd 269 bucks in the post in 2 weeks.
