SATA hdd are running 150MB/s while PATA, the normal ones, run at 133MB/s. The price diff is not large so it boils down to whether u wan 2 spend that little $$ to get that little perf more. Personal pref but if gaming or video editting den get those running 10Krpm like Raptor.<br><br>2.No point getting ddr2 now cos not developed much and cost a lot more. Not worth definitely!!! get ddr1 more stable and widely available<br><br>3.I f for normal use den any brand also can. MSI,Gigabyte and Abit are more popular overclocking boards. The rest are average.<br><br>4.If u want those that do assemly as well for low price den visit F***ll or CM (both pls figure out yrself, not too diff - else PM me!!) and their after service is gd.<br><br>5. Never get fore front technolgioes available but those that u really require and tats all. Mayb a little more den u require ius ok cos u need 2 leave room for expansions and b a little more "future safe"<br><br>Phew... i thirsty liao!! u owe me 2!!! hahahaha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Erm, for your info, please do not buy DDR2, cos its actually slower than DDR and its more expensive. Go for something average. The shop I went to buy a package is Jorjy Intl at the 3rd floor, it's somewhere arnd the backlane. Cheap and reasonalble config.<br><br>$770 for the below:<br><br>3.0E GHz HT, Intel 865G<br>80GB ATA HDD<br>512MB DDR Kingston<br>128MB Geforce FX 5200<br>52x32x52x/16x DVD/CDRW combo<br>Integrated 10/100 LAN and sound card<br>Free optical mouse, keyboard and assembly.<br>No monitor.<br><br>It's quite a value-for-money package, in fact the cheapest I can find around Sim Lim.<br><br>Also, when you are shopping around Sim Lim, take note of 2 things:<br><br>1. Get an IT-savvy guy with you around. He can help you with all the jargon.<br><br>2. Never be contented with the price of 1 shop. Shop around for at least half a day before comparing the prices of the kind of computer you have in mind.<br><br>Good luck shopping in Sim Lim!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh heh... I've got my system already! Although earlier I've said that I won't be going for DDR2, I went for it anyway, since at sim lim the prices for DDR2 and DDR ram were almost the same! I don't know why, but according to the pricelists they are quite a distance apart in terms of price, but I guess it's because little ppl buy DDR2 now, that's why they let it go at a lower price!
