            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>I have a lobang which is too good to be true!<br><br>By now, you should have heard something about the term Tablet PC right? It is a cross between a PDA and a lap top.<br><br>Basically, it's a lap top with touch screen (like that of a PDA) functions.<br><br>The previous models that came up previously from HP and Fujitsu didn't have internet connection. Meaning, it's sorta like an obselete PDA. You can do stuff on it but can't get connected to the net.<br><br>Latest technology has enabled that flaw to be corrected. So much so Crescent Girls School has ordered 1 set for each and every one of their staff and student (it was in the papers).<br><br>However, that tablet pc was from Fujitsu and cost $3000 per pc. That was for a balk pricing (meaning 50 pcs and more).<br><br>The lobang that I have cost only $1800 for individual orders, meaning it can go down much lower for balk orders! In fact, Cresent Girls School has changed supplier to my contact as he's providing them the tablet PCs at half the price they budgeted for, with freebies thrown in.<br><br>Normal pricing for a desk top range from $1000 to $2000 plus.<br>A lap top would start from $1500 onwards. PDA cost between $100 plus to $1000 plus. For a tablet PC, if you don't have $3000 in yr wallet, you can forget about even taking a look.<br><br>Now, this lobang that I have is offering an all in one for only $1800. It has the speed of a desktop, convenience of a lap top and touch screen functions of a PDA.<br><br>If keen, do contact me for more details at coldheart@pacific.net.sg or 97471948. Below are the specs and pics.<br><br>VIA Ezra C3-M EBGA 1GHz CPU<br>8.4"TFT LCD Panel SVGA(800x600)<br>Touch Panel with stylus pen<br>South Bridge VIA VT8235 + North Bridge VIA VT8623<br>DDR Memory Module x 256MB, (can upgrade to 512MB)<br>Compatlble with ATA-133 (2.5" 30GB HDD)<br>S3 UMA (AGP 8X LVDS interface)<br>UMA 32MB<br>Whispro BIOS and APM 1.2<br>AC-97 Audio on Board Sound, 16Bit Stereo,full duplex<br>Bulit-in Speaker x 1 and Microphone x 1<br>LAN 10/100 Bese-T LAN (Realtek RTL8100)<br>3 x USB 2.0 Port<br>1 x FIR IrDA Port<br>1 x External eraphone Jack<br>1 x External microphone Jack<br>1 x PCMCIA Type II Slot<br>1 x RJ45 for Etherbet LAN Port<br>VGA output port (800x600pixels)<br>Removable Li-Ion Battery pack<br>Up to 3 hours<br>Input AC 100~240V 50/60Hz<br>Output DC 16V 3.13A<br>231mmx192mmx42mm<br>1.2Kg (with 6 cells Batery)<br>Microsoft Windows XP Home<br>One year limited warranty parts<br>FCC/CE<br>Portfolio Case, Stylus pen (1pack)<br>Water Proof Bag<br>VGA Commenction Cable<br>AC Adapter<br><br>Here is the detailed pricing for the Tablet.<br><br>Tablet $1800<br>Compatible Keyboard $50<br>Mini Optical Mouse $20<br>External CD drive, with DVD functions $200<br>Wireless Card $55<br><br>Total pricing $2125<br><br>However, as an introductory offer, the keyboard is given away free with every sales order. Hence, total price is $2075. Here's another bonus, the price has been slashed to $2050 for every package purchase, meaning a savings of $75!<br><br>Please take note that you are free to mix and match your accessories. Meaning to say, you can opt to buy the tablet (with the free keyboard) without any of the additions. Or you can choose to take any of the additions. Do note that the bonus price only applies to the full package order.<br><br>For bulk orders (10 and above), the pricing will be further reduced.<br><br>There are 2 colours currently available - Jet Black (Matt finishing) and Pearl White (Glossy finishing)<br><br>Do feel free to contact me at coldheart@pacific.net.sg or 97471948 for any enquires or even to take a look at the product.</div>
