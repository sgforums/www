            <div class='col-md body'>for those having frequent disconnections during bulk data transfer from the 2wire 2700 modem (regardless of its sub model) it is likely not due to the following causes:<br><br>1] operating system<br>2] programs running<br>3] your line problem<br>4] interference<br><br>those people (minority) that have this 'disconnection problem when transferring bulk data' are probably running a wireless connection from the 2700 modem. it was reported that the 2wire 2700 modems (all series) have wireless connectivity problems with certain 802.11 (wifi) chipsets.<br><br>you can do a simple test (if you're currently on wireless connection to the 2700 modem) by running a speed test @ <a href="http://speedtest.net" rel="nofollow">speedtest.net</a>. if you're on the 10Mbps service and your speedtest result (on wireless) shows you 5 to 6Mbps means you're most probably using a 'non-fully-supported' 802.11 chipset.<br><br>these 'non-fully-supported' 802.11 chipsets are not 100% compatible with the 2wire 2700 modems. constant bulk data transfer will cause temporally disconnection of the DSL link. within minutes, the modem will do a reconnection and everything resume normal. if the constant bulk data transferring activity is still pressent, the modem will again disconnect and reconnect again.<br><br>Solutions:<br>1] DO NOT use wireless connection, use wired lan.<br>2] Change the modem to a non 2wire 2700 modem. (not applicable for those on MIO voice, as there is currently no aftermarket digital voice ADSL modems available)<br>3] Gamble your luck, try other wifi chipsets (do not ask me which chipsets work, as i have YET to meet a working one ...)<br><br>thank you for reading this post. i am in no way related to singnet, starhub, pac net, microsoft, 2wire, etc ... feedback is not required ... thanks once again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

You have to look at what the contract specifically provided for, if they have breach that term, it's cause for rescission. e.g. if you buy 20kg of calrose rice, the supplier sends you 20kg of thai long grain. Are you suppose to accept the 20kg of thai long grain rice?<br><br>Well, you have to look at the contract terms carefully and see if you can prove your case that, they have given you a less than the service they said they would provide for in the contract.<br><br>My friend managed to cancel a contract made with Starhub, despite all those threats. If you are too easily cowed, you can't get anywhere in life. Even if the contract doesn't specifically say so, you can still use Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't just stop paying them and keep quiet hoping everything will go away. They will come after you.<br><br>Write them a proper AR (addressee received) letter, tell them of the current problem you are experiencing, give them opportunity to rectify the problem. If problem not rectified by then, state that you want to terminate the contract because their service requirement stated in the contract was a misrepresentation.<br><br>Anyway most businesses won't take legal actions against small frys, because it's just not financially logical to do so. The cost to the corporation will be in thousands, getting the lawyers to write the writ of summons amongst other things. At the end of the day, even if they win the case, which I think is unlikely if you have the evidence to substantiate your case. They still have to end up paying 1/3 of the legal cost. If your contract is 2 years for $45 a month, which is $1,080 for 2 years. The legal cost to them might be $1,200. Would a business pay $1,200 to collect back $1,080?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been using SingNet for the past 10 years. Not a single problem at all. I've on my pc for straight 1 week, no disconnection at all. I used wired lan. My dad use wireless for his notebook. No problem at his end also.<br><br>Know your hardware well. You using torrent? Download illegal stuffs? Then dont complain. Its your problem. Not SingNet.<br><br>What if you change to Starhub and the connection also slow? Post a "Starhub sucks!!!" thread in SgForum also?</div>

If all they give is reasons instead of solutions, my grandmother can do a better job by giving a better different reason.</div>
