            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on your battery life.. I was considering and hoping to upgrade but not going ahead eventually.. too financially taxing.. anyway, P7010D's main competition is more the Sony T17GP/S. You really have to ask yourself, do you want an ultraportable to be portable, or do you want it to have immense battery life and essentially handle everything ??<br><br>I won't compare the Acer as I'm not a fan and have never done much research on it.<br><br>The Acer only has 4.5hrs Batt life btw, but specs are slightly higher.<br><br>The Sony T17GP/S is almost a replica of the P7010D. Price is even almost the same. Both have Battery Life that can go up to 8hrs, and can perform most office applications, basic media applications quite well, essentially, what a home user will do. You can't play games, and you definitely cannot do much professional work on it (e.g. engineering). The screen is too small for that, but office applications are fine. They utilise a ULV Pentium-M Processor which is really effective for the home user but that's about it. Both notebooks come with 512mb of memory which will speed things up alot so don't worry about performance unless as I said, you're not the home user.<br><br>The Sony has an incredibly bright and sharp screen with XBrite technology, while the P7010D has a superior screen but not as great. The P7010D comes with fingerprint recognition technology which is a great substitute for passwords! but reviews have shown that since it's so small, it can be come an issue too if you do not swipe your finger across the scanner properly. The P7010D also has way better specs than the Sony! The Fujitsu utilises 2.5" HDD while the Sony utilises 1.8" if i'm not wrong, and the 2.5" are alot more stable and perform at a higher rotational speed meaning your data is accessed alot faster.<br><br>The Sony is slightly cheaper, and comes with 2 variations, one with bluetooth, 60g hdd, 1.2ghz processor, the other comes with just a 40g hdd and 1.1ghz processor. Price is similar so decide from there. Fujitsu is a little more expensive.<br><br>Hardware aside, Software Wise, Sony gives the definite better, despite coming with alot of bloatware ( you can not install them, but some of them are really cool ), Fujitsu on the other hand gives you crap - Best comparison of this: Sony - Norton Antivirus Fujitsu - Norman Antivirus (WTF IS NORMAN!?).<br><br>Terms of looks, it's very subjective.<br><br>Warranty, Fujitsu is more covered than Sony (Sony only has 1yr Local), so I'd feel that the Fujitsu is safer.. BUT.. Fujitsu isn't all that durable. My darling spilled orange juice on her Fujitsu and it died. My IBM Thinkpad however, has withstood drops from heights above 2m, spilled beer, drinks, food, 2L of coke, 2L of juice and it's still going fine, no damage at all actually.<br><br>It's up to you to consider from here, Hardware - Fujitsu owns, Software - Sony owns, Warranty - Fujitsu owns, Durability - Sony owns.<br><br>I'd feel that if you want an ultraportable for size but do not need such huge battery life, go for the Acer, and compare to the IBM-X series. You'll find the IBM highly enticing. These type of ultraportables have more "firepower" so to speak.<br><br>Good Luck &amp; All The Best,<br>SupaFatty<br><br></div>
