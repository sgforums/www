She believes that every bad thing she said will come true.<br><br>Jacky Wu is an ideal prince charming: He is good in his studies and has girls waiting to hold his hand.

When I was fifteen, my mother called me "ah girl" in front of my classmates and I scolded her. When I was twenty, my mother still called me "ah girl" aloud and I ignored her completely. I know that, from her point of view, no matter how old I am, I will always be the "ah girl" who calls her "mama".<br><br>From my point of view, my mother is just an old woman in the house who lives with me. Her responsibilities are to make breakfast for me in the morning, give me money to spend in the day, do the laundry in the evening and switching off the lights at night. For all those things that she did, she will have the authority to scold me or ground me.<br><br>Until one day, she calls me and says, "Ah Girl, I've got cancer. I may die within the next six months"<br><br>That is when I realize that my mother is more than that.\<br><br>#5: A Photogenic Life<br><br><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XxZ1oHtH6pA/TD8PNFHuo3I/AAAAAAAAAa8/sJZjrzikdBE/s320/8670582.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="320"><br><br>Dear Diary,<br><br>Why must I always wear different masks wherever I go?<br><br>I am so sick and tired of my life. Who can help me tear away these masks of mine that are lingering in my skin? Why must I play the role of a strong daughter in front of my parents, a smart student in front of my teachers and a contented girl in front of my classmates? Why must I Keep on telling everyone around me that I am the best, by putting on the multiple masks of disguise for different people?<br><br>This afternoon, I looked into the mirror and realized that I could no longer recognize myself. My reflection was of a faceless girl, awaiting the next mask to be placed on.<br><br>Why are we always trying to pose for the best posture for the camera, when we know we can never change reality?<br><br>#6: To Forget You<br><br><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_XxZ1oHtH6pA/TD8Qo0dHgeI/AAAAAAAAAbE/7k9j1HIkQdQ/s320/To+Forget+You+2D.JPG" alt="" width="194" height="320"><br><br>Before I met you, I wondered why all the lyrics in love songs were so exaggerated: Why do lyricists create such mushy and overemotional sentences? Why can't they just write a good melody without those melodramatic lyrics? That is plain exaggeration.<br><br>Before I fell in love with you, I thought romance novels were just so silly: Why would a person cry for another person for hours? ow could a person wait for his lover for years? That is plain silliness.<br><br>Before we became a couple, I thought romance movies were just so stupid: How could a person love another person so deeply that it became an obsession? How could one sacrifice so much, even to the extent of his own life, for his lover? That is plain stupidity.<br><br>When I realized I had fallen so deeply in love with you, I finally understood that songs, novels and movies are just reflections of life inspired by the writers' true stories.<br><br>Because when I decided to end our relationship, I realized our story mirrors a love song that I once heard, a novel you once read and a movie we once watched.<br><br>#7: Lilith<br><br><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_XxZ1oHtH6pA/TD8R3DnxqgI/AAAAAAAAAbM/tc8cDwfTqx8/s320/Lilith+2D.JPG" alt="" width="201" height="320"><br><br>In the Oxford School Dictionary, "Justice" is defined as "being just: fair treatment".<br><br>Bullshit.<br><br>In my dictionary, Justice is not about giving that terrorist the death sentence.<br>In my dictionary, Justice is not about jailing that rapist.<br>In my dictionary, Justice is not about punishing that boy who bullied the girl.<br><br>In my dictionary, Justice is about fighting for yourself: Just yourself.<br>In my world, Lady Justice doesn't do her job; I do her job.<br><br>If I am born as a deer, I will hunt and kill tigers.<br>If I am born into a poor family, I will rob the wealthy of their riches.<br>If I am born without legs, I will break everyone's legs.<br>If I am born hearing impaired, I will slice off everyone's ears.<br><br>That is Justice.<br><br>My name is Lilith Ng and I am HIV-positive.<br><br>-End of all sneak peaks- <br><br>"I'm interested, where do i purchase these books?"<br>You may purchase them from me, it is the best prices you will ever see in Singapore. <br>The usual prices are @ $15.90 out there, and my prices are really unique in numbers. <br>My website is [URL]http://lowkayhwabookscollections.blogspot.com/[/URL] <br><br>"I'm still not clear about the summaries, can you give me a sample?"<br>You may read the samples or they call it Limited Version of the books from the publisher website.

It depends on different people thinkings, so if you are not interested, please do not flame this post thanks (: <br><br>Unique in numbers? yes. take a look at the price below<br><br>-PRICE CHART STARTS HERE-<br>Prices on the left are the payment needed to get to whatever book (1st to 8th&gt;)<br>The prices on the boxes are the total amount you have paid.<br>You may top up anytime for more books, (eg. you are at the 1st book and you wish to top up to 2nd, add $12.)<br>Of course, you may buy/top up as many books as you like. Take note that the 1st book or 2nd book is not the ordering of the books. You can choose any books as your 1st book, any books as your 2nd books.<br><br>Your 1st Book: $13 [$13] *Save $2.90*<br>Your 2nd Book: $12 [$25] *Save $6.80*<br>Your 3rd Book: $11 [$36] *Save $11.70*<br>Your 4th Book: $10 [$46] *Save $17.60*<br>Your 5th Book: $9 [$55] *Save $24.50*<br>Your 6th Book: $8 [$63] *Save $32.40*<br>Your 7th Book: $7 [$70] *Save $41.30*<br>Your 8th Book: $5 [$75] *Save $52.20*<br><br>(As "A Perfect Story" is yet to be release, you may buy the first 7th books first, and once the 8th book is on stock, we will inform you and you can top up another $5 for it)<br><br>If you want a book cover, you may have to add $1/book. Usual its $2! *Save $1*<br><br>Of course, you can buy all 7 books in a shot @ $70.<br><br>Or you may buy like this example:<br>John wants to buy 2 books to try out the books first. So he gave us $25 for 2 books. After he realize the book are awesome, he wanted to buy the other 5 books from us. All he has to do is top up another $45 to get the other 5 books.<br><br>Conclusion?<br>So no matter what, you can buy the first 2 books first, den get the other 5, still at the same price, 7 books = $70!<br><br>Why did you make a COMPLICATED (not really) price chart at the first place?<br>Well, remember "Distance Fare" on 3rd July 2010? I was inspired on that, and wanted make a price chart for Low Kay Hwa novels similar to that.<br><br>-END OF SPOILERS- <br><br>Anymore questions?
