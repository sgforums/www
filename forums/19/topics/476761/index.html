Thank you.<br><br>-<br><br>THE LEGEND<br><br>A controversial archaeological mystery, 13 crystal heads have 
              been found in regions around the world, from the American southwest to Tibet. 
              They’re dated between 5,000 and 35,000 years old, and were supposedly polished 
              into shape from solid quartz chunks over a period of several hundred years. 
              Although according to Hewlett Packard engineers, they bear no tool marks to tell 
              us exactly how they were made. The heads are thought to offer spiritual power 
              and enlightenment to those who possess them, and as such stand not as symbols of 
              death, but of life.<br><br>THE BOTTLE<br><br>Aykroyd and Alexander wanted the 
              opportunity to get closer to the myth of the 13 crystal heads. After more than 
              two years in development, their moment finally arrived. When their glass 
              depiction of a head was complete, Milan-based manufacturer Bruni Glass declared 
              it to be a bottle of unsurpassed complexity and quality. Now, what to put in it? 
              Vodka became the drink of choice. But with it, came a commitment to do something 
              enlightened and different.<br><br>THE WATER<br><br>To create our truly unique 
              vodka, we travelled to a place with pristine waters and unspoiled land. What 
              better place than Newfoundland, Canada, where unrivalled natural beauty and 
              purity lie at the heart of a culture rich in tradition and legend.<br><br>THE 
              CRYSTALS<br><br>A quadruple-distillation process made Crystal Head as pure as 
              vodka can be, but the quest for an almost mystical purity continued. As a final 
              stage, the liquid was filtered through 500-million year-old crystals known as 
              Herkimer diamonds. These quartz crystals are found in very few places in the 
              world, including Herkimer, New York and regions in Tibet and Afghanistan. 
              Perhaps because they share the raw material from which the original crystal 
              heads were carved, they are thought to have similar spiritual 
              qualities.<br><br>THE PURITY<br><br>The result was perfect vodka, with 
              absolutely no additives. No glycol (an ingredient for engine anti-freeze); no 
              citrus oil (used in its raw form as an insect exterminator); and no raw sugar. 
              Nothing was needed, because it was abundantly clear that finely produced vodka 
              came by its smoothness and flavour naturally. So in the end, the only things 
              required were a glass and a pure spirit of one’s own. <br><br></p>
