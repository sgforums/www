            <div class='col-md body'>Singapore E-Commerce still has a long way to go especially for the retail sector.<br><br>I had placed an order for an Acer LCD display on-line with this company, Skylet Computer Corporation  Pte Ltd at www.skylet.com. I had received the acknowledgement from this company via email mentioning the payment terms. In other words, my order was logged on with this company.<br><br>When I called them for the confirmation about the delivery date, only then did they inform me about their mistake in pricing and thus would not honour my purchase order. The company offered to give me a discount from their list price. Now here's the bite, the price offered by the said company for the item is more expensive than the listed price offered by the manufacturer!  I was taken aback by the offer.<br><br>Anyone would expect a better discount from them. If the transaction can not be honoured, why put them on the web in the first place. The reason for e-commerce is to save time and to shop at my convenience.<br><br>In my telephone conversation with them, I was told that the acknowledgement from the company on my purchase order isn't a business transaction contract. Also, I was reminded that under the Terms and Conditions, "Prices, specifications and availability are subject to change without notice......".  Thus, there is nothing I can do. Now I end up having  to pay for  their mistake by paying the difference in amount for the equivalent specification display as I promised it to someone.<br><br>In this respect, I wonder by stating such Terms and Conditions favourable to the company, will it allow leeway for unscrupulous organisations to obtain customers' data through on-line transactions? Also, will they use this opportunity to solicit for business?<br><br>After this experience, I may not want to undertake anymore on-line transaction for local retailers.<br><br>feeling sore</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm...actually you can't successfully sue for any genunine error in pricing, i.e. the price is not rediculously low. Hence, the only option would be to take take them to CASE, or the Tourism Board to blacklist them.<br><br>Just curious right, why do you even buy the said product when told of the difference in price. Since they said that the acknowledgement is not a contract right, you can back out of your order right? If they said you are bound by contract, then why the f**k can't they sell you at the price as stated in the contract? Second issue is whether have you make any payment to them prior to them informing you of the change in price? If you even pay them a deposit and they accepted it right, then they have no cause to revise their price since any payment exchange is considered a contract. Contracts do not have to be written you know. Anyway, if you have time to spare right? Then go and complain to CASE or the Tourism Board. At least make them malu. But remember not to make any degratory remarks to 3rd party. You may be sued instead.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The Straits Times reported the court decision on the wrongly priced printer case. I think if the price is very different from the real price then the business can cancel the deal. Sounds fair but ... in unscrupulous hands it can mean I will put some low price down and trick you to order then say sorry that a mistake is made.<br><br>Question is how many times can he play this same trick before word gets out on the scam.<br><br>I think this is the result of businesses using heap e-commerce solutions which are not connected to their back-end systems, hence the pricing errors.<br><br>Cheers</div>

The price is not firm during the whole process.  Only when you pay at the point of delivery then the price is firm?

But is A&amp;P (Advertising &amp; Promotion) department that must do e final check on every detail inc e prices b4 going 4 print.<br><br>If they dun honor wt they hve printed or posted that will be considered as misleading to Customers n u can launch a complain w CASE. If i will u i will keep a look out to see if they repeat e same mistake n give out e same excuse over n over again. If it is than go ahead n report them to CASE n contact e Press. (e more media e better) cause that is consider as Cheating! BTW if u r a Singaporean u should go to Case, Spore Tourism Board is 4 tourists, they will refer u to CASE anyway.<br><br>But for me I dun hve much faith in a company that dun honor their mistakes. In other words, what trust do I hve in their products n after sales service?? I rather take my $$ to go some other shops n spend it happily.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello there.<br><br>I am new and is now browsing thru the posting.  I saw this and had this to say.  I hope it will help ( and not too late ).<br><br>For a contract to be valid, there must be four things: offer, acceptance, consideration and legality.  When you response to their pricing, you are offering to buy from them at that price.  They can reject you or counter offer.  However, since they have acknowledge the offer and possibily accepted your offer.  The consideration is the price of the product and since this is a legal transaction, ( no illegal things like gambling ), this contract is valid.  They cannot now say the price can be changed as and when they want, then there is no end to pricing since they can also changed it when you collect the goods, right ?  I do not know how the content of the acknowledgment letter but, in most cases, you should not lose.  Question is whether you can afford lawyer or not. ( The legal fee may be more expensive ).<br><br>BTW, I am not a lawyer but had studied some contract law.  The best way now is for you to take the matter to CASE.  Join them as member and they would be in a better position to help you.  HOpe this help, happy new year.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by koosong:</div><div class="quote_body">Singapore E-Commerce still has a long way to go especially for the retail sector.<br><br>I had placed an order for an Acer LCD display on-line with this company, Skylet Computer Corporation  Pte Ltd at www.skylet.com. I had received the acknowledgement from this company via email mentioning the payment terms. In other words, my order was logged on with this company.<br><br>When I called them for the confirmation about the delivery date, only then did they inform me about their mistake in pricing and thus would not honour my purchase order. The company offered to give me a discount from their list price. Now here's the bite, the price offered by the said company for the item is more expensive than the listed price offered by the manufacturer!  I was taken aback by the offer.<br><br>Anyone would expect a better discount from them. If the transaction can not be honoured, why put them on the web in the first place. The reason for e-commerce is to save time and to shop at my convenience.<br><br>In my telephone conversation with them, I was told that the acknowledgement from the company on my purchase order isn't a business transaction contract. Also, I was reminded that under the Terms and Conditions, "Prices, specifications and availability are subject to change without notice......".  Thus, there is nothing I can do. Now I end up having  to pay for  their mistake by paying the difference in amount for the equivalent specification display as I promised it to someone.<br><br>In this respect, I wonder by stating such Terms and Conditions favourable to the company, will it allow leeway for unscrupulous organisations to obtain customers' data through on-line transactions? Also, will they use this opportunity to solicit for business?<br><br>After this experience, I may not want to undertake anymore on-line transaction for local retailers.<br><br>feeling sore</div></blockquote>another example here, but this time no worries of 'overwhelming' response....<br><br>http://www.webshop23.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=28&amp;products_id=80&amp;osCsid=0de731b1630e638fd7c23a7cc0e1f8ad</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>are you talking about the $200 19" LCD up fro sale at Skylet website?<br><br>if you are, I see that they really made a mistake at the pricing of their website, from my point of view, they will not honour such a deal. Ask yourself this question, would you honour the deal if you're the company? Humans make mistakes, why not make it a learning experience, not just to blame others for not honouring, how come we are not blame being greedy and overlook at the small fine print at the website?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
