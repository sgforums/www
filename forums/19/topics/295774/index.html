            <div class='col-md body'>Have you heard the saying in relation to working, Â“Find something you love and youÂ’ll never have to work another day in you life?Â” It makes perfect sense. If you are able to do what you love for a living then most of the time it wonÂ’t even feel like youÂ’re actually working.<br><br>Of course, the trick is to find that which you love so much that you wonÂ’t get sick of it. Usually thatÂ’s easier said than done.<br><br>Sometimes itÂ’s very easy to find that which you love. You just know it. You love cars so you become a mechanic. You love writing so you go into a field that allows you to write. You love working with kids so you become an Elementary teacher. But itÂ’s not always this<br>easy.<br><br>So here are a few tips on how to choose a job that youÂ’ll love:<br><br><strong>DonÂ’t Worry About the Money</strong><br><br>Too often we make decisions about what we want to do for a living based on how much money weÂ’ll make. Sure we all want money but money isnÂ’t everything. Besides if you get into a job that you absolutely love, chances are you will succeed and wind-up making a<br>lot of money anyway because of your passion for the job.<br><br><strong>Pay Attention to What You Like To Do, Not What You Hate</strong><br><br>DonÂ’t get into a job just to get away from something you hate. Get into a job because youÂ’ll be doing something you love.<br><br>Always chase your dreams instead of running from your fears.<br><br><strong>Take Your Time</strong><br><br>DonÂ’t feel like you have to decide what you want to do with the rest of your life in a short amount of time. There is no pressure to decide within days or weeks. As long as you are willing to work another job Â– any job Â– while you decide, then you should definitely take your time. ItÂ’s better to take a long time to make the right decision than to quickly make the wrong decision.<br><br><strong>Analyze Your Life</strong><br><br>To help find that perfect job, sit down and take the time to think about your entire life. Think about a subject you loved in school or an activity that you were good at and thoroughly enjoyed. Think about all your interests in you life Â– both past and present. Then try to find a job that matches what you like and what youÂ’re interested in.<br><br>This advice (the four tips above) can be used to decide what you want to do for a living and the advice can also be used to help you decide which niche you want to be in (if you are into Internet Marketing). Just follow the same advice thatÂ’s given above.<br><br>The bottom line is that you want to put yourself in a position where you are making money doing what you love to do. You want to be able to use your passion so that you can achieve success, have money, and be happy every single day. If you can do that, then you really wonÂ’t feel like your working another day in you entire life.<br><br>If need extra help in turning your passion or hobby into a business you can make a living from then check out the <a href="http://www.supermailingliststrategies.com/" rel="nofollow">"Super Mailing List StrategiesÂ”</a> that will help you do just that within the next 90 days. {...}<br><br><a href="http://dzesire.net/2007/12/07/discover-your-passion-and-you%e2%80%99ll-never-work-again/" rel="nofollow">More...</a></div>
