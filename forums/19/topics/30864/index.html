            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,folks,<br>if you are new to Digital Camera and intend to buy one, please read on...<br><br>I was quite new to Digital Camera few months ago and I had an unpleasant experience at Sim Lim Sq(SLS) when I bought a high end Sony digital camera then. When I was in the shop, the salesman asked for my budget after I told him that the initial offered price was too expensive. My budget should not exceed $1k, so he offered me $990 but he didn't inform me that it was w/o GST. He even told me that he gave me this price as I looked sincere in buying the digital cam and this price can only be offered if I am not using VISA. When I was abt to pay, I was told to pay $1019.70 incl GST (and this price is only $25 lower than SAFE superstore) and I was stunned for a while. But I made the payment eventually. Then I upgraded the memory stick from 16MB to 32MB after bargaining from $25 to $20 when in fact the price should be less than $15. It was a painful experience.<br><br>My advice to you:<br>1)  Do a research at these overseas web site:<br><br><a href="http://www.digital-camerastore.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.digital-camerastore.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.dpreview.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://www.imaging-resource.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imaging-resource.com/</a><br><br><a href="http://dpcorner.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dpcorner.com/</a><br><br>for the camera you want and the accessories included. If you convert the price they offered to Sing $ plus the shipping cost, that would be about the lowest price any shop can offer here.<br><br>At the local web site, you can check out tips for buying Digicam:<br><br><a href="http://forums.hardwarezone.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://forums.hardwarezone.com/index.php </a><br>(Go to -&gt;Digicam &amp; Photography SiG - Brought To You By Nikon -&gt; A FAQ for Starting/Buying a Digital Camera)<br><br>2) Do not let the salesman know your budget. Instead ask for the best price they can offer. Compare with a few shops. Some will mark up the price w/o you knowing it and will convince you that you are getting a good price after bargaining. The electronic shops at 1st-3rd floor in SLS do not put up a price list outside their shops unlike computer hardware shops at 4th-6th floor. You might want to check out the price at SAFE superstore, BEST Connection, COURTS or Harvey Norman before making a purchase at other retailer stores.<br><br>3) Never be pressured into buying a product. It is a common technique used by the sales pple in SLS. When asked "What's your problem?" or "Come, tell me what you want!" or etc. Tell them that you need some time to consider and if the price is good, you will come back for it. It will take you some courage, ask a friend to go along with you if need to.<br><br>4) Check the local web site for 1st hand Digicam:<br><a href="http://www.cheapngreen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheapngreen.com</a><br>(someone who imports Digicam from overseas and sells thro' this web site)<br><br><a href="http://www.parisilk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.parisilk.com</a><br>(I bought a Sony 128MB memory stick and InfoLithium battery for $135 and $85 respectively at Parisilk and most retailers are selling at $165 and $120 respectively).<br><br><a href="http://www.phsphoto.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phsphoto.com.sg/</a> (Alan Photo)<br><br><a href="http://www.cathayphoto.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cathayphoto.com.sg/</a> (Cathay Photo)<br><br><a href="http://www.mscolor.com.sg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mscolor.com.sg/</a> (M.S.
