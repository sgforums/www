              I have quite a number of â€˜Aâ€™ level materials on sale. I am selling them at a really cheap price because I want to help A level students who need these most and make it affordable to those who need it. I will sort them out into different specific categories so you can identify what materials suit your needs. Should you need additional notes/prelim papers, please let me know too. I have plenty but for now, I will just list down the practice books and revision guides.
                      
              Ten-Year Series (Topic-by-Topic)
                                              
              H2 Chemistry GCE 'A' Level Topic by Topic November 2000-2009 QUESTIONS ($4.50)
              H2 Chemistry GCE 'A' Level Topic by Topic November 2000-2009 SOLUTIONS ($5.50)
                                              
              H2 Physics GCE 'A' Level Topic by Topic November 2000-2009 QUESTIONS ($6.50)
              H2 Physics GCE 'A' Level Topic by Topic November 2000-2009 SOLUTIONS ($7.00)
                                              
              All the Topic-by-Topic Books are by dyna publisher pte ltd. They contain some scribblings but is largely clean. Scribblings are also only in pencil marks.
                                              
              For the students who plan long term, do consider purchasing the 5-year series. They come in real handy in the months AFTER June because that's when everyone starts doing the WHOLE revision paper instead of topic-by-topic. Selling them at low rates. I bought these only 6 months ago. So my 5-year series are very new with minimal writings. These are the ACTUAL 'A' Level papers from 2007-2011.
                                              
              Five-Year Series (YEAR-BY-YEAR 'A' Level Exam Paper)
                                              
              H2 Mathematics GCE 'A' Level 2007-2011 ($4.50) - INCLUSIVE of solutions
              H2 Chemistry GCE 'A' Level 2007-2011 ($7.00) - INCLUSIVE of solutions
              H2 Physics GCE 'A' Level 2007-2011 ($7.50) - INCLUSIVE of solutions
                                              
               Please also note that I give almost 50% discount for the 5-year series. I bought them at $13.00 and $12.00 for Chemistry and Physics. That's the market rate. So yeah, you are getting a real bargain here.
                                              
              For the motivated students who want MORE additional practices, here goes the list.
                                              
              The CS Toh textbooks and questions are quite hot-selling amongst A-Level students. Most of you should have seen it. I suggest you google it up to look at how the books look like. It's quite useful! Bought it around $18-20. So technically, you are getting it at a more than 50% discount if you want it from me.

              </p><p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">For H2 Chemistry students, I have a 3 booklets consisting of Physical Chem, Inorganic Chemistry, as well as Organic Chemistry questions from other JCs. They are binded together. It’s quite handy and useful for preparing school exams (which are significantly tougher than A level questions). So for those who wish to excel in school exams, you may want to try this. The questions are definitely more thought-provoking. I will be selling them only at $7.00 per copy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">1 Physical Chem booklet (Full answers)<br>1 Inorganic Chem booklet (Full answers)<br>1 Organic Chem booklet (I have some of the answers, but didn’t get the other half of it, lol. I can find it for you if you want)</p>
              <p></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">
              </p><p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>I have a <span>NEW</span> compilation of H2 Chemistry questions ranging from MCQs to structured questions. Never did a single question in it before. It contains around 900-1000++ questions, I suppose. It covers the <span>WHOLE</span> range of H2 Chemistry topics and once again, the questions are sorted into topics and collected from the various JCs papers. Those who think topic-by-topic revision will facilitate you in your learning, this is the book for you. I am selling it at $10.00 because this book is really good, lol.</p>
              <p></p>

              Latest Update: The Math Revision Packages and Chemistry Revision packages are in high demand. I apologise if most of you are unable to get your hand on it because I only have limited copies of them. Nevertheless, I could ask if my friends still have them and get them to sell it to you if you do want it. Thanks!
              
              I have one set of each of the 2012 H2 Mathematics Preliminary Papers from the following institutions. They contain some pencil markings but are generally new. I tried some questions in them before but most of the papers are not completed. Because these are the latest questions, I am selling the prelim paper from EACH institution at $3. Please note that I only have 1 copy each and only cater on a first-come-first-served basis. This is to help those who really need the extra materials to improve :)
              
              2012 H2 Mathematics Prelim Papers: ACJC, AJC, DHS, HCI, MJC, NJC, PJC, RVHS, SAJC, SRJC, TJC, VJC [All come with full solutions]
              
              2011 H2 Mathematics Prelim Papers: ACJC, DHS, HCI, VJC, TJC [Full solutions]
              Since these are from last year's prelim papers, I am selling them at $2 per institution. [Note: Slight pencil markings on some used prelim papers, but generally still in very clean and good condition]

              I received quite a number of queries asking for Chemistry and Physics 2012 Preliminary Papers. I do have a handful of them with me. Only 1-2 copy for each institution. I didn't really manage to complete the papers so only a few of the papers have scribblings. Let me know if you want to get them! 
              
              Here goes the list:
