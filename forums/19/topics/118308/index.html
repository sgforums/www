            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone use eBay before.  This is my first time..  I bid for a  1G MMC card at $ 102.50. During the process, I contacted the seller thru email to enquire about the product.  I also asked if I can buy the card from him before the bidding closed at the bid price.  He say no as the card would cost about $130 in the market.  If I am willing to pay $130, he do not mind selling it to be.  But me, I decided to try bidding.  I managed to win the bid at $102.50 but now I cannot contact the seller.

He doesn't have to pay rent so his products are cheaper. The product might have been won through some lucky draw also, therefore it's definitely cheaper, MOST of the times.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya.  I supposed you're right.  But I bought the matter to eBay and they say they need 1 - 2 days to investigate.  It's more than a week now yet they have not reverted.  Also, on their website, I posted my problem too, but that don't seems to help too.<br><br>Anyway, that will be my last time buying over there.  Hope mine experience can serves as a timely reminders to some who want to buy over there.  You have to be more careful lor ...
