            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>1) Timeline - Michael Crichton<br></strong><em>"In an Arizona desert a man wanders in a daze, speaking words that make no sense. Within twenty-four hours he is dead, his body swiftly cremated by his only known associates. Halfway around the world archaeologists make a shocking discovery at a medieval site. <br><br>Suddenly they are swept off to the headquarters of a secretive multinational corporation that has developed an astounding technology. Now this group is about to get a chance not to study the past but to enter it. And with history opened to the present, the dead awakened to the living, these men and women will soon find themselves fighting for their very survival–six hundred years ago. . . . "</em><br><br><strong>2) Star Trek - Invasion! (Bumper Edition)</strong><br><em>"The ultimate Star Trek® saga, spanning four thrilling adventures! The bestselling Star Trek epic of all time!<br><br>Long ago, even before the days of myth and legend, our worlds belonged to them. Now, across time and space, comes a fury that will test every one of Starfleet's greatest heroes.... "</em><br><br><strong>3) Dalglish - Stephen F. Kelly (Biography of Kenny Dalglish)</strong><br><em>"This updated edition of the 1992 biography tells the story of Kenny Dalglish, and takes his story up to March 1997, covering his appointment as manager of Newcastle United."</em><br><br><strong>4) Clear and Present Danger - Tom Clancy</strong><br><em>When a U.S. president decides that drug smuggling has become a "clear and present danger" to national security, the response is a complex and covert military campaign against the "Colombian Cartel."</em> <br><br><strong>5) Dragonlance : The Second Generation - Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman</strong><br><em>Years have passed since the end of the War of the Lance. The people of Ansalon have rebuilt their lives, their houses, their families. The Companions of the Lance, too, have returned to their homes, raising children and putting the days of their heroic deeds behind them.</em><br><br><em>But peace on Krynn comes at a price. The forces of darkness are ever vigilant, searching for ways to erode the balance of power and take control. When subtle changes begin to permeate the fragile peace, new lives are drawn into the web of fate woven around all the races. The time has come to pass the sword -- or the staff -- to the children of the Lance.</em><br><br><em>They are the Second Generation.</em><br><br><strong>6) Needful Things - Stephen King</strong><br><em>Leland Gaunt opens a new shop in Castle Rock called Needful Things. Anyone who enters his store finds the object of his or her lifelong dreams and desires: a prized baseball card, a healing amulet. In addition to a token payment, Gaunt requests that each person perform a little "deed," usually a seemingly innocent prank played on someone else from town. These practical jokes cascade out of control and soon the entire town is doing battle with itself. Only Sheriff Alan Pangborn suspects that Gaunt is behind the population's increasingly violent behavior. </em><br><br><strong>7) Forgotten Realms : Darkwater on Moonshae - Douglas Niles</strong><br><br><strong>8) The TommyKnockers - Stephen King</strong><br><em>Writer Bobbi Anderson becomes obsessed with digging up something she's found buried in the woods near her home. With the help of her friend, Jim Gardener, she uncovers an alien spaceship. Though exposure to the Tommyknockers who piloted the alien craft has detrimental effects on residents' health, the people of Haven develop a talent for creating innovative devices under its increasingly malignant influence. </em><br><br><strong>9) Carrion Comfort - Dan Simmons</strong><br><em>The second novel by World Fantasy Award-winner Simmons ( The Song of Kali ) is a 636-page epic that draws on a variety of genres--horror, science fiction, political thriller, Hollywood roman a clef. It centers around a small number of "mind vampires" who can subjugate other people to their wills, read their minds, experience through their senses. The immensely powerful vampires use others, often bloodily, and often in frivolous "games" (hunting human prey, chess games with human pieces, and so on). Opposing them are Saul Laski, a psychologist and concentration-camp survivor, who is devoted to tracking down the Nazi vampire von Borchert; Natalie Preston, whose father inadvertently and fatally crossed the path of a pawn of the ancient, dotty vampire Melanie Fuller; Sheriff Bobby Joe Gentry, dragged in while investigating the multiple murders that marked the departure of Melanie Fuller from Charleston; and a host of other normals and vampires whose lives impinge on those of the principals. While he could profitably have trimmed the novel by a third, Simmons has produced, overall, a compelling thriller.</em><br><br><strong>10) Encounter with Tiber - Buzz Aldrin &amp; John Barnes</strong><br><em>Buzz Aldrin, one of manned space flight's pioneers, has helped create a stunning, possibly prophetic novel of the future of space exploration. A radio beacon from an unknown world leads an astronaut to disaster on the Moon -- and his son far beyond that as he searches for the key to the mystery of Tiber, a civilization who left artifacts in the solar system some 9,000 years ago, with sufficient impact on human affairs to explain some odd references in the Bible. The villains of the book are not the aliens, but the benighted politicians with the minds of accountants who won't fund the necessary scientific derring-do to save the world -- apparently an affliction which alien astronauts also have to bear. </em><br><br><strong>11) Frontiers II - Isaac &amp; Janet Asimov</strong><br><em>In this second collection of their weekly science columns for the Los Angeles Times syndicate, Isaac Asimov is joined by his wife, Janet, who coauthored a number of the essays and independently wrote about a quarter of them. Apparently, Isaac was ill during the winter before his death in April 1992, and Janet therefore became involved in his work. This collection is as far-ranging as the first ( Frontiers , LJ 1/90), dealing with proteins in the first paper, then advancing to "What Teeth Can Tell Us," an analysis of the dodo, and a discussion of the spread of landfills. The book is arranged in four parts: "Life: Past, Present, and Future"; "Our Planet and Our Neighbors"; "Science and Technology"; and "The Universe from Quarks to the Cosmos." As educational and entertaining as the first volume, this is recommended for popular science collections.</em><br><br><strong>12) The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew (Hardcover)</strong><br><br>All books are in good condition.<br><br>Interested parties, please PM me indicating which book(s) you are interested in.</p></div>
