              <p>Designed by a German Engineer and Microbiologically tested , itâ€™s a
                                                      formula making machine that ensures your formula milk is prepared
                                                      hygienically, conveniently and safely, for the consumption of both
                                                      babies and breast feeding mothers. The machine is patented worldwide
                                                      and incorporates the following core functions in one sleek apparatus:<br> <br> * A Steam Sterilizer<br> * An Air Pot &amp;<br> * A Programmed Formula Maker<br> <br> This machine stores both Milk Powder and Water separately. It will mix
                                                      them instantly and accurately for various amounts of feed directly into
                                                      an awaiting milk bottle. The LCD will display both the dispensing
                                                      amount you need in ounces or ml. The user can dispensed anything from 2
                                                      ounces (60ml) to 12 ounces (360ml) in step of 1 ounces. Before making
                                                      formula, it will boil the water to ensure it is fit for consumption.
                                                      Then "Express Cool" the hot boiled water and "Keeps Warm" at your
                                                      desired temperature suitable for multiple feedings later. It will also
                                                      "Dispense only Water" if that is what you want. Morever, it steam
                                                      sterilizes milk bottles &amp; breast pumps in a totally separate
                                                      compartment, without you having to add water for steaming each time!
                                                      Unlike other methods like using UV, sterilizing with steam will not
                                                      result in uneven or dangerous hot spots on the utensils.<br> <br> The Milk Expresso is programmed to be compatible with all major milk
                                                      powder brands available in the market. Powder manufactured by world
                                                      renown manufacturers such as Abbott (Similac), Mead Johnson (Enfalac),
                                                      Frisco, Wyeth, Dumex, etc can all be use with the machine. Breast
                                                      feeding mothers can use the machine to dispense formula for their own
                                                      consumption too. All you have to do is to select the group number from
                                                      a corresponding list of milk powder brands in the menu settings. Yes,
                                                      you dont need to think of how many scoops for how much formula needed
                                                      anymore ! At Babywell, our laboratory has calibrated all kinds of
                                                      powder available in the market and assign a program no. to each kind of
                                                      powder. All you need is to refer to the back of the User Guide and
                                                      select the "Program Group no." for the kind of powder you are using.
                                                      Then select that program no. in the Menu setting for the 1st time when
                                                      you use the machine. Once selected properly, our machine will dispense
                                                      the same amount of powder as recommended by the powder manufacturer (in
                                                      terms of weight) for various amount of feed needed each time. ie, if 4
                                                      scoops are needed, then the machine will dispense powder equivalent to
                                                      4 scoops in weight. You can even vary this selected concentration
                                                      easily from the menu settings upon your paediatricians'
                                                      recommendations. Morever, you can select the water temperature (between
                                                      35 to 60 degree Celsius, in step of 1 degree Celsius precision) that
                                                      you think is most suitable for your baby. Our machine will sense &amp;
                                                      display the water temperature at +/- 1 degree Celsius precisio. It will
                                                      also maintain the water at +/- 3 degree Celsius range from what you
                                                      need for feeding. Above or below this range, the machine will prevent
                                                      you from dispensing Milk. That way, your baby will never get a thermal
                                                      burn. What a safety feature! Last but not least, this machine works
                                                      with almost all milk bottle sizes currently available in the market
                                                      using an adjustable lever which can easily be moved up or down to suit
                                                      your bottle height.<br> <br> Key features includes:<br> <br> * Only water at the desired temperature will be dispensed for formula;<br> * Dispense the exact desired amount of water &amp; powder for mixing;<br> * Conventional boiling of water and steam sterilizing for reliable results;<br> * No dangerous hot spot, uneven sterilizing or incomplete boiling cause by using microwave or UV light;<br> * Programmes to choose for almost all brands of Milk Powder.<br> <br> Imagine, no more hassles during preparation of formula milk (thousands
                                                      of times) especially in the middle of the night when you are tired and
                                                      have to awaken from a deep slumber !! No more worries about giving your
                                                      baby a thermal burn if the water temperature is too hot. No more mind
                                                      boggling guesswork of how much powder to go with various amount of
                                                      feed. No more digging of that powder scoop and unhygienic hand contact
                                                      with the milk powder. No more doubts if your maid or other caregivers
                                                      are performing this task correctly, hygienically and consistently. No
                                                      more walking back and forth to the kitchen to prepare formula. The Milk
                                                      Expresso is sleek and can be easily stored near the baby's cot or in
                                                      the parents' bedroom. It provides clean water at the right temperature
                                                      to be mixed with suitable amount of powder consistently, automatically
                                                      and instantly when needed. Now, imagine the chore of preparing infant
                                                      formula for thousands of times in the first 5 years of the baby's life
                                                      has just been reduced to virtually a simple one arm, one touch
                                                      operation every time!</p>
