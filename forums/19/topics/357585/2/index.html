              <p>then make sure they pay for the damages...why worry about such things. if u rented it out to the proper people, u are less likely to have this problem...If u rented out to thai or bangla construction workers, then good luck.</p>

There are organisations tho who help students as in funding and housing. But those dont do singapore. I could use one of those organisations to go to Indonesia, but I've been a couple of times to Indonesia as hollidays and I dont think I would like going there for the living. Indonesia is my favourite holliday country tho, mainly because my roots I guess.</p>

              <p>If you are looking at resale or private property from the open market, you need to pay a minimum 5% cash deposit. Say you have 80k, you can look at a property worth $1.6 mil. But the problem is you should also consider how much CPF you have. Say you are looking at a $1.6mil property, you will need to pay 80k in cash deposit and the reminding 15% deposit of $240k from your CPF. If your CPF does not have that much money you would need to fork out the balance in cash. Here is an example,</p>
              <p>Total Value of Resale Private Property : $1,000,000</p>
              <p>Total Deposit required : $200,000 (20%)</p>
              <p>Minimum Cash Deposit : $50,000</p>
              <p>Available in CPF account : $90,000</p>
              <p>Required cash Deposit : $200,000 - $90,000 = $110,000</p>
              <p>But if you are buying an new property project (Buying direct from developer), you can put down 1% of the total sale price (in cash only) as an option excercise fee. Thereafter you would normally have 2-3 months to pay the remaining 19% using your CPF or a mixture of both cash and CPF if your CPF does not have enough balance to pay for the 19%. Please be reminded that this is only for new properties that are directly bought from the developer.</p>
              <p>Another difference in buying completed/Resale Property and new properties that there are no CPF Housing Grant for purchasing a
                  property on the open market (Resale or Completed projects), the grants are only available for
                  new properties bought direct from the developer.</p>
              <p>I do not know the exact minimum sum a bank is willing to loan, and the maximum sum would depend on your income/expense, credit report and also your current loan standings. You will have to approach a banker to clarify your doubts about the financing. The only restriction fo buying an property on the open market is that you have to be a Singapore Citizen or a PR.</p>

              <p>That would be considered a personal loan or unsecured loan since there is no form of mortage and will be quite difficult to get. I know some people who make use of overdraft facilities to do this but the interest rates are too high to be worth it. You will have to consult a banker for more details.</p>

              <p>Another alternative is to look at studio apartments. Some are going for around 400k. Your cash on hand should be able to pay for those.</p>
