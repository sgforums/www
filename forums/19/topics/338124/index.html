              <p>Beware of bogus $2 moving companies.</p>
              <p>If you are moving internationally, you really have to do a lot of homework and background checks<br>of the companies you intend to hire to help you move. Do not be swayed by websites or even broker<br>agents who claimed how well they know these companies.</p>
              <p><br>One company to beware of is <a href="mailto:Movers@worx">Movers@worx</a>. <br>It is a $2 private limited company with no assets.</p>
              <p>Our story:</p>
              <p>We had to relocate recently because of my husband's overseas posting. <br>We had to pack up the entire house basically because we did not own any property here.</p>
              <p>My husband looked on the web for a moving company and found Cross Roads, a moving broker firm who <br>got us quotes from various movers. We decided to go with Astro because their price seemed fair.<br>The agent however told us to go with another company, <a href="mailto:Movers@worx">Movers@worx</a> international p/L, because<br>she had good experiences with them before. Although the price was a bit higher than Astro's, we <br>decided to heed the agent's advice because of her claimed experience in this line and with <br><a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a>.</p>
              <p>The men came to our house, packed and labelled our stuff in boxes quite professtionally. <br>We noticed the boxes were labelled with another moving company's name and logo. It did not<br>raise any alarm. The director of <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a> came, we signed the contract and was given an invoice. <br>He also prepared the inventory list as they packed our items. He said he would give us the copy<br>later. We were told there would be 1 week FOC warehouse storage for our items.<br>We gave him the cheque for the shipment of our items and they left.</p>
              <p><br>We needed to find a house in the new country before the movers could arrange to ship our things.<br>We found one after 2 months. We gave the address to <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a> so they could ship immediately. <br>Then they emailed and said we had to pay for the warehouse storage incurred plus peak shipping<br>surcharge, fumigation fees, which weren't stated in their quote before. They would not ship <br>unless we paid. So we paid them again as requested, asking for the documentations of the <br>warehouse charges and shipping bill of laden. They promised to email the documents but never did.</p>
              <p>Whenever we called <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a>, the director guy in-charge would not pick up the phone. <br>His staff would not know where he is and he never returned our calls and emails. When he finally<br>did reply to our emails, he told us our things have arrived at the port. It would take about<br>10 days to clear customs and truck to our address. So we waited. Then after 2 weeks, no news. <br>We tried to contact that guy again and again he's missng in action.</p>
              <p>We contacted the broker agent to get her to contact <a href="mailto:Movers@worx">Movers@worx</a> to tell us where our things are<br>but to no avail as well. We were getting anxious and frustrated. <br>We had our family members back at home to help us file a complaint with CASE. <br>Also went the to police to make a report. We engaged a lawyer to review our case.</p>
              <p>It was at least 3 months later when we made the trip back home and wanted to confront the man. <br>He finally replied to our smses and agreed to meet and let us view our cargo. He did not turn up.<br>Instead, at the warehouse, we meet the owner and the owner of the actual moving company who<br>packed our belongings! The mover told us that <a href="mailto:Mover@worx">Mover@worx</a> contracted them to do the move but<br>did not pay a single cent afterwards. So they stored our items in the warehouse, and now we<br>had to pay for the warehouse to release our items. 6 months worth of storage mounting to nearly<br>$5000!!!</p>
              <p>It was clear that <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a> was running a scam. We already had the idea that that man<br>has taken us for a ride but we were even more angry that he only revealed the location<br>of our items after making us wait for 6 months with the storage charges increasing every month!</p>
              <p> <br>Even then, the director of <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a> had the audacity to email us and said <br>he was doing his job, and asked us to pay for the storage to release the items and let him do<br>the shipping still!!! How ridiculous??!! Needless to say, he refused to refund our money paid to <br>him. <br> <br>Our lawyer told us that it is best to pay the storage to get our things back and find a reliable <br>forwarder to ship our items. Because <a href="mailto:movers@worx">movers@worx</a> seems to be a dud company, we would incur more<br>losses if we file a lawsuit against him. He would not have the money to compensate<br>our losses. So that man gets away scott free basically.</p>
