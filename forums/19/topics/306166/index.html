My army buddies and I are looking to sell our PSP Slim &amp; Lites. It's really unfortunate that due to orders from higher HQ that we can't bring in PSPs, particularly sets that can *ahem* due to piracy and security issues. Therefore there's no point in holding onto something that we can't bring in, neither do we want to get into trouble by smuggling them in. The RPs do a fine job ransacking every bag we brought in. To our dissappointment and to your delight, we are going to let our PSPs go at reasonable prices so as to pool our funds to buy ORIGINAL DVDs, a DVD player and a TV for our so-called ONLY entertainment at our camp.<br><br>There's a total of 7 packages of PSP Slim &amp; Lites and I will be acting as the so-called agent. Likewise all PSPs are guaranteed in perfect working conditions. All at least 7.5/10, with screen protectors and crystal cases since Day 1. The PSP packages are as below:<br><br>Package 1 (9.0/10, metal ring slightly scratched)<br><br>- 1 X Piano Black PSP Slim &amp; Lite (PSP-2006PB)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 3-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 3rd Party MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $260, local set, Sony warranty left 10 months.<br><br>Package 2 (8.5/10, PSP faceplate slightly scratched)<br><br>- 1 X Piano Black PSP Slim &amp; Lite (PSP-2006PB)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 3-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 4GB Lexar MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $260, local set, Sony warranty left 8 months.<br><br>Package 3 (7.5/10, PSP backplate slightly damaged)<br><br>- 1 X Piano Black PSP Slim &amp; Lite (PSP-2006PB)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 3-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 4GB Sony MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $260, local set, Sony warranty left 8 months.<br><br>Package 4 (9.5/10, perfect condition so 9.5 for normal usage wear and tear)<br><br>- 1 X Ceramic White Slim &amp; Lite (PSP-2000CW)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 2-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X Decalgirl skin applied for protection<br>- 1 X 4GB Sandisk Gaming Edition MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $320, export set, Qisahn warranty left 10 months.<br><br>Package 5 (9.5/10, well cared PSP in very good condition)<br><br>- 1 X Black Phat PSP (PSP-1006Black)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 3-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 4GB Sandisk Gaming Edition MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $260, local set, Sony warranty left 3 months.<br><br>Package 6 (7.5/10, incurred plenty physical damages but in working condition)<br><br>- 1 X Blue Phat PSP (PSP-1000Blue)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 2-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 4GB Sandisk Gamining Edition MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $220, export set, no warranty.<br><br>Package 7 (7.5/10, incurred plenty physical damages but in working condition)<br><br>- 1 X Ceramic White Phat PSP (PSP-1006CW)<br>- 1 X AC power cord (with 3-pin coverting adaptor attached)<br>- 1 X AC Adaptor<br>- 1 X Battery pack<br>- 1 X Printed materials<br>- 1 X Crystal case<br>- 1 X 4GB Sony MSPD<br><br>B.N.P = $220, local set, no warranty.<br><br>All sets comes with 1 week personal warranty from the date of purchase, and warranty shall be covered by respective shops thereafter. Don't worry, the original reciept will be given to you for warranty purposes.<br><br>The reason why all these sets are offered at B.N.P is that we do not wish to waste time on the sales. We have been so-called wasting our 2 years already so... Just show us the money. Pardon me for my poor english too.<br><br>Able to deal anytime on weekends and after 7 PM on weekdays. As I am a stayout personnel, I am able to deal on weekdays too. Just give me ample time to reach home and get the sets you are interested in. Viewing of the sets are welcomed, then you can decide whether to buy or not. Sincere buyers only! Don't waste each others time! If interested parties were to compare with the price of a brand new set and stuff, I suggest that they get a brand new one instead. Rubbish offers will not be entertained. On the contrary, reasonable offers can be considered.<br><br>Please pardon me if I do not reply your SMS immediately. Sometimes I will be doing my wayang duties in camp. Resasurred that I will get to you ASAP! Calls for enquiry are welcomed too, however if I seemed to be rude to you, please pardon me because the previous caller might have pissed me off, or I might be having mood swings. Please understand. And don't bother to PM my forum account as I seldom check the PMs and stuff. So do SMS or call me.<br><br>Interested parties can contact me at 97653118 (No. Edited!!!), and a friendly bump of my thread is more than welcomed. Thanks.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>pideerarpuur</p></div>
