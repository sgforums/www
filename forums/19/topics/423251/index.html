              Currently, we have an education centre in Tampines Central with about 20 students. The education centre has 7 classrooms, 1 office, 1 reception area, 1 meeting room, and a main event hall.
              
              The education centre has been operating for a year now. Close to $250,000 has been spent on it already with about $70000 being held as 6 months rental deposit by the landlord. We have a 2 years agreement with the landlord so basically, thereâ€™s another year of the agreement left.
              
              The education centre needs about 60 students to break even. At its peak, the education centre was having 50 over students but currently, itâ€™s down to 20 students. Most students left after their exams ended around December last year.
              
              Previously, there was only 2 staff handling the marketing. A new shareholder joined in last month mainly for the marketing and the marketing staff has been increased to 8, with some of the staff from the shareholderâ€™s company.
              
              We are looking for another 1-2 investors to come in as partners. It would be excellent especially if you have the networks or contacts to help attract more students in on top of the new marketing team at the moment. We believe with everyone working together, the company will hit profitability within 3-4 months.
              
              If youâ€™re interested, we can meet and discuss about all our current marketing efforts by the whole marketing team. We have been tackling on all angles from traditional marketing to social media marketing to viral marketing, anything to get the students in.
              
              Youâ€™re also welcome for a viewing of the education centre or you may locate the pictures on Facebook, just search for EduPad or visit our homepage at http://www.EduPad.com.sg/
              
              If everything is going smoothly, using our knowhow from the existing education centre, we plan to open another centre in the west/north/south area of Singapore. Alternatively, weâ€™re looking to be registered as a school as we have the contacts for overseas students.
              
              We're looking at an investment range around $80k for a portion of the company equity. If you would like to be the majority shareholder, I think we may need to discuss with the other partners.
