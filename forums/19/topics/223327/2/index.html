Also, if you're buying brand new, you're likely to pay the same price for the stainless steel Daytona as you would for a Rolesor (18K/SS mix) Daytona.<br><br>No, it doesn't make any sense, but what you do have to keep in mind is that Rolex's reputation is largely based on its stainless steel models.  My Sea Dweller, which is all stainless steel, was purchased at S$6650 in 2004, but if I wanted to offload it now, I could get at least $8600 for it in less than a week.</div>

Not that I ever buy any of my watches to sell, but the ones I have picked up could very easily be moved.

As I said, as far as Rolexes go, there's little, if any, issue about the watches being made of stainless steel because the market's there for it.<br><br>As for the brand name issue, people buy them for various reasons.  For myself, I like their after-sales service.  When I send my watch in for a service, it not only gets its movement cleaned, oiled and regulated, but Rolex goes over every single part and restores it to brand-new condition - it's as good as getting a brand-new watch all over again.  On top of that, Rolex's 31XX series of movements are regarded as being the most rugged automatic movements around, although something like the IWC Ingeneuir is a lot more over-engineered.  A number of fellow Rolex owners I know have taken up watch making courses to further appreciate the history of the developments and the work that goes into the design of their watches.  To write it all off as a brand-name issue would be an overgeneralisation.</div>
