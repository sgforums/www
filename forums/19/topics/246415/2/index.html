            <div class='col-md body'>hmm...interesting discussion...seems like a selling thread had became a debate. hoho.<br><br>1. AK became a millionaire at 26. (The company AK started got all valuable contracts for a major company in sg. Hence it became a million dollar business. The MD of the company giving the contracts was Vince Khoo, his father).<br><br>2. AK inherited his father's multi million business. The company was around even before AK was borned. FYI, AK's parents are both multi-millionare to begin with.<br><br>3. The stuff in his books is widely available, esp from others speakers like anthony robbins, buzan, richard blander, etc etc. He didn't really created all those stuff he's teaching. He just renamed and re-phased it. Even some of the stories and examples he used in his books are exactly the same as robbins's.<br><br>For me personally, respect comes from people who lead by example. If my school teacher keeps coming late for school, who is he/she to tell me I can't be late? If AK himself did not became a millionaire through own's hardwork but by inheritance, then who is he to tell me I should do this do that to be successful?<br><br>Although I have a copy of Master your mind book (the stuff in it is good, a compilation of some success theories from Anthony robbins, think and grow rich,  and NLP stuff) , I dun really respect him as a person. He may earn much much more than me, but wrongfully claiming credit is immoral.<br><br>But to be fair, he too puts in his hard work. He is a good marketeer.<br><br>If today u are AK's fan, then by all means go all out to do what u aim. It doesn't matter whether he's good or bad. What matters is at the end, whether you are successful/achieve ur goal.<br></div>

What's his secret to going to his dream JC from a crappy neighbourhood school? Pure hard work. I don't understand what's the difference between him and many other students in Sinapore. There are many instances in which a neighbourhood school student went into an elite JC and then achieved 1st class honors in the university. Why is he so special?<br><br>The other thing I don't understand is why people are sending money to him just to inspire them to study through useless activities. He is a millionare because silly people made him one. If no one is attracted to his course, there is no way that he would be a a millionaire. In short, he became successful by opening courses, giving speeches and writing books teaching other people to be successful. It's like saying one became a milionaire by writing books on how to be a millonaire. It was pure hypocrisy and an absolute irony. I remembered him saying that the key to success is to set goals in life, and him setting a goal to be a millionaire by the age of thirty and he did it. Hmmm... How did he achieve this goal in the first place? I don't see Warren Buffett writing books. </div></blockquote></div>
