              i'm a glutton for punishment. I had looked at the TRX system for about 5
               months and did my homework and finally bought one. I set it up in my 
              basement right away and started going through the exercise list to "test
               drive" it. I immediately knew it was worth every penny! My mom even 
              asked how it worked and I let her hop on for a minute and she said it 
              might be a good Father's Day gift for dad! Thanks TRX! Awesome product!<br> <br> 5 out of 5 Stars: Just received in the mail 3-31-2011 - by Janna H. from Springfield, MA<br> I've been checking the mail for my TRX everyday and today it finally 
              arrived. Hooray! I can't wait to start the 12 week program. I'm a single
               parent that doesn't have much time to hit the gym. When a fellow 
              Soldier showed me the TRX at work I was pretty impressed by the 
              simplicity of the design and the hardcore burn factor it can inflict. 
              That same night I ordered my own. TRX body here I come!!!<br> <br> 5 out of 5 Stars: Watch out 2011! 12-31-2010 - by Roy from ,<br> The great people at FitnessAnywhere accommodated my request for the 
              updated version and now that It has reached me, it's an amazing product!
               Now I am able to complement my fitness training with the TRX and it's a
               great feeling! Watch out 2011! Better fitness, here I come! </blockquote></div>
