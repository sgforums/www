              <p>Hi. I'm from pakistan and am planning to travel to singapore for 6 weeks. I needed an accomodation for this time period and unfortunately i'm on a very tight budget. I was hoping for some advice on short term accommodation from this forum.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have looked at hotels, they are mostly much too expensive. I am looking for a single room for 2 people at SGD 50-60 a night.</p>
              <p>Backpackers do not have the kind of space i need for luggage.</p>
              <p>IF there are short term rental rooms available, is there any reliable way of locating and booking them?</p>
              <p>I have a budget of 1250 SGD for 43 day stay,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you all in advance.</p>

              <p>a possibility that they cum here to work. also note they will use electricity and water so by the time you wait or the utility bills o their last saty they should say they will have to be going. pay outfront they can use as much as they like.</p>
