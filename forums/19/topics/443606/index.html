              <p>I'm looking to sell one of my companies. It already have existing clients but most likely to remove any conflict of interest, I will be selling at a much lower price but all the existing clients will be transfered, meaning you will buy over the company but you will have to find your own clients. The company is a cloud based IT company and the website is <a href="http://SingLeaf.com/">http://SingLeaf.com/</a></p>
              <p>If you have questions, please email me directly at <a href="mailto:Eric@SingLeaf.com">Eric@SingLeaf.com</a></p>
              <p>You can choose to take over the existing office at Orchard or not, up to you.</p>
              <p>I'm selling because I'm raising cash for my other company.</p>
              <p>You will be getting the following...</p>
              <p>- 100% of the company shares.</p>
              <p>- Ownership of all the 7-8 solutions indicated plus source codes.</p>
              <p>- Rights to find and assign new Franchisee in other parts of the world</p>
              <p>- Take over an assigned franchisee in Singapore (allocated South East Asia to them) (basically they are a sales team selling our solutions to their clients) working on profit sharing basis, so no monthly payroll committments.</p>
              <p>- Servers</p>
              <p>- All the inventory worth about $5k mentioned in <a href="http://singleaf.com/incentives.html">http://singleaf.com/incentives.html</a></p>
              <p> - 3 months transition period to go through everything as necessary. If need more time on transition, we can negotiate but any deals sealed during the period will be shared 50/50.</p>
              <p>- Monthly expenditure is about $1k/month inclusive of office. Programmers are paid on a project basis when the clients request for new customizations, of which we will makeup a percentage of the programmers fee and quote to the client.</p>
              <p>- Office (Optional)</p>
              <p>- Profit is in the 5 digits low mid range.</p>
              <p> It is strongly preferred someone with IT background to take over because the sales team while they can find clients, you still need to have IT knowledge to address the client's technical worries.</p>

              <p><br>The problem is that I can't fix a good number because as we add new clients/franchisee, the value increases immediately and currently we're in talks with a few major clients. The increase can vary by such big differences that it can be a few times the amount quoted. Imagine I say $1 now and 1 month later we signed an agreement with a major client and the deal is worth $2, so now I tell you I want to sell the company for $3, which is 3 times the original quote.</p>
              <p>For a small client, the revenue will be about 1-10k/year and for major clients we're looking at $20k onwards annually.</p>
              <p>What I can do is this, we can bring you in to meetings with the major clients and show you the invoices for what the clients are paying us, so you know how much revenue to expect. You can also guage whether on your existing networks, could you leverage on it and bring in immediate clients. Some already have networks to certain companies and they can immediately leverage on those connections.</p>
              <p>It's also easier to talk face to face because I can type until hand pain also not as good as say bring you down to see a meeting and then we negotiate the deal and you can see how much the deal worth etc.</p>

              <p>The company owns 7-8 solutions created entirely by our own programmers, so basically it has its own products &amp; portfolio. Yes, that's why we can white label our solutions and appoint franchisee to partner and sell these solutions.</p>
              <p>A new company will take time + money + additional money to fix bugs and add missing features while ours are in used by clients. So a new company wanting to start from scratch will spend about 1-2 years to catch up and another $80k to build up those solutions. All these are estimates and based on my own expenditure.</p>
              <p>And Ice make a good point, it's preferred someone with IT background take over because without IT background, it's much harder to go talk to clients also.</p>
              <p>I'm trying to raise $200k at the moment, of which some will come from the sale of this company and some from the bank loans to fund something I bought in the other company. If I sell at $1 to charlize, then I need to raise another $199,999 from the bank loan.</p>
              <p>My ideal selling price is of course 200k but there is a reason why I never put any figure. I want to be open to a lower offer and not kill off all offers. And the amount also depends if you want to take over the existing clients. If you really insists on taking over existing clients, then the valuation will be many times higher heading into 7 digits (existing client contracts willl be shown to let you see the revenue).</p>
              <p>Ideally I prefer to cut the selling price and remove the clients altogether, so there's no issues later saying the client want to work with me and not you etc, a lot of avoidable problems. I'm trying to reduce the headaches and problems later for both parties by making sure there's no conflict of interests later on.</p>

When you mention a new business, I don't think some days a random referred client will just call in for a new sale. To compare a totally new business vs an existing business that has proven positive cash flow is abit unfair, ain't it?</p>
              <p>As for the amount, that's why I keep refusing to put an amount. I keep not wanting to put any amount because I am open to offers. You guys insist so I put my ideal figure and now you are making fun of it. (But you imagine when we first started, we paid $80k for the programmers to create these without any clients, we must look stupid to you. We also started without clients and built our way up, which company doesn't? Not just we spent money but we spent years of our lives hard work.) But if you're talking about taking the clients away then we're already making revenue in the 6 digits past year and the sales is growing (because you just retain the existing clients and add new clients so the base rate will grow over the years) so it doesn't make sense.</p>
              <p>The agreement will be the sale inclusive of the rights of ownership to those solutions. Our side have spent about $80k overall on the solutions and getting them stable and secured.</p>
              <p>And because some may be skeptical like for example, how would anyone subscribe till 2016... that's why we can show proof, black and white. We have built trust, our reputation is there. You start a new company and compare it, it's very unfair.</p>

              <p>The last time I sold my other entity DailyFreeGames.com and I wanted $60k, the guy offered many times lesser, which I end up accepting because really needed the cash. That company also no clients because everything is free, every month I am losing money. Now they managed to make it worth more than $200k USD and they are making good money every month.</p>
              <p>Compared to Match.com, I am alot luckier. The founder of Match.com only took $50k but the business is now worth billions. Yes, Match.com is worth billions and the founder only took $50k and was out.</p>

              <p><br>My contacts are restricted to clients and some business guys. I wanted to type something long but then here's the point form instead...</p>
              <ul>
              <li>I don't join business networks so my contacts are restricted.</li>
              <li>My marketing are done online through google/yahoo/msn/etc. (so mostly clients)</li>
              <li>I never aggressively push for sales because I prefer the semi retired lifestyle. enough to live comfortably, never buy branded stuff, live simple.</li>
              <li>Rather than pushing something to friends, I rather someone who is interested come to take over. Isn't it awkward to suddenly out of the blue ask a friend, "eh u want to buy my company?"</li>
              <li>The person taking over have to have the passion and belief to succeed... it's abit hard to randomly check my friend list to see who i think have the passion and belief.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>I posted here because to see if I can get a decent offer. If not, then obviously I will continue working on the sales.</p>
              <p>The thing is I don't mind being very transparent, showing the accounts/contracts/etc... I can even tell you the first year only make less than $10k revenues, then second year a few times more, then third year alot better than second year. In fact first year I slog so bloody hard to get sales. It took me 6-7 months for the first client to come in!!! but after that quite smooth sailing slowly build up the reputation.</p>
