            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Replies Retrieval of www.hardwarezone.com(R) Classified Ad<br><br>=&gt; Reply 1<br>- Replier Email: sundayeda4@yahoo.com<br>- Reply: Hello, Am Pastor Fred of E32ND ST BROOLYN,NEW YORK CITY.USA.A registered member of www.ec21.com and www.alibab.com.I came across your ad @ www.hardwarezone.com.sg/classified while searching for a similar item.I am intrested in buying and would like to send it to my adopted child(COS WE DONT HAVE CHILDREN)whom i LOVE so much in Nigeria for his research work in the University.I will be adding $100 if sold to me. Pls do reply as soon as possible with the total cost plus shipping so as to make start arrangement on payment.I offer payment via my bidpay account,i.e bidpay money order(www.bidpay.com).Bidpay is an affliation of western union money transfer which serves as middleman between the buyer and the seller for safety and security to prevent scams as it is rampant on internet now.You ll have nothing to pay as charge as i would be paying all the charges unlike paypal.Once i make the payment,you will get a confirmation from bidpay and the next process or instruction shall be given to you by Bidpay on how to get your money.You can collect your money in whatever way you like depending on you.Since you are aren`t a member yet,your money will have to be brought directly to the address you provide so as to PROTECT your money. As for the shippment to Nigeria,i shall be bearing the cost and i would prefer you use FEDEX for the shippment and calculate the total cost including shipping via FEDEX to Nigeria and let me know the amount am to pay because its an urgent and serious buy. If it is okay by you kindly get back to me with your FULL NAME AND ADDRESS in which i ll send the payment as i look forward to sealing this deal on time. Thanks I wait to read from you.<br>- Replied Time: 2005-08-06 18:40:08<br><br>Hello seller, I am interested in this item and i will be sending it to africa as i have promise a client of mine who have paid for me .i will pay for this item via western union auction payment(BIDPAY) and as soon as my payment is approve by western union(bidpay) i will send fedex to your house so that they can come and pick it up ro you do the shipment yourself.pls i will be very happy and glad to have another deal with you some other time if you can really help me with the urgency in need of the item over there.add an amount of $5 to the payment i will be addressing to you its for appreciation if you can help me with the urgency in need of this item and let me know the total amount for the transaction.all i need now is just your full name and address so that i can address the payment to you and to schedule the pick up.if this is okay with you,you can get back to me asap so as to meet up with the urgency in need of these item.hope to hear from you soon.<br>Regards</span><br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Hi guys,<br>Im not sure if you all have received such messages from any of your auctions before, but well beware of them.<br><br>When someone email you they are in a hurry to buy an item at high price and can't wait for the bid to end, especially when they request you to send item to overseas, this is some tell-tale sign of scam email, be very careful. This happens especially to electronic items and expensive items.<br><br>Either you ignore and delete such email, or wait till you receive and SEE the real money.<br><br>Symtoms of a scam:<br><br>1. Offered much higher prices to buy your item<br><br>2. Insist that they pay by BidPay Money Order<br><br>3. Items to be sent to Africa/Nigeria<br><br>&gt;&gt;Please be very VERY CAREFUL! Do not be blinded by GREED!!<br><br>&gt;&gt;Please do remember that www.bidpay.com DO NOT ask for tracking number. Once anyone indicate that you must sent a tracking number to bidpay.com (the email address is a fake) this transaction is a scam.<br><br>COMMON SCENARIOS:<br><br>-- Received email from western union about the confirmation of the amount received from buyer.<br><br>-- Buyer request to shipped out the goods.<br><br>-- After you have already shipped out the goods, you nv receive the $$ -- Checked with western union bidpay on the status of your money order, realised that there was NONE</span></div>
