And agreed to meet up on Tuesday for the transaction.<br><br>Seller 2306hrs sms was replied only 14minutes later  as buyer was engaged on the other line apologized and reply to the seller at 2320hrs. In between that 14minutes, at about 2315 a female forummer posted a reply and claimed that she had sold hers sometime in Nov'04 to a school boy for about $260.<br>Buyer's 2320hrs sms was then not replied, so does to his 2 other subsequent sms at 2321hrs and 2330hrs.<br><br>On 20/02/05 at 1239hrs buyer sent another sms to confirmed the location. And was only replied at 1320hrs (41minutes later) and said that he/she had GIVEN the phone to it's cousin. (wow.. it was like ... just 12hrs ago he/she was trying so hard to sell it more then it first projected price....and now had it given away??? Well....)<br><br>Ref to seller's 1342hrs sms, well we are not running a business company whereby official documents are print and sign by both parties. And a verbal vocal agreement between 2 parties may carries the lightest weight but fortunately I did save my incoming and outgoing sms-es which would be a valid text evident in the name of law as it  includes the date, time and sender's hp number.<br><br>19/02/05<br>2233hrs	Hi, interested in your X300. Is it still available?<br><br>2243hrs	Yes it still is. But I have an offer for 75 dollars. Am willing to part with it<br>for 80.<br><br>2248hrs	Wow...I tot it was $59.....<br><br>2253hrs	I know. Sorry but I have a higher bidder. Its still an excellent offer though.<br><br>2253hrs	Ok lah $80 deal. See you on Tuesday can?<br><br>2259hrs	Tues after 530pm is good. Where would you like to meet?<br><br>2300hrs	I'm working in town, is it alright for you?<br><br>2306hrs	Yeah. No problem. McDonald's Wisma Atria at 620pm good for you?<br><br>2320hrs	Sorry, was on the line. Prefer Clarke Quay or Chinatown area and if<br>possible after 730pm.<br><br>2321hrs	Sorry I just hate to drive to Orchard Road at that timing.<br><br>2330hrs	So how? Is it alright for you?<br><br>20/02/05<br>1239hrs	Hi, so is Tuesday after 730pm ok with you?<br><br>1320hrs	Sorry. I have given the phone to my cousin.
