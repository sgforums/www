            <div class='col-md body'>If you have been paying full priced tickets to attend the many seminars going on in Singapore, here's a tip that can <strong>save you quite a bit of money</strong>.<br><br>Many seminars especially those on <strong>business opportunity, internet marketing and education</strong> offers affiliate schemes to past participants. These participants can sign up new participant at <strong>substantial discounts</strong>.<br><br>The organisers see it as word of mouth advertising. So instead of paying for a few more ads, they pass the savings to these affiliates (usually past participants).<br><br>Many affiliates - especially those business-minded ones, earn some money by offering to share their discounts by giving a rebate to those who register for the seminar with them.<br><br>The more enterprising ones will add on to the offer by <strong>giving out extra bonus </strong>items. Sometimes the <strong>value added bonus provided by the affiliates can be worth more than the ticket itself</strong>.<br><br><strong>How is this possible</strong>.<br><br>Well, it happens that sometimes, the affiliate themselves who are business owners, adds products or services from their core business. The products may not cost as much to the business owner but the value to the user is quite substantial.<br><br>For example, if the affilate owns a spa. He can offer to add in a $150 spa session provided the customer buys the ticket from him at full price. The spa session is worth $150 in value to the customer. But for the business owner, there is very little additional cost for him to give away the $150 spa package as his staff, rental, equipment and overheads are already paid for. It only cost him some consumables. He <strong>gains a potential customer</strong>, and he profits from the ticket discounts.  If the ticket is price at $200 and his comission is $100, he in fact earns a profit and gains a potential customer.<br><br>If you sign up with these affiliates, they can sometimes offer up to $200 to $300 dollar savings, depending on the price of the tickets. It's a win - win -win situation for affiliate, registrants and organisers.<br><br><strong>The problem is how to find these affiliates</strong>.<br><strong>Here's how </strong>- do a search on google using the name of the event as keywords together with words like "tickets". Add "singapore" if its a local event.<br><br>You will find some of these affiliates listed usually on the right side of the google page. Click on their ads and see what they offer.<br><br><strong>A word of caution </strong>- Don't buy from any Tom, Dick and Harry. Check out their contact details. Its usually <strong>safer to buy it from a registered company </strong>than from an individual. How established is also very important.<br><br>If you reach this part of my post - thank you for your attention :-)<br></div>
