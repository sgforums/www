Simple monogram for Mens only Coach Signature Stripe Tote, its more like Unisex, size much smaller than this one with thin flimsy handle. Coach Mens Collection mostly plain be it nylon, suede, leather or canvas, most people will not know it is Coach if not for the Coach Tag that comes with the bag.<br><br>Very plain &amp; elegant ones you got to get Zegna, Bottega Venetta, Bally or Prada.<br><br>Monogram ones I still prefer LV or Gucci.<br><br>However for bag of such size as this one, its impossible to get either of my recommendation at this price unless you willing to pay at least double or more. </span></strong><br></div>
