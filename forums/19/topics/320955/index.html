              <p>KOHJINSHA SR SERIES -- World's <strong>SMALLEST and LIGHTEST</strong> 7" UMPC with integrated DVD Writeable Super Multi Drive</p>
              <p>(EDIT: PHOTOS CANNOT SHOW HERE. PLEASE GO TO http://www.flickr.com/photos/67295262@N00/2577628250/ where I had uploaded all the photos I painstakingly write code for. ;()</p>
              <p><img alt=""> Can balance on my HAND like that! 
                          <img alt=""></p>
              <p>SPECS: Please refer to http://www.kohjinsha.com.sg/products/sr.htm 
                          Please note, that however, <strong>my DDR2 memory has been upgraded to 2GB and if I'm not wrong, the hard disk is 100GB, not 60GB.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img alt=""> PRICE I'M SELLING: PC Show selling discount from $1599 to $1399, I am selling it for <span style="font-size: x-large;"> 200 bucks off</span> -- $400 off for what I bought that time, and some stuff are actually upgraded. (Bought for around $1599 that time) 
                          
                          Price is negotiable but please don't quote something like 500 bucks.:oh:
                          
                          CONDITION: Mint. 9.9/10 and the 0.1 is due to the fact one of the minute rubber 'cushion' is mysteriously not there:</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>(Top right hand corner, the shiny circular thing)
                          Anyway it's not like some aesthetic defect or a defect that will cause the machine to crash, don't worry.
                          Warranty is one year but 3 months has already passed, so remaining 9 months warranty. I will give you the receipt for it as well if you buy from me.</p>
              <p>USAGE: Very little. I only used the computer like around 5 times or something. Mainly cos I didn't need it. 
                          
                          WINNING PROPERTIES OF THIS COMPUTER: (Written by me)
                          <img alt=""></p>
              <p>-- DVD writer drive. This is v v convinient, especially like you're on the road, you wanna watch a movie, so you could just put in the DVD and watch la. Or you want to install some programs on this computer, and you need a CD drive. <strong>All the UMPCs don't have CD drives,</strong> except for this model. Very recently launched, the KJS sticker says</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>December 2007 but I got it when it was launched in Singapore, 3 months ago. 
                          
                          -- Hard drive storage very big, (100/60GB I can't remember, will update asap) so you can store music and photos.</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>-- You can use it like a tablet. The above image shows the screen turned to the opposite side and facing upwards.</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>There's also tablet software on this computer, for example  handwriting recognition (this is very cool one!), and Windows Journal, like a notebook except that it's electronic, and the 'pen' is erm, your stylus. These programs are part of a Tablet pack thing with Windows Vista. There are other quirky and useful programs to make use of this tablet capability of the SR series KJS. This is the best part I like about this computer.</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>Left side of the screen.</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>Right side. Note the plentiful buttons. 
                          You can FLIP the screen vertically and upside-down (as in the Start menu and desktop in Windows) like tablet also! The older Kjs series can't do all these tablet-technology stuff.</p>
              <p><img alt="" width="24" height="24"> <img alt=""> --</p>
              <p>Memory card slots for almost all the camera brands. Very convinient, say you wanna transfer photos into your computer while you're travelling. And your friends can offload their photos here too!</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>-- WEBCAM 1.3 MEGAPIXEL and Microphone (INBUILT) so you can Skype all day long! Also can take photos/videos of yourself fooling around in front of the computer haha. </p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>-- This computer packs seriously ALOT in such a small frame. (battery not in photo) My hand is already considered one of those small types. The black cloth at the bottom is not actually just a cloth, it's a casing for the very cute computer, comes with velcro strap at the widened top part to secure the computer in. Very ingenious.</p>
              <p><img alt=""></p>
              <p>Strap fastened on, you can hold it like it's a handbag. (Strap came with computer.)</p>
              <p>WHY I'M SELLING THIS: I like this computer actually, though I have no use for it. This computer was bought by my parents, they thought I would need it. But I already have a main computer that I'm using to post this. So I've decided to sell this computer instead of leaving it in the storage area. 
                          
                          Vista is a bit slow sometimes on this computer, because of the slow processor (800 mHz), but if you really strip down Vista, don't run so many programs in the background, or if you're not running some very big programs, this will not be a major problem. In fact I'd say that the features and benefits in this computer outweigh this slowness.</p>
              <p>I'M STILL IN DOUBT!: This is a very good deal, as I'm putting it at 200 bucks off the price that KJS is selling it for now. Plus it had already discounted 200 bucks so it's like I'm giving away 400 bucks. If you count the price I'm selling over the original price, it's a 25% DISCOUNT I'm giving.</p>
              <p>This computer is in mint condition (except for that small rubber thing) and I seriously used it like 5 times or something, mainly to check out the computer and install some programs, transfer some stuff in. I will factory restore this computer before giving it to you so <em>it's practically like from the Kohjinsha factory itself</em>. Just that it's like a model that's been shown to people. Actually, probably <span style="text-decoration: underline;">used less than the models they put on display</span> in their shop.</p>
              <p>The biggest draw is probably the DVD drive. You're going to be installing programs and stuff on this computer, and many of these programs (Antivirus, Microsoft Office, etc) are put on CD DRIVES. How are you going to install them without a CD drive??</p>
              <p>INTERESTED PEOPLE: Please CONTACT ME personally at jennyteen@gmail.com! I will not answer queries on this forum. 
                          
                          If you're doubting the authenticity of what I say and you are very serious about buying after asking me whatever questions you may have (that is prepared to pay personally through bank transfer or cash on the day we meet) we can meet and you may inspect the computer and the box etc. to be sure that it fulfills what you expected.</p>
