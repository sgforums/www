It is all designed to give you an easier mobile Web experience; just like surfing the Web on your computers. <br>“Sony Ericsson’s vision is to offer ‘Generation Web’ a mobile internet experience that’s rich, user-friendly and satisfying,” says Chris Lee, Vice President of Marketing, Asia Pacific at Sony Ericsson. “This Web-optimised phone is a clear step along that journey and will appeal to individuals who are managing their busy lives and social networks online, whether it’s arranging to meet up for a football match or booking movie tickets. Now with the K660i, they can surf the Web anywhere easily from their phone as if they were sitting in front of their computers.” <br>[B]Sony Ericsson K660i – for an easier web experience[/B] <br>[LIST]<br>[*]Web Short-cut Keys illuminate when Web mode is activated<br>[*]Landscape Browsing gives consumers a more natural orientation and larger screen space<br>[*]Magnetic Mouse Pointer is an accurate way to move around the screen similar to the mouse experience of computers<br>[*]Pan and Zoom allows you to zoom in on a section of the screen<br>[*]HSDPA for four times faster than 3G surfing, email and download[/LIST][B]The internet as you expect it to be![/B] <br> <br>The K660i makes browsing the mobile Web straightforward with its unique illuminated Web short-cut keys. It sports a Bookmark function, a single click button that takes you back to your Home Page and an ‘Enter Address’ shortcut; all intended to give you an easier mobile Web experience. Maximise your screen’s real estate using landscape browsing. Easily switch from portrait to landscape mode for a wider display, allowing you to easily scroll and view your Web pages. <br>The phone’s navigation key also serves as a “magnetic mouse pointer” when in Web mode, letting you find your way around the page just as you would on a PC. It indicates when a part of the page is clickable and where text input is possible. You can even zoom in for a closer look at text or images. <br>Pan-and-zoom is just one of the Web shortcut keys that sit under your thumb when viewing Web pages in landscape mode. It lets you choose a section on screen and zoom in to read or see more detail. <br>[B]The information you need – on your terms[/B] <br> <br>The K660i is engineered to ensure that you’re not kept waiting for the news or content that matters to you. Music, video or email – HSDPA technology lets you download it all at speeds that are up to four times faster than regular 3G. <br>[B]Get there with Google Maps for Mobile[/B] <br>Thanks to Google Maps for Mobile, the K660i keeps you grounded wherever you are, even in a strange city. Find your way instantly with interactive maps that let you zoom in or out, or pan in any direction to orient yourself, like a comprehensive street directory – just without the weight. Enter your current location and destination and receive point-to-point directions. No fuss, no diversions. <br>[B]Shoot and share…instantly[/B] <br>The K660i squeezes a 2.0 megapixel camera into its compact frame, making it easy to capture the moment. And since the Web is at your fingertips, it’s just a few clicks to upload your picture to your blogsite and share it instantly with friends and family. <br>Although packing a whole host of Web applications, this phone is not just for suits. Available in two stand-out colours, a funky ‘lime-on-white’ and a stylish ‘wine-on-black’ colour, the K660i will earn you admiring glances no matter where you are. <br> <br>SB: 360<br>BNP: 400<br> <br>price negotiable.
