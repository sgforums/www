              eliminates real world noise better than any other headset because it is
              the only headset that can accurately separate speech from ambient noise.<br><br>The
              mobile phone is the prevailing communication tool for business and
              personal productivity, and people expect to be able to use their phones
              in all environments without sacrificing audio quality. Jawbone's
              patented NoiseAssassinâ„¢ technology is unique in its ability to separate
              speech from ambient noise with remarkable precision. Jawbone's
              NoiseAssassin is able to achieve this while other headsets cannot.<br>Advanced DSP Algorithms<br><br>The NoiseAssassin algorithms were developed over a number of years for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).<br><br>These required powerful noise suppression algorithms for use in the<br><br>most
              extreme acoustic noise environments including battlefields and
              helicopters. The algorithms use Jawbone's two microphones and the VAS
              to accurately model the noise environment.<br><br>Jawbone detects when and how a person is speaking, models the noise, and aggressively eliminates it.<br><br>Conventional
              "noise eliminating" headsets do not have the VAS and can only estimate
              when speech is occurring with software-based Voice Activation Detection
              (VAD) systems. For these systems to work, the speech must be
              significantly louder or spectrally different from the noise. These
              systems fail in loud environments or in the presence of other people's
              speech. Furthermore, because they can't accurately identify the speech
              signals, they distort the speech in the process of attempting to
              eliminate the noise. The result of this distortion is a significant
              degradation in intelligibility and quality in order to achieve a
              perceptual reduction in noise.<br><br>The design<br><br>The New Jawbone
              is the next step in the integration of best in class noise elimination
              technology with personal design that is both humanistic and minimal.<br><br>"The
              Jawbone strategy we set-out to follow three years ago has proven that
              products that live on our face need to be designed differently than
              typical technology wares; we regard them as personal accessories or
              even jewelry, and, as such, believe they need to be a complete
              departure from the gadgetry of the mobile and headset industry."<br>Yves Behar<br><br>Chief Designer and CCO of Aliph<br><br>In
              the tradition of bringing together beauty and science, the new Jawbone
              is a miracle of miniaturization and 50% smaller than the original
              award-winning Jawbone. Every effort has been made to contain best in
              class noise elimination technology in the most unassuming, yet richly
              detailed product.<br>No Visible Buttons<br><br>The "invisible button"
              policy at Jawbone accomplishes a clutter-free look. Touch-surface
              technology allows the user to operate switches by lightly pressing the
              outside shield.<br>Premium Materials<br><br>Constructed with ultra-smooth medical-grade plastic, the new Jawbone also comes with optional fine leather earloops.<br>The Experience<br><br>Comprised
              of an outer shield and inner surface, the new Jawbone experience is
              two-fold. The outer shield, curved and rectilinear to follow the face,
              is lightly textured in a sound-reflective progressive relief, a
              three-dimensional texture visually representative of noise abatement
              surfaces. This unique surface becomes animated as light creates
              highlights and shadows when worn. The inner surface, the one touching
              the face and creating contact with the Voice Activity Sensor, is gently
              curved to be ergonomic and comfortable on the skin.<br><br></p>
