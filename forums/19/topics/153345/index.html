            <div class='col-md body'>I would like to tell you the full story of my facial being done at Modern Beauty Salon at OUB Centre, level 4 on 4th November 2005<br><br>Day1(4th november 2005):<br>Geok, the beautician used DNA Remover Machine to remove the dirts on my face. The machine requires a stick with electricity to put it under my shoulder, then she used a piece of metal-like material to scrub the so called dead cell from my skin. The feeling is a bit uneasy.<br><br>When it comes to squeeze and press all the black and white heads out. It is really hurtful because my tears keeps coming out. And it is really painful, but I never ask her to stop because I think she wants to help me fully clean the dirt. She is an expert I thought, so I should trust her. And she helped me to trim my eyebrows by cutting and plugging.<br><br>When it was done, 3 persons including Geok used hard sell technique and kept persuading me to buy the package. It took me an hour and I am frustrated by it since it took so long and it delayed my plan to go to airport.<br><br>By looking at their friendliness, so I took up a package in order to get rid of their continuance persuasion.<br><br>Day 2:<br>I felt a bit tight on my face where I only used my normal daily skin care products which has never cause me any problem before. But the only thing I add on is the impoulses that was given by modern beauty.<br><br>Day 3:<br>I felt itchiness on my right face especially from the cheeks towards my jaw.<br><br>Day 4-6 (7th november to 9th november):<br>My face became worse with lots of redshalls especially around my cheekbone and also on my forehead. And the itchiness on my face became worse. On top of that, there was lots of white head pop out on my whole face especially on my cheek. My colleagues noticed my face became very sensitive and my eyebrow was badly shaped.<br><br>I went to Modern Beauty and talked to Yen, the one kept persuading me to sign. When she first saw me, her comment was "Oh, Your face is just like that?" (Sounded not serious enough for her) I found that they were so irresponsible of what they had done to my face.<br><br>I got angry and I request for refund of my money. She kept saying cannot but I insisted. She has no choice but to call her shop manager, Angie. She tried to explain what has happened to my face and asked me to do another treatment to kill all the so called bacteria and germs on my face and luckily I refused to do so (later on I seek for doctor advice and doctor stops me from going to any further treatment). Since she can't do anything and she called Fennie out (In charge for Modern Beauty in Singapore).<br><br>They wanted me to change my course to other type treatment. But I insisted I want my money back and I emphasized to them that I have totally lost trust in their company.<br><br>Day 7(10th November 2005):<br>I called Fennie and asked her about the status of my case. She told me according to their company policy, they needed doctor's prove and will compensate for the medical fee if it is proven.<br><br>For my own good, I went to see doctor and was told that I got allergic and sensitive skin and was at the initial stage of acne. Doctor wrote me a letter to stop me from going any further facial treatment. Thus I went down again to Modern Beauty and told them about the doctor's advice. Their attitude towards me were not good and I felt that I was an unwelcomed person.<br><br>Angie asked me to write a letter for requesting full refund. I did as per her request. I asked her how long needed for this whole procedure and the answer I got was " Unsure"!<br><br>Day 8 (11th November 2005):<br>I called Fennie at about 2pm but her colleague said she was busy and I left a message and asked her to call me back. But I waited till about 8pm and she had not get back to me. I called her again and the answer she got me was Â“Sorry, I was so busy today"!<br><br>Day 11 (14th November 2005):<br>William Tan, Hong Kong customer service officer called me and said that my request was being turned down and asked me if I can compromise to either bring a friend and do a membership change or change the course to other type of course. I told him I still want my money back. He said he will try to talk to the decision maker again.<br><br>Day 13 (16th November 2005) :<br>After 2 calls to Fennie in Singapore, I finally get a call from William Tan again and what he told me was" Sorry, your case has been rejected again."<br><br>Please visit this link for lots of other bad comments about Modern Beauty.<br><br>http://www.singaporebrides.com/forumboard/messages/1151/989.html?1132204791</div>
