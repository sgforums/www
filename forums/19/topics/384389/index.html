              <p>This is sometimes the most dangerous. You never know if the solution is the most efficient. Or if the solution is done wrongly but the correct answer was coincidentally achieved. I have seen such cases.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, many of the H2 maths and physics exam materials could be downloaded for free at the moment if you look at the right place and know how to use google properly. What for buy? I have already downloaded nearly 1GB worth of materials for use.</p>
              <p>But I won't share online unless I know that they are students.... because I have seen certain immoral people trying to get the free stuff from me, yet attempting to sell the free notes at marketplace for a fee.</p>

              <p>Maybe top JCs expects their students to be more independent and
              thus do not need very comprehensive notes while the weaker JCs tend
              to provide more informative stuff so as to help their students do
              well.</p>

              <p>I have to agree that the supposedly 'weaker' JCs have much much better notes... Their notes are more well organised and comprehensive.</p>
              <p>RJ notes are actually not as comprehensive. Perhaps it's because of your reason. Not sure about HCI notes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have TPJC, RJC, ACJC, AJC, JJC, SAJC notes and materials in softcopy format. I have also seen VJC, MJC and IJC notes as well. So I can compare.</p>

              <p>Fake emails will not help if the law is involved and the police wants to track you down.
