              <p>More than just a sentence. Nothing to do rite? Then do this kind of stupid thing by "giving feedback to HCI". I can't think of any other reason why anyone would want to tell the school about this WITHOUT ANY AGENDA. Well it is obvious your very intention, is to bring this up to the school, and initiate a school investigation into this, having read the newspapers about copyrights and such.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, to a person who has nothing better to do, and raise it to HCI for fun, don't bother hiding behind a veil pretending your vigilante act was just to raise awareness to the school. I bet others are not so stupid to fall for your trick either.</p>

              <p>Wow, you are indeed to quick to judge. How confident are you that I have indeed raised feedback and sent it to the school? Just because I said I did it, you are so quick to take it as the ultimate truth?</p>

              <p>The article merely gave the usual thought-invoking questions  that have no answers , such as "but is it an infringement of copyright laws, given that the notes are the efforts of the school teachers?" as well as giving the penalities possible for copyright infringement.</p>

              <p>It's just a simple concept of getting rid of notes you no longer need (or in a rather unrealistically optimistic way, helping others); the commotion is unnecessary.</p>

              <p>Yeah so if the schools decide to persue such a matter, they could consider it as against their copyright since the notes are prepared by the school etc. Just like unis can sue students who upload their notes online.</p>

              <p>we didnt have to sell our notes to the juniors hahaha, those in yr 4 will alr be doing the yr 5 topics (as compared to a non-ip jc)...BUT those who are lucky will have teachers asking if they could take over their notes (and they usually pay exceedingly good money for it despite knowing the true value haha, *hint: pls take down all the notes the lecturers say in a neat nice multicolour-coded fashion and file them* haha)</p>
