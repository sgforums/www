              breakfast. S-Factor Plus is an excellent meal-replacement for busy
              individuals like you as it provides all the daily nutrition you need!
              <br> <br>S-Factor Plus is designed to supplement you with all your
              nutritional needs without having to take any additional synthetic
              vitamin pills. It is the perfect solution for those who lead a hectic

              easy and convenient way.
              <br><br>This advanced phytonutrient rich super food contains 90
              uniquely combined nutraceutical ingredients. It is a 100% organic super
              food which does not contain any dairy, wheat, corn, artificial colour

              <td><span class="body"><strong>Why Do I Need S-Factor Plus? <br> </strong>The
              body is slightly alkaline in its natural state. It has to maintain this
              slightly alkaline state to function properly and complex mechanisms
              within our bodies ensure that this balance is maintained.
              <br><br>Most of us are natural alkaline producers in our early years.
              This is why many children can get away with an imbalanced diet and
              still stay healthy and slender right up till they are in their
              twenties.
              <br><br>But as we reach our thirties and forties, majority of us will
              become overly acidic. That's because nearly everything we are exposed
              to - food, environmental toxins and even stress - lead to a build-up of
              acid in our bodies. On top of that, our natural buffer systems become
              less efficient at neutralizing acidity over time. Our bodies' normal
              alkaline level starts to develop chronic acidosis or chronic excess
              acidity.
              <br> <br>A balanced PH is very important to our health. S-Factor Plus can
              help to alkalize your body by providing broccoli powder along with
              other powerful green super foods. Living in a toxic and stressful
              environment means that it becomes more important for us to supplement
              our diets with antioxidants, phytonutrients, super foods, vitamins,
              minerals, herbs and so on. However, if we were to purchase all these
              supplements individually, it will be confusing, cumbersome and very
              costly.
              <br><br>In fact, if you purchase all the ingredients found in S-Factor
              Plus (super foods, antioxidants, herbal extracts, vitamins, minerals
              etc.) individually, it would cost over S$300 a month or an average of
              S$10 per day.
              <br><br>S-Factor Plus costs $100 for a month's supply, which means
              just $3.30 per day. Most people spend more than that amount for a cup
              of coffee and a sandwich. This amount is much more worth its value for
              keeping yourself in good health. </span></td>

              ingredients in S-Factor Plus includes powerful antioxidants, digestive
              enzymes, plant fibers, probiotics, FOS, essential amino acids,
              standardized herbal extracts, plant sterols, nucleic acids, nutrient
              co-factors, cell pigments, essential fatty acids (Omega-3 and 6),
              naturally occurring whole food source vitamins and macro-trace
              minerals. These ingredients are derived from enzymatically active and
              alive foods and they work in synergy to provide you with an optimally
              balanced nutritional support so you don't have to rely on synthetic
              vitamin pills.
              <br> <br>S-Factor Plus provides powerful bioactive phytonutrients such as
              lycopene, zeaxanthin, cryptoxanphin, lutein, sulforaphane, ellagic
              acid, carotenoids, isothiocyanates, and indole 3 carbinols for those
              who are looking for a complete nutritional supplement that promotes
              health, energizes vitality, cleanses the body system, enhances immunity
              and promotes alkalinity.
              <br><br>In addition, S-Factor Plus also contains oat bran concentrate.
              According to the new FDA Heart Health Claim, "3 grams of oat bran
              soluble fiber daily, in a diet that is low in saturated fat and
              cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease."</span></p>
