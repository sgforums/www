              FAQs:
              
              1. What is Cell Activa SP800 made of?
              Cell Activa SP800 is a product from U.S.A and is formulated using only the purest and freshest ovine (sheep) placenta extract combined with other imported anti-aging ingredients such as avocado oil, shark liver oil, olive oil, collagen and aloe vera powder.
              
              
              2. Is there any controversy with regards to the use of sheep placenta? 
              There is no controversy regarding the use of sheep placenta because they are derived from post-birth discarded placenta of healthy sheep raised at medicinal farms. After these medicinal sheep have given birth safely, their ovine placenta will be harvested ethically and freshly frozen.
              
              
              3. Are sheep placenta cells compatible with the human body?
              Yes! Sheep placenta cells are compatible with the human body. In fact, sheep are ideal cell donors for two main reasons. Firstly, there are no essential differences on a cellular level between the enzymatic and functional capabilities of human and animal cells, which mean the tissue functions are essentially the same. Sheep placenta pluripotent stem cells are identical to human placenta stem cells in their ability to produce any type of mammalian cell. 
              
              Secondly, the sheep live in a healthy environment where they are certified free of all diseases, and their health history is verified by over 150 years of documented breeding. As it becomes increasingly more difficult to find fit, disease-free human donors, these sheep provide a healthier and more vital source of biological material. Moreover, all our freeze dried placenta are all certified to be BSE-free (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) by the USDA before the encapsulation process. 
              
              
              4. How does Cell Activa SP800 work?
              Cell Activa SP800 works under the same fundamental theory of cell therapy, a process of introducing new cells into a tissue in order to rebuild and revitalize ailing or aging tissue. Cell Activa SP800 aims to stimulate the body's own therapeutic and revitalizing powers to regenerate aging cells to become new healthy ones. In this way, the new healthy cells are able to quickly and effectively build up the defense mechanisms of the body and thus significantly slow down the aging process allowing one to regain physical health and vitality.

              Elusyf Biochemistry is a company that embraces social responsibility and we strongly adhere to the use of animal cruelty products. The source of our sheep placenta comes from sheep that are raised on special medicinal farms in countries synonymous with sheep farming and also well known for its strong focus on animal welfare such as New Zealand and Australia. The extensive pastoral farming systems employed by their farmers allow their sheep to live a more natural life with rarely restricted freedom of movement as compared to livestock in other countries. These medicinal sheep are chosen due to their almost identical match to human placenta stem cells. After these medicinal sheep have given birth safely, their ovine placenta will be harvested ethically and freshly frozen. There is no controversy regarding their use because they are derived from post-birth discarded placenta of healthy sheep raised at medicinal farms.
              
              
              Every batch of our sheep placenta extract will be held temporarily by the US custom and released upon tested BSE-free (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) by the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) before they are sent to our manufacturing plant for processing.
              
              
              According to recent scientific research, sheep placenta has been found to be effective in the reversal of the aging process due to its rich growth factors, hormones and antibodies as well as other concentrated nutrients that can rejuvenate the organic tissue. Sheep placenta contains rich amino acid, adhesive polysaccharide, gonadotropin, Vitamin E and B series, ferment (malic acid and hydracid), yolk vitelline, lecithinum, and various minerals like calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, copper, etc.
              Sheep placenta has been known to be used by the British Royal Family as medicine or promoting general health for the past 1400 years. In recent years, the rich and famous have been known to seek out sheep placenta treatments in Switzerland to preserve their youthful appearance and prolong their vitality.
