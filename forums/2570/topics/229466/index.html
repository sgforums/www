The Quran is only the Quran when it is recited in the <strong>original</strong> arabic language. there are many english translations of the Quran, but there's only ONE arabic version. and that's the one we should learn how to recite. because the Prophet saw. said that if u recite the Quran, for each letter, the reward is multiplied by 10 (i don;t have the hadith with me right now, i can present it if u want.)<br><br><strong>In the event that we come into contact with anything 'najis' like pig's skin or dog's saliva, is there one standard way of washing up? </strong><br><br>there's a hadith regarding this that ppl called hadith `sertu'. that when a dog licks or drinks from your food container, the Prophet told us to throw away the food or drink, and then wash the container 7 times where one of those times tha water is mixed with earth (or mud).<br><br>but with the case of touching pigs or pig skin, i don;t know. but i do know that scholars tend to `kias' these two elements (dogs and pigs) together.<br><br>but if anyone has a better or more acurate answer than mine please present it so that we can all learn on how to go about these issues.

Will the mandi not count altogether as a result?<br><br></div></blockquote>got this from islamqna website :<br><br>Question:<br>This is a simply question. I just to know, what is the best way to perform Ghusal. All the fards and sunnahs. Please describe..<br><br>Answer:<br><br>All Praises are Due to Allah<br><br>A brief summary of the requirements for the Ghusl follow. First, the Muslim should make their intentions for purification, then wash the private parts. Then make wudu like the wudu done for prayer, then pour water on his right side, then the left side. Then water should be poured on his head, covering the entire body with water. It is also reported in the sunnah that the washing the feet should be delayed until the end of the ghusl. As is reported on the authority of A'ishah (May Allah be pleased with her) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) when performing ghusl from janaba used to wash his hands, then wash his private parts with his left hand. After that he performed wudu like that for prayer. Next he took some water and ran his fingers in the roots of his hair until he used three handfuls of water on his head. He would then go on pouring water on the rest of his body and wash his legs. (It was reported by Muslim #479.) In the narration of Al-Bukhari it states that he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then turned aside and washed his legs.<br><br>Allah knows best.<br><br>from what i have learnt if u were to perform ghusl in this manner (following the sunnah) then u wouldn't need to make another ablution to perform the solat, because u would already be in a state of wudhu. but to omit the wudhu part during ghusl, i can't say or rather i don't know if the ghusl was accepted.<br><br>i hope someone with more knowledge can help u.<br><br></div>
