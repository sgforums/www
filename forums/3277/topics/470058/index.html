              <p>I'm still studying and I find that sg is really a stressful place to live in.</p>
              <p>for students, we have to wake up at 5-6am almost everyday and r only allowed to leave school ard 5- 6:30pm because of cca, rememdials, duties and stuff. which means, we will only reach home around 6-7pm at night almost everyday and by the time we students have finish eating dinner, homework and stuff, it would be already 9-10pm and it's already time to us to sleep. which = we don't have the time to hang out, to rest or have any nap at all. which is really stressful. i don't understand, how does having dyed hair, long nails, ankle socks will affect our studies? we can't even express our ownself with style.</p>
              <p>a lot of singapore say that singapore does not have a good fashion sense. a lot of foreigners i know says that for singaporean girls have only black hair, shorts+top , slippers or high heels only .  and almost all the guys hairstyle in singapore look almost the same.. all because of the school rules.</p>
              <p>i just feel that, school is controlling us, taking away our freedom. do u agree?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Living in a concrete jungle in Singapore and going thorugh it's education system it is indeed pressure cooking the individual. Thats why having a getaway to another country is good once in awhile, take for example Australia, it's a place whereby you do not need to raise you head too high just to look at the sky because there are not many high rise buidling at all, its also a place whereby teenagers on vacations willingly work as shopping mall cleaners and supermarket cashiers because the culture there is so different. There are people there whom does not have an education and their lives is simple, tend to their sheeps, sell milk and cattle for a living. Natural resources are abundant there, unfortunately here in singapore we only have people as resource, thus we all feel stressful and pressured. Most importantly is to know how to balance work and play and thorugh this balance lead a less stressful life. </p></div>
