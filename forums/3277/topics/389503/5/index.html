              <p>Ok folks, back to Milo &amp; Cougar show after a long rest......</p>
              <p>Milo leaned hard into his armchair, clearly exhausted from working on a bug on the target acquisition and lock on software....all that it takes now is to upload the patch...</p>
              <p>He hit upload and the process went automatic....and that was when he realised he had forgotten MiMi's toy....(&gt;&lt;)</p>
              <p>Panicked, he got off his chair and went off in a hurry....</p>
              <p>After he left his office, a slender figure appeared at the window....it was MiMi</p>
              <p>She had chosen to take the easy way out....let Milo go free</p>
              <p>Neverthless, she stepped into the office through the open window and looked at the screen on his laptop...as always, he does not bother to instruct the computer to auto shut down after usage....always relying on his memory to do so</p>
              <p>She took out a mobile hard drive and attached it to the laptop....apparently, she had to allow the computer to finish its task...that will be 1 minute.....</p>
              <p>Deciding to wait, she sat on the floor and saw a post it note that read: Buy MiMi's toy!</p>
              <p>Sighing, she took it and kept it inside her pocket</p>
              <p>She checked back and found the computer's task was done</p>
              <p>Quickly, she started uploading all information from Milo's laptop to the mobile hard drive....if there is not enough memory, the remaining data will be sent wirelessly to a remote location and from there to her laptop</p>
              <p>The whole operation took 10 minutes and no one came in....</p>
              <p>Eager to get away quickly, she unplugged the hard drive and exited his office through the window</p>

              <p>At the shopping mall, Milo saw what MiMi wanted: Doreamon Charms from Macdonald's (Full Set)</p>
              <p>He immediately grabbed it, went to the counter and paid with his MasterCard</p>
              <p>Just then, his N97 rang and he immediatley answered, "Yes, Mimi?"</p>
              <p>Sharie: It's me!....Sharie!</p>
              <p>A few moments of silence from Milo.....</p>
              <p>Sharie: What is the meaning of this....the minute i called you, you think it's MiMi! Do i mean nothing to you after all?</p>
              <p>Milo: I......</p>
              <p>Sharie shut off the phone without waiting for Milo's reply and cried </p>

              <p>his patch is capable of filling in the gaps of many nations that deploy and use cruise missile and laser targetting technology</p>
              <p>what is more important, he managed to derive an application from it-- smaller lasers that can be deployed on the field with uncanny accuracy and destructive power although not as powerful as the russian's huge laser system</p>
              <p>the manufacture and deployment will take only 6 months at a cost $2 million...easy...</p>

              <p><br>Aiyo, u keep asking, i keep replying, leak the plot out liao....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
              <p>Ok, anyway, this part of the plot i already intended to post liao....<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>To do so, Razor will need to kidnap Milo and "make" him "talk"....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>In fact, even if Milo does not have the exact coordinates, he will still be able to work out a rough idea of where each CVBG is.....</p>
              <p>Razor: MiMi, invite Milo to my residence for a chat</p>
              <p>MiMi: ?....Boss, why? (She sounded a little fearful)</p>
              <p>Razor: Dun worry, i will not hurt your lover....</p>
              <p>MiMi: He is not my lover.....=.=!......he is more like a brother to me</p>
              <p>Razor: I see.....i almost forgot, you are an orphan like Milo....so, please bring him over to my residence for a chat with me</p>
              <p>MiMi: .......ok....</p>
              <p>Inwardly, she felt a tiny pinge of fear.....for one thing to be sure, Razor does not bring people over for a chat....it always ended with the other party dead, or become his puppet</p>
              <p>She had personally seen examples of how those puppets were treated...it was worse than being a dog....(&gt;&lt;)</p>
