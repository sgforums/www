            <div class='col-md body'>airgrinder,<br>I think league's great! It allows me to meet friends whom I don't get to otherwise (different schools; different jobs in the future) and makes bowling interesting.<br><br>Consider this: it's way worse squeezing in just a couple of practice sessions per week. That's even worse because you're only playing for the sake of playing. In a league, at least there's some form of competitiveness and adrenaline rush. And for those of us who are not good enough to enter national tournaments, that means the only outlet for competitive play. And the fact that it's a league makes every shot count. That's something leisure bowling can never duplicate. It's like the football league we all watch on telly.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with both airgrinder and harmz.<br>League games might give you the competitive edge that hone your bowling technique but maybe we should not neglect the fun side of bowling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Although, i've not played in any league games, I believe you have to keep on your toes n concentrate during the league games.<br>The training sessions might just provide the chance to fool around n crack jokes without really getting stressed out by a competitive game. And that might be how you really enjoy the fun side of the sport just like how we enjoy those times we trained at safra resort and grassroots.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>and of course to improve your skills.<br>At least I find them most enjoyable and hope we can still do that even after we graduate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>woh! chuan, wat happen to ur right? there was this interesting history of a female american bowler who could use both hands. Seems she is originally a righty, but a car accident hurt her right hand so bad that the doc says she can't bowl on that hand anymore. So, she trains her left. A few years down the road, her right recovered. I'm sure u'll can guess the next part: she now can bowl with both her paws. Seems to me she reserved her right for strikes and left for spares, but both hands can strike or spare. Heard she retired a few years ago from a friend, cause of back injury.<br><br>------------------<br>Â“Losers quit when they're tired.
