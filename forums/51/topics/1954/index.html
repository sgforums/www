            <div class='col-md body'>Hi fellas,<br><br>Thought it might be fun to report on what your balls have been doing on the lanes. Be it new ones, old ones, whatever. I'm sure all us fellow bowlers are interested to know. I know I am. Alright. All that said and done, I'll start by introducing my personal "specs".<br><br>Style: Hook bowler, the more the merrier<br>Ball speed: Medium fast-ish (medium being Chuan and fast being Jae, Dinghua being rocket)<br>Axis rotation: Close to maximum<br>Revs: medium<br>Master eye: Left, gotta aim 3.5 boards to the right of the board I wish to hit<br><br>-------------------------------------------<br>Went out to Changi last night. Friend was kind enough to lend me his last frame for a warm up shot.<br><br>Whipped out my Adrenaline (15 lb 3 oz, label leverage with small axis hole for earlier roll, smacked with Ebonite Particle Polish) and on the lanes I went!<br><br>I started by standing on about 22 and throwing to 14 at the arrows. Within 4 shots I realised the Adrenaline was too much for the lane I was playing. It had good head oil, but the lanes were dryer in the middle and carrydown was mild. The ball would and begin it's left charge too early.The edges were dry, so we had an "immunity to right gutter". Unless I threw a real deep inside line I knew I had to put some oomph on it to REACH the breakpoint to ensure at least a pocket hit. But hey, I want the ball to HOOK. I'm in it for the ego-boost. Stubbornness did not pay off. A few brooklyns and greek churches later, I looked up. 135. Save it for soupier midlanes, I felt.<br><br>Time to bring out the Dynasty (Label leverage &lt;-- surprise!! I drill that on practically every piece of mine). One fling of it, I knew it. It was almost the original Trimax in different colours! Only better! WIth head oil this baby could sail through LONG before making the hard left when the drys came into the view. However, this ball refused to read the dry in the midlane (unlike the black Matrix) but instead managed to hold till the backend. Had a bit of over/under tendencies with this one, though. Tried 2 frames playing a deep line, it would hold well and make the turn, but the hook's not continous and deflects. Found the line early, stood on 21 and aimed at 8 (ball crosses about 11-12) all the way out to about the 7 board, makes the turn and just smoothly eliminates the pins. Got in the groove and finished with 216.<br><br>Ego took over. Out came the Adrenaline again. Now confident that I'd warmed up and game 1 was a fluke, I stood way out on 31 and aimed the ball to go over 17 at the arrows to break at 4-5. Boy it was beautiful. Tends to leave weird spares if hit light, but the half pocket hits that normally leave a 10 wasn't there.<br><br>Finished the night with 135, 216, 182, 194.<br><br>--------------------------------------------<br><br>Dynasty: Carries excellent on high hits, deflects too much on light hits. Half-pocket hits leaves many pin 10s. Has a skid-hook-set motion. I believe this ball will NOT handle carrydown, but will negotiate through anything from light to light-medium in the heads to the midlanes. More forgiving than the original, but still overreacts a little in the dry.<br><br>Adrenaline: Needs a small helping of head oil and at least med midlanes, but skids well for a low load particle/aggressive reactive combo. Powers up and arc-snaps impressively. This baby will handle anything between light medium to med heavy oils, with up to med carrydown. Best to hit light and half-pocket with this. Hitting slightly too high normally leaves you splits or a stone 9.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo! Glad to see another lefty-eyed person.<br><br>It's not a problem, just have to aim a bit "righter" than normal.

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking abt master eye, my left eye is my master eye too. I guess that's why my shots tend to be diagonal and i try to "corect" it by thowing out, hoping that the ball will snap back in.<br><br>Speaking abt ball, Currently i only have columbia power surge and columbia game. the power surge is drilled for early snap and is good for patchy lanes or lanes that allow me to hook early. thus i usually use that ball as my benchmark ball to see if i need to change ball or change line.<br><br>second ball is columbia game(black). Drilled for normal hook but with a lot oil at the heads. SInce its a particle ball, i noramlly use it when the front is oily or when the lane sare freshly oiled. learn this thru the hard way. throw my game ball on medium lanes and got 4x8-pin splits in a row.<br><br>I dun have that many balls, so i have been using this 2 ball for the past 1 year and it has been successful for me. But does anyone here know of a more forgiving ball? My current 2 balls isn't very forgiving though...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deamon   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><blockquote>lanes that allow me to hook early</blockquote>when you say that, you mean lanes with less than heavy oiling, right? (i.e., lanes which hook - medium oil) I initially thought that you meant dry lanes, but then the ball with the early roll drilling will roll out too early. Please clarify.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You need a more forgiving ball? you seem good enough to deal with a small target area with consistency. Lots of people will vouch for that!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Seriously, the power surge is the decendent of the origianl blue surge, which was itself a hook monster. Although both surges were reactive, the MICA loading in the coverstock made their reaction (and bite) closer to those of particles. In fact, the power surge was the ball before the black Chaos (essentially the Game + a Ti core). So, what you have is essentially two balls that are very similar in reaction to each other, in spite of the fact of the cover difference. Because of these cover differences, they will react differently on some surfaces, but for the most, they should be the same - differences will probably be due to drilling than ball.<br>Sorry about the loooong post  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> But i get carried away.<br>Ok, i think you need a non-hook monster ball. Pearlised would be a good start for expanding your arsenal. Get a mid RG pearlised ball, and i'd recommend a length drilling. Label laverage if you need flare. I don't think you need it though - your track is already quite high. That should allow you to open the lanes up when it gets favourable or drier. Hope this helps.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oops think i got u misunderstood. Well i jus mean that the power surge break early so it give me an earlier snap action. I drill it to tackle carry-down condition and for lanes that are somewhat middle to a little heavier oiling. What u see me on classic the other day is that i reduce my speed so that it won't snap so much.<br><br>Last sun afternoon i was at silver-bowl for an alunmi tourny. There was a tourny in the morning, so naturally the lanes are that of little oil and some carry down. I deploy a faster speed and throwing at the 11th board to get a hockey stick kind of snap action.So if u were there last sun, u would have seen a different me. sadly i was unplaced in that tourny cos there were many good bowlers there.<br><br>As for the game, it was drilled to tackle heavy oil. So whenever the front heads has lots of oil, i'll use that ball. It works better than my original chaos cos it "bite" into the heavy oil better. Perhaps this is due to increased loading of the particles in the game ball.<br><br>I was mentioning abt forgiving ball. Well 1 such ball i suppose will be the messenger titantium pearl(gold colour). I withness a bowler throwing 3boards right of his target and 2 boards left of his target and it still goes into the pocket. perhaps oiling play a part, but that ball really allow u to have more "hold" area.<br>Other ball i can think of will be storm el nino warth and maybe super power pearl? Is hammer ball generally forgiving? I think some ebonite balls are rather forgiving too. what do u think, Prataman?<br><br>[This message has been edited by Deamon (edited 27 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The messenger Ti is supposed to be a very good ball. But as usual, the usual answers surface: on any given lane condition/bowler style combination, <strong>anyone</strong> can have hold area. Conversely, the same ball in the hands of another or on a different lane might force a tight line.<br>All being said and done, there are some balls out there that retain a large proportion of their 'advertised' capabilities over a wider range of conditions. Messenger Ti (solid/pearl); Super power (solid/pearl); Eraser, etcetera...<br>Of course, this is only a guide. Bowler style plays a more than big part in keeping all those predictions accurate. Coverstock preparation factors too.<br>And the Game is exactly the same as the black Chaos. The only difference is the name, price and the Ti core. The game was designed as a budget particle ball in the US. But as usual, by the time it gets here, the prices are the same... So the difference you feel must come from a different drill layout, or cover surface, or lane condition, or possibly a slight more control from the Game (because the Ti nugget slightly lowers the dynamic RG of the ball?) IMO.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by harmzuay (edited 27 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>talking about cleaners..well i do clean my ball after use. Theonly time i will not clean is after a play i bring the ball to the pro-shop, so that the driller can see my track and give some insight onto my bowling..<br><br>As for the cleaners, after certain trial and error... i find that track dull and clean work best for columbia balls. If u use that on a brunswick ball, chnaces that it will just "glide" round the ball w/o much cleaning.<br><br>In the past i use neo tac renew it. That lotion is one of the better cleaners, It clean the brunwick, columbia and amf balls i have.<br><br>Right now i still have neo tac liquid sandpaper. I use that to clean pro-active balls. somehow track proactive cleaner didn't clean particle balls;it try to polish them.<br><br>In the past, there was this Master reactive ball cleaner. Its still available now. it a pretty good cleaner, if u wanna clean a ball w/o paying alot. On the other hand, master liquid abrasive cleaner sucks cos it didn't "polish" the ball and it smell like turpentine.<br><br>squaeky clean, dunno why, oso dun work for me too...<br><br>Jus something to share abt all the cleaners i use b4   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Deamon (edited 09 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa... I am awed by Mr Daemon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> You have used more polishes than I've used balls man. That's very informative! Thanks.<br><br>Regrettably, I don't clean my gear often. Perhaps every 20 - 30 games. And it depends on what conditions i expect to face when i'm next due to use them. I usually don't clean them the day before a tournament that's played on synthetics because i found that going there with 'used' balls reduces the over-under i tend to get after a few shots, when the coverstock has adjusted. Also, i train only with one ball (DZ2), so my tournament balls are usually not worn.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cleaner wise, I use Track's Clean N' Polish. I used to use Sqeaky Clean until I ORD-ed and they told me it's no longer in production. I wa shattered - that polish was multi-use; now, there are polishes for every damn surface. I get the feeling we're being miilked here...<br>Anyway, Track polishes cost the same for 22oz, while the Columbia ones hold 16oz. But Track polishes have a bubble-gummy smell  :p that i like.<br>And i use the Clean N Polish on my Heat2 Pearl, which i believe is particle? It works for me. I'm planning on getting a Dulling polish soon.<br>Any recommendations?<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, wat's the grit of yr dull ball? 400grit sanded, 600 or 800? My powersurge is 800 grit sanded so i use track's clean and dull. but it didn't clean as well for my columbia game which is 360 grit sanded.In the past for that dull ball i would use neo tac renew it, but now i tend to use neo tac liquid sandpaper cos renew it is no longer available.<br><br>Thus as i dun really have 400grit sanded ball(except for 1),so i dun really know which cleaner is suitable .Perhaps Master liquid cleaner helps, as i use it for a dull rhino pro-teal before...but then that ball is 600 grit sanded.....</div>
