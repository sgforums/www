            <div class='col-md body'>Harmzuay...walter is a good driller, guess u hve to trust him cos he knows more in this field then we do.<br><br>Nowadays, its not how much side, top nor thumb weight that matters a lot;rather its the dynamics of the balls that determines the play. U need to let the driller know the ball u using is for what conditions, and he'll adjust to it accordingly.Thus the challenge is to know how comfortable u are with yr shot and how the ball react.<br><br>Personally, i like neo tac renew it, but then ever since bowlingasia close down, they don't import it in any more. so chuanish, do keep your cleaner as long as u can  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah Deamon, I absolutely agree that Walter is a fantastic driller.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> In fact, i rate him as one of the best. I can't dream of getting my equipment fired up by anyone else.<br>I just wanted to say that, it would be nice to adjust in slight moderations as well, say from 600 grit sanded to 800 grit. Walter adjusts the ball internally - drilling and core position, which does limit its effectiveness over a wide range of conditions. It would also help in gauging the box conditions of new equipment that comes out because i can compare them to what i have.<br><br>I agree on the insignificance of top and side weights nowadays. These are all static weights and are only useful for numbers and tourney regulations. The dynamic weight of the ball is what matters, and that changes with each bowlers style. Unfortunately, it is not possible to measure dynamic weights because the ball is in motion. That's what makes Walter so good - he can accurately determine a balls dynamic properties while drilling.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I suppose using too much of an aggressive ball in a dry condition WOULD give you awesome hook in terms of boards covered, but it sure is going to burn up all it's energy finding the way to the pocket and hit slightly harder than a piece of pocket tissue.<br><br>If slapping on Diamond Gloss or polishing it up won't help..... then ye better get a ball with a mild cover, preferably polished. Don't bite too quickly. Urm... Tornado?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prataman, there's no laughing here. The tornados are good balls. I was going to get the one that preceded them, what were they? Nitro? Gyro? I forgot.  :p Anyway, i was going to get one, then they changed the colour, slap on a new name and BLAM! We have the rather ugly tornados...<br>Inside, they're the same ball, though. But to me, the appearance of the ball matters a lot.<br>Tornados - good balls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thought I'll resurrect this tread by talking about my current ball, Tour Power 15-4lb from storm.<br><br>Been out of bowling for almost a month due to injury. Just recovered enough to go try some games at CDANS star bowl. For those who never been there before, its synthetic. Great, I thought, cos synthetic lanes tends to gather carrydown faster(time) then wooden lanes.  Since I am out for a month, should have grown weaker, hence slower ball speed, more hook, handling carrydown should be no problem. Thinking I should do well in this condition, I stand at 30 aiming at third arrow and let the ball row. Ball hits 4-7 pocket. Keep changing till I am very deep inside, yet I the best I can manage is a cross pocket into 1-2. Next correction, I reduced my axis rotation to 20-30 deg. Still the balls did not go down long enough. It stills transits early. End of game 1: 127<br><br>For game 2, I removed my wrist guard and do a break wrist type manuver from deep into the boards. The ball hits mildy into 3-6. *yeap* at last the is one shot to the right. Chances of adjusting into the pocket looks great. However after the entire game 2, there were only 5 pocket hits, and not a single strike from any of them. Even the sound sounds weak and brittle. Alright, I console myself, nevermind, still got game 3, and I prepared myself for the next game.<br><br>Results for game 3,4 and 5: 24 pocket hits out of a possible 35 pocket shots. Of this 24 hits, only 6 yields a strike. Wah lau! What the hell am I shooting, the swiss cottage sec gal beside my lane can shoot a 186 hooking with a whitedot. At that time, think I could have given everything for a light-oil ball. (well, not everything  &lt;-in italic)<br><br>Went home with an average of 130 and a burning determination to train doubly hard for the up and coming TPB/SIM classic, and maybe a new light-oil ball. ;p<br><br>btw, the ebonite dynasty looks good, and the trimax 3 looks cool....<br><br>------------------<br>Don't marry a person you can live with, marry someone you can't live without...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Air (up there)   :p<br>Wow! you're the first person I know to own the Tour Power. It's supposed to be a very good ball. I have some observations:<br><br>Was your surface sanded? I think the box surface is quite aggressive, so it might not have been you.<br><br>I agree when you say that you gave some room for a slower shotspeed after returning from injury and playing on synthetic lanes. However, you seem to have overlooked something:<br>The fact that they carrydown quicker means that there'll be less head-oil. And a slow ballspeed means that you burn energy before your breakpoint, resulting in your pancake hits.<br><br>From the description you gave, I assume you are using a leverage pattern, around 3 1/8" - 4 1/2"??    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised">  Does your layout look like this?<br><br>o &lt;-- Pin<br>0   0   &lt;-- Finger holes<br><br>*     &lt;-- CG<br><br>0     &lt;-- Thumb hole<br><br>Heehee. That's the best i can do to 'illustrate'.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Anyway, if your ball is drilled to aid with leverage, then by breaking your wrist to achieve length, the ball is still burning up too quick. Not enough energy left to carry, even if the leverage assists in getting to the 1-3 pocket.<br><br>Anyhow, don't give up on the ball!! I believe it's a good core/cover. Just need to tweak it for the conditions. And get well soon!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>[This message has been edited by harmzuay (edited 26 May 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by harmzuay (edited 26 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Artist in the making, I see.<br><br>Btw Jordan, the Matrix Dynasty is more powerful than we think. Please don't mistake it for a light oil ball. It WILL make the hard turn on the dry. Perhaps it was meant for light oil, but only for deeper angles.<br><br>The Matrix TRIMAX 3, forget about it. You're talking about the burgundy coloured one, right? It's covered with an even stronger coverstock than the Dynasty. Dry lanes? Try a Tornado instead, or a Stinger.<br><br>I've gotta get me a Tornado too. Seems to be the only thing that will spare the 1,3,6 or 3,6,10 on dry lanes for me!!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 26 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hamzuary,<br>yeah, its looks like wat u described, but I am not sure if its leverage drilling. I downloaded Storm's Basic drilling layouts. From the graphics presented, it can be either a label or leverage drilled. Think the difference between them is for leverage drill, the PAP is 3 3/8" away from both the CG and pin posn. Nvd, will bowl again tmr and see how it goes.<br><br>No way I am going to give up on my beloved Tour Power. I shot my highest average with this ball. Its just that the ball doesn't suit the lanes (btw, I forgot to mention in the previous post that the backend was fried!)<br><br>deamon, now am looking at the old Cuda/C 2000.
