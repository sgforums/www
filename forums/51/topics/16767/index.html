I dun play as deep as 30th board, more like the first 15, down and out, nothing fancy, just enough to get the job done  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just wondering, how do you ppl take your spares? I'm right handed, for pins on the left I use 3-6-9 system. For pins on the right, I just throw the ball dead stright, i.e. roll over the holes. I know it's not the best way, but since my spare ball is urethane instead of plastic, it's necessary to prevent it from hooking. Still having problems with the cao pin 10!!!  :p<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prataman, mayb i'm mistaken, seems to had saw some1 said something abt u shooting a 190 in another forum. sori.<br><br>i shoot pin 10 with reactive ball too. usually visualise a line then shoot cross lane to 10's dead centre. do a high spd ramming. me a rite handed. sometimes 4 the fun of it, i try a backup ball to pin 10. let go a straight wif ur guard on, watever, straight to pin 6 posn, wif ur fingers twisting the other way. usually does the job. but u'll have to try a few times first. hope that helps.<br><br>anyway, i've got a problem. my scores seems to be stuck below 200 for a long time liao. any tricks to go to +20??<br><br>rdgs</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The first day of battle is over, and man, I was disappointed with my performance.<br><br>But hey, most of all, it's great to finally meet some of the forum dudes, Captain Freemun, Vice Capitan, Ian, Chuanny and Yvonne. Great to meet you all.<br><br>Back to the games... I guess the three of us did struggle quite a bit, playing on Safra for the first time, but hey, that's not a good excuse. Solli solli solli I sucked today!!!! My pocket ball was ok, just me veli careless with my spares, left quite a number of single pin opens.<br><br>My personal final average was a gruesome 155, and I promise you I'll do better next time. Good thing is, I came away with a healthy handicap and also beat my opponent 3 out of 4 games!!!! Ngiak ngiak ngiak. Luckily he also couldn't find his line, if not I surely concuss.<br><br>I find it a really nice place to bowl, but the lanes take a bit of adapting. 20 boards in the center there is good oil, and 10 boards in either side of the gutter it is dry, but not too dry. Sounds good? Yeah... only problem is the oil only reaches slightly further than midlane, and the backend is bone dry. so it reacts pretty quick. Snappy at the back. It got a bit better, as Yvonne said, when the oil carried down a bit and tamed the ball reactions. Only thing then was you needed to rev the ball a bit harder so it wouldn't lose power hitting the pins.<br><br>Anyway, that's all for me today, once again, great to see ya finally.<br><br>Regards,<br>David<br><br>ps: John! How did you do???</div>

Next time we go Bedok to have prata for supper, onz boh...<br><br>Totally agree with you on the bit about backend being bone dry... it is nothing like vic's man, I'm starting to miss homeground lanes oredi  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I dunno if it's a problem, but my ball is drilled to promote early midlane roll... maybe that's why most of my strikes are going brooklyn???<br><br>Ahhh well, there's always the next round...<br><br>P.S. Nice to have finally met you too David</div>
