            <div class='col-md body'>the lanes were oiled b4 the last tourny. but the oiling pattern was different from the last time i bowled there. maybe thats why u felt it wasnt oiled. anyway, the outside was dry and inside oily, wif the heaviest oil down the centre.  the pins were too light making splits common for power type bowlers or for pple wif heavier balls and forcing them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>At the last tourney, the lanes were oiled. Very nicely, in fact. As pointed out, they were a mild block. It's just that the volume of oil wasn't much, so it dried quickly. Also note that oil carries down much, much faster on synthetic.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh.....so that is it.....I had always thought the lanes on that day had no oil, maybe that because I was always playing outside.

            <div class='col-md body'>Had a not too bad day today. As compared to the last mth classic tourny, well, my position improve by 2 places and my avg also improve by another 2 pins. So basically was satisfied despite the small improvemments.<br><br>Today amost everything new for me. "new" 2nd hand bolwing balls(had them drilled on fri only, so only today get to try out); tried a new concept bwling shoes which my frd got for me in the States, and of course using my favourite cleaner which now cannot find in singapore (neo tac renew it). So was able to get a 177avg, i more than happy alrdy.<br><br>Frankly, to get into 5th place came more as a suprise,esp when the counter announced after the end of 6 games, i was hovering at 6th. 2 games of 180+ and 190+ and 4 games of 160+ and i still have a chance to get into top. Really a susprise. I think among the top few, i may be the only bowler who played all 8 games without any games hitting beyond 200 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I always like to reflect the goods and bads after a tourny. Perhaps the good thing is i managed to improve on my avg. 2nd good will be that i have kept the difference bet my high and low games to less than 30pinfalls. 3rd good will be still able to bowl some decent games after all.<br><br>The bad? much more. my sparing really bad. 4 games of 160++ shows how much spares i have missed and the other 4 games of 180++ also shows missed spares, which would have otherwise lead to some 200 games. Lesson leant.<br><br>2nd bad...unable to adjust as quickly as i could. Till only the end then i decide not to roll the ball and loft the ball and playing "area" bowling. Should have done that by the 3rd game when my orange ball starts to over-hook at the 11th board. Experience learnt<br><br>3rd bad, unable to read the breaking down of the oil as fast as i can. only after 5th game then i realise i can't release the ball on the dots cos there wasn't any oil to allow my ball to skid.<br><br>having learn all these, hopefully next time got chance to do better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deamon<br><br>I did not ask you then because you were playing and had made a decision on how to play. But now that you mention it...<br><br>Remember that time (either 3rd or 6th game) when I was behind you and you left a 1-4-5 standing? You were lofting by then. But you played a smooth, strong shot to the 1-3 high and converted. Wasn't that a good line? It would have been more repeatable than lofting, surely.<br><br>I did notice your shoes. But I thought it was only the shoe (slide) cover that was different.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>the lanes this time around looked different from the last time. i only looked at deamon and tom's lanes so i might be wrong.<br><br>patchy at the ends, oil on the outside and bonedry from 5th to 15board. the centre had abit of oil but not really enuff to make a difference to hook ball bowlers. the spinners should have had a good day.<br><br>pins as usual was light (duh) making splits galore for higher speed and forceful players wif heavy balls.<br><br>ding had alot of problems, forcing more and more each time he made a pocket shot and didnt get a strike. only the last games he got a better score as he tired himself out and slowed down the speed, enabling a better reaction at the back.<br><br>ever wondered y the lady bowler (forgot her name) was always top bowler? (after 1st 4 games anyway) her style is simple and relaxed, allowing for pin reaction. since the pins were light, it suited her perfectly. put her on cathay lanes and the result would be very different. try looking at the top bowlers bowl in the competition and get an idea of wat they do right, it would improve ur chances if u try to follow them or adjust from wat u learn.<br><br>just my 2 cents.</div>
