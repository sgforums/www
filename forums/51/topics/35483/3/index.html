(after 1st 4 games anyway) her style is simple and relaxed, allowing for pin reaction. since the pins were light, it suited her perfectly. put her on cathay lanes and the result would be very different. try looking at the top bowlers bowl in the competition and get an idea of wat they do right, it would improve ur chances if u try to follow them or adjust from wat u learn.<br><br>just my 2 cents.</div></blockquote>Well, its definitely different if u compare the oil conditions on sunday and the monday league. The league on mon, maybe, employ a so-call "house" conditions, and it makes scoring seems higher. This is becos the amt of oil is more, and enough to last thru the 3 games<br><br>For the classic tourny, the lanes become unplayable after the 2nd game. The 10th board which got me a 388 after 2 games suddenly cross 4 boards across 1-3 pocket, and that's the extent of how much the lane has dried up.<br><br>U are right to say 5-15th board has dried up. interestingly, 0-5th board is patchy, so playing the outside line does not allow the ball to snap back with energy to the pocket.<br><br>But after 2 classic tournaments, i have a clearer idea how to tackle the lanes. The 1st tourny, i was using power surge and pearl power. The recent one i was using piranha and rage(which is a 16lb ball). My educated guess is to use 3 balls and exclude the power surge. Piranha for 1st two games when lanes still got oil. 3rd-5th/6th game, use storm pearl power to generate more skid to skid thru the front end which, by then, has alrdy broken down.Last 2 game or last game use the 16 lbs rage and whack straight into pocket and hoping for high pin counts and sparing.The 16th lab shall be used with a slower speed to purposely take out the pin5.<br><br>But they are just my educated guess. won't know if they work or not. anyway, they are just my thots<br></div>

But now that you mention it...<br><br>Remember that time (either 3rd or 6th game) when I was behind you and you left a 1-4-5 standing? You were lofting by then. But you played a smooth, strong shot to the 1-3 high and converted. Wasn't that a good line? It would have been more repeatable than lofting, surely.<br><br>I did notice your shoes. But I thought it was only the shoe (slide) cover that was different.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>Hehe 1 shot wrote so many posts.I like to explain why that shot is not used for my strike line.<br>Basically i was spinning the ball in and it went into the pocket just nice, slicing the pin5 and knocking the pin 4. But, if there were the full 10pins, i will be leaving a 6-8-10 split. Firstly, as u said the 1-3 pocket is high, so pin3 is not likely to knock out pin6 and pin10. Secondly, the ball only slice the pin5, meaning it wil not take out pin8. I was observing the reaction as the ball went for the spare and it indicate to me such a pocket shot is not worth to utilize as a strike line.<br><br>Also, becos of the dryness of the lanes, there is only less than a inch of error if i want to play the outside line. In this competition, i was playing catch up, so i have to find an area where i can afford at least 1-2 boards of error and hopefully high pincounts if i can't strike( a 9spare is always better than a 7spare). As  a result i have to use the lofting to skip the front and snap at the break-point to take out pin5. In my lane, the common pin being left behind is pin5, and this indicate abt the carry down condition of the lanes. With that in mind, so i just went for the simpler shot. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

The other was due to my release. I stretched my neck-shoulder tissue and it had an effect on me in the next 2-3 games. After that kinda get used to it and able to adjust my play. Had better follow-thru(which was missing from my earlier games)<br><br>Lesson learnt, try not to over sleep hence avoiding injury as I would had a better warmup and gotten warmup throws <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
