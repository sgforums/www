The lao-jiao bowlers will still prefer the old terms like finger weight... etc.. Skid snap is a drilling which maximises finger weight for skid and side weight for snap.<br><br>Modern bowling drilling concepts focus more to the pin and mass bias (for asymmetrics) placements for ball reactions, rather than the old fashioned "side weight, thumb weight, finger weight" concepts.<br><br>Coverstock surface is also the greatest influence on how fast your ball grips the lane, hence modifying the distribution of its energy release. For example, a pearl ball tends to skid through the front part of the lane and unleash it's energy in the backend. This may result in a "flip" motion.<br><br>As what Ian said, Quantums are designed by Brunswick Technology Ventures (BTV), and I believe their last offering was the Denim Quantum, which PT currently has.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quantum balls are actually experimental balls for proactive materials. Way during the reactive resin era, brunswick and their R&amp;D were alrdy developing the new coverstock. That is why quantum balls are manufactured under BTV(Brunswick Technology Venture) and not under Brunswick.<br><br>Thus now that proactive balls are out on the market, that is why quantum balls are no more ard.<br><br>For skip/snap. I still believe it is the lane condition that allows u to achive that rather than yr style. I saw remy ong in last year Taiwan CGU step ladder final on tv. Then, he was throwing a messenger Ti-pearl and the ball really skid and snap. But in other tournys, he was throwing a more even arcing ball. Thus i'm of the opinion that its the lane that allows the kind of style.<br><br>Yup, agree with prataman. james always tend to use the word snap when he drilling ball, which is actually using the finger weight of the ball........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't regard Remy Ong as a "snap" type of bowler. The way he releases the ball does not make it possible. He's a strong arc bowler.<br><br>To make a ball skid and snap is to create a hook shape the americans term the "hockey stick" shape. For those who have seen any hockey sticks before, this is a very strong imagery. A strong arc may look awesome to asians, and because of that many of us who see a very aggressive hook simply call it a skid/snap shot.<br><br>The fact is, the best of us are only strong arc bowlers. Shaun Ng doesn't get on television anymore. But i'm sure some of you know who zulmazran zulkifli is. On his form, he is what i regard as a strong arc bowler. Not a skid/snap.<br><br>Of course, lane conditions allow for certain shots to be played. But personally, i believe the bowler is still the largest input into the shape of the subsequent shot. For instance, Robert Smith plays skid/snap whether or not he plays the first three boards or lofts over the left gutter. He is the exception, not the rule.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just to let you guys in on something:<br><br>THE SKID-SNAP REACTION:- What is done here is that the pin is above or below the ring finger hole in most instances. Hence the entire span lies with the CG almost in the centre of the span. This creates finger weight OR the top weight will lie in the top half of your palm. This causes the ball to maintain its initial axis of roll longer("Fowrad-Roll") before the weight block flips hard to give the entire ball a "skid-Snap" reaction.  It is the same as the label drilling which gives the ball the longest length, but strongest backend. NOTE THAT DRILLERS WOULD NOT NEED YOUR Positive.Axis.Point. or P.A.P. FOR THIS LABEL DRILLING MOST OF THE TIME.  ----Personally my favourite drilling.<br><br>There are so many levels of a bowler's knowledge. Why bicker and term everything beyond common comprehension. Knowledge is power and is a blessin But knowledge is Not an instrument used to impress.<br><br>Jasmine, was wondering about whether you have checked out the lane #1 website yet, and if you have any questions.<br><br>Nope I never trained under Mike Lam nor Henry Tan, Nor at Jackies.<br><br>By the way, Jae, I'll play this coming Monday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well said.<br>for the record... i dun make the ball snap..just an ordinary underpowered stroker.<br><br>and, i believe maybe the problem between the definations lie in the terms used by the bowlers and drillers.<br><br>a driller will refer to the skid/snap coz the ball he drills will do just that. but can the bowler do it? or rather achieve the balls max potential?<br><br>the bowler wans the ball to skid/ snap, means he wans the ball to travel far and break late. for the striaghter line bowlers, this causes the illusion that the ball does come in at a very sharp angle due to distance travelled by the ball after breaking.<br><br>another thing about whether a bowler can skid/snap is the lanes. its not about the ball or the release sometimes. the lanes just do not permit a certain style. i go victor's to bowl and i feel like a champion ready to take on remy. i go to vision? and i feel like an amatuer who spent too much on bowling.<br>(lets not go into detail about oiling and all that. pretty needless)<br><br>all in all, its just terminology misuse by many pple, and fantasy on of doing such a thing by many others.<br><br>ps. there is a bowler i know who can snap the ball. my biggest arc is a child's baby steps compared to him. and he's in poly/jc this year. i believe he is an up and coming.. at least i hope so. =)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can I say that, all other factors being the same,<br>1) a ball with a highly asymmetrical core will have a more angular reaction?<br>2) the "angle-rity" of the ball increases with axis rotation? A 90 deg axis rotation will have a sharper angle; more skid-snap than skid-arc?<br><br>Dun mind me, students of engineering are naturally more interested in correlations..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Quantum balls were the technological heights of ball design 6years back. their main asset was their core which allowed a better pin action and rev even on inept bowlers.<br><br>However, that was 6 years ago. since its a brunswick ball, (and i only use brunswick) i can only discuss along these lines, The 'new' series of Zone is out, namely the dangerzone 3,4 RedAlert series etc, these either come in the new surface of carbon something i cant remember what, and partical surface. these surefaces will allow a bowler to hook like never b4, but, only for the mid to low end rev bowlers. higher rev bowlers will find that unless the oil is mercifully 'thick', their ball will roll out at the pins.<br><br>The fuZe line by brunswick, supposedly to take over the original Zone line, seems very popular, using symmertrical cores to distribute even hitting power. eg are the raging red, purple, igniter. they primarily used the same core (upgraded version they claimed) slapped a new name, but used the overall concept of their predecessors to market the product.<br><br>the reason why quantum was so popular last time was becoz no other company had that level of technology to compare wif brunswick at that point in time. now, most of the major manufacturers have already caught up and most have their 'specialities' to promote their balls.<br><br>brunswick = powerkoil, 1st company to use partical technology.<br>columbia= powerful coverstock, but wears out fast.<br>storm = scented balls???<br><br>these are the primary differences but i do not know the specifics of the other brands. maybe prata and harmzuay will elaborate more.<br><br>*written according to the best of my knowledge*</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today was passing by parkway parade when i step into Cash Converters, an australian shop selling 2nd hand goods. I spotted a pink quantum ball. Condition so-so, cos the ball kinda tracked out but recon the ball shld be fine. Weight, i suspect is between 12-13lbs. Price is $12, if i remember correctly. So anyway who wants a light ball for experimental purposes, may wanna go down there see see look look.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey peeps!<br><br>Yes, currently I only have a 14lbs cherry bomb. However if the response is good, I would definitely be able to bring in more Cherry Bombs. I'm selling it at S$330 with inserts. Just to let you in on some price information, it is selling for US$300 in the States.<br><br>For further enquiries on other products, let me know at 96808624.
