How much to skid depends on the oiling conditions.

Then go home and cry on wetter lanes. Or learn to bowl like Ian.<br><br>Anyway, I use a 4 x 4 layout for my dryer lanes on a pearlised reactive coverstock ball. This is a stacked layout with a further pin.<br><br>The further pin distance from PAP allows the ball to take a longer time to roll, the pearlised cover assists in the skid as well. I chose a stacked layout for a more aggressive snap at the back (compared to an arc or roll layout). But keep the speed up on this drilling otherwise you'll visit Tom/CH's pocket more often than your own.<br><br>Lastly, I chose to have the pin under the ring finger rather than above it, because I spin it more than most semi-rollers. So I get a little inherent skid compared to most of the others here. Except Jae and Hanz, of course.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When the lanes get too dry, i try to switch balls. Or rather, i <span style="font-style: italic;">want</span> to switch balls, but i can't, because the other options are: (1)a more aggressive chaos, (2)a pancake blue dot, and (3)a urethane shadow i always leave at home. So... i switch lines. Go al the way out to first 5 boards, or shift in for a wider arc.<br>And when THAT isn't enough, i stop playing. No lah, i try to get more length by speeding up the footwork, and thinking "project... project...project the damn ball...". Helps to use a further target.<br><br>Last resort: field promote the plastic to a strike ball, or play a straight (i.e. *goong goong*) shot with the particle. More biased towards the goong goong shot.</div>

I am more comfortable in play my usual same line and target and is often more consistent.<br><br>I usually play around 7-10 boards. Let it go at around the same area as well.

            <div class='col-md body'>oh, that's what happened to me in a katong league session when the oiling pattern has not changed yet. If i play outside line, it crosses over. if i play inside line, it falls short of the pocket.<br><br>When that happens, I played the outside line, speed up my ball so that it goes higher on the pocket or around there. This is usually not consistent.<br><br>What I can do though is shift right (i'm leftie) 2~3 boards, and target 1 board or so, depending on the lane condition, switch to my ShockZone (skid-snap) ball and throw at my initial speed(relatively slow). As the ball is made for more length, I could have it skid further down, before its snaps and hook. By shifting slightly inside, I can get slightly more oil and it will skid further.<br><br>However, before I even get to try this line again, the oiling pattern has since been changed, so I cannot work out my theory. It did work for 2 games of fun bowling after league session though...</div>

Lanes too dry for that? simple, use a break wrists release. lanes too oily? ball skids into the pocket? slow down the ball speed ( backswing, slower steps blah blah)<br><br>4) take out ur car keys, do ur usual routinue, get into bed, hope u have someone beside u to hug. cry ur eyes out about the unfairness of the world, wakeup red eyed, and prepare to cry every week. ur gal might leave u though after awhile, to find someone wif more backbone.<br><br>thats it. all i can tink of in my weakened SARS condition.</div>

If i play outside line, it crosses over. if i play inside line, it falls short of the pocket.<br><br>When that happens, I played the outside line, speed up my ball so that it goes higher on the pocket or around there. This is usually not consistent.<br><br>What I can do though is shift right (i'm leftie) 2~3 boards, and target 1 board or so, depending on the lane condition, switch to my ShockZone (skid-snap) ball and throw at my initial speed(relatively slow). As the ball is made for more length, I could have it skid further down, before its snaps and hook. By shifting slightly inside, I can get slightly more oil and it will skid further.<br><br>However, before I even get to try this line again, the oiling pattern has since been changed, so I cannot work out my theory. It did work for 2 games of fun bowling after league session though...</div></blockquote>To those playing in katong league, do u find that week in week out, there are no same lane conditions? What i mean is that week 2 lane condition is not the same as week 3. But week 2 lane condition might be the same for week 4 or maybe 5.<br><br>As far as i know, they employ 2 oiling conditions. Maybe 3, i not so sure. BUt the 2 i face in earlier leagues(and struggling with them, of course) is one that they clean and strip the lanes an hour before league starts. So u get a very nice and snappy backend.<br><br>The other lane condition is pretty unplayable for most styles. They put long and heavy oil in the middle. In such cases, go to the approach and see the lanes. If i'm not wrong, the 1st 3 boards are totally dry. So while most ppl may think oil is heavy and need to play deeper in, playing 3-5 boards is even a better option. and becos of the long oil after 5th boards, the ball will be guided into the pocket. Speed must be slow of course.<br><br>That's what i have observed after playing in about 5weeks of league.In both cases mentioned above, 2nd arrow doesn't seem to help carry into pocket.<br><br>I not too sure if there's a 3rd condition for katong league.Prata, what do u think?<br><br>haha harmy....me dun eat the conditioner, i feel it. hehe</div>

I am more comfortable in play my usual same line and target and is often more consistent.<br><br>I usually play around 7-10 boards. Let it go at around the same area as well. Some may call it hitting up the lanes. But this often cause a solid 10.<br><br>Most ppl would bring probably 2 or 3 balls. So sometimes its really hard to bring down 1 ball just to pinpoint 1 lane condition . I'm also lazy at times, so hardly bring down my spare ball for pin10.<br><br>But generally, most i would say bring down a peralised and dull ball. So in the event of lane changes or become drier, the pearl ball will come into use. The peralised ball is only to give u more skid thru the lanes. Ultimately, the bolwer will still have to move ard to find oil to skid the ball.<br><br>Lastly, how a ball hook and strikes depends on the friction between<br>the ball surface and surface of the backend.Hence we not only have to find an oil line, but an area in the backend where the friction allows the ball to have pin carry, aka pin action.<br><br>That's the tough part abt hook ball bowling<br><br>Anyway, thanks for the advice<br></div></blockquote></div>

We should be seeing more consistent patterns from here on in.... one that doesn't leak conditioner in the backends...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
