            <div class='col-md body'>Every manufacturer has claims to "unique" core designs or whatnots... But I think the only company that is able to claim that is probably Mo-Rich.

I have encountered very little problems with energy management with Track equipment, all other factors being equal.<br><br>I would love to try Mo-Rich and Ebonite's offerings, but they specialise in asymmetric cores. So i'm out of luck there, since the only reason I wanted to try them was for their innovative core designs, especially Mo-Rich's (Ebonite's coverstocks don't impress me).      <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The guy's name is Billy Orlikowski. Hehe i got autograph from him too. According to him, brunswick dun make mass bias cos it has something to do with locating the cg as well as the drilling patterns. I dun how to write in words, but when he was there explaining, i know what he meant. Also, by adding another piece of inner core "elsewhere" and selling for US$200++ does not make any economical sense. Thus brunswick rather go for designs w/o mass bias and selling them for US$175.<br><br>Probably in singapore, brunswick balls are going at quite a high price. This is partly becos the dristributer jack the price up. Ask any pro-shops(at least me and prata regular driller agree on this) and see if they agree or not.<br><br>lastly from the seminar, i had a good look of the brunswick fractory. not pictures but videos clips. They show how they make a easy polyester ball to the more complicated high-end ball. On average, the high-end ball take a week to manufacture and more than 50% of the time is spent on curing! and when it comes to curing quality, there's no way they can hurry it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>the fingerhole is widened and it isnt smoothened out much</blockquote>Not bevelling the edges of thumb or finger holes is the common way to "teach" a bowler not to squeeze. My brother has been using sharp edges on his ball for years. Ultimately, the aim is to switch back to bevelled edges unless one gets so used to it that they stay that way. Some pros have grips that are naturally like this, though their names escape me now.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Back to this thread's topic: Brunswick and Columbia indeed do not make balls with asymmetrical cores. If Columbia does make any (though none springs to mind now), those are probably rare forays into that market. But as far as I can backdate, i do not know of any Brunswick's that have a mass bias centre.<br><br>Track bowling was for a long time a similar company - specialising in a range of very good balls without asymmetrical cores. Then they tried it once with the EMB (elliptical mass bias) ball and the response was so good, EMB because a series of balls. Since then, I think only the Freak series (designed my Mo Pinel of Mo-Rich) has such aggressive cores.<br>Other from those two, Track is a "normal" ball making company.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have tried a couple of balls from Shadow/R, Defense Zone, Attitude III, Deep Danger Zone, Super Cuda/C, Tremor, Extreme Chaos, Complete Chaos, Phatom, Cuda/C 2000 and not too mention my only 2 plastic, a pink maxim (rare  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  and a blue dot.<br><br>With the amount revs I put into the balls, I realised that zone is not for me. But still I am keen to try another zone with a very weak drilling.<br><br>I love my 2 cudas. Very good. However it was my chaos that stole the limelight, managed to get my high games from them. The Extreme had since experienced the TEC death......<br><br>However my high series still comes from my cuda/c 2000 at the moment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Hope I can get a hold of the original cuda/c.<br><br>Would like to try storm and ebonite someday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>All 4 of my balls are Columbian. Always thought that they looked the best, i guess. But i always had this nagging suspicion that investing solely on one brand will have it's drawbacks. I agree with harmzuay when he said that Columbia's coverstocks are versatile, useful for manipulation.<br><br>Recently, i've been getting feedback that the coverstocks don't last as long as other makes... not that i can tell; i have nothing to compare to. But diversification usually lowers risks, so unless Columbia has a very strong case, my next ball will probably be something else.</div>
