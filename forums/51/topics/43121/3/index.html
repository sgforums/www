            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it didn't turn out to be the derby match most of us expected last night. It's all one sided since the whistle...<br><br>Kev, you really bowled extremely badly last night as the first bowler. Being beaten by one of the F4 member   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Maybe you are overly excited bowling against Vaness Wu Jian Hao  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now, on a more serious note. I had no idea what you are doing. You are adding to your problem (not solving it) by confusing yourself/ your release... by spinning one moment... then hook play... spin hook... whatever. It's not the first time dude <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> I have seen it too often when you use both styles on the same night. I have seen you bowled well too by sticking to one style of play. Many many times in fact.<br><br>In my own view, I feel that you have disregarded the team's performance by doing what you did...... My view is that if you can't cope using one style, what makes you confident that you can switch to the other <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  The consequence will be disastrous if you aren't comfortable with the other style too(your confidence will be at the bottom then)... then? switch back? to and fro <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  To me, it's not only the individual's game. One gotta feel for the team's game/spirit too. When you ask me whether or not to sandbag when the team is 100 pinfall behind, I'm alarmed. Where are you when the team needs you most <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> (Thinking of sandbagging the opponent <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> )<br><br>Sorry for the harsh tone. I just wanna get this out of me. I'm sure you know this ain't the first few times you tried this...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>THAT Team : You guys can't have it easier... our 2nd lowest total series. Well one thing's for sure, THIS Team gonna have to pick ourself up and do much better the second time round we meet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You guys deserve the win. And a round of applause for your past 4 weeks' performance  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be too hard on Tomahawk. I believe he was trying his best. He certainly was throwing the best he could, from what I saw. The drying lanes caught all the heavy ball bowlers off (maybe except Prataman, who is king on the day).<br><br>Afterall, nobody plays with the intention of losing, yah?<br><br>I feel what style one bowls is a matter of personal comfort. Just like the advice to play the line or shot that makes you the most comfortable or gives you the most confidence. Tomahawk must have done what he felt was most natural to him in different circumstances. It's just that different bowlers approach the game in different ways.<br><br>Some like to play their way out of a slump with the previous shots, while others try to change their game. If it works, they look like geniuses, but if it doesn't they look like fools, right?<br>Everyone has off games. He had his yesterday. If he was on a good day, he would have looked like a genius and this thread would be hailing his bowling genius, no?<br><br>Let's just look forward to another week. A better week for all.<br><br>Ding<br><br>Don't take it too seriously what he said about sandbagging. It is a form of strategy, by not fighting over a lost cause and "planning for the future". It's similar to tennis players not wasting energy fighting from 1-5 down in the set, saving energy for the next set instead.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Woh woh.....ding cool down. I understand you care about the team. I am also disappointed that tomahawk didnt manage to bowl his usual 200 average. I also hope not only tomahawk, but all members of THIS (and THAT) can perform well. Maybe tomahawk should have to stick to one style, or maybe he shouldnt have switch styles so frequently. That is his decision. If he wins out in the end, then good for him and the team. If not, then he'll have to bear the consequences i.e. fines, losing points, pulling team down, etc. I'm sure he kicks himself for not doing well too.<br><br>On the positive note, the next opponent against an on-form Tomahawk will have to play against his fury as well as his heighten handicap. Make things tougher for them eh.<br><br>The last thing I wanna see is distrust among team members. Ding, I'm sure what you said is vaulable teaching to tomahawk. I believe he shall be in much better position to take on THAT, as well as OTHERS the next time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's not blame Tomahawk for the failure. He probably had much better days, and I believe he is just trying to get used to the lanes.<br><br>Take myself for instance, I let the team down. I was supposedly to archored the team but guess I really did archored us to the bottom.<br><br>I was doing so well in my debut 2 weeks ago. Average 196??? But Last monday only a mere 150+. So where did I go wrong??? Worst of all yday at Victor's managed a 179??? I should had at least kept my 170+ average but I failed.<br><br>On the lighter side, at least we pushed That Team further up the standings? Did we? Its still a SIM team rite???<br><br>Ok shall we try to hit the minimum quota of 160 and avoid fines. That would be a good start.<br><br>By the way all our styles are different. Tomahawk is a power player beautiful style, but luck wasn't on his side. And I am a tweener.<br><br><strong>On a lighter side</strong><br>Was there too many distraction??? hahahaha<br>I alway bowl badly when against a woman opponent. And last mon with all the girl power, boy was I distracted too. Too bad none is available hahahahahah (just kidding) Probably that's why jae is doing well hahahahah (oops there I go again)<br><br></div>
