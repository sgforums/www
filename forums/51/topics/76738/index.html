            <div class='col-md body'>Looks like the CSC website has already been updated:<br><br>We are currently 7th of the league's 18 squads, slightly above "mid-table". Next week we face L C S Novena, who are currently in 15th place, 11 points behind us.<br><br>Still early days yet, but their best bowler currently has a handicap of 7. The rest of the bowlers have handicaps ranging from 13 to 22. Quite a bit to overcome! However, this represents a good chance to get valuable points.<br><br>Might be a good idea to utilise our bowlers who has a reasonable handicap as well to counter. Just a suggestion.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well to each individual to their style.... its definitely good to have a higher handicap, but its also good to play to our best potential! Picture this.....your opponent is hitting a 110 game....would you go all out to beat him flat by scoring a 200 game? Or juz beat him by 130 game and gain a higher handicap in view of maybe the next opponent will be a stronger player?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel whether to sandbag or not is a bowler's personal decision, which i believe, will ultimately affect his/her mental game in the long run, which in turn will affect his/her scores...<br>just chatted with Michael, and he talked abt some of the bowlers doing obvious sandbaggings, like guttering for the first throws, (hm, well, if u'r as lousy as me, then no problem, but if u hit a 200+ game, then guttering a few first shot for the next few games...a bit obvious, rite?) therefore, hm, unprofessionalism in bowling too?<br>anyway, Mike's a definite a good example (for me) in terms of having a strong mentality to win, no matter who his opponent is. see if jae's anywhere close to him in a few yrs' time... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
