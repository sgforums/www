            <div class='col-md body'>The Super Carbide Bomb hooks far more than the swamp monster. The Super Carbide Bomb snaps harder and hits harder too.<br>Very, very hooky. Good for very oily conditions and lanes with patchy backends. Could also be shined up to make it go longer, though its not recommended.<br><br>Also it has a Carbide Particle Formula coverstock and a 5-piece core. so it rolls possibly as much as the Storm Trauma Carbide but snaps harder and hits harder than other dull balls. I have an undrilled 14.24lbs Super Carbide Bomb going for S$300, if anyone's interested. But trust me, it really, really hooks and hits harder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lane #1 gear has a very large and faithful following overseas, especially in the US of A. It has to be noted that in the States, their balls retail around US$70 - 90 more than the high-end balls of other brands (e.g., Track's Freak line, Columbia's Icon line, et cetera), so if they only go for S$30 more here, I think that it's a good deal, albeit relatively.<br><br>That said, I think Lane #1 has some connection with Brunswick. (Prataman, would you know about it?) Their buzzsaw line uses the same powerkoil 18 coverstock that the classic dangerzone black uses. And the Lane #1 trademark is their diamond shaped cores.<br><br>The consensus is that Lane #1 balls outhook most competition, as originick has been trying to sell.<br><br>Here's some friendly advice to originick: Don't push the brand by saying it hooks, hooks, and well... hooks. Hooking isn't the only thing that matters. And you'll find out that many people in this forum actually <span style="font-style: italic;">do not</span> want so much of it (hook).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lane #1 balls don't all outhook the rest, but, it does hit harder than other balls because of its cores.  The Super Carbide and the Super Carbide Bomb(being particle balls) are the ones that hook alot. But the other balls are all designed to go longer and snap harder, making it controllable and stronger at the backend, especially their new Cherry Bomb which goes really long, then snaps really hard.<br><br>By the way,since you mentioned it, Lane #1 designs their balls       (designs their coverstocks, cores,etc., then decides which to use with which) but their balls are made by Brunswick. Thus meaning to say that the Carbide Particle and  Resin Formulas,the Powerkoil18 Reactive Urethane formula and their Xtra-Strength Rhino Pro Reactive Coverstocks belong to Lane #1.<br><br>Lane #1 bowling balls are doing and selling exceptionally well in other places too, besides the U.S., like Japan and the U.k..It is becoming increasingly well received  in Thailand and Australia, which have just began marketing Lane #1.</div>

The viper, for example, uses rhino pro coverstock, which belongs to brunswick, and not the other way round</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br>The powerkoil 18 coverstock was initially designed by Lane #1. But since you mentioned that it is patented by Brunswick, then I shall enquire with Lane #1 about this. However the Rhino Pro coverstock does belong to Brunswick. The coverstock used on the Lane #1 Viper is called and Xtra Strength Rhino Pro coverstock, thus it could be a modified version. However I will get back to you all on this one.<br><br></div>
