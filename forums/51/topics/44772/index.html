            <div class='col-md body'>After watching Frawley's sensational performance against one of the best european bowlers makes me wonder how come he looks so mediocre on the ABT.<br><br>I guess a possible reason could be that he isn't good at adjustments. Which brings me to my point: I think that even on a tournament like the ABT, the lane oiling conditions are still a joke to recognised american standards. Probably just as blocked or patchy as standard house patterns.<br><br>On the ABT, Frawley almost always struggles with over/under reactions within a single game. And since we can see that the ABT oils its lanes between every match played, there can be no transition in a single game. I may be jumping to conclusions, but i've always been convinced that in asia, those with hand and ballspeed are often penalised.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thomas juz told me that he's a good bowler, except his mental isn't as good as it should be. He gets frustrated easily, and once he gets frustrated, he doesn't care too much about his game and starts to bowl differently. As in, getting worse.<br><br>This I agree because the number of times I see Frawley play in ABT, once his opponent gets the hang of it, and Frawley doesn't, his face is a frown, shoulders a shrug, and everything starts to go haywire.<br><br>Otherwise, he's a very good bowler...</div>

Remy's release is really nice, and I've been following them through slow-motion replays. Not that its impossible to copy, but it did give me a bit of hint as to how I can continue to "upgrade to level 3"....maybe can try it on the lanes soon...<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>For now, study....study....</div>
