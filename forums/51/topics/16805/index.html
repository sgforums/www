            <div class='col-md body'>Went down to the Cathay Superclassic finals yesterday. Really an eye opener. Watched the experts from all over the world bowl. The final step ladder match was really exciting. Technically speaking, Remy Ong finished the game with a 226. It was Kimmo Lethnomen's turn for his 10th frame. His current score is 216. If he close this throw, it is just simply hitting another one single pin to win the game. Unfortunately, even thought his ball hit into the pocket, he got a 1-2-4-6-10 split. (he is a lefty). He only manage to clear 1,2 and 4, leaving pins 6 and 10, thus losing the game to Mr Remy. For that, I think Remy was damn lucky.<br><br>Airgrinder's Best Entertainer Bowler Award: Tim Mack-that fellow was a joker boy, all his funny actions...<br><br>Airgrinder's Most Vocal Bowler Award: Remy Ong- if u hear a shout, means remy'as got a strike...<br><br>Airgrinder's 2nd Most Vocal Bowler Award: Lim Yu-wen, starts to follow remy towards the last few games...<br><br>Airgrinder's Most Action Bowler Award: Remy Ong, everytime remy jumps, its a strike...<br><br>Airgrinder's Hulk Hogan Lookalike Award: Kimmo Lethnomen, imitate Hulk's chest squeeze action when he got his 6 bagger in the step ladders....<br><br>Airgrinder's Most Chatty Lady Award: The lady in red behind me in the grandstand, with her 2 similar friends...<br><br>Airgrinder's Most Boliao Award: Me, for typing this while watching "feng yun"<br><br>rdgs<br><br>------------------<br>"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career.

The fittest bowlers generally find it easier to maintain the same level of mental and physical performance thru as much as 210 shots thru 10 games. Then play in small increments. 5 game series, then 7, then 10, etcetera. Else you risk injury or fatigue, after which you'll be likely practicing bad habits which might be detrimental to one's game.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
