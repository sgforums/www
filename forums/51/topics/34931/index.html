            <div class='col-md body'>Ian,<br><br>The program which Uncle Thomas Fox is negotiating for the CHIJ and SIM club is a different package from the 280, 550 and 800 dollar packages, with the on lane instruction, as you have mentioned. It's also a different one from the 50 dollars per classroom session. Same topics, but over different days.<br><br>I've spoken with Mr Paul Goh, the program co-ordinator, and he tells me that the package he is preparing for Mr Thomas Fox for the SIM/UOL club costs $98 per head, if I don't remember wrongly. So Ian, you have gotten a reduced price alright. However, I think there's also a limit of 20 people and the talks will be held over 2 days, Saturday and Monday (22nd and 24th Feb). Once again, I may have gotten the dates wrong, but I know it's a different package than the ones stated above.<br><br>Of course, if you could spare the dough, you could take part in the on lane training sessions. As I understand, the places are filling up fast.</div>
