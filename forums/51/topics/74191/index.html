GL Paul said to get hayden to give him a call and he'll hand over the card.<br><br>Ding went back to the lanes and got Jae to call Hayden. Hayden returned call and Jae pass the phone to GL Paul for direct communication(words from the horses' mouth - sorry Hayden, I'm not saying that u'r a horse  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  ).<br><br>GL Paul then said to Jae. He(Hayden) must come down personally with IC to collect his card.<br><br>Jae came back slightly agitated and broke the bad news to us saying that GL Paul said something about black &amp; white conditions on the application form indicating member must come down personally irregardless of whether he's died/overseas/or hospitalised(I've added salt &amp; vinegar here) . He then proceed to the lanes to register a strike <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ding's very DL about GL Paul. After a few disturbed throws on the lanes, went to confront GL Paul at the counter.<br><br>Ding: "I thought u said to pass us the card after I get my friend to call?"<br><br>GL Paul: "yes but now I've changed my mind. he must come down personally to collect it. It's the terms and condition when they apply for the card"<br><br>Ding: "is that so? Are you trying to play me out here?"<br><br>GL Paul: "...... silence...... felt uneasy(hope he didn't think that I will beat him to pulp."<br><br>Ding: "if you wanna mess with me, I'll mess with you! Show me the black and white that you've mentioned now."<br><br>GL Paul: "There's no black &amp; white."<br><br>Ding: "Give me your full name, Victors' bowl email id and phone number. I wanna log an official complaint!!!"<br><br>At that point, GL Paul panicked. Was stoned for awhile then proceed to write the requested info in a blank piece of paper with unsteady hands. I picked up the Victors' Bowl namecard at the counter and passed it to him, just write down your full name here, email and phone number is already indicated on this card.<br><br>end of story. Don't feel sorry for GL Paul, he deserved it for blowing a small matter up.<br><br>Update all when I have the offical reply from Victors'...... so stay tuned <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I seriously don't understand why they would want to make such a big fuss over a small case like this.<br><br>First of all, Hayden's already called in as per his request, and THEN he refuses to fulfill the promise he made. That's strike number 1.<br><br>it's not really that difficult to give us what, 3 games out of goodwill at member's price. We had 13 games at that time? Not only will it ensure that we'll come back happy next time, at least we can spread good words about Victor's Bowl and its staff. Just a bit of " outside-the-box " customer service also cannot. Strike number 2.<br><br>If it was really in black and white, then at the end of the day we would really have nothing to say. But he can't even produce it? If he can't produce it, who can? Strike number 3.<br><br>I could go into more details, but really there's no point.<br><br>In my opinion, he's out. I fully support your decision to lodge a complaint.
