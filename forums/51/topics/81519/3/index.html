            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm with regards to bowling balls, I think it's fair to say that most of us "casuals" up to "weekly league bowlers" or even "serious leisure bowlers" will only need 2..... 3 or up to max 4 balls.<br><br>Usually it consists of a ball for heavy oil, one for lights/mediums and 1 for sparing...

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm?<br><br>If you notice, some bowlers wipe their ball before every shot with a towel. This will remove excess oil from the ball surface so that it will not mess up your shot, and prevent (somewhat) the oil from being absorbed by your ball. Not all bowlers do this, and I myself don't have this habit.<br><br>However, importantly, invest in any ball cleaner, a nice towel, and wipe down your ball after each bowling set. Don't be lazy! Don't let the dirt pile up, especially on your bowling track. This will cause the ball to lose reaction. May not be noticeable to all, but the more sensitive bowlers will feel the lost in reaction especially in the backends. If you don't know which cleaner to get, go to safe route and just get a simple cleaner from one of the ball companies, probably Storm, Ebonite or Track.<br><br>If you haven't done so for a looooong time and your ball seems bigger because of all the accumulated dirt, it may be a good idea to bring the ball to the pro shop for a reconditioning. Will cost you though.</div>
