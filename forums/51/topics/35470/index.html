            <div class='col-md body'>I have a few questions I would like to ask here.<br>As topic suggests, before I visit my proshop driller lah.<br><br>Thumb question. AGAIN... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>I am going to widen my thumb hole, after being stubborn for past few months. Problem is how wide should it be?<br>For example, I am currently playing with just a piece of timing tape from the start. Take the Forum Challenge for example.<br>First game, I could afford to use 2 pieces of timing tape on my thumb. Just first game.<br>Second game and 3rd game, I just needed my first piece of timing tape.<br>4th and 5th game, I'm struggling to get my thumb out. Which means my thumb is not fully deep in. Of cos, I had my timing tape on.<br><br>With this situation, should I widen my thumb hole to the extent that I can play with a timing tape and fit up to ard 4 pieces of insert tapes, i repeat...INSERT TAPES. At the end of the 5th game, I just need my timing tape or perhaps, with 1 insert tape left. Of cos, my thumb should not get stuck, but can slip out without any "holdup".<br>Do you ppl think this is feasible?<br>Please advise...I'm going to the proshop on Tuesday.<br><br>Plus, I might purchase a 2nd hand ball and an SST5 or 6. My budget excluding the repair on my current ShockZone is $300. Do you think its enough to get a 2nd hand ball and the shoe?<br>Advise pls pls....PLS!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>AND NOTE, TAKE NOTE TAKE NOTE!!!!<br>Please visit this site...<br>http://www.boxup.com/big5/music/album/album950.htm<br>AND PLS PLS, CLICK ON THE REAL AUDIO FILE of the first song...ONLY YOU...by Luo Jia Ying. Click it...its the Only You song sang by the monk in Stephen Chow's movie....<br>really!! Super COOL~~~~<br>and song no.6<br>its a real nice song....its the ending of that movie....if you remember, Stephen CHow and Athena Chu kissing on top of the tower, and Sun Wukong walking away....the song is being played.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>P1<br><br>I don't think that amount is enough for the shoes + ball. SST6s cost about $240. Oh, you may want to have a look at the new ABS shoes from Japan. There are VERY good things said about them in the states. You may read about them at forums in PBA.com or ballreviews.com - just search for the keywords.<br>Though I have had mixed reviews from Sam and Walter. Walter thinks they won't last long because the top material and worksmanship may not last over time. Sam thinks they are better than SST6s even.<br><br>About your thumb... For your thumb to expand so much in 5 games, the issue may lie in your release. Of course this could simply be down to many other factors, such as insufficient warm-up resulting in a non-representative thumb size before play, et cetera. But if you want to resize your plug, do it judiciously. You could always D.I.Y. when you need to anytime on your own with sandpaper if it's not wide enough.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well Player1, I wemt to see some shoes at a pro shop juz now. Found out some interesting facts. SST6 Mostly are made in China now and they dun last long. Try finding SST6 made in the USA. Hammer came out their own shoe for $180. One colour black. Same shape as SST6, same soles and heels, interchangeble. But the Hammer shoe is lighter and harder.Not as comfy as SST6. ABS shoes i tried too. they are comfy but the soles are more complicating...see them for yourself. retailing at $250. Oh, I'm refering to the ABS Pro AM. Hope this will help, but to all forumers, this is juz personal opinion for your info hoping to aid your choice. CHEERS! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

It's due to too tight a grip on the ball.<br><br>Wish you luck in getting rid of this bad habit <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
