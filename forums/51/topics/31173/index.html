            <div class='col-md body'>A Taipei helicopter spinner ball will move forward as near the target (pin 1) it will back up into the 1,3 pocket. It need to move away from the stack rather than towards the centre of the deck to give the desirable pin actions. Traditional western spinner is different from the T-H spinner as it will hook a little when near the target. Western spinners (rare or extinct?) used a heavier ball of up to 16lb, whereas 90% Taipei spinners used no heavier than 12lb. If you paste a tracer sticker on the ball you will be able to observe the differences in axis between the two techniques and why on ball backup while another hook even though both spins.  Any comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Before the semi roller become predominent, in the Western bowling world, Western pple have their own spinner style, at that time considered is the most effective style, because many winners used that style at that time. Read the book 101 bowling mistakes, it will tell you more. Western spinner (I call it) is basically like doing a hook ball with your releasing hand on a position more above the ball. As a hook ball player to try to do a spinner, likehood is that you will see a Western spinnner. A spinning ball that hook. I am just here to discuss, as I am also learning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe wat Asiaspin is saying the style that many pple mistakenly do... its the common topping of the ball. if a hook ball bowler tops the ball over ( turns too much or thumb is a later type of release) the result is a low track type ball that skids much longer and hooks in at the end. its not really a western spinner, more like a low track hook ball. examples of such bowlers are Jack Wong, Jae, Prataman and i tink u do too Ding.<br><br>the topping of the ball can be used to great effect but the equipment u use must be lane specific or u might leave alot of pin 5s. its a simple consistant style that, wif the right carry, is rather powerful in effect.</div>

Very very small track type of spinner ball is not effective, I also think the spinner delivery to a ring -like track is not correct, also this type of delivery will not be smooth and consistent. The delivery of the Asian versus Western spinner style is definitely not the same. Given the same ball, the tracks created by the two different spinner delivery will be on different portions of the ball.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The term "western spinner" is an oxymoron.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>As pointed out before, this is simply a name the author uses to denote a bowler with a very low track. Before the Urethane era of bowling balls, the extremely rare number of players who could hook rubber balls had to impart tremendous amounts of torque to the balls combined with a very low track to create the area we know as "hook". With today's equipment, a low track is actually not necessary. It simply looks like the ball is spinning.<br><br>I won't even compare the two styles because they are two different forms of technique. It's hook versus spin. If only because of the terminology used by a certain author causes some perceived similarity, but that's deceiving.<br><br>I don't know if there is a name for a low-track bowler. But a tweener refers to someone who is half-strokes and half-cranks the ball.<br><br>Hook bowler progression in terms of power:<br>Stroker --&gt; Tweener --&gt; Power player (crank)</div>
