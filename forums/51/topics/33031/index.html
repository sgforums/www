            <div class='col-md body'>Just a little background for the 4 of you playing next week,<br><br>Next week's opponents, Capital Lane, are mostly made up of Malays. Relatively speaking, they are weak, with the exception of 1 or 2 of them. They are in the bottom 3 of the league, I believe. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>So... important to get to a good start so that you can apply early pressure on them and force them to make good shots to beat you.
