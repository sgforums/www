            <div class='col-md body'>Okie dokies, folks!<br><br>Here's an update of the team standings after 8 weeks. There is going to be a week lull period thanks (or no thanks, rather) to Vesak Day, and hostilites with the other teams can only resume on 9 Jun as a result. So I thought this would be a good time to check out our progress.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TEAM STATS</strong></span><br><br><strong>Team points: 86.5 (about 10.8 pts won per session)<br>Highest points won: 17.5 (Wk 4 vs LCS Novena)<br>Lowest points won: 6 (Wk 3 vs Infinity)</strong><br><br>We're above passing mark, which is a good sign. We haven't gotten exactly as much points as we would have liked against the "weaker" teams, but I believe it's been cancelled out by the fact that we managed to hold our own against the big boys as well, without getting blown out.<br><br><strong>Current league position: 7th</strong><br><br>X-Treme Ace is on 8th with 81 pts, just 5.5 pts in arrears, and Simple is on 6th with 92 pts, also just 5.5 pts ahead. That can easily change with a very good or poor result, but our target of finishing in the top 6 after the first leg is definitely not out of reach.<br><br><strong>Team total (scr): 16599 (avg 172.9 per game overall)</strong><br><br>This is a solid improvement over recent leagues. We are above 170 on average every game, which hasn't really happened in other leagues we have participated in. Keep up the good work, and 175 really isn't impossible either.<br><br><strong>Highest team game (Scr): 586</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Wk 2 - Michelle, Mage, David / Wk 8 - Jae, David, Joo Hian)</span><br><br><strong>Highest team total (Scr): 2175 </strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(Wk 7 - WX, Jae, Hayden)</span><br><br>I like the fact that we are still setting highs as we go along, which goes to show that we improve with each passing week.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INDIVIDUAL STATS</strong></span><br><br><strong>Current averages (Handicap) (Sessions Bowled)</strong><br><br>Joo Hian: 189.4 (0) - 2 sessions<br>David: 186.8 (2) - 3 sessions<br>Kevin: 183.0 (3) - 2 sessions<br>Hayden: 171.0 (9) - 3 sessions<br>Michelle (F): 167.8 (15) - 1 session<br>Steven: 166.7 (2) - 3 sessions<br>Weixiang: 166.4 (12) - 4 sessions<br>Jae (C): 165.8 (12) - 5 sessions<br>Ignatius: 163.5 (13) - 1 session<br><br>High series: 797 (Joo Hian), 779 (David), 743 (Kevin)<br>High game: 234 (David), 230 (Joo Hian), 227 (Kevin)<br><br>I must say that the addition of Joo really made up for the lack of anchor material in the squad. His consistency on the lanes cannot be overstated, because it provides a security base for the other bowlers to perform.<br><br>The team has generally gelled well together despite the presence of a couple new faces and also a new style or 2 (eh Hayden?) ... Looking forward to the next session, YEE HAA!<br><br>Expect the next update after session 11 or 12... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well done team! Thank you Prata for a detailed info on our team progress! Surely it will guide us to greater heights in time to come! Sure great to have Joo Hian <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  in our lineup and Prata  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> is doing very well rite now too.<br>Mage is going to be more "available" coz of his completion of his "BMT" again....hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>Really glad to know that our avg game point is &gt; 170 per game.

And i will still be spinning throughout for this season till i'm really 100% "hook" fit. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br>Hope members do understand tat.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> But no matter wat, I think tat this season we're more established in team formation with new faces and styles, namely Joo Hian (R hook), Michelle (R Hook) and Steven (L Spin) and Hayden ( new R spin).<br>So lets keep our heads up and ROCK though this season with a "BANG!"<br>More or less 1st round we're done with the "big boys" of the league and did fairly well against them . Now wat we need to do is to bowl well against  the rest of the teams and try not to let out to many simple points away to our opponents.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi members! Well we had a good start i should say, but credits to the members playing. Simple fielded two strong bowlers for their 2nd and 3rd bowler slots. Tink our members did very well against them. Steven came through with good performance to boost the team <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> . Joo Hian came and shook off a thumb injury to be back in action and played well too. Prata continued his fine run of good form to lead us, now being the member with the lowest hcp!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Next week tough opponents ahead with table toppers elite eBowler! So lets ROCK on DudeS@  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
