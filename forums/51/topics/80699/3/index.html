            <div class='col-md body'>So we are against Spook Angels next week, who is a secondary team to spook demons. So they will probably know us inside out. I just saw the CSC website and i guess they may send their strongest bowler next week. His avg is higher than mine, so to gain points from their anchor will be 50-50. Their next 2 bowlers might be ppl with hcp of 10-15. So in that scenerio, we just have to work harder to overcome those handicap. But if they send bowlers whose handicap are twice of us, then we have to work Doubly harder.<br><br>So this is what i'm proposing: Forget all our individual battles. Dun ever think u have to win yr opposite opponent. Rather we will cocentrate on team points. mind you, at the end of the day; that is worth 5 points. So the responsibility of the 1st and 2nd bowler is to help minmise the total team pinfall gap as low as possible, so that the anchor will cover the remainder.Convert yr spares, don't be frustrate of not striking in the last frame. We can't play the league if we have to rely on the anchor to cover for all. It must be a collective work; teamwork in short. never mind we lost all our individual games. At the end of the day as long as we win the team total, we would have won 5 pts. the rest are all bonus.<br><br>lastly, against teams that have higher handicap than us; that would make us favourites than underdogs. Mentally, it may be quite a burden. So let us put that aside and concentrate on team score. I believe that helps to ease some pressure in indiv games.<br><br>Enjoy the game, team-mates!<br><br></div>

I am glad that u all are still very active. Jae, remember the Black Ice I got frm u? Bowl till the bridge cracked in three places, even thought I was like bowling once in 2 months. I was wondering when it will actually break off! Guess I wun be able to qualify for league, since the standard is much higher then previous! Looking 4ward to bowling wif u all again. U cannot imagine the excitment and tension I felt as I went through the threads. It's like when I shot my 1st 200 game.

            <div class='col-md body'>dun worry guys, i have done a research and analysis, and have come up with this theory with regards to the loss of points these few weeks...<br>but let us ask ourselves (me included, cos i'm guilty of this too..): have we been bowling and practising frequently, either by ourselves or with friends?<br>i guess most of us are not, cos the last few times that we bowled together, our league position are still very okie, and we managed to hit a higher team game avg as compared to these few wks... so the bottom line is, just bowl more often, as simple as that. =)<br>i'll try to do more postings to arrange for more get-together kinda bowling sessions, but do hope that more of us will be interested to be involved, yah?<br><br>anyway, for next wk, this will be the tentative lineup:<br><br>hayden<br>jae<br>prataman</div>

We have to set aside some time for practice, which is of course easier said than done, thanks to our work schedules.<br><br>What to do?

He hit scores of 189, 179, 195 and 225, ripping our poor prata and dipped him in curry...  no worries, hope prata recovers and gets his sweet revenge!<br><br>As for me, i was kinda erratic lately, as wad our FOS CAP said, we need to play more than just leagues once or twice a month. scores were 173, 192, 164 and 196, gaining us 4 pts.. opponent's score was 131, 157, 188 and 161. Guess he was injured too?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, all the best in the upcoming match, we can get back up there again. GO FOS!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi AK<br>We're Team F.O.S , comprising of 20-30 yrs old bowlers. We're currently playing in the Planet Bowl Trios League (Tuesday). Some of us have other leagues as well, but for now , Team F.O.S is participating in one league. Interesting league as the weekly results are posted on line officially at www.csc.gov.sg . This is the only alley in S'pore who place league info on line . Check it out!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>How abt you? : )  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Power Torq,<br><br>I see. You guys joined the league at CSC club. Think they are changing their venue soon ritez .... think no longer at tessohon side ???<br><br>For myself, I joined the monday trios and wednesday foursome leagues at Yishun Safra. Most of us are in our mid 20s ..<br><br>We are still learning how to improve our bowing as a whole and we usually practice at yishun safra as most of us stay in the north.<br><br>Victor's got pretty dry lanes ritez ? We were there on Sat and more often than not, my ball hits 1-3 pocket instead of the 1-2 pocket (I am a left hander).<br><br>Anyway, always good to hear there are ppl around our age range playing league bowling rather than the usual ah peks .. heheheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Cheers<br>A K<br><br></div>
