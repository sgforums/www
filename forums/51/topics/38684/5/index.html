            <div class='col-md body'>Interesting. That, raises another point. Appointment of team captains. Since HanZzZzZ is already the captain of Team Hanz Dynasty, Prataman is the captain of the katong league team, both Airgrinder and Chee35 had already went about their captain tour, guess the appointments are open to the rest of the members. No hurry, have to fill up the members first.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Do we have three bowlers at least who want to play for points and can play every week barring an accident? The minimum is two such bowlers for the team so that the one or two remaining places can be rotated. That way, it'll be much easier to arrange ALL attendances.<br><br>The play-for-fun team is much more relaxing to play in, Player1. It's important to have some league experience under one's belt. Or some others may just relish the team atmosphere that league play provides but not the stress that may come with the expectation of scoring well week-in and week-out.<br><br>Hence the two groups. I know Hanz and Prata understand this. But it's been brought up that the "experience" team may outscore the "points" team. That is entirely possible. There may be people who can play very well, but simply not interested in the dogfight of league play. While some want points all the time, but don't have the ability to match. That's why I want to group according to people's goals. If their goals and what they are told to do clashes, then motivating them may be a huge problem.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

When against the top team and if there is no chance, put the about 2 bowlers with very high handicap so that if luck is on our side it would be our advantage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Sad to mention that unless its a scratch league, everyone always "tar lek" their average to gain handicap.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>That's from my few years of experience.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Finally when is the details going to be finalized <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unless we plan to come up with strategy planning every week to use the handicap to our advantage, otherwise, most of us will just bowl and don't think so much.<br>You could have above avg players sandbag (but still win) and use them for their handicap purposes, but i don't recommend this.<br>What everyone else can do is even if our handicap is lower than our opponents, then put in a higher scratch pinfall every game lor.<br></div>
