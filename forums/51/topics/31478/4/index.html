They requested us to change our tourney timing, and I'll do my best to help them lah. Therefore we will move it from the original 3:30pm slot to about 6:30/7pm starting time.<br><br>Most of you would have gotten an SMS from me, and some of you have already confirmed that you are able to participate on the new timings. It is tentatively set at 6:30 pm - 7pm, I will inform you separately once the timing is confirmed.<br><br>For those who haven't confirmed whether you can make it, I hope to hear from you asap.<br><br>For the couple of you who definitely cannot make it at the new evening timing, I am really very sorry, did not expect such a thing to happen.</div>

When I come back later I'll post which lanes you're on.<br><br>2) We have a final number of 28 participants, over 12 lanes.<br><br>3) We have reduced the number of games to 5. We realise that people get damn shack after 5 games, and since it starts at 7pm, we thought it may be a better idea to reduce the number of games so as to finish a bit earlier.<br><br>4) Cost per head is now $27.<br><br>5) Top 5 qualifiers will continue on to the.

            <div class='col-md body'>5 games is still better than nothing. I'll like more, though. Perhaps next time IF we do this again, Jackie's should give us a free game since all this started with their screw-up.<br><br>P1<br><br>It's 3M decorative tape. Thomas said that it's very rare. Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Food at jackie's IS good, fish head curry comes highly recommended. Eh, since it's <span style="font-style: italic;">their</span> fault that the tourney got pushed back, i don't think it'll be asking too much if a TV was provided for to catch the match. Yah it's FA cup, but... Arsenal vs Man Utd! Hello!?!</div>
