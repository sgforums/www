            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Forumites, friends, bowlers.<br><br>I'm toying with the idea of organising a tournament in January for the Forum. I suppose you can consider this as a continuation of the good work Jordan has put in for the previous tourneys.<br><br>I've worked out a few details and basically have a skeletal structure of how it will work. I will need your inputs, people, let's make this work together.<br><br>I'm thinking of holding it at Jackies Bowl on the 26th of January 2003. As for timing, we can decide a bit later, depending on availability of bowlers. First of all, it'll be 2 weeks after the Classic tourney and also before CNY. Jackies Bowl has great lanes, and great food to boot. And a nice viewing area..... I will call the alley tomorrow to ask about exact prices and chances for any package deal, but I will need more info from u folks first.<br><br>The format will be as follows. All bowlers will bowl a block of 6 games. Bowlers will change lanes during the course of the 6 games, how many times will be dependent on how many bowlers there are.<br><br>Following that, there will be a playoffs series to determine the overall champion. Based on a minimum of 12 participants, the top 6 bowlers will take part in the playoffs. Should there be more participants, it will only be fair to have up to 10 or even 12 playoff bowlers. But that will depend on the response. Each pair of lanes will ideally have 4-6 bowlers.<br><br>Let's give a rough format of the playoffs. Based on 12 participants, the top 6 bowlers will progress to the playoffs. The top 2 qualifiers will have a first round bye. On the bottom bracket, the 3rd place will face off with the 6th place, and the winner will face of with the 2nd place qualifier. In the other bracket, the winner of the 4th and 5th placed bowlers will face the 1st place bowler. The winner of each bracket will face each other to determine the winner. The playoff is purposely kept short (just 5 games in 3 rds). Furthermore, each round would be played concurrently, so as to further minimise waiting time. We certainly don't want those who did not qualify to head home straightaway.<br><br>Prizes and cost. I've put these 2 together because, the size of the prizes obviously depends on number of participants. And furthermore, being held on a weekend, games are more expensive as usual as well. We're looking at a possible 25 - 30 dollars per head for 6 games. (considering that each game would be about 3 dollars plus) We have to add in the cost of the playoffs and prizes into the fees per head.<br><br>Important thing is also to note, this is mainly for the forumites. Otherwise we can't call it a forum tourney.<br><br>Ok.... after all that is said and done....<br><br>--------------------------------------------------<br><br><strong>Date: Sunday, January 26th, 2003, Time TBA.<br>Location: Jackies Bowl, Katong<br>Format: Block of 6, followed by 3 round playoffs.</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Cost: Based on 12 bowlers, 30 per head will give us about 80 dollars worth of prizes. 25 will give us just 20 dollars of prizes. More than 12 bowlers = more prizes, more fun.</span><br><br>Think about it, if we can somehow get 32 bowlers, prize money will shoot to about 220 bucks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>So... WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE THINK?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....<br><br>Just confirmed with Jackies Bowl. The best possible timing would be on Saturday evening, any time. Sunday afternoon also can, about after 2-3pm, but that have to book pretty early. Price wise will remain the same, although they have agreed to slash about 15 cents per game <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> So.... $30 per head for the event, 6 games, plus any playoff games should you qualify.<br><br>They will be willing to make scoresheets and all that, the usual. So no worries there.<br><br>Just things to note, I need a show of hands:<br><br>1) I understand that it MAY be difficult, because taking part in the Classic Bowl, THEN taking part in the NUS/SIM tourney, THEN taking part in this tourney will be a heavy toll, since it is going to be consecutive weeks. For you SIM and NUSers, will this be a problem, please? Let me know ASAP.<br><br>2) All said and done, who will be able to play, and will be willing to join the tourney if it would be held on Saturday night, 25th January?<br><br>3) Comments please. Thanks. SIMers, esp?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An encouraging numbers of participants i must say.<br><br>Since our very own prataman organise this tourny, of course must give him some support mar. I shan't disclose the support yet, but i can assure the participants that their $30 bucks will be worthwhile. I'm trying to get some support as prizes from companies but i doubt i  can get any cash support. most likely it will be in the form of gifts. Well, better than nothing right? How prataman want to distribute the stuffs, i leave it to him. Currently i trying to push as many as possible so that all the participants can get something. Will inform u all soon.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With the latest inputs and after discussion within the committee comprising of Deamon, Jordan and myself, we have decided to push back the date of the tourney to after Chinese New Year.<br><br>That way won't be close to the previous tournaments, people are probably richer too <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>The following information is "tentatively confirmed". I will be proceeding to book 10 lanes tomorrow.<br><br>TOURNAMENT DETAILS<br><br>Location: Jackies Bowl, Katong<br>Date: 15th Feb, Saturday afternoon<br>Time: Check in 3:25 pm, Begin warm up 3:45pm. Roll off 3:55 pm.<br>Please be on time, we will begin warmup regardless of whether everyone has arrived. Damn sian to wait for ppl also, right?<br><br>Format: 6 game block followed by playoffs. Ladies are entitled to 10 pin handicap per game, 60 for 6 games. Handicap of 10 pins will ALSO be given to ladies in the playoffs.<br><br>Number of playoff qualifiers, and number of playoff games depends on number of contestants. The top qualifier will receive an advantage in the playoff (bye, etc. To Be Advised also).<br><br>Price: 30 bucks per head.<br>Prizes: TBA. the more people the higher the prizes. Haven't decided on playoff format, so prize distribution not confirmed. Suffice to say there will be at least 6-8 prize slots. (for winner, runner up and top few qualifiers) High game will also be awarded a prize.<br><br>Estimated finish time around 7pm, so we can all have a nice meal at Jackies Bowl. Yum!<br><br>-----------------------------------------------<br><br>Confirmed contestants please let me know on this thread asap.<br>Ding, please rope in Brendan and WX. Let's drag in as much forumites as possible. I have Jordan, myself, Kazan and Jay Soong already in.</div>
