The animal cried piteously for hours as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve the donkey.<br><br>So he invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first,the donkey realised what was happening and cried horribly. Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieten down. A few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished at what he saw.<br><br>With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing something amazing. He would shake it off and take a step up. As the farmer's neighbours continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it<br>off and take a step up. Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and trotted off!<br><br>Moral: Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt. The trick to getting out of the well is to shake it off and take a step up. Each of our troubles is a stepping stone. We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off and take a step up!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys, saw this elsewhere. Good to share......<br><br>Growing Up... Or Growing Old ?<br>The first day of school our professor introduced himself and<br>challenged us to get to know someone we didn't already know.<br>I stood up to look around when a gentle hand touched my shoulder. I turned around to find a wrinkled, little old lady<br>beaming up at me with a smile that lit up her entire being.<br>She said, "Hi handsome. My name is Rose. I'm eighty-seven years old.<br>Can I give you a hug?"<br>I laughed and enthusiastically responded, "Of course you may!" and she gave me a giant squeeze.<br>Why are you in college at such a young, innocent age?" I asked. She jokingly replied, "I'm here to meet a rich husband, get married, have a couple of children, and then retire and travel."<br>No seriously," I asked. I was curious what may have motivated her to<br>be taking on this challenge at her age.<br>I always dreamed of having a college education and now I'm getting<br>one!" she told me.<br>After class we walked to the student union building and shared a<br>chocolate milkshake. We became instant friends.<br>Every day for the next three months we would leave class together and talk nonstop.<br>I was always mesmerized listening to this "time machine" as she shared her wisdom and experience with me.<br>Over the course of the year, Rose became a campus icon and she easily made friends wherever she went. She loved to dress up and she reveled in the attention bestowed upon her from the other students. She was living it up.<br>At the end of the semester we invited Rose to speak at our football<br>banquet. I'll never forget what she taught us.<br>She was introduced and stepped up to the podium. As she began to<br>deliver her prepared speech, she dropped her three by five cards on the floor.<br>Frustrated and a little embarrassed she leaned into the microphone and simply said "I'm sorry I'm so jittery. I gave up beer for Lent and this whiskey is killing me! I'll never get my speech back in order so let me just tell you what I know."<br><br>As we laughed she cleared her throat and began:<br>"We do not stop playing because we are old; we grow old because we stop playing.<br>There are only four secrets to staying young, being happy, and<br>achieving success.<br>You have to laugh and find humor everyday.<br>You've got to have a dream. When you lose your dreams, you die.<br>We have so many people walking around who are dead and don't even know it!<br>There is a huge difference between growing older and growing up. If you are nineteen years old and lie in bed for one full year and don't do one productive thing, you will turn twenty years old. If I am eighty-seven years old and stay in bed for a year and never do anything I will turn eighty-eight. Anybody can grow older. That doesn't take any talent or ability.<br>The idea is to grow up by always finding the opportunity in change.<br>Have no regrets. The elderly usually don't have regrets for what we<br>did, but rather for things we did not do. The only people who fear death are those with regrets."<br>She concluded her speech by courageously singing "The Rose." She challenged each of us to study the lyrics and live them out in our daily lives.<br>At the years end Rose finished the college degree she had begun all those years ago. One week after graduation Rose died peacefully in her sleep.<br>Over two thousand college students attended her funeral in tribute to the wonderful woman who taught by example that it's never too late to be all you can possibly be.<br><br>If you read this, please send this peaceful word of advice to your<br>friends and family, they'll really enjoy it! We send these words in<br>loving memory of ROSE.<br><br>Remember, GROWING OLDER IS MANDATORY, GROWING UP IS OPTIONAL.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, got this good read from Commonality Corner.........<br><br>Subject: Your Inspiration: The Trouble Tree<br><br>I hired a plumber to help me restore an old farmhouse, and after he had just finished a rough first day on the job, a flat tire made him lose an hour of work &amp; his electric drill quit, his ancient one ton truck refused to start.<br><br>As I drove him home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving he invited me in to meet his family. As we walked toward the front door,<br>he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches<br>with both hands.<br><br>Upon opening the door he had undergone an amazing transformation. His tanned face was wreathed in smiles and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss.<br><br>Afterward he walked me to the car. We passed the tree and my curiosity got the better of me.<br>I asked him about what I had seen him do at the little tree. "Oh, that's my trouble tree," he replied. "I know I can't help having<br>troubles on the job, but one thing's for sure, those troubles don't belong in the house with my wife and the children.<br>So I just hang them up on the tree every night when I come home and ask God to take care of them.<br><br>Then in the morning I pick them up again." Funny thing is," he smiled, "when I come out in the morning to pick them up, there aren't nearly as many as I remember hanging up the night before."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Though most of us haven't start a family yet, but it's good to keep this story in mind.<br><br>Remember that most of our worries in Life won't happen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And that the most regretful things in our lifes are usually things that we didn't have the chance or afraid to do/attempt and not not things that we did.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is contributed by Xavier on the Commonality Corner...... cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Mrs Jones is 92 years old, petite, well-poised, and proud. She is fully<br>dressed each morning by eight o'clock, with her hair fashionably coifed, and her makeup perfectly applied, in spite of the fact she is legally blind.<br><br>Today she has moved to a nursing home. Her husband of 70 years recently passed away, making this move necessary.<br><br>After many hours of waiting patiently in the lobby of the nursing home, where I am employed, she smiled sweetly when told her room was ready. As she maneuvered her walker to the elevator, I provided a visual description of her tiny room, including the eyelet curtains that had been hung on her window.<br><br>"I love it," she stated with the enthusiasm of an eight-year-old having just been presented with a new puppy.<br><br>"Mrs. Jones, you haven't seen the room...just wait," I said. Then she spoke these words that I will never forget:"That does not have anything to do with it," she gently replied.<br><br>"Happiness is something you decide on ahead of time. Whether I like my room or not does not depend on how the furniture is arranged. It is how I arrange my mind. I have already decided to love it. It is a decision I make every morning when I wake up. I have a choice. I can spend the day in bed recounting the difficulty I have with the parts of my body that no longer work, or I can get out of bed and be thankful for the ones that do work.<br><br>Each day is a gift, and as long as my eyes open, I will focus on the new day and all of the happy memories I have stored away...just for this time in my life. Old age is like a bank account. You withdraw from what you have already put in."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> so guys &amp; gals, store up on your bank account now so that u'll have lots to draw on later in life.
