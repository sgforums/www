            <div class='col-md body'>My view that pin action depends more significantly on the ball and the lanes than the bowlers release, spd, rev rate...etc.<br><br>I remembered reading an article by some PBA player or coach that the most important factor is the hardness of the ball, and the core construction. The softer the ball, the higher pin action. Different construction affects how the ball "rubs" the pins at the instant it touches them. Of course, in this case the roughness of the coverstock plays apart. Have u realised why all other factors being the same, some balls keep striking in the pocket and some keep leaving 2-10, 4-10, 9s, 8s even if they hit in the pocket? This example can be see at bowlingballreviews site where they tests different balls. Some balls tend to strike better than others.<br><br>I also realised that the pin action from a polyster is not as explosive as that from a rubber ball. Well, maybe for this case I can't fully justify cause I throw both my bowling balls differently.<br><br>Well, I do not know if these are true, as the hardcore bowler always says "If u can't strike, don't blame anything else but yourself," But I think we have come to an age that technology plays such an important part, even hardcore sayings have to side-step.<br><br>Open for comments and violent objections. I had only been bowling for only a year and a half. Please correct if i'm wrong.<br><br>rdgs<br><br>------------------<br>Â“Losers quit when they're tired.

            <div class='col-md body'>from personal experience, i tink release is an important factor. i am using a comand zone.. my regular shots on a dryer lane would result in flat pockets or less carry, but when i break the wrist more and change the angle of my wrist, the ball goes into a sharper more skidded shot, thus creating much more pin action. technology is great, but it also depends on the bowler. imagine.. a bowler wif 4-5 revs and slow speed... wif a say... CommandArc Zone, the balls great... the bowlers is not.. wat pin action could there be? just a thought... feel free to debate.. i need the feedback too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, some of you know this was coming, so here goes...<br><br>[font colour=#FF3300 size=4]WARNING: This post contains long content. Proceed at your own risk.[/font]<br><br>Well, before i set off, i have a couple of things to make clear. Firstly, i personally do not use the terminology 'pin action' to describe anything other than kickbacks, pin deflections and messengers/scouts. THerefore, i assume (if i lost the plot, please correct me) that for heavy ball bowlers, the question of this thread is "How to carry".<br>As people know, the heavy ball bowlers strike consists of only ball-pin contact with the pins 1-3-5-9 (Those of you who don't know, start another thread on this). <strong>Lefties, sorry. Just reverse everything you read in this post.  :p</strong> That means that the only 'pin actions' necessary for a strike are practically idiot-proof once proper 1-3 pocket is made. If the pocket is hit without a strike as a result, there exists a lack of "carry".<br>Secondly, I think the only people who should be concerned about 'pin action' are spinners, because that is what gets them the strikes. Their ball doesn't so much carry as deflect. This isn't meant to knock spinners, because there are very good ones out there. I'm just trying to explain my standpoint so readers to this can understand what i'm dishing out later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>Alright... now for the good part:<br><br>As i've said, carry is the only thing a heavy ball bowler should concern him/herself with as far as strikes (or large pocket spares are concerned), because relying on messengers and lively sideboards is never reliable, to say the least. IMO, there are 3 main factors to carry:<br>1) Weight<br>2) Angle<br>3) Friction<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Weight</span><br>Weight, unfortunately for those who have been trying to convince themselves that lighter doesn't mean less, does matter. Mostly, the difference between 15lbs and 16lbs is negligible. 14lbs suffers a little, while anything below that is not too good due to the design and composition of the weight block. But weight is a factor in carry not because of the weight block (which affects angle), but simply because of deflection. As heavy ball bowlers know (if you don't, start another thread), deflection kills carry - because it spoils the 1-3-5-9 chain. Simple physics dictate that more mass is harder to move. That's it. Still follow me? Good. Next factor...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Angle</span><br>Angle is the reason why people like myself try week-in and week-out to "Do the twist" and make a plastic sphere move in an arc instead of a straight line. A straight ball will defect more than a ball which enters at an angle, destroying the 1-3-5-9 thingy again. Different people have different optimum angles. Recall your friend who can carry with a light pocket but you end up with corner pins. This is because of different aspects of each person. Heavier ball, more grip on impact, etcetera.<br>Basically, angle is the reason why a lot of people think revolutions are important to bowling. I don't think so. Revs are important to selling balls, that's all. Revolutions help the ball turn, because a ball hooks when its core is trying to return to a stable state (if you don't know... ). And it does this by slowly shifting a little with each revolution - hence flare tracks. Thus a ball with more revs 'refreshes' its cover quicker than others, all else being equal. This is why<br>Revolutions = More turn at breakpoint =Angle<br>But with the core technology today, simple pin placement will produce the same effect for the rev-challenged (dun understand? you know what to do).<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friction</span><br>Friction, also known as grip, is crucial for one thing - energy.<br>Friction levels over 60 ft of lane surface affects energy levels retained in the ball. Energy is needed for everything - break, hook, roll... And the less of it one has left at the pocket, the  more deflection there will be.<br>Friction also affects angle like this:<br>Friction = Turn @ breakpoint = Angle<br>Friction is affected by the hardness rating of the cover, which is brought up by Airgrinder. Although i do not agree with the quote. I suspect it's a misquote from the article. The hardness of the cover affects how much bite a ball has on the lanes (softer = more bite; vice-versa), which determines how much angle there is. Some people do not carry with soft covers, because the ball bites so hard, it expends too much energy <span style="font-style: italic;">getting to the pocket</span>. This results in deflection off the headpin, which gives very designer-looking split/spare combinations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>As for the point about using a rubber vs. a plastic ball is not representative because the grip levels of the balls aren't equal. Sometimes, more grip = more carry, sometimes, the opposite happens.<br><br>That's my 2 cents. 3 factors for carry. Please note that most other things trace back to these 3 key factors (much like how all colours are derived from 3 primary colours). A point to note is speed. Technology is so advanced nowadays that speed control is the number one priority now, mainly because of friction. Coverstocks are now so aggressive, a little earlier or later in the pocket makes a world of difference to your carry percentage. Other than that, I would refute the notion that the technology is the determinant for carry. Afterall, the only true "tap" or "chop" in bowling is the solid pin 8 or 9, regardless of which hand one plays with (this is why PBA player Pete Weber is so famous - his ball has too much carry - he leaves the highest percentage of solid 9s on tour than anybody else).<br><br>Left a corner pin on your last shot? Don't look around. It's you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm...doesnt explain why my 12 pound dead core and moon crater surface DZone gives me a wonderful strike on dryer lanes. in fact... i would say it gives a nicer sound when it strikes than some bowlers i know out there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ian<br>All carry is traced back to a few main factors. With a light ball, one can impart enough revolutions to produce more angle. This angle in turn may or may not offset the disadvantage in weight that effectively increases chances of deflection. Also, your ball retains almost all of its energy because its cover hardly expends any, let alone your high ball speed. All factors taken, it may work now, but odds tend to even themselves out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Most of us know that by now.<br><br>airgrinder<br>I love the RPG thingy!

            <div class='col-md body'>I do agree with Harmy!!<br><br>Carry is everything. You can have the prettiest and flashiest hook ball. You can have the fastest ball. You can have a 20 lb.. err no you can't have that. You can hit dead flush in the pocket, but still leave a stone cold 8, or even worse, a seemingly impossible 8-10 or even 7-10.<br><br>I think it's about getting the right amount of skid, reading the mid lane and finally getting the optimum breakpoint. Break too early, you run the risk of rolling out. Break too late, well, say hello to Mr. Washout, or worse.<br><br>In order to do that, I think the most important thing is the "explosion" point, which is the release point. At that moment in time, the body must be stable and well balanced, and all the energy that is stored and built up during the approach is expended at that one moment. Everything before the release (the steps, swing, EVERYTHING) leads to that one defining moment that determines if your ball will destroy the rack or splatter like butter against a brick wall.<br><br>Of course that goes back to the individual bowler's speed as well as release at rotation, not to mention the ball itself! The correct ball, with the APPROPRIATE cover and core and drilling for the APPROPRIATE bowler for the APPROPRIATE lanes!<br><br>I suppose that's what makes bowling such an fun sport to play!! Every bowler, however slow/fast/strong/style can make it work for them, if they are properly equipped with the correct knowledge and equipment! It sure looks easy throwing a ball down the lane at first, doesn't it? But try taking all 10 down time after time....different story baby.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 07 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i ALWAYS have trouble with that stability at the line thing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> more often than i would like to admit, my poor games are punctuated by a lack of stability.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Harmy! Online together again, I see.<br><br>Well, I use a "check list" to try to make sure I do the same things every time. Well, normally for me "something has to happen before something else happens". Let's see if I can give an example or two.<br><br>Ok, let's see... my pushaway can only occur after my right foot (first step for me, second step for you) moves just beyond the ball. Urm... my downswing does not begin until my final step is about to be taken. Hmm.... I make sure my left foot is already well planted before my ball passes the vertical axis, below my knee and out onto the lane.<br><br>You know, little personal checklists that make sure a sequence is followed such that the body HAS to (hopefully, heh heh) do the same thing everytime on the delivery. Of course, stuff like sticky approaches are out of our control.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanx for the advice praty!  :p<br>I do have that list too. My problems come because for different releases and results, i often have to change something. It's the resultant change in timing that I have yet to grasp. Here's an example of my own:<br><br>Suppose I require more revolutions on a say, flooded condition, I would need to create more leverage. Often, I speed up the shot (hold pocket line), bend lower and bend my elbows more to get my hand further under the ball. This, as you can imagine, changes the timing - legs and arms have to move quicker, but does the pushaway start earlier or later? And the balance at the line is bad because I rarely can get my full force behind the ball at the right micro-second. Most of the time, the action imparted to the ball is adequate, but I know that I can't go on like that all the time.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Talking about stability, a couple of friends said my timing is very unorthodox. My approach is 5-step. Think the standard way is to take one step, then pushaway on the 2nd. The ball should be at the highest point in the backswing on the second last step. I pushaway on the first step. My ball is at its highest point in the backswing at the third last step. My feet then rush forward two steps to the slide. In this way, I can chose to (a) kick my right leg all the way back and left but on the ground, (b) right leg up, (c) right leg slightly to the back-left. Both (a) and (b) exerts high stress on the left knee. (c) is more forgiving on the knees, as the mind reminds the body to lean slightly back, distributing more body weight on the right. Not skillful and knowledgable enough to determine the effects it causes, yet.<br>Used (a) most of the time, dun know good or bad, but seems to be working well for me most of the time.<br><br>------------------<br>Â“Losers quit when they're tired.
