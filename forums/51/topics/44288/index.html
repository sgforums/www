But after I went out for a quick breath of fresh smoke, I told myself to buck up. Which I did...above all, I think most of it is mental and partly consistency for all throws and lane adjustments.<br><br>Congrats to all who won and we did our best, Forum bowlers! Nexdt month we should try again, because although it seems like you are wasting money, but its a good gauge of how much u have improved in 1 mth, and getting a shot at the money pot.<br><br>Cheers! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well,<br><br>It's all about setting target for yourself over the tourney, and then of course followed by exceeding it. Aim for and make a minimum of 175 avg, and you'll get back something for sure. I'm glad I made mine.<br><br>The important thing's to maintain concentration over 8 games, and stay focused on just your own game, since there's so many people around you. One shot at a time, worry about just the next frame, forget the last one, strike or miss.<br><br>It's quite a bit about luck too, I had so many of what Wongsy would term as "sh*t strikes"!! So what else is new?<br><br>But it's a good challenge, no? Thankfully just about everyone (well, almost, anyway) in the Classic Challenge is fun to bowl with. I'm just glad I didn't have Ripleys in our lane... ehhehe probably would have died laughing. He didn't have his usual form though, ended up 33rd.</div>
