            <div class='col-md body'>Cannot survive in the PBA? Only Tim Mack himself will know. But I beg to differ.<br><br>I think he'd RATHER NOT play in the PBA, rather than NOT BEING able to play in the PBA. Reasons?<br><br>Let's look at the money issue. First up, in his latest perfect game in Tampines, his 57th of his competitive career, he chalked up something like $62,000 US for that perfect game. (100k SGD) And I don't know why I'm bringing this up, but he did it with a Storm X-Factor Deuce. And that's just for perfect games. How about winning the tourneys, and he has already won many.<br><br>ONLY starting last year, WINNING a darn PBA tournament only got you something like $40,000 US. Before that, it was less. Now they get 100,000 US for a MAJOR tournament, which is like only 4 times a season, and you have wade through over 200 players to win it.<br><br>Second, I don't know about you, but surely it seems more fun to travel around the world to bowl against all walks of life and people (and styles! Spinners!), play on different lanes, rather than facing the same trash talking, big hooking people in and out every other week. It does help that his best friends are Norwegian and Swedish, and they travel together to conquer the worldwide arena.<br><br>In turn, Tim Mack has more international exposure, and thus a great deal more knowledge and experience playing on international lanes. Think the PBA dudes can best him outside the US? Hard to tell either.<br><br>Any way, I submit my humble opinion that he chooses to retain his "amateur" status, rather than him not being able to battle with the "pros" of the PBA.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i did hear of the remark that tim wouldnt survive in the PBA either. or rather maybe that's a bad choice of words. i tink he would rather a higher chance of winning.<br><br>the main differences in the usa and asia is not really the bowlers but the pins and lane conditions. we are like 3-4 generations behind them in lane oilings and pins (supposedly).<br><br>tim and robert smith were PBA buddies and robert prefered to remain in the PBA. but, how many times do u see him qualify for tv telecasts finals? not many. in fact, not many massive hook players do well in US. maybe thats y he would rather come to asia. he might have found the lanes here more suited to him. and yes, his hook is so violent it gives him more pin action and carry. esp here where the pins are lighter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prataman and Ian are both right.<br><br>I'd like to add that money is the main thing like what Prata has said. If you asked any PBA professional, most of them - if not all - would take a PBA title over a larger winner's cheque any day. The PBA pros know that bowling doesn't pay well. Heck, each season is only what, 4 - 5 months? The rest of the year, most of them have their other jobs like gas station attendant, insurance agent... In other words, the money isn't enough. And i'm talking about those good ones who win often. Some have been on tour for 10 years and still have less than US$100,000 in <span style="font-style: italic;">total</span> earnings.<br><br>PBA is for the titles. It is recognised that way. Why?? The reason is in Ian's post.<br><br>The PBA is much more gruelling than the scores for each bowler accounts for. They face conditions that are far more difficult than regular USA houses and leagues (in the states, many league and recreational bowlers average above 220 - 240). Let alone the rest of the world...  Many amatuers cry foul when they play in the PBA and give up, preferring the ego boost that amatuer tourneys offer.<br><br>All this may not mean that Mack isn't good enough for the PBA. One thing is for sure: he won't be as good as he is in amatuer tourneys. Robert Smith and he travelled together. I've seen them both several times in Singapore. I remembered reading about it when Smith decided to go Pro...<br>Even as amatuers, Smith was the better player. But playing in the PBA has made him even better. He has only two titles (i think) so far, but if you know how he played before he turned pro, you'll be able to see his improvement.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
