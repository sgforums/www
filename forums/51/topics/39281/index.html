            <div class='col-md body'>Normally on my shot, I look at a specific point at the arrows (15 feet) and connect this point to a general "area" at the breakpoint (about 45 feet) and fire away!<br><br>It's advisable to look further down the lane when the lanes are dryer (closer to breakpoint), and look closer (dots) when the lanes are really tight. But I don't follow the latter, because everytime I try to target the dots I feel like I'm going to fall on my face each time I reach the foul line.<br><br>So what do you people normally shoot at? Dots? Arrows?

            <div class='col-md body'>Greeting:<br>OhhH!! It's high time for some bowling technical discussion!<br><br>Current Procedure:<br>Moi used to aim at arrows, I dun look at the general area of the breakpoint. Now, I aim using the dots most of the time. I felt it easier to control the ending part of the downswing (although one should have a free swing blab blab blab...). I do sometimes look at which arrow my ball goes over after my ball goes pass the dot I am aiming at.<br><br>Evalution:<br>One big thing I think I dun always do, which I think is a problem more than a thing and I think it is important is....I look, see, view but dun register the movement of the ball when it is going down the lane. I can throw a chio chio strike, but if someone ask me to describe my shot, I couldnt. I only know where I stand, roughly where my slide ends, and where my target is, but I dun know where my ball breaks. The most I can comment is roughly how much the ball goes out to the right.<br><br>Conclusions:<br>Not good enough.<br><br>Recommendations:<br>Dun know.<br><br>Future Objective:<br>Stand at 45, ball release at 40, ball goes to 5th arrow, ball skids to 2nd board, ball snaps back to pocket.....solid 10.......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me left-hander, so I was told (cant remember who) everything start from left.<br><br>Me stand board 15, target 10 arrow. How I target?<br><br>I use a "snooker" technique, where I look down at my feet, draw the line to the target arrow, hold for 2 secs, look further down the line to the pins, fix gaze for 1 sec, then slowly draw the line back to the arrow. Then I approach, eyes on arrows.<br><br>I think its more or less a feel of the rest. If u feel uncomfortable looking at arrows, improvise. as long as u find urself a t arget which u can consistently throw at, good enough.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I only know how to throw perpendicular to the start line. Anyway, this is how I aimed.<br><br>I start at a position when my bowling shoulder is in line with the centre dot at the foul line and the centre dot on the lane. I gently push the ball forward and downward and let the gravity take over. I observe my timing and steps forward with my bowling shoulder going toward the centre dot at the foul line.

Many books use the arrows as references simply because they are there and most people find them easy to look at.

            <div class='col-md body'>I pose another question to expand on the first one. How do you cahnge targeting strategies during the game? Let's say for a right hookie, she stand at 30 bd aiming at 2nd arrow to get the ball to the pocket. After a while, the line started to case the ball to hook eariler. So what adjustments do you make?<br><br>In respond to Prataman's question, I use the 10-10 line, then 5-5, and try a couple of pin 10 shots. However, due to my "cold engine", I end up throwing at wrong arrow, doing wrong release, etc. Hence the first 5 minutes is for me to get into bowling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Imagine yr muscles are still "cold" and then suddenly take up a 15lbs ball and try to hook the ball. Imagine how much strain on yr shoulders? Eeven if u have warmed up alot, but the transisition frm a hand carrying no ball to one that is preparing to throw a 15lbs ball is simply too much. That's why i never attempt to throw the 1st shot. By throwing a lighter shot and clearing my thumb, i allow my muscles to stretch a bit, but not too much.<br><br>2nd shot, pin 10<br>Standard procedure, stand left and throw. if left to pin 10, means area ard 1st arrow backend is dry. if right of pin 10, gutter oily. I won't throw a strike shot in my 2nd shot as muscles is still a little tense<br><br>3rd shot, pin 7<br>SOP as above<br><br>4th shot<br>Strike shot. usually 2nd arrow as benchmark<br><br>I do all 4 shots on the same lane. If i got both pin7 and 10, there is no need to repeat that on the other lane. So the next 4 shots in the next lane is on strikes. 1st on 2nd arrow, 2shot on outside line of 3 boards, 3rd shot is anyway bet 3rd and 4th arrow and last shot deep left, playing 5th arrow.<br><br>The rest are all calulated guess. So when the game starts, the 1st shot is always my calculted guess of my strike shot. Can strke good. cannot strike, well at least i alrdy know how to spare on this lane. then move again. This time any adjusements are all minor of shifting boards to get the strike shots, until that area can no longer be playable</div>

How do you cahnge targeting strategies during the game? Let's say for a right hookie, she stand at 30 bd aiming at 2nd arrow to get the ball to the pocket. After a while, the line started to case the ball to hook eariler. So what adjustments do you make?<br><br>In respond to Prataman's question, I use the 10-10 line, then 5-5, and try a couple of pin 10 shots. However, due to my "cold engine", I end up throwing at wrong arrow, doing wrong release, etc. Hence the first 5 minutes is for me to get into bowling. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>i feel that changing strategies comes with experience. i mean experience from competitions. generally, no hard and fast rule. Rather each shld go develop their way of changing strategies.<br><br>One greatest barrier is whether if u are willing to come out of the comfort zone. U are playing in yr favoutite area, but after a while obviously that is not going to work anyway. are u willing to make a change or do u still want to carry on?. 2nd issue, if u are willing to change line, how fast are u willing to do that? Its no point when u change it in the 10th frame of the last game.<br><br>When u are willing to do the above, changing lines becomes easier. If u are asking a method to change strategies, i'm afraid i dun have any as i'm still developing mine too. Generally, if my comfort zone is not working, i will use the other 3 shots which i try in the warm up and see which has the best reaction and frm there work out another strike line. For me, i'm still slow in my physical observation of the breaking down of lanes.<br><br>When i was with the sch team, i have a coach and 9 team mates who can help observe if the strike line is working any more. they can help recommend alternatives lines. After all, each of us all play differently, so some will work, some may not. But as an individual now, this task becomes more difficult.........<br></div>

Since I am not playing well, then something has to change, and usually for me, it's the line. It is the second question that I have problem answering. I don't know when to change.

Dun mix a bowling session that is playing with frds and one that is basically on trg. If u are playing with frds, forget abt trg and vice versa. Each trg shld always come with an objective and every session is a gradual learning curve. Normally my tr session with the sch team is to play different lines. we start from spending 30mins on a lane playing different lines, then move to a new lane and play game. As the trg progress further, the time spent on playing different lines shortens till it becomes only 5min that is available to us.<br><br>But then, that is for the team trg. So jordan , if u want to try, set some objectives and work on it. It takes time, and for hook bowlers like us, the learning curve is even longer. But at the end of it all, its worthwhile<br><br>sigh....this year i wasn't in the team.
