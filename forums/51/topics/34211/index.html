            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm....knee cap problem.<br><br>Let me generalise. Knee problem is a very general term. There are a lot of small areas in the knee that might give "knee problems". It depends on what you are talking about. The femur, or thigh bone connects to the knee cartilage, and connects to the tibia, or the big bone in the lower leg. The cartilage acts as a "cushion", by functioning like a sponge. The area around the cartiilage is surrounded by a thick fluid. When a person jumps, and lands on his feet, the weight of his body acts on the thigh bone, pressing down onto the cartilage. Fluid in the cartilage will be squeeze out, just like squeezing soapy water out of a sponge. Due to the high viscosity (thickness) of the fluid, the squeezing out action is slow, giving a cushioning effect. Hence less stress on the lower legs.<br><br>The knee cap (patellar), acts like a "stop block" that prevents a person from bending the knee the opposite way. It is the obstacle to prevent your knee from "flying out". Like the 2 big leg bones in the leg, the knee cap is also covered with cartilage on the contacting surface.<br><br>Glucosamine, or glutamin sulphate, or any of its avaliable forms, are generally useful as a lubricant. As a person ages, or other factors, the cartilage fluid may dry up, damage to the cartilage and the bones itself. The gluc... thing (dun know spelling) lubricates the joints, hence reducing damage to our precious joints.<br><br>However, there are many kind of knee problems. Some might be due to the 4 ligaments (one left, one right, two in the middle, front and back) supporting the knee. Excessive strain on the knee will cause problems to the ligaments, or the site where the ligaments join the bone. Problems with knee ligaments are usually due to blows to the any of the four sides of the knee or any extreme internal rotation. Other knee problems might be caused by the splintering of the bone (similar to artritis, wrong spelling again), where sugery might be required, or some other funny stuff.<br><br>My recommendation is that people should get their knee problems properly identified before deciding on the medication.<br><br>Just my 2 cents. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
