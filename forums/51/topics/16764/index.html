            <div class='col-md body'>I am expressing my objective view, not trying to score point by defending Mr Kwek! It was a good game we had with young &amp; dynamic players from SIM &amp; TP93. The fast drying lanes &amp; all those splits did create much frustration to most of the players. Mr CEO (as Ian named Mr Kwek) was cracking a joke after observing much frustration including one SIM player hiding his face in his folded arms. Mr Kwek was not at all upset as he achieved close to his average of 160. We felt bad for sweeping all trophies home &amp; he simply tried to crack a harmless &amp; casual joke to comfort our young opponents - blame it on the lanes (nothing personal against the centre mgmt).  It's a Saturday afternoon at a bowling centre, not a company AGM, we thot our young friends would be able to appreciate some sense of humour. Give him some credits - how many CEOs of that stature would be people-oriented enough to spare time for a friendly game with young bowlers while most CEOs rather talk business on a golf course.<br><br>[This message has been edited by estheran (edited 05 November 2001).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by estheran (edited 05 November 2001).]</div>

And isn't it most bowlers' dream to work under this kind of boss that support bowling to the extreme.<br>Maybe on our part, we didn't know that it's a joke.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Great competition, hope that I can bowl with the juniors more often.<br><br></div>
