            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Guys, cool it...... as I have said earlier this is but a small misunderstanding.<br><br>Let me summarize what I know to clarify things here...<br><br>1) Mage &amp; Jalvin are friends (remember Mage intro Jalvin to this forum <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> )<br><br>2) Mage is a joker who sometimes crack a joke too many(but he meant no harm). I do understand that people have different sense of humour. The most one can fault him is that he's playing a fool( he know that Jalvin can take it).<br><br>Sometimes we need such fella, no matter how bad a joker he is, to spice things up in the forum/our lifes.<br><br>3) Other people(besides Mage &amp; Jalvin and maybe a few other) may not know that they are acquaintance and therefore think that he is rude to another forumite. Although I agree that he should stop at a joke or two(Guess he's carried away).<br><br>4) Everyone made mistakes or say things that annoyed others at one time or the other. And in my opinion, a ban doesn't allow the person to clarify/redeem him/herself.<br><br>5) Lastly, banning someone's nick is all but a very short term solution(Although I don't think the word solution should be used here as it's not a final solution). People can come back with unlimited numbers of nicks so are we suppose to be busy banning nicks <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>This would mean unending trouble and when taken to the extreme would render this forum unattractive to people and in the end......(I maybe too extreme thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> )<br><br>I believe we are all mature beings here who can handle such issues calmly.<br><br>So much for hearing me... lift the ban pls <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

I believe he changes the messages so that others will not get a chance to read it and start WW3. Anyway, like Ding has said, people can always post with other handles and times, and he can't do anything about all of them. So live and let live, alright?<br><br>I don't think anybody here wants to "damage" anybody else. If we set out with the objective of hurting someone in the first place, then regardless of what he/she had posted or whether or not they end up on hte lanes is a moot point, because then the intent would have branded that person (person challenging) a loser. To spar with words is much more civilised and mature. We're settling differences of opinion, not strength.<br><br><blockquote>Personally, i was wondering, if i sent my nephew of 13yrs old for theory lessons to become a coach, would u wanna trin under him? Or someone else better, like say, Parker Bohn III, Jason Coach or like your local bowlers AK Yong, Henry Tan or even Remy Ong?<br>My point is not everyone who can spout technical stuff is good, but someone who can conquer the lanes is more worthy of the respect given. E.g: If Tim Mack were to come in here, post rubbish and say its good or say that wat the others advise are nothing more than crap.. wat are the chances you'll believe and in who? Think about it... </blockquote>I've said this before: one doesn't have to be a good player to be a good coach. Since you want to explore the topic, here's why:<br><br>a) There are two dimensions to bowling - physical and technical. Not many people are blessed with both in equal proportions, and fewer try to achieve both with our busy schedules of life. To learn about and know the technical aspects of the game means one has the knowledge of ball dynamics, etc...  but knowing how, for instance, Robert Smith releases his ball doesn't also mean one can do the same, does it? There are always physical limitations to what we can do, but never a mental limitation.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>(E.g., All the best English Premier League coaches were never good players, but the good players rarely become good coaches.<br>Closer to the topic of bowling - Bill Spigner, Billy Hall and John Jowdy... do those names ring any bells? Well, these men are reputed coaches that the PBA pros you have mentioned go to when they need help from timing to release corrections. Coaching has nothing to do with being able to average 200+.)<br><br>b) If a bowler does not listen to someone elses's advice because he/she is not a better player, then that person is a senseless git. The only thing extra a good player can offer is nothing more than credibility. Credibility without good coaching still makes a bad coach.<br><br>If a bowler chooses to only search for people who play well to coach them, that's their problem. If their pride is too strong to pick up pointers from their peers or "lesser" players, then perhaps they deserve to have all help withdrawn from them.<br><br>Granted the unlikely senario that Mr. Mack does chance upon our humble forum and post here, nobody will question him. But is that because he is good, or because he is better than us?? So, people who can bowl like him will only listen to PBA pros... and who'll help the pros?? It never ends... because it is not the way.<br><br>Lastly, this is a simple forum and was never meant to take the place of proper coaching. We merely <strong>share</strong> what we know with one another. If you're so hung up on having <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span> instructions, perhaps you should go to PBA.com's forum, where I'm sure everyone is better than you and have perfect games to their credit. If one does not feel what's here doesn't apply to their game, they are free not to adopt it. Nobody here ever says "listen to me, I'm correct".<br><br>You associate ability to bowl with ability to coach. So, have it your way and ignore all instructional messages/threads/topics here. But enjoy your stay in the less serious threads.<br><br><blockquote>Rando, u as a moderator is very impolite and unethical to change my msgs, leave me a separate one so that everyone can read it. I guess everyone else has a right... </blockquote>I do not think it will happen again.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> [/quote]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Boy! You really should quit bowling or at least giving out advice!<br>(YESH!!! YOU!! Harm!)<br>Bill Spigner- 3 PBA National Titles, 7 PBA Regional Titles.<br>10 yrs Head Coach at Bowling Camps<br>12 yrs  Touring Pro Bowling<br><br>Dick Ritger- 1978 PBA Bowler of the year, Hall of Famer<br><br>John Jowdy- PBA Hall of Fame.<br><br>And Billy Hall who?? WAHAHAHA!! sTop reading from the bowling digest then put in here pls... ( Or wherever u read it from )<br><br>Billy Hall isn't even known by the PBA, thats the email reply i got from them, probably some small time coach...<br><br>You know, its guys like u who spoil the image of a real gentleman. 1st u Piss someone off then u hide behind some sissy idea that this isnt about skill but words and all that crappy stuff. ( Reminds me of those childish little children who would try to act smart in front of others better skilled and experienced than them, then when it comes to a crunch, they all go running to their mothers or say some thing with the gist of "I'm too mature to accept your challenge", Fact is they are too scared... sigh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  )<br><br>A real gentleman is some one who is skilled enough to defeat those that dares to challenge him, yet is someone who doesn't show off his skill in public or ridicule others.<br><br>Why would any good bowler wanna join this dumb forum so that another dumber, lousy bowler can push him/her around... No wonder no national bowlers in here... wahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Oh yah, And i dun bowl, so if u find that there is a need to inflate ur ego further by banning me or shaming yourself with more dumb comments, feel free.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>StormPower,<br><br>I think you're being a little unfair here.<br><br>I quote from Harmzuay's post:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">(E.g., All the best English Premier League coaches were never good players, but the good players rarely become good coaches.<br>Closer to the topic of bowling - Bill Spigner, Billy Hall and John Jowdy... do those names ring any bells? Well, these men are reputed coaches that the PBA pros you have mentioned go to when they need help from timing to release corrections. Coaching has nothing to do with being able to average 200+.) </span><br><br>Is that wrong, my friend? All he said is good coaches have nothing to do with averaging 200+. But he didn't say good coaches couldn't be good bowlers (par average) as well, did he?<br><br>One more thing, Bill Hall (whom I think is the bowling coach of the Malaysian bowling team) may not be known by the PBA as you claim. "Small fry coach" you said. But he is still the person that bowlers such as Danny Wiseman go to when they need help.<br><br>And besides, I believe you don't really have to bowl well to be in the Hall of Fame, you can get there as an outstanding coach as well, or make a very significant contribution to the sport of bowling.<br><br>From your statement I see I can't be a gentleman either, since I certainly don't have the capability of beating anyone who challenges me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok guys, i had enuff. i wan all these hostilities to stop right here and now. everyone has a right to give advice but to spout nonsense is unbearable when the person is asking for advice in the 1st place.<br>this forum was meant for bowlers to ask and learn together. all of us arent pro bowlers or even nation team standard. SO?<br>we learn, we mature in our sport and we have FUN. thats wats important here.<br>When i ask a question here i do expect a nice reply or some advice.<br><br>Also, when pple ask questions i do also offer advice. Does that make me also guilty of being like harmzuay? i am by no means a terrific bowler and my scores are just average, does that mean u wan to challenge me also?<br>Is Houllier a great soccer player? NO. hes a well known coach and he will prob be the 1st to admit hes no great player. doesn that little fact impair him in anyway in being a coach? qualifications for being a player and a coach are different.<br>So wat if harmzuay did pick out some articles ( if he even did do that) to post in the forum? its a well known fact the rest of us are too lazy to even bother finding the articles in the 1st place. hes doing us a favour. so stop picking on him.<br>CONCLUSION, stop this shit now. i do not wan anymore of this flamming going on in this forum. for 3 yrs now i have seen it and it has grown from strength to strength. i will not stand by and let it degenerate to other useless tidbit forums.<br><br>I WILL NOT HESITIATE TO DELETE THREADS AND POSTS MEANT TO FLAME PPLE.
