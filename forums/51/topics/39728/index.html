            <div class='col-md body'>I am a right hander.<br><br>1) Presently, I use the outside of my right foot as a guide to position myself in the starting position. Think this is not right as pple use the inside of the left foot to position right?<br><br>2) When I shot spare for pins on my left, I shift right 1 board for pin 2 or 8. Shift right 5 boards for pin 4. Shift right 10 boards for pin 7. Anything wrong?<br><br>3) When it comes to sparing for pins on my right I have total problems. I do the mirror image for in part 2, but nothing feel right and always miss. Can advice?<br><br>Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I remember my coach says...<br>align ur body TOWARDS pin 10. Rightfully, when u send out the ball, you should also send out towards that same pin. Remember to break your wrist for the entire delivery. Helps in causing less hook, more skid. Close your fingers instead of spreading out the index as well. Also, stand further to left for pin 10, vice versa for pin 7. More of the lane for the ball to work. If you stand too straight, the margin of error is greater.<br>I myself sometimes fail to properly shoot down my pin 7 (i'm a leftie) because I'm forgetting all these important details! But I find them impt because firstly 1)my coach tells me wan..<br>2)its working when I got it right!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Asiaspin<br><br>You are correct in the way you use the outsole of your right foot to measure address position. So are those people who use their left insole, right insole, left fourth toe, et cetera. The point is, everyone is correct as long as they use that same spot every single shot to determine where to stand on the approach. If done this way, then the difference is always consistent and whatever methods of adjustments you then use (such as for your spares) will work. Just remember to consistently use the same spot or foot.<br><br>I'd like to expand on what P1 has said. He's right except for the typo "if you stand too straight, the margin for error is <span style="font-style: italic;">smaller</span>, not greater".<br>Try to line up your sparing line to the pin. Square your body to the spare line (i'm assuming you know what sqauring up means) and most importantly, <strong>walk</strong> in that direction. If you square your body to the pin 10, for example, you walk toward pin10. That means you're walking slightly left to right. That's alright.<br>Many people square their upper bodies and shoulders but fail to align their feet likewise. So when they start the approach, they still walk straight - parallel to the lane - instead of toward the pin. This means regardless of where you squared your upper body, you'll still be facing the pins when you release. Many people end up square to the lane and swing their arm outward toward the pin 10 to compensate, but that's not accurate or consistent. In short, square your feet to the target line too because the upper body follows the heading of the lower body.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I use left toe to position. The adv is that it allows me to make half a board adjustments.<br><br>As for yr drifting when it comes to sparing, i believe its a case of yr vsual contact influencing yr body reaction. Basically, yr visual wants you to approach in such a way that u feel u will be able to release the ball. Just like some crankers, who drift alot. This is becos their visual tells them they need to position their body in such a way to gain max leverage.<br><br>I'm afraid, if u want to correct this, u need to video yr own movements and analyse. Once u idntlfy y own mistakes frm the videos, it is so much easier to correct. Correction shld always be done early, if not, it becomes a habit. Getting frds to watch helps too. tell them where u want them to observe you and keep an open mind. Hope it hopes.</div>
