He was influential on occasions, but when the defence needs him toe most, he's nowhere. 2 goals were scored with him out of position. And yes, he was supposed to be marking the scorer on those occasions.<br>All in all, disappointing.<br>Don't count on S'pore thrashing Laos. They look impressive against Thailand, losing out thanks to 3 quck goals in 26 mins in the first half. That killed them. But 2nd half, they came back strong.
