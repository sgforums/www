            <div class='col-md body'>Whao!  When talking about new equipment, everyone starts to get kinda excited about it huh? You rarely get such spontaneous response.<br><br>Think I spent less than a $100 for my starting kit all thanx to kind souls like kevin for his free Black rage n Ian for his shoes n mechatacter. Not until I splurged on my brand new Columbia Roll-X 2. I guess its really exciting to get new equipment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Now I'm just looking fwd to get my main strike ball. Looking for a ball that is consistent for mid to wet conditions and only need to produce a gradual arcing entry. Since Im still quite a newbie who is not too good with all the technical jargons, these are probably the best I can come up with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Im poor n probably lazy so I was hoping for a ball with a longer lifespan. Heard that particle balls usually live a short life so tot that I might fancy a ball that is not too condensed with particles. Tot might overhook sometimes too although need particle ball to survive in oil.<br><br>Have a preference for either storm or columbia balls. Actually like to have Trauma ER but understand not easy to get a exact used one.<br><br>Hope those seniors out there can offer their precious recommendations n advice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Might wanna try other proshops.<br><br>Tit@n<br>Think the most important to prolong the life of a ball is to clean it after every session, paying attention to the tracks. After every 200-300 games, depending on the amount of revs you impart to the ball, the track area usually wears out faster than the rest. That's the time to get the ball resurface. A ball can usually lasts 1 to 2 resurfaces. After that, it's time to get another one. I have a friend who resurfaces his ball so many times till you can barely make out the "Ninja" on the coverstock. (I think it was "Ninja")  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>My 2 cents worth.<br><br>rdgs<br><br>------------------<br>Don't marry a person you can live with, marry someone you can't live without...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>airgrinder<br>200-300 games?!? I think it's wiser to resurface more regularly. Even for a noodlearm, that's too many games - the oil would have set in the cover waaay before any process can help. And a ball is good for more than 2 - 3 'recons'.<br><br>I have my gear recon-ed about once every 6 months. i play about 150 games?? if i use it often, then 4 months. Anyhow, your driller should be able to properly inform you of how many more recons one's ball can take. Walter tells me, for instance, that my Rage can take only about 2 more before it becomes illegal (too small) in diameter. Obviously, some balls DO react at different rates to reconditioning, but i think the more you put it off, the more has to be 'done' during the recon... more eventual damage. An analogy can be drawn with visiting the dentist.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Offload my chaos? nah...its no longer with me anymore...<br><br>On the contrary,particle ball shld last longer than reactive ball. Proactive balls are make up of different material. As a result u can't use normal sandpaper to recon the ball, u need a even finer sandpaper that are of micro-grit to sand the ball.<br><br>Reactive ball are far softer. Thus they are less resistant to wear and tear.AFter the first 20games, the initial wear will be seen. AFter 50games, the surface start to break down.Also reactive balls are pretty porous, that's why they can grip the lanes better than paricle balls. However a porous ball will mean that they absorb a lot of oil. When it cannot absorb oil anymore, that's the end of its lifespan.<br><br>Resanding the ball removes some of the tracks so that ball can grip the lanes.but when the ball is unable to absorb the lane oil, the ball will not be able to react as effectively as before. hence u might get unpredictable reaction. couple with our inconsistent release..the result? we won't know what went right or wrong...<br><br>Unless u can change ball every 3-6mths..otherwise guess we just have to be contend with the present situation.That's why ppl say bowling's for the rich..i would say its for the rich if u wanna play seriously and competitively....</div>
