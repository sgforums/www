            <div class='col-md body'>Yo dudes.<br>After searching the entire island months ago for a 15lb Storm Eraser - I even had Walter, my fitter, call his supplier - I encountered brickwall after brickwall.  ={  Then last week, I found one. But I had already bought the Triton Heat 2 Pearl by then in my desperation... Unfortunately, as good as the Heat might be, it isn't really the same type of ball as the Eraser.<br><br>Enough of my problems now. Prataman, if you have balls for handling dry lanes, let me know. Oh, by the way, i think 15lb 4oz IS a light 15. Doesn't 12oz make a pound?  =P</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>STORM: LIGHTNING FLASH<br><br>The Flash line is a series of bowling balls with great performance for a $120-range ball. The Lightning flash plays a top hat (walled) pattern very well, and as the condition dries up, the ball will stay in the bowlerÂ’s hand longer.<br><br>The dual density core (light bulb) of the Lightning Flash delivers power for the average player, while the ball also features a nice blend and control and power for the stronger-handed player as well. The core is stronger than most bulb or Â“econoÂ” two-piece balls, and its reactive cover is very aggressive. The left-hand ball was drilled 4 1/2 x 3 1/2 (Pin and Cg) with hole on PAP. The right-side ball was label leverage with no hole, and the pin outside the ring finger. The Lightning Flash is very clean up front with a strong Â“arcyÂ” hook. The rev players got a flip-type backend which was very readable. DonÂ’t look at this price point and expect a weak ball. This one delivers a great deal of power as needed with control.<br><br>~~~<br>Dug up this review of the flash, it's shod in reactive resin and is labelled by Storm for medium lane conditions. The black cover carries green markings and should tune easily to shine/sand. In the USA, it's a great budget performer. But the way balls are priced here, it doesn't really make any difference. Hope this helps you, Jae.<br><br>May the force be with you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ian, if i read you correctly, you want to play the 38th board?? (3rd from the left channel) that's not quite possible, unless you throw from the middle of the lane to your left. I do think it's a typo, and you mean the 3rd ARROW from the left.  =) That's where most pros land their ball when they loft over the left channel.<br><br>Ding, don't worry: i'm not some no-life who sits in his room all day reading ball catalogs. it's merely a quote i lifeted from the web.

Actually, the sale will take place next Saturday.<br><br>So what I've got left to sell are:<br>1) Ebonite Apex (plugged twice)<br>2) Brand new Storm Ultra Hot<br><br>Seriously, Jae.... if you really want to combat SKID, it's better to get urethane Balls or particles rather than reactives. Reactive balls skid more than anything in oil, just that they "react" more violently in the dry.<br><br>Particles and even urethane have a higher friction in oil which will cause it to skid less. However, don't hope for a booming backend with urethanes, 'cause in this case they will have less friction than reactives in the dry. Err... particles are a different story, they simply grip harder anywhere, anytime.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 05 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prataman's got it nailed there with the coverstocks. BEsides, we'll need to know what sort of condition you intend it for. Both of us know your physical game, so all the information we require is what sort of lanes (synthetic, oily - for instance) you intend on playing on.<br>But off-hand, the lightning flash is actually a ball people with more hand buy to play on drier lanes. So, it's definitely not for you. Oh, and i made a mistake about it's colour - it's purple/pink cover with orange markings. Very nice. I got it confused with a thunder storm.<br><br>Ballpark, Jae - you are most likely going to need some particle ball. Just my two cents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alright gentlemen and strong ladies (you'll see why I say that in a moment)...<br><br>A promise to a friend. He has a load of balls to let go and I am posting here on his behalf. For your convenience I am labelling them in terms of how many times drilled. And please note all balls are 15 lbs unless mentioned otherwise. For the exact weight or pin location or price you'll have to email him or sms him, I'll leave the details here. I believe he will sell them between 40-70 per ball (except the new ones of course)<br><br>Without any further ado, let's get the ball rolling.<br>-----------------------------------------<br>Brand New:<br>Brunswick Attitude 2<br>AMF Amforce 115<br>-----------------------------------------<br>Never plugged:<br>AMF Amforce 135<br>AMF Nighthawk Menace<br>Columbia Rage<br>Columbia Red Pulse Pearl<br>Columbia Beast<br>Ebonite Werewolf<br>Ebonite Clear Wolf (Interested, Chuanish?)<br>Ebonite Tidal Wave<br>Ebonite (?)

            <div class='col-md body'>You could SMS him to ask him how it handles, Ian. I guess he would have a better clue.<br><br>Another friend of mine has an Impact Zone, what I see is a ball that is late in revving up, but when it does, it revs like crazy and makes an arcy dive into the pocket or into whatever pin you hopefully aimed for.<br><br>My thoughts on it would be light to medium fronts with a hint of carrydown. No floods. Nope. No way.<br><br>However! Brunswick specs suggest it is a ball with a better than average hook potential with a sharp turn reaction, and recommends it for medium lane conditions.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 19 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prataman<br>Did your friend tell you his Black knight is Ebonite?? Hahaha!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> That's priceless. Storm does have a lightning storm. One of the best balls they ever made. But it's not for everybody - I once read somewhere (waaaaaaay back) on the review of this ball. Paraphrased, it said:<br>"For Pete Weber, this gem hooks coast to coast. For mortals, it will play well straight down, or as a spare ball."<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey prataman, you know i'd find it hard to resist an unplugged clear wolf... but my blue dot would have to be relegated to the bench! And it's doing a pretty good job, don't want to raise dissent in the squad.<br>I'll have to think about this one.<br><br>But to more important matters... it's time i got me a dull ball. So here are my shortlisted players: the Pulse, Beast and Chaos. Yes I know they're all Columbian, trying to keep it in the family you see.<br><br>Any further info on these balls, or suggestions you can give, since you know what i bowl like?</div>
