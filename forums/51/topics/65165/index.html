            <div class='col-md body'>it seems like this forum is pretty 'dead' for quite a while...<br>here's something for everyone to comment on, hope that it'll attract some repiles...but not boh liao types lah...<br><br>for me. i think of all the few balls that i've used, the monsters Brusier(mid oil) and Scream(med dry) works pretty well, esp the hitting power of the Brusier, really POWER.<br>Heard that the Inferno is very popular and highly rated among bowlers.<br>other than the above, the lane#1 balls offloaded by Nick to ppl like Hanz, Prata and PowerTorq also attract impressive comments.<br><br>As for the worst balls, so far, i'm quite disappointed with my Scout reactive...dry lanes over react, oil lanes under react...dun know if it's the drilling or the ball...anyone uses the Scout can provide their comments?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well well well .Lets see....ermmm...wats balls ah?<br>Before speaking, wat i'm going to say it based on my own opinion, its does not represent on majority okie?<br>I have used quite a few brands of balls....wat are they? Ermmm...okie Roto Grip and hammer are the two brands i had not come in contact wif so far apart from those "ULU" brands.<br>Storm, Brunswick, AMF, Ebonite, Track,Columbia and Lane #1 are the ones i tried b4.<br>Well currently i'm into Brunswick and Lane #1 Balls!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>To be fair, a lot depends on bowlers' skill. Balls play a part too.<br>BUT different balls have Different impact too!<br><br>I'm now a BIG fan of Lane #1 balls now . I'm now using Lane #1 Cherry Bomb and awaiting another Lane #1 ball to be ready. So far i can say the impact of Lane #1 balls is really impressive. I'm sure a few fellow team mates of mine who's arsenal boost Lane #1 balls will agree with me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> Value for money!<br><br>Brunswick balls....i had used a quite a few Brunswicks balls and i love them all! eg, monster's series, Red Alert 4 and inferno. These balls are easy to control and their impact seems better than some other brands. Would certainly recommend to ppl. A few of my team mates and friends SweAR by Brunswick Brands too!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Columbia balls are the 1st balls that i had used. I used to love this brand of balls and had a CraZE over them...but as i used more and more of others brands, i find tat columbia balls are more "mild" in impact and coverstock dun last as long as Brunswick.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Track balls, i had used an Enforcer b4 for a short while but find that its quite uncontrollable and it tracks up quite easily. So for this brand as i had not used much of its equipment, i shall not comment too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Storm = AgreSSive agressive balls to me. So i dun really quite like. its over/under reaction quite  alot for me to handle. Won't recommend to beginners esp those high end Storm balls with AgreSSive cores and coverstock! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Ebonite! I still miss my Matrix Dynasty from Ebonite.  Used b4 a Werewolf (pink) and a Gemstone. Ok lah but i guess the Dynasty is ONE of the better balls i used before and i loved it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>AMF i used b4 a NINJA 14lbs. An old ball. Quite nice. Anyone who used AMF more maybe can comment on this brand pls? I dun tink i'm in a good position to comment.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Well Brunswick Monsters seems a relatively affordable ball range to me and its impact does not lose out to high end balls. I love POWERKOIL coverstock series balls.<br>Lane #1 seems a bit costly but it worth the price to pay for a "better" im[act and reaction! Those seen Lane #1 balls in actions would most likely agree wif me ,i dare say! Haahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>No offence to all Bowlers out there as everyone has their own preference! CHEERS! And Merry BeLated ChristMas! Hohoho!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm...quite dead huh?<br>Hahaha. Forgot to add that Brunswick came out wif a line thats had a great impact on my bowling too...that's the Quantum Series!<br>Anyone use that range b4 would know tat they are quite impressive! . Now Brunswick had incoparated the "Mushroom" core in the their Monster series balls. Well maybe thats why the Monsters series are well by far the most impressive mid range balls in the market i suppose! Tried the SlayR recently...Best i used in the monster series so far  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>Tried a Lane#1 Cranberry Buzzsaw. Drilled for oily lane. Impressive ball! but must put away when the lane starts to dry up.<br><br>Maybe someone can also talk abt using plastic ball for sparing? Is it necessary? Lets have a show of hands who use a plastic ball for sparing? I used to use one for pin ten.....not anymore now though.<br>Wats the most interesting plastic ball in the market now?<br>To me...the Hammer Everclear is the most impressive and most "chio" plastic ball so far!<br>CHEERS!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
