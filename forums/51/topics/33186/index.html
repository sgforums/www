            <div class='col-md body'>This is gonna be some long draggy shit so those who cant stand long draggy shit then dun read this.<br><br>3 yrs  ago, in my 1st year, there were some 2nd and final yr students who wanted for once in SIM's history to win NUS or at least get some silverware to bring the fight closer. They were asking why didnt we ever win. funnily enuff ( or maybe not so funny since i am quite vocal.) they asked me.<br><br>the solution. to form a real bowling club/team that TRAINS. with a real COACH. time frame needed, 3 yrs. or rather, in my final year.<br>this is that year gentlemen.<br><br>that aside, i will try to explain my choice of coaches and things i have done so far for the club.<br>1st was Hisham. He's a great beginner's coach, not much in advanced or technical ways but good for our pockets( the concessions) and the baby steps.<br>2nd is now. Fox. (close fight between Fox, Henry and Adam i tink)<br>Fox speaks for himself. he's a damn good coach and i need not elaborate further.<br><br>There have been many times i have made some decisions for the club that many dun agree wif. Believe it or not, it was the 3 year plan in mind. my only mistake was not informing the other committee members of mine, but i did believe it would have caused undue stress. my only regret is not doing the orientation well. that caused a shortage in members for the current yr 2s.<br><br>this upcoming NUS/SIM will gague how successful i have been. History decides the heo or villian, but for wat it was worth, it was an honor 'leading' u guys. See you on the lanes Sunday.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said coming from the president.<br><br>To win the SIM/NUS tourney is always in the back of our mind. For years, we have been trying to beat them but we couldn't. As for my batch, we have many members but skill wise, not as good as the present batch of yours. Guess is the different mentallity that we have for the bowling club. What the cub is heading to right now is towards forming a good bowling team.<br><br>Ian,i believed what u have done for the club is for the outmost interest for the SIM/UOL bowling team and all your efforts will not be wasted. So i hereby wish the best for tom tourney and i will be there to see US lifting the challenge trophy at the end of the tourney.<br><br>Let's put in all our best tom and give it a good fight!<br><br></div>
