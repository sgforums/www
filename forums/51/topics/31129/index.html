            <div class='col-md body'>Yes it's time to buy clothes again!<br><br>This is open to discussion. So far, the general consensus among the bowlers is that the blue polo from the 2000 Collection is the best one to date. I believe that its strength lies in its simplicity. A few of us were talking about it yesterday, and we thought of a few designs:<br><br>School crest on left breast<br>"RAZE" on back of collar (think Tottenham Hotspurs)<br>Name on Bowling arm sleeve, all caps<br><br>And a few colour combos:<br><br>1) <strong><span style="color: darkred;">Maroon base</span>, <span style="color: black;">black font</span></strong><br><br>2) <strong>White base, <span style="color: red;">red font </span>(<span style="color: red;">Type R</span>!)</strong><br><br>3) <strong>Black base, silver font</strong><br><br>People! Please contribute. This is OUR polo, we have to make it happen. For the design, just keep in mind one thing: classy.<br><br>I will try to get a few samples a.s.a.p. for sizing.<br><br>Last year's polo was $15, use that as a benchmark.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think many pple wd understand the Tottenham Hotspurs thing.<br>anyway the RAZE word this time round has been proposed to be at the back but on the collar..<br>for those who watch soccer matches you might have noticed some football clubs have their club initials on the collar. (eg T.H.F.C)<br>the purpose is to have a little bit variety among our polos. thats all.<br><br>in my opinion, the blue polo was tot to be the nicest among all was partly bcos of its material.<br>so we need to stick to that material to make bowling more comfortable.<br><br>I think that white is nice too bt we have to be practical here too cos white tends to get dirty easily esp when we place the ball in front of us.<br>just my 0.2 c worth of tot.<br><br>pls keep the suggestions coming.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think white font would contrast better against a maroon base, but that's just me.<br><br>I agree that the white one would look rather smart, but it does get smudged easily. It's a trade-off.<br><br>The black/silver is actually very common. Most computer companies use that. Think: Compaq, et cetera.<br><br>I'll go with the white one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>By the way, does the name get printed on the left sleeve for lefties? That'll be very thoughtful - customisation and variety in a single act.<br><br>The point about the material is well brought-up. That can make <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> the difference in a competitive setting, when comfort is very important to concentration. On that note, I think the stretchable cuff at the end of the sleeves shouldn't be too tight. That may put off people too.<br><br>P.S. Does KKH get special 3/4-sleeves on his polo? Now, <strong>that</strong> would be variety.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, the blue polo is made of a nice comfortable material. I think our last one was a little starchy, i apologise for that.<br>Perhaps we shouldn't use black as a base, since it'll compromise the shirt's exclusivity.<br>Your name goes on your bowling arm sleeve, which means southpaws will see it on their left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> We did that last year.<br><br>Maybe it would help if anyone voiced their gripes about last year's polo, if there was anything you didn't like at all.
