            <div class='col-md body'>Ahdan<br>You keep asking for recommendations, but we cannot help you unless we have some information about how you play. or where you play. such information is highly subjective and what we each tell you without your information would be rather useless.<br>if you wish, just look at the sites airgrinder suggested. just keep in mind that the average member of those forums have at least one 300 game and plays with more revolutions and speed than us.<br><br>airgrinder<br>the ball essentially is designed to release its energy only later down the lane (higher the RG, farther down) than a low RG equivalent. such cores are normally used only with pearlised covers because a dull cover would prevent the core from doing this. These balls will rev up later, but because all the energy is released in a 'burst' rather than throughout the length of the lane, the reaction is more violent, resulting in a hard arc or snap.<br>Drillings can only alter any ball's reaction within a specific range that it has been designed to deliver. I.e. You can drill a snapping ball to arc, but don't expect it to arc as well as one that was designed to. I'm oversimplifying, but i don't think you'd listen to everything.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I've never understood which balls make good spinner balls because i don't even understand why they need different balls in the first place. the only thing that affects them is the coverstock, so just keep it highly shined and it'll be fine. The core doesn't even matter because 10 - 11lb balls usually use a houseball-like core with a weight block on top to create the top weight. So all balls have about the same core.<br>I think they just change balls to get a different ball. purely cosmetic.</div>

His shots are too hooky, so the conventional finger hole serves to cut down the power he can impart to the ball.</div>

Ultimately, you'd want to use a fingertip grip on your ball, especially if you're looking at a hook-shot in the long-term. Changing with the grip is a foundation-level change at any level. It affects all of your game. Similar to how a building has to be knocked down to alter its foundation.<br><br>If the ball is really THAT heavy, then practice on a lighter ball. <span style="font-style: italic;">Btw, check that your grip is fitted properly, because improper fitting makes a difference to the weight of the ball in one's hands</span> If the ball is only say, 1 pound heavier than what you're used to, then train up your upper body.<br><strong>Remember</strong>: Always focus on accuracy. Once you get that (by the time you get that), you will be stronger, and the revolutions will come. Never rush. It breeds injury.<br></div>
