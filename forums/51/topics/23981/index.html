            <div class='col-md body'>dan<br><br>i'm not trying to dampen your spirit, but it sounds like you're looking to leap before you can walk. Firstly, how long have you been playing? Secondly, you're making a HUGE leap by changing so many aspects of your game at once.<br>There is a practical side of these concerns - you're looking to shell out A LOT of money. If you aren't ready for the changes, you're wasting money.<br><br>Anyway, here's the help you wanted:<br><br>1) get a 'dull' ball. you'd want to avoid the balls that look very shiny and polished because they are very lane specific and cannot take oil. Look out for the single-coloured balls because they are more versatile.<br><br>2) If you're serious about the game, don't ever skimp on the shoes because they are often the item that lasts the longest. And bad shoes produce bad habits. Get the best you can afford. Dexter SST6s are good and versatile for about $240. Or a similar but older Dexter SST5 or SST4 will do too for less.<br><br>3) I'm afraid to inform you that 2-ball roller bags are quite expensive, depending on brand. I'm not sure what's the lowest priced one, but expect to pay from $90 - $150.<br><br>4) The wrist device you're speaking of is the Manhattan Mechatechtor. I'm not sure of it's price, but the originals are over $200. The copies are around $70 - $75. A word of advice from friends of mine - get the Columbia ProGrip wrist device. It's deep red in colour and has the same functions as the MM. Plus the metal is a LOT more rigid and thus performs better. I believe it's cheaper too - about $60?<br><br>I hope this helps, Ah Dan.<br>Do keep us posted of how you've decided!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

A reactive ball at 250, two ball roller for 120, SST shoes at 200, and that's already way over budget.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah Dan, why don't you start off with a second hand ball first? Many of us do that. It may not be as glam as buying a brand new hook monster, but consider this: it's gonna be a real pain in the ass when you start kicking yourself for spending $250 on incompatible equipment.<br><br>I know so many bowlers, including those in this forum, who wreck their game because they can't wait to hook big big. Truth is, many hook big big bowlers can do what they do because they had the patience to build up a proper foundation. Like what harmzuay said, walk first. Eventually, you'll sprint better.<br><br>However, i think it's 100% OK to go crazy on non-ball equipment, like shoes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I spent about $140 on my SST4s, about 1.5 years ago when i just started. Didn't want to splurge because i didn't know if i would like bowling that much. Now i'm like regretting, because those SST4s sure look ugly in white...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>A few of us were fortunate enough to meet nice people who gave away balls, or sold them off dirt cheap, so we could bowl. Yah... it's not easy to find this type of lobang. So if you wanted, you could invest in maybe a mid-range ball? Something in the $200 range perhaps?</div>

In terms of technology, <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">urethane</span></strong> was invented before <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">reactive</span></strong> and <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">particle</span></strong>, so it's considered pretty low-tech by today's standards.<br><br>However, I'm still using it now, even though i have particle balls as well. Sometimes, the lanes don't permit the use of particle or reactive balls (e.g. too dry), classic case of '<strong>qiu2 bi3 ren2 xiong1'</strong><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>*translation: ball more powerful than the bowler*</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So my point is, a good, all-rounded bowler should have different balls for different lane conditions.
