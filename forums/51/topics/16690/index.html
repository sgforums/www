            <div class='col-md body'>I think Singapore Bowling Academy at Kim Seng will be a good training ground. Firstly there are more buses going there (hence more accessible, maybe that's the reason why its chosen as SBA) and secondly the National squad and National Youth squad are training there several times a week (Chances are you will be impressed upon, motivated, higher level of commitment).<br><br>Places like Katong (in the East), Hougang( in the North) and jurong are not as centrally located hence not as accessible. So after looking at the options and weighing the varying needs of the members, SBA seems suitable.<br><br>PS. I think it would be a good idea for the club to get hold of bowling books/magazines either thru library loans or purchases using the fund. It will be a worthwhile investment in the long run. Members will be more motivated to train and improve their basics and it will enhance their understanding (theory aspects of the game).<br><br>Happy bowling and most importantly enjoy ur game!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ding (edited 14 November 2000).]</div>

The calling is clear, the astrological signs are aligned in unitarism. COnflicting comets ve crashed upon one another, its debris carries along with it the rebirth stigma that leg2 would be on its way soon, with due support definitely.<br>We completed 3 different bowling alleys in Singapore during the first leg and I intend to bring in another 3 venue to round it all up.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with Freemun's idea on the continuation of the bowling tour. Its important and crutial to expose ourselves to different lane conditions and environments. However, to make this happen requires commitment from ALL members.<br><br>No such thing as not free, got to work, got classes, need to meet bf/gf, want to go home for dinner, no transport, etc, etc. These are some familiar words from all of us sometime or another.<br><br>if we want to improve ourselves in skills, give the commitment... which brings about some sacrifice here and there. but i guarantee... DEFINITE RESULTS !<br><br>if all opt for just fun and time passing, no problem, let's keep to what we have now...<br>No way we're going to improve, beat NUS come next Febuarary, make SIM team a renowned name in various league competitions... and definitely, no way we're going to feel any form of accomplishment.<br><br>Long story short, straight to the point, might have pissed anybody with what i just said... but that's what i see from where i stand.<br><br>Things only happen when as a team we decide to support changes, not when we only use our verbal talents.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, its about time we show some committment 2 bowling. not just playing games and having fun, but REAL training. that means no fooling around and missing 2 many trainings. If u really wan 2win tis year, we had better get started now. NUS and NTU trainings are really good, and they really train. that means one step drills and technique correcting. we can only improve so much if we just play games, but to break that limit, we have 2 improve constantly on our own individual styles. I would really hate to see the cheerful faces of the team now who r having so much fun 2 have a black face when we get thrashed by NTU/NUS next year. We wan 2 win, we train.And we train hard. Theres no easy route to victory, and the competition is stiff. But, we can do it if we start now.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I tink there's too much toking &amp; no actions! So wat if we attend every training faithfully??? Does it reallie guarantee results?? No offence but i tink training sux! Seriously, i tink all of us need to differentiate btw "training" &amp; "games". Personally, i define TRAINING as the coach training all of us &amp; not leaving some of us in the lurch! We not only need to have practical training but theortical ones as well ie. classroom workshop. The coach is supposed to give us' mental training ' which has proven to be very vital. For eg. some of us r at our peak during games or inter-comp however, if we were to compete wif NUS, somehow the morale juz crashes &amp; everything seems like a lie! Sounds familiar???!!! Therefore, i wuld recommend dat we reconsider the criteria of a coach &amp; stop being a "miser".U all noe wat i mean, i juz dun understand why pp hv the $$$ to buy new balls, shoes, bags etc.. but couldnt afford to pay a little more for a better coach??!! However, even if we have the best of coach, COMMITTMENT still has to be there!! Think about it.......<br><br>------------------<br></div>

IMHO, i feel tat there r 2 camps .... ie 1 which is serious abt completing against nus/ntu / etc ... while the other camp is more int in bowling as a recreational event ... mayb that is why some feel the pinch to invest more $$$ in bowling !? i duno ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">fyi, i am in the camp of serious bowling  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>4) well .... we cant force those who r only joining bowling for recreational to take up serious trg .. can we ?? of cos i would like to see tat most of us will b in the serious camp ..... so what says u guys .....<br><br>basically it is up to all of us ....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
