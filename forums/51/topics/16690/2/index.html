            <div class='col-md body'>Sherry... it would be ideal to get the best coach to head over us, and train 3 times a week, etc, etc. However, bowling club remains as a recreational sch. club where different members join for different reasons. There are the ones who want to just play for fun, those who love OUR company(heheh), and those hard-core bowlers who wanna WIN !!!<br><br>So a good compromise is what we have now.<br><br>Victor 's our choice basically because our coach has been treating us really well. and interms of cost, its most manageable by the majority.<br><br>So how do we improve is the question right? ok, few suggestions...<br>1) in smaller groups we find our own coach on a separate day. so that the "clean" fun of recreational club activity remains.<br>2) on our own, do practices... either alone or do it in an informal group.<br>3) get tapes, VCDs or books to imprive your theory on the sport.<br><br>What i wanna put across is that we shouldnt depend on one thursday a week and expect miracles to happen. dwell on that.<br></div>

Okay, bradders and sisters, comrades, farmers, peasants, middle classes , boys and girls. The fact is that, we need to have something lor, something tat is self inculcate, something simplistic, something morale friendly, something which I had for  and still trying to maintain for the sport of rolling balls, something which I see many of my comrades still have, something equally which I c in some have yet to have, something which we should have b4 we start to talk about rolling balls and how to improve it, something which we ve instilled in us from the early days of having 4 lockers in 4 different bowling alleys and 7 balls at one time. Something shared by most members in the  club, that something is PaSSION. Passion 4 the sport man, passion to improve man, passion to lay ur spine and back on the line and improve ur got damn spare(onli a few wld understand what my last sentence means, those goodfellas sonofa guns, appreciate them) to realli make it so far man. I agree with IAnny man, I think its bout time we earned something from the SIM/NUS, something which the seniors have earned, probably not the trophy man, that something is call respect and integrity, the significant amount of effort in which we have put in to improve on our games, From 4 to 5 steps , from mecha-tector to mechatectorless, from 1 league to 4. Surly 1, U seriously have to give credits to those pple who stic through the leagues,espacially Franchise and DIng, they r the ones who ve stick by them, they r the ones who work behind the scenes to prevent Eraze from being Erased, appreciate it bros. Many other more, the goodguys of the Wed league who played their hearts out against oppponents u wonder what the hell are they doing in the league like this when they could be in the S'pore B squad or something. We grow from this leagues we have, pls dun let it become more of a chore to play.<br><br>------------------<br>Oxygen makes u high....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A bowler experienced insumountible change when bowling in the leagues..Something you dun have to wear a Tag Huer watch to experienced, something priceless and effortless yet its weightage dwells a thousand miles. He throws the ball missed the  spare, looks at his opponent, his wrinkle cringes, endrenalin runs high, knowing that he just lost to him by a few points after adding his handicapped. He looks around, his heart sinks, morale dempens, trying to lift it up, he take two more steps, looking straight in the eyes of his team mates. His teammates comes over and say, :Nabei,Neber mind, we next game then we Whack, this game we let them fly high high first like a kite , then we cut the line, C'mon Good game all the best for the next. He looks at the pins, c the opponent face in them and when on for a 228" That is something invaluable, something intricate , something for the soul man..get it not, its the drive, DRIVE drive to succeed, drive to make the strikes and raze the lanes and to excel over oneself, u dun have to go to the Omnimax and watch olympic glory to know this man.....Surly one I think is a musta,,,<br><br>------------------<br>Oxygen makes u high....</div>
