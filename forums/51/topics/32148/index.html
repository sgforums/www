            <div class='col-md body'>RIght, I just read from a forum post at ballreviews.com in which a chap asked if bowling was too easy because that's what his friend told him. To make a long story short, this friend of his plays rarely but manages to average 188. Hence he declares the game of bowling is too easy.<br><br>I'd like to tranfer this to the local scene, since most of us haven't even averaged 200 yet (unlike forumites in the states, who have many 300 games to their name). Personally, I was thinking about it - it's a worldwide problem bowling faces: people thinking it's not a sport or that it's too easy... I was just wondering what you people think.<br><br>Afterall, we've all seen people play 180+ with houseballs... while we struggle to average that high with our gear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I don't think you guys are getting the crux of the topic.<br><br>All replies are welcome, though. And just as expressed, different people have different standards for themselves.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...read through the posts in ballreviews. Most there average above 200s, one of them even had a 300 after a year of bowling, makes me wonder what lanes they were bowling on. Are they really so good? If they are, why asian top bowlers (Remy Ong, Shalin, etc) don't hit a 300 every couple of weeks?<br><br>In basketball, a college student can shoot three pointers. Micheal Jordan can shoot three pointers. But why Micheal Jordan got paid millions of dollars? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Easy? I think it's a matter of perspective. And it also depends, I believe on what you wish to achieve in the sport of bowling.<br><br>I admit bowling is easy in a way that people of all shapes and sizes can just pick up a ball and fling it down the lane. And score "well", too.<br><br>But, let's put it another way. If my objective was just to keep a ball "in play", that is, hit the pocket safely each time, I'd be using a houseball rather than the reactives. I'd leave pins 5 and 8 all the time, and assuming I spare 8/ all the way, I could average 180+ with a houseball. But I believe I sure can't get to 200 avg with that ball. Even our best straight ball exponent forumite Deamon would be the first to tell you that if all he wanted was to hit the pocket all the time, he'd rather use a houseball or at most a urethane.<br><br>Therefore I switch to reactives and aim for a bigger angle of entry, etc. The risk increases and if I dun crush the pocket, I leave more spectacular leaves than with a houseball. So now, on a good day I can avg up to 190+ and on a bad one go to 150+.<br><br>But to do well in league and average 230+ like many of these people claim? Most of us would find it impossible. I for one don't find bowling "easy" to average a score which I aim for. But if wanted to score 170 avg ONLY as my bowling objective, sure it's damn easy.<br><br>But the ballreviews people are mostly made up of very high average veterans, and loads of braggarts. (I shot 800 of of the box. Yeah, like that's a review, go tell someone who cares)<br><br>For every person that average 200 and above, there are definitely many others who can't, and do not post in ballreviews.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And ballreviews.com isn't the only forum with people who have very high averages or scores. Pba.com also boasts very high=scoring forumites.<br><br>Let's face it - over in the states, forum threads go: "How many 300 games do you have?" or "What ball did you shoot your first 300 with?"...<br><br>I always feel they can always write what they wish (anonymity over the web) and no one will be the wiser, but it IS hard to believe that so many of them can play so well. Their lousy scores are our average scores can - many of them consider it an emergency if their average falls 10 - 20 pins to 170+.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do believe that 200 averages are easy.<br>tink this way, every clean game or evey game wif one missed spare. how much can u get? 180? lets assume no strikes. if u hit the pocket most of the time or at least get 8 pins. 180 wun be much of a prob.<br><br>a double or turkey now and then? 200++ easy.<br><br>sparing makes the average. strikes make the scores.<br><br>Also,<br>in my league, only 2 pple have 200++ av. the others have 190-150 av.  in the other teams all 18 of them, i would say about 12 have 200 averages. in just one league alone. of course, u put most of these so called 200 average bowlers in lets say... safra resort alley and wham. 200 av? i dun tink so. league is very different. its like specialising only in one place and not doing well in others. i av 180 presently also in eastside league, but in kimseng? i am doing like shit... proves a point eh?</div>
