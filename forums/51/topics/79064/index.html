            <div class='col-md body'>6 weeks of the season have now come and gone, and how exactly does F.O.S. stack up amongst the rest of the teams at CSC?<br><br>Well friends, not too bad, not too bad at all! We're not really the Freak Show we were expecting to be! Maybe because Hanz is not around.....<br><br>Before last night, we were in 6th place, on 58 points, with eBowlers United just 0.5 pts behind snapping at our heels. We're 10.5 pts clear of 8th placed Pacer, and 4 points behind 5th placed Spook Demons.<br><br>After last night, chances are we may have dropped to 7th, or even (although unlikely) moved up to 5th place depending on how those 2 teams did. But we should worry mainly about ourselves, and I'm glad to say we have been doing reasonably well so far.<br><br>We set our highest scratch and handicap game for team last night at the league too, good stuff. Here's an update on the team stats:<br><br>Team points: 67 from 6 weeks (7, 17, 6, 17.5, 10.5, 9)<br><br>High scratch team series: 2157 (Week 6 vs LETAC Gallery)<br>High hdcp team series: 2281 (Week 6 vs LETAC Gallery)<br>High scratch team game: 586 (Week 2 Game 1 vs Voltorb)<br>High hdcp team game: 612 (Week 2 Game 1 vs Voltorb)<br><br>High scratch individual game: 227 (Mage), 225 (Joo Hian)<br>High individual series: 797 (Joo Hian), 779 (David)<br><br>Team averages, handicap in (brackets) followed by sessions played:<br><br>Joo Hian: <strong>199.3 (0)</strong> - 1 session<br>David: <strong>186.4 (2)</strong> - 2 sessions<br>Kevin: <strong>183 (3)</strong> - 2 sessions<br>Michelle (F): <strong>167.8 (15)</strong> - 1 session<br>Steven: <strong>166.7 (12)</strong> - 3 sessions<br>Hayden: <strong>165.4 (12)</strong> - 2 sessions<br>Jae (C):<strong>164.5 (13)</strong> - 3 sessions<br>Ignatius: <strong>163.5 (13)</strong> - 1 session<br>WXman: <strong>159.6 (15)</strong> - 3 sessions<br><br>Joo Hian also leads us in number of 200 games (3), in just 1 session, mind you, averaging 3 per league session. David and Kevin are tied for second averaging 1 per league session.<br><br>I must say we have a much more balanced team this time around, with no less than 4 spinners of all types! (left hand, right hand, even part time...) to complement the 5 hook (full time, so there) bowlers. And not to mention (finally) the presence of a female bowler in the squad.<br><br>We face X-Treme Ace and Sixers in the next 2 weeks, who have proven capable of producing big games, but find themselves relatively mid table at this point in time.<br><br>Let's rock on, fellas!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, we have indeed dropped a place to 7th, and are now 1.5 pts behind eBowlers United. However we are still 6 points ahead of Sixers.<br><br>Considering that our past couple of opponents were Spook Demons and LETAC Gallery, I think we have no reason to be upset about dropping a place.<br><br>We have to start picking more points in our next few fixtures!

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiya folks,<br><br>Here's a quick update on tonight's session with our opponent Sixers.<br><br>Coming into tonight's matchup, we were on 7th place with 79 points, ahead of Xtreme Ace with 69 pts on 8th and Sixers on 9th place with 67 points. Ahead of us, eBowlers are on 6th place with 83 points.<br><br>Sad to say, we managed to obtain just 7.5 points. The 3 of us, Jae, Joo and myself sincerely believe we let about 3-4 more points slip away most easily..... no less than 4 games decided by less than 7 pins.<br><br>As such, we're most likely to remain at 7th place, unless eBowlers United do a universally bad job and score less than 3.5 pts. Highly unlikely scenario, with Spook Angels their opponents.<br><br>Individual review as follows:<br><br>Jae unfortunately did not fire on all cylinders this week, hitting a 160 avg as opposed to his poised spinner opponent's 180 avg. Just half a point for our team captain. Better days ahead, my brother. Keep that head up.<br><br>I had a rather decent night, although I felt that an easy point slipped away, much like the others. Nonetheless, managed to hit an avg of 187 versus my opponent's 170 avg. 3 points for the IBM.<br><br>Joo Hian started with a bang, but managed to come away with just 2 points for his efforts, losing overall score by 4 pins (!!) courtesy of handicap (lack of) despite hitting a 179 avg against his opponent's 174.5 avg.<br><br>We won just 2 points from our team games, and lost the overall by 17 pins despite beating them in scratch by 15 pinfalls.<br><br>Well, we live to fight another day, and this time it will be 8 Jun vs TS Reloaded. They currently linger on 13th place at 53 points (not including today's results). Their strongest bowler averages 165 and weaker bowlers average 109 and 141. &gt;30 handicap, mind you.<br><br>There will be a week's break on Vesak Day eve on 1 Jun. Fight on, folks.</div>

I just couldn't find an answer to the lane in my last game. Hitting a 126 in my 4th game, i lost what was a possible 2-3 pts for the team. And it was so frustrating as the difference between between my first game and the last was more than 100pins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Sorry once again. I have learn some lessons from this league game, and i be back again</div></blockquote>You aren't alone, my friend. We both lost the line in the final game and lost overall team score as a result. ARGH!<br><br>But, lesson learnt, and we will apply it going forward.</div>
