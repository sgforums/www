            <div class='col-md body'>me have a question with regards to the coverstock tweaking for Trauma ER.   appreciate any feedback. esp. Prataman, since you had some experience with the ER.<br><br>i noticed that for medium lanes, to achieve lenght, i need to polish up the ER (with Storm's reacta shine).  In such medium conditions, if i polish up with ER, it will give me lenght, but the backend is somewhat tame.<br><br>in slight heavier condition, i will "sand" down the ER with scotchbrite.  it will "bite" the lane well, but backend tends to be a tad too stong.<br><br>what should be the ultimate solution?  sand down the ball to a lower grit before polishing it??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>me doing okie prata.....but my average still sucks!<br><br><blockquote>We tweak the coverstock in order for the ball in YOUR hands to match up with the lane.</blockquote>Correct and I find that Storm's line of balls are very condition specific.  That's the reason why I am trying to see if I can tweak the coverstock to my style and also to allow play on more conditions.  otherwise, will have to lug around all the baggage and hope that one of the balls suit the condition.<br><br><blockquote>The "backend" reaction I think you're getting isn't tame, but if it's the same thing that happened to me, it's that it's still skidding and didn't catch a heavy roll yet.</blockquote>Nope.  never happen to me, unless the lane is flooded i.e. vision bowl in hougang, where they seem to have a neverending supply of oils and conditioners.<br><br>I tend to face the problem of roll out cos the lane is dry.  But on the right condition, I agree that the ER hits very very hard.<br><br>btw....the ultra hot also hits like a truck on the right condition.  me had a 9 bagger (too bad, its over 2 games.  last five in game 1, followed by first 4 in game 2) on monday....hehehe.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lowbass<br><br>Thanks for the information!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I'll try to give you some help, but I won't be able to do much until I can get more info. Since you appear to know Prataman, he should be able to correct any wrong assumptions I make.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"><br><br><blockquote>In such medium conditions, if i polish up with ER, it will give me lenght, but the backend is somewhat tame. </blockquote>From your layout, I would say that that drilling is very strong. As long as the MB is in the strong position, the ball is going to flare a lot. And since your pin is 3 3/8" from the PAP, that means you are not going to get the necessary length. A balance hole means you have the maximum side weight. Basically, your ball is drilled to hook without much length.<br>If you do not want to change the layout, here are other things you can address.<br><br>Shining the cover is a very good step. For the medium condition you described, I had correctly assumed that you play a deep inside line because the problem you have is very common: playing the wrong line.<br><br>Your ball has length so that means it has energy left. But the flat hits tell me that you are playing the wrong line. Many people prefer the inside line because it looks better and less punishing if missing right of the target than an outside line. In your case, I think you do not have enough "bite" for the ball to drive through the pocket, even though the ball has energy left in it. If you leave a lot of pin 2s and weak pin 10s, this is your problem.<br>So just adjust to a tighter line, and the carry should improve.<br><br>The problem could also lie with your drilling. It flares so much that your ball has hooked out, meaning the core has reached its stable position and will no longer keep the ball moving left. Since you have trouble playing the ball's surface without the polish on this condition, I think you also have a lack of speed.<br><br><blockquote>in slight heavier condition, i will "sand" down the ER with scotchbrite. it will "bite" the lane well, but backend tends to be a tad too stong. </blockquote>This hints two things to me. 1) You do not have enough ballspeed; 2) This combined with your problem on medium conditions make me believe you have a late thumb release.<br><br>1) If your ball is biting but overhooking the pocket, I think you lack the speed for such an aggressive biting ball. Of course it could also mean you are playing in reverse block conditions, but Singapore alleys rarely lay out that condition, so i doubt it.<br><br>2) A stuck or late thumb would lose a lot of length in the shot, as well as revolutions. In the case of the medium condition, a late thumb means you do not catch the ball as well, so it slides all the way past the proper breakpoint. In heavy oil, you are losing length which causes you to come in too high.<br><br>All this is pure extropolation from my room  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , so please do not take it too seriously if they do not apply to you. Instead, please correct me so that I can be a better bowler too.<br>We learn from one another!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Harmy.<br><br>Thanks for all your explanation and inputs.  Greatly appreciated.<br><br>I think I am with you with regards to my current ball speed.  I also think its a bit slow.  Used to have a high ball speed in the past, but faced the same problem as Prata - ball still skidding past breakpoint and all the pin 2s and weak 10s.  So slowed down my timing and footwork to adjust my ball speed to achieve the proper skid-hook-roll.  and now it seems that I may have decrease my ball speed too much to create the current problem.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> hummmm........I think its time to go back to the drawing board for my timing and footwork.<br><br><blockquote>For the medium condition you described, I had correctly assumed that you play a deep inside line because the problem you have is very common: playing the wrong line.<br></blockquote>i try not to play to deep, unless the lane condition forces me to.  i would loved to play an outside line if the ER allowed me to, but no.  My 10(release)/ 10(arrows) line with the ER is for the 7 pin spare.  if I am frustrated and pulled it a bit, I will miss left of the 7 pin (gutter).  Also i think it is affected by the other bowlers' line.  I think the ball hits a dry patch before its breakpoint.<br><br><blockquote>2) A stuck or late thumb would lose a lot of length in the shot, as well as revolutions. In the case of the medium condition, a late thumb means you do not catch the ball as well, so it slides all the way past the proper breakpoint.

For my case, cover is actually tweaked - shined for medium and sanded for heavy.<br><br>oh ya.  another piece of info, but i am not sure if it is helpful.  I am one of those who's track is closer to the thumb then the fingers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Lowbass<br><br>The 10 (release)/10 (target) line rarely works on blocked lanes because you'll experience extreme over/under. When I suggested a tighter line, you can perhaps try a line such as, 13/8 or 20/15. From the evidence and your gear, you do not have a problem making the turn. It's making the turn with energy left that eludes you. A tighter line is the simplest way to do that.<br>Always go for the most direct shot possible.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>On the heavy oil condition, I am aware that you have a rough surface. But since your ball can bite, it means that surface is adequate. A late thumb would retard a lot of foward momentum to the ball and hence allowing it to break earlier, probably around the midlane. And since you play inside, the only thing left to adjust is your ballspeed and the "clean-ness" of your thumb.<br><br>Btw, I do not think Prata has high ballspeed. His low track + high degree of axis tilt is the reason why his shots normally skid beyond the break point. If he plays down and in like Jae does, he'll be fine. HE doesn't have Jae's ballspeed, so perhaps Prata will have to try a 15/10 shot.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....I am inclined to think that playing with coverstock is a better option. Don't know about you, but for me, I cannot consistantly keep to my low, medium, high ball speed, if I have three speeds. It is easier to keep to one ball speed, at least at my level. For changing different lines, the general assumption is (for right hook) if ball goes more to left of pocket, you shift line my moving feet left. There is a possibility that one might hit a sensitive patch, and there goes your line adjustment. Hence, I think it is better to play with coverstock. I'm standing at 17 playing 2nd arrow. If ball over-react, change to one that have a smoother cover. If ball under react, change to a stronger coverstock. In this way, I can keep my ball speed, line, the same.<br><br>BUT, too many balls spolit the bowler. Bowler can easily get confused over which to use and what to do. Really admired those top bowlers. They can answer questions such as "Can I carry more with a weak cover ball with lower speed and a more direct line, or with a stronger cover ball with higher ball speed deeper into the lane and lofting a little?"<br><br>Knowledge and Experience.<br><br>Just my 2 cents... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>P1<br><br>Here's where you have to adapt. Tweaking coverstocks should be one of the first things to do when seeking the best carry under a certain given condition.

            <div class='col-md body'>i agree with my coach because apart from cleaning my ball after play, the next thing for me to do(since I have only 2 balls) is to play with release.<br>in fact, if not because of working with release, i wouldn't have learnt so much anyway.<br>because i always think its interesting, new and exciting to learn when ite regarding the different type of releases...<br>plus, with one ball, i can have 3 different type of releases for a league game....which helps me.<br>so...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>varying ur release is an excellent way of tuning ur game.<br>no serious bowler is without their B, C or even D games.<br>remy has 6 different releases (i quote; hey man, i can change my release to any of the 6 different styles i want. u must learn mah)<br><br>even for us on a everyday basis, we must use different releases.<br>Pin 10? those who hook alot? look at the PBA bowlers. do they use their hook like mad release to spare it? NO.<br><br>if the lane is too dry even for ur dry lane ball to perform leaving pin 10s? do u vary ur release? or use a house ball? i guess u know the answer urself.<br><br>btw, i usually just clean my ball, and coverstock to me is just wat i want i dull or shine on a particular ball then i leave it. no more tweaking for me as i resort more to ball change. thats y i keep using so many balls.<br><br>example, my damn columbia Udot hooks more than my purple fuZe. thats coverstock AND drilling for u.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>more or less, i guess you've got to remember that feel, and keep being consistent...as in keep using that release.<br>like yesterday, i was abit more or less, throwing harder with a controlled backswing. The release for me is like my previous, but i try to feel the part where my shoulder is perpendicular to foul line and at that moment, my bowling arm is on its forward part. So everything just has to fall into place.<br>Miss the timing and my shot goes off. Of cos, after awhile i got tired, 2 days consec bowling....siaLL~~......then i cannot control already. Controlling is no good, but I was just trying to practise feeling the parts that i was concentrating on.<br>After I got tired, I just try to keep my ball on target....<br>the thing is lock the release in my mind, and keep using it?</div>
