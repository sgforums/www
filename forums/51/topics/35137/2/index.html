            <div class='col-md body'>Hope everyone has an enjoyable nite out there and hopefully the goodie bags help too. This goodie bag is even better than what singapore pools used to sponsor when my school organise its tournamnet 2 years back........<br><br>Lastly, everytime after a tourny, its oso time to reflect what u did rite and where went wrong. Each time u throw a ball, u shld gain some experience and knowledge abt such conditions. Keep the positives, but throw away the negatives ;for the negatives will lead you to bad habits.<br><br>Remember: to improve yrself, u must recongnize that u have lost the game and how u can imrpove to become a winner. I always apply this after every game and tourny.<br><br></div>

Step ladder sure was exciting... every single game was a nail-biting finish(save for game Jae had 5 in a row from frame1-5 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ) Anyway, he purposely kept it interesting by throwing the first ball of frame 6 down the drain <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Congrats to all <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WOWWW! I'm the one who was told to post up the scores and stuff, had one of the latest post in! Not my fault hor, the school's network is down for my area yesterday.<br><br>But then, think I wun have to post much right, since most of all had been mentioned in the past ten plus messages. Anyway...<br><br>Had a successful event on 15th Feb 03 at Jackies. The event was Prataman's Forum Challenge. 24 males and 2 females battle it out in a five game qualifying where the top 5 proceed onto the step ladders.<br><br>We saw david, jae and weixiang making it to the top 5, the step ladders. WX did it with an avg of 209 per game!! But I must say, the greatest was Mr Jae. He knockout david and another to enter into the 2nd round of the step ladders, started off the second round with a five bagger to drown his opponent with a 213, and just sliced WX to emerge the champion! I must say it was teeth-grinding, hair-rising, and sweat breaking to watch the step ladders. Even people from the public were attracted to watch the ladders. Think it was a entertaining competition. Once again, david, wx and jae did a good job.<br><br>Credit must be given to ding, saf, ian who made it into the top ten. Saf was so happy when she won, trashed a lot of others to become eighth!<br><br>I must also congralute Power Torqress, whom had beaten Power Torq and a lot others (including moi). Haha! Well done!<br><br>To those who didn't made it, like Deamon said, we must recongnise that we had lost the game and how we can improve to become a winner. First we must know what we did that is NOT advisable. I know mine. I can't play inside the lanes. I just cannot believe that my ball will go out and then hook back at an angle sharp enough to the pocket. I am going to do something about it. Do you know what went wrong with your game?<br><br>Again, must thanks prataman for organising this tournament and Deamon for getting the goodies and the rest for attending it. Every participant got a nice laptop bag to go home with. Hope to keep this tournament thing going....Goodnite. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
