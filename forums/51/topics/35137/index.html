            <div class='col-md body'>Ladies, Forumites, Bowlers and Gentlemen in no particular order,<br><br>The final details of the Forum Challenge have been settled and are all here for your perusal!<br><br>Date: Saturday, February 15th 2003<br>Venue: Jackies Bowl (542-B East Coast Road)<br>Time: 6:45 check in, 7pm practice throw, 7:05 roll off<br><br>*****<strong>PLEASE DO NOT BE LATE!!!!!!!!</strong>*****<br><br>Cost: $27 per participant, to be paid when checking in<br>Format: 5 qualifying games, top 5 to proceed to 3 round stepladder<br><br><strong>Bowlers participating:</strong><br><br>Eric Tan, Ng Ting Hwa, Sin Ker Han, Saffry Hoo, Regina Ong, Vernon Lee, David Goh, Tom Lim, Ian Wong, Ong Chong Han, Jay Soong, Jordan Loh, Tan Liang Cheng, Alexsius Pek, Lim Boon Kiat, Ong Chong Siang, Johan Shah, Jae Tay, Liong Chuan, Hayden Tan, Kazan Looi, Yeo Wee Siong, Adrian Yaw, Victor Loh, Ian Tan, Kevin Ng, Yvonne Chee, Andy Chin.<br><br>Some points to note:<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">General Info:</span></strong> We have 28 participants, over 12 lanes. To save time, the lanes have already been drawn for you, courtesy of the Jackies Bowl manager. We have been allocated lanes 1 - 12. Good luck to the corner lane people. If you wish to know your lane assignments, please let me know. Otherwise you can surprise yourself on the day itself.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lane Change:</strong></span> There will be just 1 lane change after 3 games. Players on odd numbered lanes will move <span style="font-style: italic;">4 lanes to your left</span>, and players on even numbered lanes will move <span style="font-style: italic;">4 lanes to your right</span>. So if you're on lane 7, you move to lane 3 after 3 games. If you're on lane 10, you move to lane 2 after 3 games.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Playoff Format:</strong></span> The top 5 players will advance to a 3 round stepladder. In the first round, 3rd 4th and 5th placed qualifiers will have a 1 game shootout. The winner moves on to play the 2nd placed qualifier. The winner of the 2nd match plays the 1st placed qualifier to determine the tournament champion.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Handicap:</strong></span> Ladies are given a 10 pin handicap per game. Please note, this handicap will count towards the high game award.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prizes:</strong></span> There will be a total of 11 cash prizes, for the top 5 qualifiers as well as for the 6th to 10th placed qualifiers, plus a high game award. The prizes for the top 5 will be based on their performance in the stepladders, whereas the rest will be based on the 5 qualifying games. High game award includes games played in the stepladder. Thanks to Deamon and his "goodie bags", I believe no one will have to go home empty handed.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Tie:</strong></span> Should there be a tie game in the stepladder, the player's performance over the last 2 frames will be used to determine the winner. For example, player A hit 9/ and XXX for his last 2 frames, and player B hits X XXX for his last 2. Thus player B will "win" the tie breaker due to a better last 2 frames. Should there still be a tie, players will roll a 3 frame (8, 9 and 10) tiebreaker.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dinner:</strong></span> It's best to eat before you come. Or come early about 5:45pm or 6pm to eat (and digest) at the alley. Food's quite good. We start at 7pm, and will not finish anytime before 9:30pm, 10pm-ish. PLEASE try not to order food and eat during the games, unless you are really on the verge of fainting. It can be very distracting to your fellow lane mates.<br><br>Having said all that, I hope I didn't leave out anything important. Otherwise, see you all at Jackies Bowl on Saturday and let's go have a helluva time. By the way, parking is free. And bring your cameras.<br><br>Please post here or SMS me (96947062) should you be unclear about anything, or have any comments. Jordan, Deamon and myself will do our best to help.<br><br>It would be great and most helpful if the participants (from this forum at least) reply to acknowledge that you understand the above details.</div>

I dunno how much is the RIGHT AMOUNT...so...<br>We also need ppl experience with digi cam and has the link cable to PC and knows how to burn into CD.<br>If we don't have these expertise, its also fine to do with a camera...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings everyone,<br><br>Kudos to our boys Jae and WX who finished 1st and 2nd in the tournament!!!!!!!!! WX had a tremendous qualifying session, but faltered in the final to Mr. Jae, who led his own impressive rampant charge to win from the 5th spot. Excellent job to both of you, buddies. Congrats also to Saffry in breaking the top 10 in a male dominated (24 males, 2 ladies) event.<br><br>Thanks to all of you who supported and played in the tournament. I hope it was fun for you (besides the oil part) as it was for me to organise.... except for a couple of hair pull incidents....<br><br>Thanks to Deamon for his "door gifts", it was really a very great gesture, and also to Jordan who helped in no small part with the organisation. Lastly to Eric and Tom, who helped with the goodie bag preparation as well.<br><br>Although they are most unlikely to read this, I'd also like to extend a thanks to the manager Pauline, who I thought was a very good MC, and the rest of Jackie's counter staff for all of their help.<br><br>About the "appalling" lane conditions, and yes, my lane mates had a very nice time suanning and bashing me about it being my fault.. thanks, I think. I didn't think it was THAT bad, but anyway..<br><br>I spoke to the manager about that, and she will look into the possibility of stripping and reoiling the lanes just for our tournament before it begins, should we wish to organise one there again.<br><br>Well, in closing, I feel with this experience in hand, I think we can go on to organise even better tournaments for the forum in the future. So... who should I pass the torch to? Jordan to me to....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Btw, please let us know how to collect the photos!</div>
