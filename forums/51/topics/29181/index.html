            <div class='col-md body'>I think the direction of a spinner shot is fundamentally similar to a hook one, i.e. both are determined by the path of the armswing. It's important to keep the shoulders perpendicular to your ball's path, as well as letting gravity do all the work. Something I'm still finding very hard to do...<br><br>Also important, is your placing and drift. Placing is calculated by counting the number of boards between the sliding foot at the foul line, and the board at which the ball passes through <strong>at the foul line.</strong><br><br>For example, I'm a rightie, i drift right <strong>4 boards</strong> and have a placing of <strong>6 boards</strong>. Should I start at the approach at board 20, I should drift to board 16, and release the ball over the 10th board. In short, I stand at 20, aim at 10.<br><br>Say I stand at 30, aim at 10. To get to the 10, my armswing will deviate from it's gravitational path to the right, for compensation. I found that this affected accuracy and consistency quite a bit.<br>Solution: Still standing at 30 and aiming at 10, twist torso to the right and keep it there throughout the swing.<br>Result: Armswing's path kept straight, AND being able to pass through board 10.<br>Drawback: EXACTLY HOW MUCH TO TWIST TORSO?!? Sighhh... trial and error I guess, plus lots of practice.<br><br>Anyone employing this method? Uncle Fox recommended it, and I'm still struggling to improve. The theory looks sound on paper though.<br>To make sure I was following through on my shot, he also asked me to finish the release with my hand beside my ear. Right hand, right ear of course.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When looking to increase ballspeed, the idea is to channel extra momentum from the forward movement of the body's mass into the ball. This has been mentioned by Ding and Chuanish.<br><br>The simplest way is to repeat your usual approach footwork, only faster. Unfortunately, it isn't that simple. Without trying to confuse you, here's how it works:<br><br>1. Objective is to move your entire body's mass forward faster to generate more momentum to transfer to the ball during release.<br><br>2. This is achieved through faster footwork in the approach (your normal approach, same number of steps)<br><br>3. But speeding up footwork without changing the timing of your armswing means that your resultant timing of the release will become too late.<br>I.e., the arm gets to the release point later than usual.<br><br>4. The easiest way to compensate would be to start the armswing later.<br><br><strong>Example</strong>:<br>Assuming you are a 4-step bowler (push-away in 1st step) attempting to increase ballspeed.<br>First, your push-away should be delayed, say it starts only when you are Â½-way through your 1st step. This should compensate for the difference in timing speeding up your feet would otherwise cause.<br><br><strong>Note</strong>:<br>There are other more advanced methods such as that mentioned by Ding, but just try out the simplest one first.<br>The reason why you should adjust your armswing's timing as well is to avoid muscling the ball. Simply speeding up your entire body's timing would mean the arm has to intentionally swing harder and faster instead of using natural gravitational force of the "pendulum swing".<br>Exactly <span style="font-style: italic;">how much</span> to adjust your armswing's push-away depends on how much you speed your feet up.<br><br>Happy experimenting.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The direction of a spinner ball is determined by the arm swing. A relax, not too high, pendulum swing is crucial to the accuracy. Dun grip the ball too hard, to increase the revolution, at the bottom of the swing turned your palm till the back face the front, the quicker you turned the more revs you will get. By doing that I can get 12 revs from my release till the ball hit the pins and it take 1.7 secs. Practice your arm swing first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But saying that, most spinners i know, including me, has a problem with flicking the ball too hard at the end of the armswing resulting in a drifting shot and inaccurate release. Therefore as a beginner, it is always good to find a more forgiving line whereby if you do make a mistake and your ball drifts off, it might still take out the head pin and hopefully still get you an easy spare. One example is going for the 1-2 pocket with a starting postition on the left (if you have a tenency to throw off to the right).<br>What works best for me personally is actually swinging the ball a few times before i actually move off to sorta remind myself to keep my arm perpendicular to the foul line. So maybe you might like to try that?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">and i can't seem to make it spin all the way... it always start to roll towards the end.. how to correct this huh? </span></strong><br>As for spin, ball speed does not actually play a part as it can only make up for it by bringing the ball to the pins before it starts rolling. What i think is most critical is actually the split-second just before you release the shot, meaning that the flick of the wrist (which is the action that creates the spinning reaction) just before the release is actually the crux of the whole issue.<br>Amount of spin = The speed &amp; timing of the flick<br>This part of the spinners' games is most confusing coz' at best, the only way to learn it is to FEEL it. Thus, to improve on this part, PRACTICE is everything! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Another way to get the feeling, is to just stand at the foul line and release the ball, concentrating on only the release would be much easier then. And if you do manage to create enough spin to last all the way to the pins.... you're THERE!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">Dun grip the ball too hard, to increase the revolution, at the bottom of the swing turned your palm till the back face the front, the quicker you turned the more revs you will get.</span></strong><br>Bottom of the swing meaning on the upswing or at the downswing??<br>Mine is always facing the back on the upswing.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br></div>
