Nothing fancy, just thumb out, turn, lift and follow through.<br><br>Things such as power and stylo-milo will follow later. Better to get the fundamentals right early, lest it becomes a bad habit.<br><br>Haven't heard about the league yet for a while now. Is everything settled? Do we start on the ... ahh.. 6th June?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>[QUOTE]Originally posted by prataman:<br>[B]Hmmm!!! What is a frisby release?!<br><br>Plataman,<br>freesbee release is actually a half spin half hook type of release.....<br>instead of lifting up your ball,u "flick" the ball out so the ball will skid,spin and then flip into a roll once its reaches the backend......i think i "taught" brandon how to do it the other time....duno if he is a master at it now or not...kekeke.....so basically u will see the thumb plug at the top of the ball immedaite after release and slowly flip towards u at the backend.......<br><br>rdgs,<br>john<br></div>
