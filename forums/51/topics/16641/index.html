            <div class='col-md body'>The library should extend its hours later so that students can spend more time revising, especially so during this peak period of examination.<br>The library should also re-assess its internet facilities. The entire network system is currently at an unacceptable level. Internet access is often slow, frequent "hangs" of the netscape program. These of only a few of the problems the students encounter.<br>It spends so much of its funds on the landscape of the school compound, perhaps it should consider investing in a more extensive high end multimedia-internet system, which clearly is the future of tomorrow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I couldn't agree with you more. There are also many classrooms that are not used and I believe they can be opened up as discussion rooms. Currently at this peak period most of the benches are taken up and there is not many places where students can discuss.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, perhaps the SRC could start thinking about this? Cos i really haven't noticed much difference in the quality of school life since my first day in SIM. A few pondering questions as a year one... where do we give feedback to the SRC; what is the SRC's short term and long term goals with respect to the students' welfare; how do we as students play our part in improving the community of the institute?<br>Perhaps a collaboration event between the various clubs? Well, one of Bowling Club Ex-Co's plan is to have a friendly bowling game next semester, among the various clubs in SIM. Any comments to that?<br>We have also discussed with RMIT's FTSC to organise a bowling meet, objective being to combine the quality bowlers to represent SIM in external competitive events.<br>Cheers! all the best in your final exams.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the library opening hours should be extended sligthly. The issue of making the classrooms free to us is the major issue. We pay so much but we get to use so little facilities. SRC is to relate what we want to SIM but it seemed very futile. life has been the same like doink. More specifically, it is very boring and dull. No matter where we turn we end up facing a white colour wall.  Our suggestions to SIM much be taken more seriously, even though we are not recognised as a third local university by the government. I think we all should fight for tiertary bus passes, that is very essential as transport expensea  major headache for all. Having inter-club tournament is very gd idea, but it is best to test water first. Combining with RMIT is a great idea, it will open up the competition, this will amke us want to be better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>fireball : the issue of issusing bus pass to us has been discussed every yr ... n i think the SRC have done a lot wif regards to this issue ... n SBS have olready response to us saying that there is no way they can issur bus passes to us cos if they were to gave us ... all the other students from private inst such as stanfield .. sic etc etc will want to have it oso ... so no point dicsussing this issue ... unless we have frenz whose dad is the CEO of SBS ??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> cheers .. haha</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Which institute has the worst Internet and Multimedia facilities?? SIM HQ... Endless errors popping out when surfing and checking mail. Dont understand why they arent solving the problem. Spend so much money on so many computer systems, even got one huge server with flickering lights! What i suggest?? Forget about Netscape cos Microsoft Explorer is way much better; and upgrade your network.<br>In this present age of technological advancement, places like NTU is already using LAN accessing at cable speed... why is SIM still lagging behind?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very simple reply to your question Doink! The answer is SIM is a "NON-PROFIT ORGANISATION"!So they need people to "sponsor" as we have so often heard since we have been there. As the saying goes, Never Judge a book by its cover.  It fits very well here ! Don" t you think so?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"Non profit Organisation"... would that mean in Economic terms : normal profits?<br>Badri asked us recently, why do firms still enter the industry, when knowing that they will only earn normal profits? i'm sure from that we all know that "non profit" doesnt really mean zero profits... they probably just dont have profit earning as one of their main objectives that's all!<br><br>Sponsors? You mean the puddle of water in our school was sponsored, and not paid by SIM themselves? hmm, that's so perculiar?!?<br><br>Anyway, i'm just glad that i'll only be here for three years.

The lecturers in SIM r definitely much better(in terms of qualification) than those in other institutes. E-mail a/c, membership card,... r all secondary.

            <div class='col-md body'>What MAx Rian said is rather true. Esp. on the part of membership card, etc. The lecturers so far are alright, other than my Dr. Econs who is psychologically ill, constantly taking the initiative to chase students out of his class.<br><br>I asked two classmates recently if they knew what was SRC... "no" was their reply. Perhaps the SRC should be more open to the students? A feedback website? that'll be good since most of us have internet access.<br>Somehow, i feel that since they are the students' representative, there ought to be stuff they should be more active in.<br><br>The exams are round the corner, less than a week.... all the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz wanna say something on behalf of SRC. They have organized many activities for the students. Mooncake/Lantern festival, Movie marathon, Basketball tourney, Trade-fair, jam n hop n many other activities with aid of other clubs. They are a bunch of students who wanted to improve the school scene n make it more interesting. If ur frenz never hear SRC b4, then it is high time for them to open their eyes n look out for future student activities organized by them. The SRC tried, ur fren should play their part too. When they say no, did they ask themselves y some people aren't so ignorant? I think it is their laid-back attitude that separated them from SRC.<br>So who did they think organize their orientation?<br>Remember that it takes two hands to clap.<br><br>------------------<br>Everyday is a special day, do something special b4 u end this day!!!<br><br>[This message has been edited by Ding (edited 11 May 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, i agree with you. indeed, it is very difficult publicising activities organised in SIM. there are students who go for lectures and then head straight for home. they are the ones who probably have no exposure to too much of school life, other than lectures.<br><br>it is a phenomenon in SIM.</div>
