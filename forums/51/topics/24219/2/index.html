            <div class='col-md body'>yo pple,<br><br>Tried increasing more roll on the ball at the lanes again yesterday. My ball rolled straight down the lane and made a small turn towards the pocket. Had to play tight line. Strong impact as denoted by harmzuary. Tried playing inside the lane (feet at 25 to 3rd arrow) with 45-60 deg axis rotation and slow ball speed. The ball can get to the pocket with less impact. Tried a rolling the ball more (with axis rotation abt 15 deg) standing at the same arrow. The ball knocks into the pockets with more impact. Must be due to the ball not slipping away from the lane at the point of contact. Had a significant 30 pins more to the average as compared to the last time. Think this release is very suitable for lanes oiled this way.<br><br>I feel that the pins don't mixed around that much when bowling a high rolling release as to a high axis rotation release. Any confirmations to that?<br><br>As for the ball track, mine is slightly reverse too, closer to the thumb plug and further away from the inserts, but the max width of the track is just 2-2.5 inches. Must learn how to increase the flare.<br><br>The powerstep:<br>Defined as a set of timing where the ball on the downswing is still at the back of the body when the slid is completely finished, i.e. braked. Momentum from the inertia of the slide and the power from the swing should add tremoundous power to the ball, causing pin disintegretion. Somehow after several games, the impact is still much less as compared to my trusty stroker timing. Is the powerstep lane oil specific? or can it be employed on lanes of any conditions? Tried this on a medium oiled with good backend.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

A rolling ball doesn't have as much pin action because the ball has the power to <strong>carry</strong> all 10 pins. It's what the americans term as "Ten in the pit", because the pins just fall, and the ball penetrates the center of the deck without much deflection. Normally, that's the reason behind loud, Ding-like sounds at impact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Pin action is usually characterised by the head pin which riccochets off the sidewalls as a 'messenger' or 'scout'. This is an indication of a light hit. I.e. not optimal. A heavy ball player should never rely on pin action - if you get it, its a bonus, because you got a strike or an easier spare that your execution did not deserve.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>And i don't get the portion about the powerstep thingy.

The way I'm taught is that the timing of the hands should be way slower than that of the feet, such that u completed the slide long before releasing."  From my observations, this is slightly different from what I saw from other coaches at other bowling centres. Maybe I misunderstood, but I need a second opinion.

            <div class='col-md body'>powerstep is generally refered to the 2nd last step. it is planted firmly on the ground and that leg (right leg for righties) is used to push/power ur slide. it usually grants more stability and the extra momentum is generated. not really recommended unless ur rev and speed is complementary. ie. imagine a bowler wif 5-6 revs on the lane. speed is 2.1. not optimised power and carry.<br><br>btw harmzuy... my release track is the track closer to fingers and further from the thumb. the reply u posted seemed to refer the opposite..<br><br>ps: very sleepy.. dunnoe if i made sense..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ian<br><br><blockquote>my ball track is an inverted track. ie: track away from fingers, nearer to thumb</blockquote>i was just following what i read.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Airgrinder<br>It's very true to say that the power of a ball is generated by the body and legs of a bowler, not the arms. Hence your idea of the momentum transfer is correct. Faster ballspeeds doesn't mean your arms throw harder - it means one's lges move quicker so that when the slide ends at the foul line, the extra inertia is given to the ball to avoid falling over. Bowling is all physics.<br>But the observation about whether or not the hands should move quicker than the feet is debatable because it is very subjective. It varies from stroker to tweener to power players, not to mention the hybrid types in-between.<br>Basically, its like this: there should be a slight delay between the end of the slide and the hand arriving at your ankle so that there is ability to create what is called 'leverage'. This is where the most action can be imparted to the ball - when it is next to your ankle. And it is best to have the slide end first because it is more advisable to 'hit' the ball while one has a 'stable' foundation, don't you agree? The best bowlers do not lose balance and fall over no matter how much lift they impart because of this - they have strong and stable lower bodies.<br>This difference in upper and lower body timing differs in people. As Chuanish has noted, power players need to create so much leverage that their slide is basically just planting their foot down and ripping their hands through the ball. When their plant ends, the ball is usually only about waist-high behind their backs!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Conversely, strokers have a more "in-time" timing <span style="font-style: italic;">(both end almost the same time)</span> because they focus on accuracy, which requires more stability below.<br><br>Consider this: one of the greatest bowlers of all time, Marshall Holman, was legendary for his powerful release which was peformed <strong>mid-slide</strong>! While the newer generation of power players such as Robert Smith still have incredible balance at the line. Chris Barnes has near stroker timing, but still gets plenty of revolutions on the ball. Airgrinder, you bowl with Yvonne, right? Watch her timing - its one of the gems of her game. The upper body is <span style="font-style: italic;">just</span> slow enough to create leverage without sacrificing undue accuracy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Bottomline: it all depends on which works for you. A good coach doesn't change your stlye - he/she works on improving it.<br><br>P.S. For those out there who haven't figured out by now, bowling is a sport you have to be fit all over to play well, not just he master arm. Amleto Monacelli jogs 5 <strong>miles per day</strong> while preparing for the PBA season. How many of us jog even 2 kilometers a week?<br><br>Power comes from the legs.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
