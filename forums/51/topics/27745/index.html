            <div class='col-md body'>Well fellas,<br><br>It's been a fun 21 weeks. It was good while it lasted, and although we didn't finish the season the way I had hoped, I believe we gave it a good go. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>First of all, gotta thank all those of you who took part, those who showed up to give support.<br><br>I hope you fellas were satisfied with the job I did as captain. You fellas sure made it much easier for me.<br><br>On with the review:<br><br>We finished 7th out of 8 in the league, with 217 points. Our nearest rival was Juz Us, who pulled away in the last few games to finish with 241.5 points. Well, for our efforts we get a Hamper (yay yay hurrah). No cash, just a hamper.<br><br>Furthermore, thanks to our week 13 performance, we actually managed to win prizes for 2nd highest team game handicap (867) and highest series with handicap (2370). Ok, actually it was 4th highest, but teams aren't allowed to get prizes for both scratch and handicap .... so..... we sneak in "2nd" in the handicap category.<br><br>I believe there are 2 main weaknesses in the makeup of our squad. Other than the lack of consistency that plagues most of us, we lacked firepower at both ends, by that I mean good 1st bowlers and proper anchor bowlers. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>We lost points mainly in these 2 slots each league session. As you will notice later, our top 6 bowlers hover in the roughly the same average range. We did not have a major consistent bowler with at least a 180 avg, nor did we have good, consistent 1st bowlers.<br><br>Thankfully, each and every one of the "upper echelon" of our team have the potential to throw up a huge game at any time. I suppose you could say our team has the "shock factor". Unfortunately it didn't come often enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
