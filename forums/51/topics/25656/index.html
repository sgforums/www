Dingster's next with 578.<br><br>Jae holds the high game by far with 247 (and technically 2nd place as well with 233), followed by Ding with 231 and myself with 227.<br><br>------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Team<br>-------<br><br>After 14 weeks, we're still mired in 7th place, with 148.5 points. We're 8 points behind Jedi Knights and 13 points behind Juz-US.<br><br>Overall, we improved slightly in terms of points scored in Leg 2 from Leg 1. I'm sure this trend will continue for the 3rd leg.<br><br>54 game points, 14 round robin points in the first leg.<br>61.5 game points, 19 round robin points in the second leg.<br><br>Interestingly enough, the trend of points won and loss was very similar in the 2 legs against the teams. How so?<br><br>We're consistently horrible both 1st and 2nd Legs against Hi-Rev (3pts and 4pts) and K-Force (5pts and 4pts). Obviously we struggle for points (no indication of performance though) against the titans Just Lucky (3pts and 5.5pts) and TIger (5pts and 6 pts).<br><br>We always underperform against Juz-US (9pts and 10pts).<br><br>On a good note, we do very consistently against Jedi (16pts and 14pts) as well as the Eagles (13pts and 18pts).<br><br>So as you can see, pretty similar results against the same team, even with different bowlers.<br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>The plan for the 3rd leg is simple. The 3 teams we MUST improve our perfomance against are Juz-US, Hi-Rev and K-Force. They seem to be our "Bogey" teams. Problem with us is we cannot match K-Force's deadly consistency (seniors, but very good seniors), Hi-Rev always seem to raise their game against us, and the Juz-US ladies who usually line up in 1st/2nd spot are relatively very strong compared to us.<br><br>As spoken earlier, we're going to rotate players to play teams that they haven't faced before, with the exceptions of Tiger and Just Lucky, where nothing but our best 4/5 will suffice.<br><br>All the best to us in this leg. Just 7 more rounds to play, fellas.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>3rd Leg starts this tuesday, and we face the same teams once more. Once again, we get the toughest team on the start of each leg, Just Lucky.<br><br>However, this time, we have the questionable luxury of knowing exactly which bowler we are facing. The prospect is not pretty.<br><br>Our team lineup for Tuesday is all but confirmed:<br><br>1st Bowler - Jae<br>2nd Bowler - Dinghua<br>3rd Bowler - WXman<br>4th Bowler - Myself<br><br>Team lineup for Just Lucky<br><br>1st Bowler - My brother Daniel, averages 166 (Hdcp 17). He hardly bowls above 185, but almost never bowls a bad game either. Old school stroker is his game and consistency is his forte. Does an excellent job with his 13 lb Scout Reactive.<br><br>2nd Bowler - Robert Goh, Just Lucky's "tactician". Has an ungainly looking slow and low-revving spin shot, but still manages to average close to 200. By Jove, who on this team doesn't? Handicap region between 1-3.<br><br>3rd Bowler - Michael Lim. Hasn't bowled against us yet, but looking at his average hovering around 200, I wouldn't want him to. Another high speed low rev spinner, but very very accurate. Gets more than his fair share of messengers. Handicap is either 1 or 0.<br><br>4th Bowler - Daniel Cher. Ultra smooth, med speed, med rev and VERY balanced at foul line. Definitely enjoyed playing us the previous 2 legs, notching 216 avg and all 8 individual points over 6 games. Kehan had the "luck" to play him both times. Hdcp... err what handicap? Ouch. Guess who's the lucky one facing him this time.<br><br>Looks like we have our work cut out for us. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yep <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>We got taken to school. Big time.<br><br>I wouldn't mind if we bowled well and still got beaten by the better team, but what was disappointing was the fact that we couldn't really put together decent games (with the exception of a 216 game by WX) and series, and ultimately let ourselves down.<br><br>This is how we got gunned down:<br><br>Jae - (142, 151, 134) = 142 avg vs 149 avg  - 2 pts<br>Ding - (142, 161, 176) = 160 avg vs 216 avg - 0.5 pts<br>WX - (216, 165, 137) = 173 avg v 208 avg - 1 pt<br>Me - (156, 172, 161) = 163 avg v 203 avg - 0 pt<br><br>Argh. I got whitewashed AGAIN! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Overall we only garnered 3.5 points out of the 21, which slips us further behind in the chase for 6th. With Jedi Knights pulling off an absolute stunner (I think they won 13-8 or 14-7) over Tiger Bowling team, they probably leapfrogged Juz-US as well. Hmm.....<br><br>I don't have the numbers, as my mum went to Malacca for a 2 day break, but we have a lot of work to do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  in terms of our performances.<br><br>But hey, my advice is, forget about the numbers, just go out there and give it our best shot.<br><br></div>

Unlike the first couple of legs, where we comfortably defeated them, this time they returned the favour. We lost by the margin of 9-12. Not a big loss by any means, but I dare saw we had an enjoyable time. Like to thank Brendan (and Joey?) for showing up to give a little support. That was thoughtful.<br><br>Liang Cheng shrugged off his early season blues to register a commendable 168 avg (174, 134, 195). He scorched his opponent for 4 points, who bowled a 134 avg ( 150, 135, 118 ). He moves off the maximum handicap list, reducing it by 1 to 25 and upping average to 151. Yay! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ian, unfortunately was on the wrong end of a 4-0 defeat. He hit a 151 avg (162, 157, 133) avg, which was simply not enough to overcome his opponent's 165 avg (166, 178, 152). Overall average drops 1 pin to 163, hdcp remains at 18.<br><br>Jae sputtered in his first 2 games, but rounded it off (as usual) with a big final game to claim 1 solitary point. Jae scored a 163 avg (129, 140, 220), his opponent hitting 175 avg (150, 176, 200). Jae's average reduces 1 pin to 165, hdcp remains at 17.<br><br>I myself also only managed to garner 1 point. I started off slowly again, but managed to "find a small groove" before petering out again. I had a 179 avg (150, 217, 170) on the night, with my opponent scoring a 185 avg (178, 224, 157). No movement for my average and hdcp, remains at 174 and 13.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Just for extra information, Juz Us scored 7 of 21 points against Hi Rev, and in the "clash of the titans" Tiger Team also only managed 7 points to Just Lucky's 14 points.<br><br>On a further unrelated note, teams stats wise, Jae now has 6 games over 200 in 30 games (1 in 5), and I have 5 in 27 (1 in 5.4). Dingster has 5 in 30 (or 1 in 6). Ian has 4 in 30 (1 in 7.5) and WX has 3 of 27 (1 in 9).<br><br></div>
