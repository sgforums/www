            <div class='col-md body'>I have that type, but its no longer manufactured or maybe sold in singapore. Its known as 3M plastic tape. A small roll cost me abt $5 and i bought that abt 2 years back.<br><br>The texture is similiar to the black non-slip tape which u see in pro-shop. Hence it is good for putting on the behind of yr thumbhole.The normal PVC tape has a glossy look which is supposed to make the tape waterproof, hence u get a lot of grip on such tape. But too much grip=late release of thumb. I normally use the PVC tape when my thumb shrink, whcich is the early stages of the game.</div>

I paste in the front og the thumbhole towards the fingers. As it has a waterproof surface, hence it gives a lot of grip. After my thumb has swell, then change to my 3M tape.<br><br>The 3M tape has a matte surface, so it is better to put behind the thumbhole, to fill up the excess space bet yr thumb and the thumbhole. Never put in the front as it will cause u to slip out too much. In fact, the texture is similiar to the plastic black tape which u see in pro-shop<br><br>The disadv of those black tapes, as well as the white rough tapes seen in pro shop is that it left a residue behind. So, what i normally do is i put the pvc tape in first and followed by the white tape, and this help me to peel off the tape faster. The white rough tape is used when i want a grip that is between the PVC and the smooth one of 3M.<br><br>These days, i hardly put on tapes liao. All thnks to mr James Shi who drill my thumbhole such that it fits snugly</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, here's something very stupid. about me...<br>I was going to test the PVC tape on my ball by fitting here and there and see which way of putting tape works.<br>Then I discovered that my ball ard the finger inserts area cracked.<br>Sigh..<br>So I use the tape to tape up the area where it has cracked. I can't repair it or I won't be able to play in the tournament.<br>sighz...<br>So, I'll tape it first, after tourney then send for repair.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
