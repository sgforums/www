            <div class='col-md body'>Bear,<br>Have you heard this saying in bowling, that if if hurts or if u have to force it, you're doing something wrong? Your wrist can't be any smaller than mine. This I can guarantee. Yet I can still load and unload my wrist. Hook, speed and revolutions all require good timing. That's all, just work on timing. Of course you also need a good ball fit. Take it from me, I used to have the same problem as you just less than a year ago.<br><br>The more you try to do to the ball before the foul-line, the less it will do for you when it hits the pins. The less you try to do to it, the more it'll do for you....<br><br>For starters, try this....try to achieve a later timing. That means that when your feet has finished its slide, your armswing should be almost the end of its downswing, ie. just before it hits the flat-spot, which is when your arm is perpendicular to the ground. This is the timing for a power-stroker, or tweener. This creates leverage and also gives your hand more than enough time to go under and around the ball(thumb rotates from 12-10 o'clock for righties).<br><br>If you want to stay under or behind the ball more, try to start of in a cupped wrist position and just work on keeping your wrist cupped for your whole shot. Your backswing will definitely be lowered. What you want to remember is that revolutions and hook is not about how much you can lift or finger the shot. Nor is it about how cupped your wrist is and/or whether you can keep your wrist cupped throughout your release. What is is caused by is timing, which is how fast you can load and unload(cup and uncup) your wrist at the release point. Whatever you want to do with the ball, the idea is to get the ball out as fast as possible and as clean as possible. So why need to over cup for too long or lift so much. All you need is to go around as much the right half-side of the ball.<br><br>If you have any questions, and if you are free, let me know and I'll make time to go watch your game k.<br><br>I'm Nicholas Tan by the way.

I'm definitely sure that apart from me, there are many out there who sees your replies and go, "What the F..."<br>It just goes to show that while you are addressing the post, you arent really putting in something sensible.<br>You of cos feel its alright, otherwise why would you post in the first place? No bother replied to your posts regarding your replies because they couldn't be bothered to. I replied because I cannot tahan liao. You don't agree with me? Go read all your posts to various messages. At least 60 % or more are definitely not required...or necessary. And they simply dont make sense. Sometimes one sentence, sometimes 2...but ultimately, there's no need to post at all.<br>I'm not prejudiced against you..once or twice, still ok. It has happened many times...and I simply cannot tahan. You could jolly well say, cannot tahan then dont come into this forum lor. But I click every reply hoping to see something relevant to the topic. Otherwise I wouldnt click at all. And what reply do I get from you?
