            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To all members of Dimension - X on wed league at Silverbowl,<br><br>A team captain's meeting was held last night with regards to the possibility of cancellation of the 3rd leg due to the pulling out of several teams.<br><br>For half of leg 2 and whole of leg 2 we have been playing without the full complement of 12 league teams and another 2 have decided to stop after leg 2 (which finished last night), which led to many walkovers, sandbagging and all that.<br><br>The teams that have/are pulled/pulling out are CMM (who left so early that I don't even know who their members comprise of!), Silent Killers (the young punks) and the 2 representatives from Leisure Bowl (Infinity and Sam Pro Shop).<br><br>After a short discussion with the team captains last night, the management has decided to proceed on with leg 3 with the remaining 8 teams, but a different format will be followed.<br><br>They will be resetting the points and splitting the teams into 2 groups of 4. The top 4 teams (based on results from legs 1 and 2) in 1 group and the remaining 4 in 1 group. Sort of like a Serie A and Serie B..... anyway, we will play round robin of 7 sessions as per normal, but now we only need to be concerned with the results in our own group.<br><br>This was done so that the lower squads had something to play for. There was not much point for the lower squads to continue for another 7 sessions since they were already lagging so far behind. In case you're wondering, yes, that includes us! By virtue of our horrendous performances in the last 3-4 weeks, we are almost guaranteed of joining the second group!!!!!<br><br>Alright then, one more topic before I close shop. We will distribute the fines/rewards before the commencement of leg 3. Amt of rewards will be rounded to the nearest dollar, for better or worse. For the third leg there will not be any fines or rewards or whatever. Just get out there and whoop a**. Beer frames still apply!!!!!!<br><br>If you see me please remind me:<br><br>Mage: $23<br>WX: $19<br>Ding: $14<br>Deamon: $19<br>Jae: $5<br>Tom: $5<br><br>Interesting... James Shi didn't get reward pts but holds the highest average in the team. Go figure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Back to mundane matters.<br><br>Kicking off the final 7 sessions this week would be:<br><br>1) Tom<br>2) Mage (Subject to availability)<br>3) WX<br><br>Backup in case Mage can't show up is James... Shi, that is. More than able replacement, I assure you. But best you let me know asap so that I can inform him early.<br><br>Opponent this week is "Anonymous", who finished 7th out of the remaining 8 teams. Onus is on us to give them 1 x shallacking. But if people that bowl like dinosaurs can dump scores like 256 (eh Mage) on us, I suppose we should be ready for anything lah.<br><br>Next week there will not be league because of the National Masters. If you people are interested you can come down to watch the Nationals and generally bowlers of supreme quality bowl... bowling freaks like Lee Yu Wen, as Hanzz will testify.<br><br>Back to tomorrow, you guys go ahead alright, I'll be there about 9pm after work.</div>
