And of course how  rich you are.<br>There are bowling shoes which have a sliding sole for both, left and right side. I recommend that you choose one with only one side for sliding. If you are a leftie, then you slide with your right foot. If you are a rightie, you slide with your left foot. Of course there are un-recommended exceptions to this rule.<br>You would also want to know if the shoe has interchangeable sliding soles. There more interchangeable they are, the more kinds of lane approaches you will be able to better adapt to. Some lane approaches let you slide more. Some less. I will further elaborate on this later on. In the mean-time I would recomend only three brands. This is for durability and interchangeability reasons.<br>They are the SST series from Dexter(SST 4,5,6 are interchangaeble), the Kangaroo Series by ABS(these are me personal favourite). And the linds XXx-tra series( these used to be a favourite among spinners and ladies). Each Shoe has its strong point. But there is only one thing I do not like about ABS. Their non-sliding shoe is not as good as Dexters. Dexters has the best non-sliding shoe, because of the traction. ABS is the most interchangeable. Linds is the softest and lightest shoe, pretty durable too.<br>So read through what I've typed, tell me what you want your shoe to be able to do and what for, and I'll help you draw a conclusion.<br><br>2) Lane Types.<br><br>There are generally 2 types. Synthetic and Wooden. Wooden being the original and traditional lane type,  ie. Victor's Superbowl, Plaza Bowling Centre, Bukit Panjang Superbowl, Marina South Superbowl, Singapore Swimming Club, Serangoon Gardens Country Club, NSRCC, Marina Square Superbowl, to name a few. The other type would be Synthetic. This basically is a wooden lane with a plastic covering over it. There are 2 "generations" of the Synthetic Lane. One is the older one, ie at Keppel Club, Classic Bowl, Raffles Marina Club and Star Bowl Kim Seng, to name another few. The newer ones are the best, ie. Cathay Cineleisure, Cathay Safra Yishun, Cathay Safra Tampines, etc to name a few.<br><br>The difference is that wooden is harder to maintain. As the Surface on top is wood, which is soft, is more subjectable to wear and tear. Synthetic lanes on the other hand have a plastic covering on-top which is acts a protectve covering to reduce wear and tear tremendously. The 1st generation of synthetic lanes have more parts to it, thus making the lane less consistant. The 2nd generation is the most consistant, as it is made up of  only three main parts of lane.<br><br>As for the approach, usually the synthethic type are not as slippery as the wooden ones. This is mainly due to the characteristics of wood and plastic and what humidity does to their surfaces. Sanded wood is smoother and less tackier than buffed plastic. Synthetic lanes are wooden lanes with a plastic piece on top. Preferably there should be synthetic lanes with wooden approaches.Hehe.<br><br>3) Custom-made Bowling Balls<br><br>Yes there are custom-made everything. We can make clear-balls with anything in it, from teddy bears to a monster, which anyone can order. They are made in mainly Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China. Korea is cheaper though. We can also print pictures on the ball an cover it up with a clear covering to protect the picture. This is the Vis-A-Ball technology from Brunswick. Or you can get an engraver to engrave anything from your name to a dragon on the ball. Of course it will be mono-tone, but its the most affordable.<br>Also, there are factories in Korea, Japan, Taiwan and China which will make anything from bags to shoes to guards to shirts to socks to whatever you want. They will have whatever design you want. Even your own name for the brand. They are definitely cheaper, but you will need to order in bulk.<br>Linds (a shoe Company) will custom make shoes for you. This is their latest selling tactic. I think it will cost you slightly more per piece than if you order from Korea, but at least you can order a piece and not in bulk.........<br><br>Anyway, hope this helps and sorry for the long, long, long message.....CHEERS! </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Synthetic lanes tend to be more susceptible to carry down, i.e. when oil gets pushed down onto the buffed zones (last stretch of lane before the pins). And because this bit of the lane is supposed to be dry to allow the ball to bite and hook, the shot isn't as hard hitting and usually off target.<br><br>Wooden lanes on the other hand, are more consistent in that sense, but they break down faster. Personally,  i find that i have to make more changes on wooden lanes in the same span of time.</div>

This will create a wet backend (carrydown) and a dryer front area.<br><br>For wood lanes, oil displace by the ball tend to seep into the gaps in-between the strips of wood (or boards). Hence less carrydown.</div></blockquote>i get it liao !!! so paiseh, i very blur 1  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>
