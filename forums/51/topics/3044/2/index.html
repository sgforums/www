Just kidding, big guy.<br>I'm sure he wants to redeem himself next week. Brendan's going to play for sure too.<br>Ok, we got 2 points. We won 1 game, and I won my dude thanks to a decent final game. Otherwise we were pretty much overrun.<br><br>To both Harmy and Vonny:<br><br>Ok, now for the Adrenaline, pretty much drilled it up label leverage. pin just right of the ring finger, CG kicked out 1 inch from center of grip and bomb in the thumb, with a hole in the PAP. Ok, supposedly drilled for slightly over medium length with power backend, but size of backend hook depends StRoNgLy on both head oil (early/late roll) and carrydown. Hmm.<br><br>Well, played yesterday in league. Seemed pretty wet in the middle, with dryer outsides, oil seemed longer than usual, and the pin deck was oily!!!!!! SERIOUS, so many sliding pins it was ridiculous. I left a 5-7-10 combo. Ouch. Ok, due to my ball speed the ball revved up late most of the time and gave me a 5-7 board backend. Had to play pretty tight down the middle before trying a down and in (my least favourite) in the last stanza. Ended up with an indecent 158 avg.<br><br>I thought the ball was a dud, until I played today in Katong. What a difference! Stood way out at 30, flung it over around 19 at the arrows all the way out to about the 4 board, and it came back crunching the pocket. Beauty. Just what I wanted to see. If not for operator error (3 missed single pins) should have gotten more than my 183 avg over 3.<br><br>Analysis thus far. It's a beauty. I always loved Pearls. I love Ebonite. I love PET flakes, those shiny sparkles you find in the Afterburner and Matrix TRIMAX, and now on the Adrenaline. Wrap it up in a low volume particle shell, it did exactly what it was supposed to do. Glides well to provide length in dry, yet strong enough to overcome the wet (slow speed or dryer backend needed) and completely crush the pocket and send the pins low on the deck.<br><br>Thanks for reading so far!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It seems  your ball was drilled to the #1 drilling on Ebonite's drilling sheet. Looking at it, seems to be very unlike what you described it to be -  <blockquote>supposedly drilled for slightly over medium length with power backend</blockquote>.<br>The drilling seems to be for a <span style="font-style: italic;">smooth</span> and controllable backend, not a strong one. Let alone from the inside angle you play. Besides, i think your coverstock condition also played a big part in the reaction. in box condition, too much energy will be burnt up and none left for the turn - if there weren't oil rings on the ball, it means this is right.<br><br>Anyway, it seems to have only medium length. about the same as my heat 2 pearl.<br><br>ps. i don't think the adrenaline counts as a pearl.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i didn't think the ball was pearlised inspite of its phasing because the Track Voodoo isn't classified as a pearl despite it's cover.<br>The number of boards a ball covers after making the turn is not a function of drilling. It's more an equation which includes elements of the bowler's characteristics and ball cover vs. lane condition match-up which eventually determine how much energy is left <strong>after</strong> the turn. i.e. how many more boards the ball can still travel after changing directions. the drilling only changes this by dictating what shape (arc/snap/straight) the hook takes on - the number of boards covered is always down to the energy retained in the ball.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I'd better try again at Tampines before making too much of a comparison.<br><br>In any case, if you're looking for a strong ball to handle medium-medium heavy conditions and you've got a bit of moolah, it isn't a bad choice at all, seeing the results from my 7 games with this ball. Slow speed strokers, especially those who like playing down and in, please stay away though.<br><br>On the league, does anyone know how many points we are behind 18th?<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 15 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>two weeks ago, i think we were somewhere around 11 points off. after that... not sure. I'm sure Ding knows - he scrutinises the scoreboards after every league session.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Prata  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I think your release helps the ball get further down the lane. you have so much turn the ball probably doesn't sit up and roll until beyond 30 ft. I think a higher flaring pattern would allow you to have a stronger 'pop' in the oil, because it bites earlier. you seem very susceptible to squirting on your trauma. a pattern drilled to bite early would kill the syndrome. but you'll need some head oil to do that.<br><br>Anyway, i'm in need of a ball to play on carrydown. i reckon that's all i need. i've been playing a lot on synthetics lately and they've revealed one of my glaring weaknesses. i haven't even realised until now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> I think i'll need flare for that too.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You would be the first guy to notice, I reckon. But you've hit the jackpot once again. My Trauma gets super squirty on oily conditions, many 1-2-4 leaves, thanks to my huge amount of "wrap". But I've been working on it to try to stay behind it longer... to get that stupid track higher!!!!<br><br>I got the Adrenaline just for this rea....... ok, so I was bluffing. I got it because I liked the look of it. I guess you knew that already.<br><br>By the way, is anyone interested in continuing this league when it ends? Or perhaps joining another? We didn't fare very well thus far, but I really enjoy playing with all of you and wouldn't mind doing it again. Enjoyment of the game is by far more important to me than beating the crap out of everybody. (although that's fun too) Trust me, all of you make me want to play with you dudes (and lady, oops!) again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>really, i don't think your release is the problem. it's a good, solid release. Everyone can do with more variations in their repetoire though!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>I think more of a factor is the Trauma: it is an 'aggressive reactive'(i believe this is the term they now use) pearl designed to go long and snap. this makes it very unstable in carrydown because it doesn't bite until the back and carrydown doesn't allow this. all pearls suffer from this, unless drilled to flare a lot, such as a 4x4 or 3 3/8 pattern. even then, this would just reduce the squirt, not eliminate it. One needs a solid ball that bites evenly more throughout the lane, so that over/under can be avoided on carrydown. i get the same problem with my pearls too - i only get away (partially) with it because my shots roll a bit more than yours, so they bite earlier. That's why i need another ball! i like pearlised balls so much, almost all my balls are pearls (drilled to go long w/o flare), so i cannot handle carrydown. i hit the pocket, but the carry isn't there. And in tourneys, 3 spares while your opponent strings 3 strikes means i'm already 35 - 40 pins behind.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ho ho ho!!<br><br>Looks like we have the same tastes in balls!<br>Bowling balls! Pearls! Yay! Except that I DO like flare in my drillings, the Trauma is mild though.<br><br>Wait a minute, minus off the Clear Wolf and the low end Flame Reactive, Pearls are all I have for strike balls. Never seem to really like solids.... the only ones I ever had success with is the Messenger Ti and the Mega Cuda (Hmm! Columbian solids!). Pearls are good ... hmm.... squirty. But on dry, watch out!<br><br>Maybe it's time to take that rusting Vortex II out of the locker and get it drilled after all. Or consider taking the Super Power off the transfer list.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 15 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, pearls look THE best. My best was my Triton Heat. She was a beaut! I had to retire it because it cracked.

EVERYTIME.<br>Btw, the Flame reactive is supposed to be a dry lane strike ball. So you are still all pearls.  :p<br>I'm thinking of getting the voodoo, but the messenger Ti pearl is there... ARGHHH!!!! n..n..e....e.d mo...r..e m..on...ey...<br><br>I don't really like the league there - it's too damn far! But i do really like the idea of us all playing together.
