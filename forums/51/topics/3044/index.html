            <div class='col-md body'>Alright Gladiators!<br><br>Buckle up. Let's all get behind the wagon and claw more points for us to take at least 18th spot.<br><br>The team has been doing decently of late, and what better way to solidify our bid for a late charge, than to play the league's cellar dwellers next week?<br><br>Did a bit of recce we did. Their top bowler's average is a little over 165, and a couple linger below 160, the others much lesser than that. Nothing less than at least 8 points will suffice next week.<br><br>What's up with Yvonne? Haven't seen or heard her playing for a pretty long while? Is she alright? We need her back in the fray. Playing a league with ... lemme see, Jae, Weixiang, Ding, Chuanish, Ian, myself, Brendan, Federick.. 8 guys (did I leave anyone out?) is really not enough.<br><br>p/s: Freemun, hope ye got it all figured out, boss. Yesterday was... aahhh... not so pretty, I guess.. to put it mildly. Ding told me he never saw you play like that before.<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 21 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 21 February 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 21 February 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got a couple of updates from my friends who went to the Chevrons that said the system there was very buggy. Lanes wise, they mentioned it's something like Cineleisure standard. Not sure what that means, cause I haven't bowled there before.<br><br>The systems were brought over from Lot 1, and they aren't new. Lanes wise, reports has it that the approaches are slicker than a block of ice. Well, that was the impression I got anyway.<br><br>Would love to go, but I am kinda like on the other end of the island.<br><br>Out of topic, I do have a 15 lb super power and flame reactive to let go if anyone is interested. Prettier parties get a heavier discount, just that people who use 15 lbs don't really tend to be little petite pretty people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hihi, I just returned from a session on the abovementioned Chevrons alley. A couple of points:<br><br>1) The parking there is the same system as Tanah Merah - cannot get 'subsidies' with SAFRA card. When i got there today, it was POURING. Cats and dogs. So i follow the sign to the carpark... it was... open-air.. ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Basically, by the time i got to the safety of the building (running with ball, bags, etcetera... under a brolly), i was approximately 3 pounds heavier - all in fluids.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br>2) The lanes are from Lot 1, this is a concurrance. And they stink! I'm not sure how hard the blokes there have been working, but it's sure taking them a long time to get the ball returns and scoring machines to actually work. More often than not, throw a ball and the lane shuts down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> Really a test of 'character'. haha<br><br>3) For tonight, at least, the lanes were laid out with a reverse block with, get this - a 60 feet pattern. Not kidding here. They were still sanctioning the lanes (a process of determining the levelness of the lane surface; requires the use of lane conditioner all the way to the pindeck). Therefore, there was no backend. Zip. Zilch. Negative. Here's a reference - for those of you who know my style - i managed to play from 22nd board thru the 2nd arrow and managed to get a turn to the pocket. But there was no 'bite'. So the ball turned, but didn't grip. Hit was sill solid, but only on very high pockets. Unlike the usual, when the ball speeds up after the break and zooms into the pocket. I had to put so much roll on the ball to get it to turn, it rolled-out a couple of times.<br><br>4) The approach was, IMO, slick. I use Dexter SST5s, and was stuck using the number 2 sole with the number 2 heel, i think. Not too clear on the numbers. But they are both the least slide in their categories. I don't have the red colour sole, but i thought that would have worked better. Oh well. It's slick. And  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> p-a-t-c-h-y.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> But it's not that way for everyone. Yvonne actually complained that there WASN'T enough slide. She used maximum slide on her Linds eXXXtra - still wasn't enough. Go figure.<br><br>That's all i have folks. If you decide to go, it's on the 4th floor.<br><br>------------------<br>Always remember: It's easier to spare from a channelball than a split. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
