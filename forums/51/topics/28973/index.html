            <div class='col-md body'>hihi...to those who knew about it, I went to widen the inside of the thumb plug already. Now the problem is I am uncomfortable with the new taping method..the Remy Ong style. Erm, tape from thumb nail downwards. My main problem before widening was the inside of the thumb at the side of the joint. Erm...give a Hitler salute, look at the joint of the thumb touching the whole palm. That part of the thumb.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Ok, anyway, that was the part where it was getting stuck. Now I widened the thumb plug, it felt better. But a tad little wider than expected. I know I can tape my thumb to solve this problem, but do I stick to the old method of taping(thumb inside to outside at the sides), or the Remy Ong method? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>I tried the ball and felt if my thumb was slightly moist, the portion sticking to the thumb plug was still that area....<br>Aw man, I'll just explain again on Thursday during training...<br>very hard to ask here without visual aid.

Erm, tape from thumb nail downwards. My main problem before widening was the inside of the thumb at the side of the joint<br>that was the part where it was getting stuck. Now I widened the thumb plug, it felt better. But a tad little wider than expected.<br></blockquote>the reason why you are getting your thumb stuck at the joint area is probably bcos you are gripping your ball too hard.<br>the new taping method is to smooth out the loose skin area below the nail which is likely to increase friction restricting a smooth release.<br>to overcome your original thumb stuck problem, you have to make the thumb hole snug so that it is the skin and more of your fingers that is holding the ball weight, not your thumb.<br>that is exactly what remy ong is doin ..making his thumb snug by creating moist in the thumb hole by blowing in air. (if that is what you are refering to)<br><br>so first of all before you can make any improvement, you have to make sure the thumb hole is customised to fit your thumb snugly.<br>i did the hole at Sam's pro shop (eastside) but the difference here is i did it with the advise of Uncle Fox.<br>Sam no doubt is a very good driller bt you have to couple it with Uncle Fox's coaching expertise to phase out the probelm.<br><br>you would definitely face many problems bcos we are aredi used to our past release. i was demoralised and frustrated bt you have to press on.<br>it all comes with nothing bt <strong>consistent</strong> practice. bcos you have to get used to the new release and forget the old one.<br><br><blockquote><br>I know I can tape my thumb to solve this problem, but do I stick to the old method of taping(thumb inside to outside at the sides), or the Remy Ong method?<br></blockquote>you shd not tape the inside cos it wd defeat the purpose of making the hole snug and you end up gripping the ball too hard again.<br>as uncle fox said, the strength you use to grip the ball shd not be more than the strength you need to hold a chick. (squeeze too hard and the chick wd die.)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>we can exchange pointers during thurs training if i had fail to clear your doubts.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>oh...ok.<br>i know some people find the loose skin on the top of the thumb the factor, but it didnt give me any.<br>so far, the point of pressure i have is that area on my thumb, which i agree is due to me gripping.<br>But there are times where I didnt grip at all(my mind concentrate on not gripping), and although the ball went kinda shitty, but my fingers and thumb felt pressure-less.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Ok, I'll bring my ball on Thurs and we'll see how.

            <div class='col-md body'>Jason, my grip on the ball can kill a grown chicken. Not just any chicken, but one which has undergone intensive weight training and a healthy dose of steroids. Gripping too damn hard lah.<br><br>Fox's "anti-wussy" method of using thumb tape is helping though. A nice snug fit results in a more relaxed grip, as well as the ability to throw it smoothly. Smooth-er at least.<br><br>Starting to understand what you meant by "...throwing till you feel high...". Not second nature yet though, but hoping to get there.<br><br></div>

Otherwise I risk the ball getting stuck due to a moist thumb. I have a high-moisture rate thumb. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>Anyway, I also found that I cannot throw the ball if I use too much reverse pitch. But if I play a little in between forward and reverse, I can manage a smoother release. My fingers and wrist also feels natural with a little forward pitch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>I might try for a slightly more forward pitch for my new ball than my current ball.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>harmzuay is right...<br>the pitch in the thumbhole, its already drilled in a certain angle. if u dun like it, redrill it, not change the position of ur own thumb by gripping or doing some other muscle work. get watever pitch u wan that suits u and relax in delivering the ball. thats the best way for consistancy.</div>
