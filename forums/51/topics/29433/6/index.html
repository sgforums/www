Got a tough run coming up, we faced the 3rd and 4th placed teams (as of this week) in the next fortnight.<br><br>As of now, the projected lineup next week (9/1) comprises of:<br>Tom/Brendan, Dinghua, Weixiang/Jay and myself.<br><br>Projected lineup week after (16/1) comprises of:<br>Tom/Brendan, Titan, Jae, Weixiang/Jay<br><br>Sorry for the uncertainty, have to check availability with individual players.<br><br></div>

Thing is, the first round's results will NOT be taken into the 2nd leg and 3rd legs (that is, all points are back to 0 after leg 1). The top 3 teams after the first leg will get some $$$, then everything is reset to 0. Not bad eh? The slate is wiped clean and we get a fresh start!<br><br>HOWEVER... the handicaps remain. Now, I'm not asking you to sandbag or anything, but considering that we're now in 9th place out of 12 (and that was before yesterday's whitewash) with just 4 weeks left in leg 1.... we don't have a chance of getting in the top 3.<br><br>So, on 30th Jan and 6th Feb (week 10 and 11 - last 2 sessions of leg 1), I'll be sending out the "rookies" (Tom, Hayden, Jason) to get more exposure - if they're willing and available, and a couple of you who would probably benefit from getting further aclimatised to the conditions.<br><br>Just play your games, test out what you learn in training on league conditions, and don't worry about the scores at all. To put it bluntly, they won't really matter till week 12, when leg 2 begins.<br></div>
