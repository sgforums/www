            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing against Brendan, but Ding is right. When you have Freemun anchoring the team like we had on Thurs, you know you have a lack of depth in the squad, anchor-quality. BUT, everyone who can play has already played (12 of us), and we can't make changes now.... so.....<br><br>Mage, our main "main man", is away charging mountains and digging trenches. Even James, whom we pin such high hopes on, managed to have an off-day from the first slot, much less the anchor slot. Problem also is we can't expect James to play all the time, he does have a shop and a business to run. Have to assume they are "out" most of the time.<br><br>Still very early, but right now our 3 leaders in terms of averages are:<br><br>1) Mage, avg 197 (3 gms)<br>2) Prata, avg 187 (6 gms)<br>3) WX, avg 181 (3 gms)<br><br>Fearfully enough, at last glance, Brendan was the dude with the lowest handicap after these 3, at 16 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> That should have changed from last Thurs results... think Jae could be least now. No wait... I'm not sure about Ding and Phua....have to go check.<br><br>( Been neglecting my Katong stats..... oops. More concentrated on the Classic one! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> )<br><br>What does that mean? Lots of anchor practice for me and WX when we do play. I'd like to think that we can "hold our own" against most when we ain't too careless <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">, but certainly not against the top teams. Madness. Having James and Jay Soong at max handicap will help in a way, too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Player1,<br><br>That equation will only work if you're playing against a scratch opponent, ie 0 handicap. Which isn't really likely, unless we're playing against 4 scratch bowlers, and/or we field 4 max handicap bowlers. Which is even unlikelier.<br><br>The oiling is actually not heavy on the outside. In fact, it's a rather clean backend and thin outsides on league nights. You may be referring to your ball's late breakpoint, or failure to turn enough to the pocket.<br><br>2 things:<br><br>1) You favour an inside line, more often than not. You make your ball travel through the oil in the middle part of the lane first, so this extra sliding in the oil will cause your ball to sometimes skid past or go outside of the optimum break point.<br><br>2) A Shock Zone was built for length and snap. Skid is already imbued into the coverstock, you certainly didn't need to help it by moving so deep so quickly.<br><br>Perhaps it will be better for you to start outside and shoot a straighter line almost parallel to the gutter, and move in as necessary. Play what the lane gives you, rather than trying to overpower it.</div>
