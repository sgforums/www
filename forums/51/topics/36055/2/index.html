This is true and people <strong>KNOW</strong> that. In fact they sometimes do not want to try any balls that are not specifically manufactured for the Asian market as they know that these balls are designed for the Heavy-Bowlers in mind. Just look at the history of such "Asian" balls and you can easily tell that they are some of the <strong>BEST</strong> spinners' ball ever produced!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Good examples are balls are Ultra-C, Legacy 7 Star, Ninja, and some of the Wolf Series that never even appear on the offical line-ups of ball manufactures!!!<br><br>It's not that i'm trying to put down certain brands but it's juz that everyone knows that balls work best for the bowler and lanes it was designed for. So why buy a ball that is meant to hook to spin when you can buy a ball <strong>DESIGNED</strong> to spin right form the beginning???<br><br>Furthermore most American balls do not have any core for balls under 12lbs while almost every "Asian" has one that actually is designed to aid spinners in trying to increase torque and revs. Thus from my humble opinon, this could be the reason why some bowlers find Columbia balls easier to control as they do not flip as much without a core.<br><br>But with everything said and done, the end of the story is that bowlers themselves have a responsibilty to survey and <strong>FIND</strong> the ball that is suitable or compliments his/her style. I never believe in blindly listening to what other people say about a particular ball and religiously expect it to do the same for my game. Know what you need and what you want from the ball. At the end of the day, it's gonna be you bowling and not the rest of the world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

With regard to you saying that American lightweight balls do not have a core in their bowling balls, have you actually seen taiwanese balls having a core? I personally have not seen any half ball displays of those taiwanese balls that show there is actually a core in it. I personally have spoken to a certified local coach and he stated that if you spin a spinner ball with a core in it, the track will be in a different area than where normal spinner tracks will be. Most importantly for a spinner, whether there is a core or not in it is not the main factor. The one most important factor in how you determine how the ball is going to roll is by it's surface. Do you actually go into a pro shop and ask the pro shop operator which core is going to help you get more revs and spin? That's just plain silly. No matter what level of play you are at, the pro shop operator is basically going to recommend you bowling balls based on the surface, that is for spinners.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is getting interesting.<br>point to note. which coach did u talk to? it makes a difference. some certified coaches i know, know nuts, and a certain ex national bowler also said something i really disagree wif. boils down to what you believe is true and whether u experimented it yourself.<br><br>anyway,<br>cores do make a difference no matter in which ball and whether u play hook or spin or plain throw it.<br>BUT, i do not note any difference in the track whether there is a core present or not. logically speaking, the core is to help the ball transit, once it GRIPS the lanes. so, before it does hold on to the lanes, how you throw it remains the same. if u play a high track, your ball remains high tracked no matter what. the only thing that changes due to the core is the flare!<br><br>do u also know that a ball can flare yet not transit?<br><br>another point from a personal view.<br>i play a high track hook, and i have used many balls, ranging from house balls, spinners balls ( all for fun of course) and my own bowling balls with whichever cores. all my tracks are the same. if it applies to a hook bowler, i really do not tink a spinner would have a difference.<br><br>ALSO, if a core or rather, a lack of a core makes a difference in track, it would also imply that a change of core, ie pancake to bulb or mushroom or whichever u want, would change your track. <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">so, that implies that a low track bowler that wants to convert to a high track need only to change balls with a different core and viola! high track!</span></strong><br>this i doubt is the case.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mine too.<br>my track for the shockzone pro is higher, as compared to the complete chaos.<br>i dunno why, but i thought it was because of the drilling for both balls, put more weight on the side of one ball, thus the difference. Which would mean that the core and how u drill ard the core, apart from release and revs, will decide the track?<br>Anyway, my track for shoczone pro is not only higher, it isn't as nice as the CC in that, u do not see rings that spiral across. i get messier rings that just runs ard the ball...pretty weird...</div>
