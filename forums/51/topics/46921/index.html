Less than a minute later, he returned to his seat next to his mom. He had the look of obvious relief on his young face.<br>"Did you make it all the way to the bushes, Johnny?"<br>"I didn't have to go that far, mom.<br>Just as I got to the front door, I found a box that had a sign on it: FOR THE SICK.''<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After lunch, a bear and a rabbit decided to go for a stroll to walk off lunch. Evidently, a little exercise does help ease digestion as 20 minutes later, they found themselves crapping in a secluded part of the woods.<br><br>While doing their business, the bear had this burning question to ask his rabbit friend, but was too shy to pose it. However, the bear finally mustered up whatever courage he had and asked, "Hey... uh... there's something i really need to know about..."<br>"What is it?" the rabbit questioned, sensing a weird tone in his buddy's voice.<br><br>The bear took in a breath and then said, "Do you, like, get bothered when the fur gets stained with crap?"<br><br>The rabbit was surprised by the question, but hid his shock. "Maybe Mr Big Badass Bear of the forest is getting soft." he thought.<br>"Nah, of course not. It happens all the time, and cleanup is a piece of cake." the rabbit said. The bear thought about it, and said "Oh... uh, okay."<br><br>After a while, the bear, clearly unconvinced, asked again, "Really? I mean, isn't it gross, with the poo sticking to the fur like that?"<br><br>Growng impatient, the rabbit repeated his stand. "No, it doesn't bother me at all, it's just a lttle dirty, that's all!"<br><br>The bear was glad he could have this conversation, and proceeded to wipe his ass with the rabbit.</div>

Ah Seng and his frens started to pull 2 bags each, slowly dragging them across the floor.<br>Suddenly, they heard footsteps and fearing the security guards, they each hid in a gunny sack lying against the wall with the other sacks of potatoes.<br>The security guards walked in and saw 6 bags of potatoes near the entrance. Fearing thieves, they walked around until they neared Ali~! Ali was terrified, but he remembered alot of cats around his neighbourhood. So he started meowing. The security guards heaved a sigh of relief and walked to the other bag, this time, with Ah Seng in IT~! Ah Seng, was quick and remembered his dog at home. He started to bark. The security guards heaved another sigh of relief and walked towards the bag WITH MUTHU!<br>Muthu started to think and think. What can he impersonate? Finally, he smiled as he remembered what they were in for. Without any further hesitation, he said loudly "POTATO..POTATO..."<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

That's it! I want a divorce!" the wife fumed.<br><br>The husband looked her straight in the eye and said, "Are you sure you want to give up our big house in the suburbs, your Mercedes, your furs, your jewelry, and our vacation home in Mexico?"<br><br>For a long time they continued dining in silence. Finally, the woman nudged her husband and said, "Isn't that Howard over there? Who's he with?"<br><br>"That's HIS mistress," her husband replied.<br><br>"Oh," she said, taking a bite of dessert. "Ours is much cuter."</div>

Say, what's with that group ahead of us? They're rather slow aren't they?"<br>The greens keeper replied, "Oh, yes, that's a group of blind firefighters. They lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we always let them play for free anytime."<br>The group was silent for a moment.<br>The pastor said, "That's so sad I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight."<br>The doctor said, "Good idea. And I'm going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if there's anything he can do for them."<br>The engineer said, "Why can't these guys play at night?"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Two young engineers applied for a single position at a computer company. They both had the same qualifications. In order to determine which individual to hire, the applicants were asked to take a test by the department manager.<br>Upon completion of the test, both men had each missed only one of the questions. The manager went to the first applicant and said, ''Thank you for your interest, but we've decided to give the job to the other applicant.''<br>"And why would you be doing that? We both got nine questions correct," asked the rejected applicant.<br>"We have based our decision not on the correct answers, but on the question you missed," said the department manager.<br>"And just how would one incorrect answer be better than the other?" the rejected applicant inquired.<br>''Simple,'' said the department manager, ''Your fellow applicant put down on question #5, 'I don't know.' You put down, 'Neither do I.'''<br></div>

Of course they shared a room. There was a bathroom and 2 separate showers with curtains and all that. Then one of them said "Where's the soap?" and the other guy said " I left it outside with our luggage". Since he was already a bit wet he didn't want to put on his clothes again so he went out naked. So he went out and found the 2 bars of soap in his luggage and started back towards the room. Suddenly 3 woman started walking down the hall. Of course he didn't want them to see him naked so he posed as a statue. The 3 women saw him and started discussing about how life like it was. One of them snickered and walked towards the naked man, and pulls his penis. Of course in pain he drops the bar of soap. And the woman smiles and says hey neat its a soap dispenser. So the next woman comes up and pulls it even harder. And of course in extreme pain with out saying anything he drops the second bar of soap. Then the last one comes up and pulls lightly and says "hey its not working" so she keeps pulling. Then finally she says "Hey I got liquid soap!"<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A deserter soldier was running down a road escaping from two<br>Military police.<br><br>He came to a fork in the road and saw a nun standing there. He<br>asked her "Please Sister, may I hide under your skirts for a few minutes. I'll explain why later."<br><br>The nun agreed to his request. Shortly thereafter, the two MPs<br>came running along and asked her if she had seen a soldier running down the road.<br><br>She replied, "He went that way".<br><br>After the MPs disappeared, the soldier crawled out from under her<br>skirt and said, "I can't thank you enough Sister, but you see I don't want to go to Iraq."<br><br>The nun said she understood. The GI said,<br>"I hope you don't think me rude or impertinent, but you have the<br>most beautiful pair of legs I've ever seen!"<br><br>The nun replied, "If you had looked a little higher, you would have seen the most beautiful pair of balls you've ever seen!<br><br>I don't want to go to Iraq either!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>$500 Porsche</strong><br>A man was reading the paper when an ad caught his eye: $500 Porsche! New! The man thought that it was very unusual to sell a Porsche for $500, and he thought it might be a joke, but thought it was worth a shot. So he went to the lady's house and sure enough, she had an almost brand new Porsche.<br>"Wow!" the man said. "Can I take it for a test drive?" Unlike what he expected, the man found that the car ran perfectly and took it back to the lady's house.<br><br>"Why are you selling me this great Porsche for only $500?"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>"My husband just ran off with his secretary, and he told me I could have the house and the furniture as long as I sold his Porsche and sent him the money."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

When I got fired, you were there to support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you were by my side. When we lost the house, you gave me support.
