The forum seems really slow these past few days.<br><br>If given a choice, which player would you choose as a team mate?<br>a) a proven scorer who consistently plays good, solid games (180 - 190,  for discussion's sake) but is horrible as a person. Perhaps someone you cannot stand to even speak to.<br><br>b) a player who is liked by all the rest of the team (assuming a 4-person team) and always maintains the team's mental game by raising morale, but is not noted for his scoring game.

Let me just give a small example (If you're reading this, you did say it, Lenny).<br><br>He started out hot, stringing 4 in a row (this was his first league outing at CBC), then he left a ringing 10 on his fifth shot. He turned around with a really frustrated look, then muttered loudly "Aiyah, nothing to play for already".<br><br>My my, the looks on all the uncles/aunties' faces were, let's just say "disapproving".<br><br>Harmy, if that's the case, I'll take B then.

He chosed the team with the highest chances of winning.<br><br>If the leader chose Mr A: then I would think he is a even better leader, someone with compassion. You're giving your friend a 2nd chance. I think that's a very noble decision. Of course there will be a lot of negative stuff if the friend fails to redeem himself. Sort of like politics.
