            <div class='col-md body'>well, no hard feelings, clown...<br><br>guess there's a difference between ur ideas and perception and our's.<br><br>i have to be frank that a lot of us, including me, can't really quite accept the fact of being 'judge' by another fellow bowler, esp so when such judgement are made by someone who are not really close to us.<br>Maybe u can try to be more considerate as to how to put ur view points across properly, as i can see that most of ur posts meant well, but are too blunt......i admit that most of us here are screwed up bowlers, we know that, and we'll improve from there, and it juz doesn't feel nice when we'r having a bad patch, and someone juz comes along abd rub salt into our wounds...it hurts lor.<br><br>anyway, this is how i feel, so take my comments with a pinch of salt, k?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>and i would like to take this opportunity to say that u'r a good bowler<br>and hopefully in the future, i can match up to u one on one, on the lanes, of coz... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yo Clown.....U're not goin to walk out on us.....I'm not going to allow it.......this is about bowling not politics.....<br><br>Listen up all of you, everyone is different. Who wants to bowl with lousy bowlers? Who wants to lose? I don't. Its just like as everyone has our differences, bowling is no different.  Everyone has different bowling standards. I'm not one to preach but come on ya'all... wateva clown did or say, he did it coz he personally believes he meant well. No one would knowingly do something wrong. We only do stuff we believe is good or at least acceptable, unless of coz if that person is wack, a little screwed in the head....<br><br>A Champion ad in the States said this...since when did atheletes become politicians? When did the word negotiate end up in the boxing ring?<br><br>This is all about bowling......Clown should understand by now where the misunderstanding lies. If not, i think we owe him an explaination and tell him where he went wrong. Some of us have already done that... So why all these thanks and byes? The only way to enjoy the game is to put our differences aside and give in a little....<br><br>Clown......irregardless of how good or lousy a bowler u are, I don't care...Not even about what u have done wrong....u're always welcome to have a game or 2 or 3 or 4 or whenever u can with me.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
