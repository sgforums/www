            <div class='col-md body'>well, ask ard the bowlers (esp those whom u'r familiar with) in the alley who frequents the pro shop. Good drillers help a lot in providing advices. I've had experiences with drillers who jus told me to leave the ball in his shop, and collect it after 2 days, without even listening as to what i want the ball to do...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>BP  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> (Bukit Panjang?) maybe Chuanish visited that Pro Shop before?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

For me, i will feel "heartache" to see scratches on new ball. For a older ball, got a lot of tracks and scratches, u won't feel so bad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>I know mr air grinder is seling 2nd hand balls, u may want to mail him to enquire abt the balls.

            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Deamon.<br><br>There's no disgrace in skimping on your first, style-forming ball and investing in a solid pair of shoes. As any bowler worth their salt will tell you, good shoes are more important than having good balls.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">   You can get a second hand ball for about $30-50 and re-drill it for another $40. That's a lot of savings for a better pair of shoes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>smoking in  their shop doesnt mean they arent good at wat they do man.<br><br>i dun tink a second hand ball saves much. if u buy the package,<br>example: $165 for package,  against 2nd hand ball, $30.<br>pay for redrilling, up to $40. thats $70. need a bag? lets say a lousy one (unless u wanna start like me, use a old travel bag) another $25? thats $95 so far. a pair of shoes? the idea is to get a better pair yeah? a good pair costs at least $150? in the meantime? get a zeta striker? u may save like 20-30 if u get the zeta, but as a start i prefer,<br><br>buy the package, talk to the driller, know him. and his methods. see if he is interested in ur business. best if u have a friend who knows abit more about bowling, see if the driller knows wat he is doing ie: measuring span, thumb size etc. usually if u get 2nd hand balls the driller aint too keen on them. esp if u havent been to him b4.<br><br>i find the extra 20-30 is used as a base to invest in the driller. a better bowler-driller relationship provides for a better bowling experience.<br><br>PS: i tink ken sucks, relative to wat ding says. over priced, arrogant, and paul hangs around. better pray u have a face he likes if paul is there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you want to build from the ground up, start with plastic. Urethane forces many people to get caught up in the "hook fever", where they ignore basics and simply try to hook the ball more. This breeds bad habits into their game which can take months simply to eradicate.<br><br>As for Ken... I dislike him too. He's a good driller, undoubtedly. He's just too showy and that leads to arrogance sometimes. Besides Paul, he actually has another "kah gia" called Ah Poh. Basically, they serve the "regular" and "gold" customers. Only the platinum class customers get Ken's full attention. Haha.

            <div class='col-md body'>a good driller caters to the bowler. optimizes the style of the bowler and not tell the bowler he is wrong. after all, bowling has no true right methods. ie jack wong who says i cannot hook a ball.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>also, a good driller will spend the time needed to do a good fit.not just whack a hole in the ball and pass it to u saying it is drilled. for those who saw my thumb... well, thats a bad driller for u. thank god that driller retired or else...<br><br>anyway, the above are just my views. already found a driller i can click wif. goodluck to u =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah. Ask around b4 you go into a pro shop. My first experience of getting a proshop to redrll a 2nd hand ball (my first ball...Columbia Power Torq) led to a disaster! Imagine he passed me a ball with many holes, try out which span i like without explaining to me anything and drilled my first ball!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br>Thinking back, I feel like an idiot! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  Hahaha!<br>I'm still upset with the driller <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  and had not patronise his drilling,but  sometimes he still sells stuff to me cheaply!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>So the morale of the story  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  Get someone who bowls regularly to go with you to advise you, rather that you get con and blaffled by the pro shop owner!<br>Why dun you post which pro shop you intenting to go, see if anyone from this forum knows the owner and can accompany you. Guess most of us would be glad to help.! CHEERS!@ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Anyway, he didn't always treat me like this. When i first patronised him, i got the same treatment as you did.<br><br>I guess that what we call faith or loyalty. One party has to start it.

            <div class='col-md body'>My personal experience, I had visited ......8 proshops, 5 of them whom I actually employed their services.<br>1) When I was just starting out, this 1st driller i visited gave me a wrong pitch, cause long term but minor injury to my thumb.<br>2) The 2nd driller drilled a ball where I dun feel comfortable; my ring finger felt "stretch".<br>3) Went to the 3rd driller to correct this problem.<br>4) Went to the 4th driller to correct the pitch problem (I didnt know the pitch was wrong until then).<br>5) Went to the 5th driller to drill my balls and had been with him since. With this 5th driller, I felt no major problems except the thumb angle.<br><br>However, am looking for the 6th driller, as this 5th driller had increased his price and is out to "cut vegetable head".  WOW! Me and my history with drillers.<br><br>Cant blame the drillers all the time cause sometimes we gave them incorrect info. For me, I sometimes just dun know wat is best for me until I roll the ball down the lane, and by then might be too late. Think I am still learning how to communicate and workout a pattern that fits me.<br><br>......a lifelong learning process (and of course, not cheap too)....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe life is fuul of experiance or watever.<br>to me, maybe i am lucky. i got to know some friends while i was bowling alone during my poly days. and they happen to be either training in the national team or represented some schools.<br><br>so with their recommandations i got to get a whole set( ball, shoe, bag and accessories) for juz under 400. as i am a hooker, and the hammer ball i got was really worth while.<br><br>perhaps its already a outdated news cos its quite some time. hope u get to know some ppl like these and enjoy with their "influence" .</div>
