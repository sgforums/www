            <div class='col-md body'>Hi~! I have yet another question...I think the 7 arrows AFTER the foul line is the same distance as the first row of dots where u stand?<br>Am I right to say that?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Because, for example, if I were to use a 5,10,15,20,15,10,5 boards to explain, supposedly I want to release the ball on the foul line on the centre arrow...20 board?<br>And the ball to reach the 15 board on left(i left hander) down the lane, should I stand on the 15 board on the right? or more the the right?<br>I assume approach line(the line we walk) and the swing should be parallel. So should I stand on the 15 board right, or make allowance for it and stand 12/13board on right??? This to release on the 20 board and ball to reach 15 board left on lane. Assume a straight line walking approach. pls help. Cos I am reading somewhere that if u walk in a line different to tat of the swing, you might screw ur throw so that it does not go where u aimed.<br>THANKS!!!! help~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> [/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah kao..so many numbers i blur liao.<br><br>It doesnt mean u have to walk a striaght line to the approach. the swing can also be adjusted towards the line u wanna play.<br>eg. u wanna play 15 - 10. and ur placement is 5 boards and no drift. ur right foot should end on the 20 board. now, there are 2 ways to reach the 20 board from ur starting step.<br>1) straight from 20 end at 20, armswing outwards towards the 10 board.<br>2) or, walk a diagonal line towards the 20 board.<br><br>it kinda depends on wat u are used to. i myself prefer walking straight down to the board i wan to reach.<br>it doesnt really matter wat method u use as long as u reach ur target and deliver to the correct line.<br><br>points to note.<br>left hander, ur leftmost board is 1st board.<br>right hander, ur right most board is 1st board. we assume as such.<br>makes things clearer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry i forgot to mention about the armswing u were talking about.<br><br>i have no concrete foundation guides but i tink that as long as ur swing is straight( wat i mean by straight is meaning a good natural pendulum swing) it doesnt matter if ur swing is an inward out, or a outward in.<br><br>many bowlers use both types to play the lanes.<br>eg, for pin 10 (pin 7 for u) i stand on the 34 board, feet facing straight down the lane but armswing outwards towards 20 board. therefore having an outwards in swing.<br>vice versa for pin 7 for me.<br><br>i suppose all here will have their own methods but i must say, its all about ur own comfort. if u are comfortable wif it, i say u stick wif it. its prob the way that gives u the highest chance to spare.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi player1,<br>i'd like to share a few pointers with you. it might be useful but than again its my own view to this question that you.ve posted.<br><br>1) firstly you have to take into consideration that you have no drift.<br>meaning that you walk straight towards your target and do not<br>drift. eg. (i stand on 20th board and finish at 20th board at the<br>foul line)<br><br>2) well if i remember correctly, it is 15ft from foul line to the arrow<br>zone and it is also 15ft from foul line to the dots on the approach.<br>so if you want to swing the ball out to 15th board (3rd arrow), for<br>lefties, and finish at the foul line at centre (20th board), you are<br>swinging outwards at a line of 5 boards, for every 15ft. which<br>means you draw a line backwards and get 25th board. thats the<br>line of the ball path.<br><br>3) So now you know the line of your ball path, which comes to the<br>next point, your shoulder span and standing position. if your ball<br>has to travel or start at 25th board, than you have to stand say<br>31th or 32th board as thats the span of your shoulder width.<br>Also remember that you have to walk/face the direction of your<br>alignment of your ball path.<br><br>Try this out, it might help you. Remember you don't always have to finish square to the foul line. it be easier to finish with your shoulders perpendicular to the line of the target. Well it is posible to do elsewise but like i said this is the easiest way to start learning and you can move on to something more complicated when you have accustomed to this method.</div>
