            <div class='col-md body'>hi. i have a friend who is interested in learning how to hook.. both of us are newbies.. so people advise us to start wif a ball that is easier to control (like some polyester ball or something) b4 finding a style that is more suitable, then change to a better ball.. thus the polyester ball would become a spare ball.<br>but i tried looking for information about hook bowlers on the net and i found some terms confusing.. especially the part about drilling the holes.. there are things like Positive Axis Point, axis rotation, flare track, ball track.. stuff like that..<br>how would we know all these when we dun even have a ball? and how do we determine all these?<br>how do the drilling pattern affect our playing?<br>thanks for enlightening me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess u dun really have to know about the drilling theories.<br>Most proshop owners can drill ur first ball according to the basic requirements of left/right hander hook-ers. Measurements are taken.<br>When u actually go back to drill the 2nd ball after u upgrade, depending on the characteristics of the ball, ur proshop owner should be able to assess how u want the ball to hook, how much and then drill accordingly. Its best if he could assess u on the spot.<br>Then decide how to go about doing it. The amount of forward or reverse pitch, blah blah....all can be done by proshop owners.<br>but of cos, the owner must be of a certain standard, and not all have them.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>I THINK... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Drilling a hook ball? That's a difficult question to answer.<br><br>For the most part, a "hook" comes from the bowler's hand, and from the lanes. Any ball can hook on a really dry lane. Any ball will slide on a really really wet lane.<br><br>A significant part of it also comes from what ball you are using. Drilling only accounts for a small small part of "hook" in the overall scheme.<br><br>Personally, I feel that when a bowler learns to hook, a plastic ball is fine enough. After all, it's the <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>technique</strong></span> that you're trying to master, and it really has nothing to do with the ball at an early stage.<br><br>Just a point to note: It's not how much it hooks that's important, it's when it hooks.<br><br>For a newbie, you really don't need to know all these technical terms. Your pro shop driller should be able to drill out a ball for you. You just have to let him know what you're trying to accomplish at this point. It'll be much better if you could actually bowl a couple of frames to show him your skill point so that he may better judge for you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to agree with Jae and Prataman. For beginners, do not bother yourselves with such deep concepts first. Instead, you'll be better served using all that energy and motivation to improve upon your individual technique on your preferred shots, be it hook, spin or something else.<br><br>Many just are eager to get a new ball. Hey, i can understand that!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Heck, even us "oldies" to the game are <strong>always</strong> itching to get new balls, eh guys??<br><br>But far more important is to work on your technique. This can be done with a simple polyester/plastic ball or even a house ball. Rushing to get a ball may force you to settle into a style that the ball dictates, rather than one that you prefer. And once you pick up a bad habit, it is more difficult to get rid of than learning a good one.<br><br>So for now, just enjoy the game with whatever you have, and leave the technical aspects until later (assuming that you're still playing then).<br><br>P1<br>I have to say, I am impressed with the amount of research that you engage in. Thumbs up.</div>

People have the right to say wat's on thier mind! regardless of how stupid it may be...<br><br>2ndly, u may know lots of theory (Or copied off other sites and Mags) but come on!! Go and fix ur bowling skills first! I admit your roll has improved but you practically had to re-learn your whole roll again... coach had to ask u roll the ball on the floor towards him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Lastly, i am not trying to get back at u or anything, but fact is that we are not here to make others look stupid about their posts or say that they were wrong about anything they say.<br><br>Others reading this post may dislike it but, go check back on all my posts, surely there would be some condemning posts from Harmzuay about wat i or other pple have to say... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mage, relak man... lak... don't blow a gasket...<br><br>harmzuay may have been too overzealous in his approach, but he's just concerned that our forum would lose its credibility as a place for bowlers. I mean, look at other forums. Some of them are really <strong>really</strong> bad!!! Surely none of us here would want our little piece of heaven to become like theirs...<br><br>But yeah, could have exercised a little discretion. But wait, if it was meant to flame... discretion isn't very appropriate...<br>Am i making this worse than it already is? Anyway.<br><br>I just <span style="font-style: italic;">had</span> to disagree on one of your comments. If a bowler's physical game is far from perfect, does it mean that she is not fit to give pointers on the technical aspects?<br>Do all coaches then, have to maintain a certain average?<br>Maybe it's just me, but that particular comment did sound like a hit below the belt i.e. it <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> personal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Regardless, i agree with you mage, that anyone can say anything on the forum, such is the beauty of it. I don't give 2 hoots what others might say about me, if i think whatever i'm doing is right. But i believe that our actions have consequences, and sometimes, others will make known to us those consequences, <span style="font-style: italic;">if</span> we're fortunate.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Mage<br><br>I'm not trying to be the best bowler out there. I'm just trying to enjoy this game. It doesn't matter if the coach made me do one-step drills or shadow bowl all day - because i do have room for improvement. I guess unless a person can average 300, there's always room for improvement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>All I'm trying to do here is to provide answers for people who may be too shy to ask them in person. And being a good bowler has nothing to do with being a good coach.<br><br>Point to ponder for you: When new coaches take the rein, they always impose changes that they think may work. For instance, Andrew Fang had to kill his hook when Bergendoff was coach, but open it up with Hoppe. Does this neccesitate a proof of a flaw?? Just as an apology does not equate an admission of guilt, perhaps you should learn about humility.<br><br>I would roll balls kneeling on the approach if it meant i can ultimately enjoy the game i love more.<br><br>And please don't pretend to be so "everyone is entitled to their own say" when you were obviously being personal.<br><br>I wasn't out to get you, but you took it that way.
