            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>The Weekly Guest League in my own Changi Beach Club (CBC) is coming to a close in a few weeks, and will resume sometime in May. As to exactly when it starts, I do not know yet. When I get further details I will let you know. As my mum is responsible for organising the league, she has allowed me the opportunity to captain and form 1 team of bowlers to participate in the league.<br><br>The CBC Guest League comprises of only 8 teams (what to do, CBC has only 8 lanes), and will run for 21 weeks. Each team will face every opponent 3 times. Guests (Non-CBC members) are also invited to this league (hence the name), therefore I am able to recruit you folks.<br><br>Note that I want a team able to compete. By that I don't mean a superb average (although that helps, haha), but most importantly I want people who want to compete as a team, people who want to learn from each other, have fun, and hone our skills together. Together we will gain experience playing in a league against strong opposition. Doesn't really matter if we win or lose at the end of the day, we must be willing to give our best shot, week in, week out.<br><br>The league runs every Tuesday evening at 8pm at CBC, which is very very close to Commando Hendon Camp along Loyang Ave. This is important because I understand it is very difficult to travel that distance. I do not wish you to commit yourselves if you find it too inconvenient and far. Also if you have commitments on Tuesday nights, then it won't be a good idea either. Hopefully out of those who choose to participate have vehicles, then I can rotate players with vehicles each week so that can tumpang fellow members when possible.<br><br>I'd like to form a team of about 10 - 12 players. This will be sufficient to fill each week's rotation yet allow each player to play sufficient games. 21 weeks x 4 bowlers = 84 "slots". 12 bowlers will mean each bowler will play about 6 times, or 18 games. Some may play more, some less.<br><br>Currently I already have 2 confirmed members, myself included. Quite a few are still tentative. Please let me know if you are interested. I'll have to apologize in advance for people I cannot accomodate if there turns out to be too many.<br><br>What say you? Ding? Ian? Chuan? Jae? Others?<br><br>Ok, some details for you to ponder:<br><br>----------------------------------<br>Time of league:<br><br>8pm each Tuesday, normally ends 10 plus.<br><br>Costs:<br><br>1. $35 registration PER HEAD for CBC members, $40 PER HEAD for non-CBC members. Each PARTICIPATING bowler for the week also pays $9 for the games played each week.<br><br>2. $3 for each Masters qualifying attempt. Any participating bowler for the week may attempt to qualify for the end-of-league Masters event, using your scratch total for your 3 games for the week. No limit to attempts (just once per week though). Top 16 qualifiers at end of league qualify for Masters Event.<br><br>Handicap:<br><br>1. 4 bowlers take the lanes each week. As usual the player with the highest handicap goes first, lowest handicap takes "Anchor" spot (4th bowler). Each bowler plays 3 games.<br><br>2. Handicap is (200-Avg)/2 for guys. For example, if I bowl 180 average, my handicap would thus be (200-180)/2 = 10. Maximum handicap for guys is 26, regardless of average.<br><br>3. Handicap is 2/3 x (200-Avg) for females. If a lady bowls 160 average, her handicap would be (200-160) x 2/3 = 26.6, rounded to 27. Maximum handicap for gals is 36, regardless of average.<br><br>Point Scoring System:<br><br>There are up to 28 points up for grab each week.<br><br>CBC Guest League scoring depends heavily on the individual games, so we have to work hard every time. Which is very good, in my opinion. And one more thing, no such thing as gambling, so there won't be undue distraction.<br><br>Breakdown of the 28 points is as follows:<br><br>1 point for the team game score with handicap for each game. 3 points total for 3 games.<br>1 point for individual score with handicap for each game. 12 points total for 4 bowlers x 3 games.<br>1 point for total individual series with handicap. 4 points total for 4 bowlers.<br>2 points for total team series score with handicap. 2 points.<br><br>Furthermore there is there is a ranking of your total team series for the week. The team with the highest weekly series (with handicap) gets 7 points, all the way down to the lowest team series score which gets 0 points. Once more, what this means is players' don't get to switch off or tune out, and MUST bowl their best every game.<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>Please email me at: prataman@hotmail.com, msg me at 96947062 or leave your message here if you have any questions, or if you wish to join up.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 27 March 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry for getting back to you people so late, but it seems that the league will start in late May. As yet the date is still not confirmed.<br><br>Update on the lane condition. The bowling chairman has just changed recently, and he has asked for the lanes to be oiled to 32, buff to 35. Usually it was simply 32. So there's less of a backend now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> It's more or less a wall, so unless you love to live dangerously close to the channel, you're gonna get an immunity to the gutters.<br><br>It's not really at the Le Meridien. It's closer to Hendon Commando Camp. You turn in from Loyang Ave but pass by the camp, and ignore the turn right to Changi Village but go on ahead.<br><br>Parking wise, normally people park outside the club complex, there's usually enough space at the side of the road.<br><br>Currently the team has 11 members, including myself. We have 9 males, 2 females. 2 LH Hook, 1 RH Spin, 1 RH Rocket and 7 RH Hook.<br><br>Team name tentatively to be "Dimension X".<br><br>Any objections?<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 12 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a little rusty about the term "buff".<br>can anyone enlighten me? I thought buff to 35 was acceptable.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1. To "buff" on Tueday nights at 11pm would be the term to use when tuning in to Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br><br>2. "Buff" is also a quicker way to address Buffy, during circumstances which do not permit the full use of her name, like in the middle of a fight with undead, or plain laziness to mouth 2 syllables, etc.<br><br>3. "To get buffed" is a phrase vampires, ghouls and zombies are familiar with, it generally refers to the act of getting thrashed. (See "To get some whoop-ass")<br><br>Combinations can also be formed between the root word and it's derivatives, or between derivatives, to form interesting phrases like "Buffing Buffy" or "Buffy in the buff".<br><br>As for the term, "buff to 35", I'm guessing that it's either a signal set dialogue between Buffy and a contact with callsign 35, or it simply means beating someone into 35 pieces.<br><br>But that's just me.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Urm? Chuan? Come over here so I may slap you.<br><br>Ok from what I understand, They oil it as per normal, but spread the edge of the oil another 3 feet forward, or something like that. That is, the 32-35 feet zone is lighter conditioned than the first 32 feet.<br><br>3 feet may seem a short distance, but it does make an obvious difference (well it sure did to me the first couple of times) out there. Perhaps it affects me more because I've been bowling there so long and this sudden change gives me a reaction I'm not used to  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>???<br><br>Prataman, you're saying that the extra 3 feet have less oil YET produces less backend?<br><br>I once knew this... but've forgotten. I thought buff means they don't strip it, they just 'flatten' what's left of the oil there.<br>Whether this means that the 3 feet from 32-35 are drier or wetter than the preceeding 32 totally depends on the original lane condition before the conditioning process. If the lanes were very dry before oiling, then there wouldn't be much to buff, hence it would be less oiled than the front 32. But if the lanes were wet, say because they weren't used much, then buffing would mean more oil after 32, and on synthetics, that would leave a flat condition AFTER the front 32 that would provide a lot of the ammunition for carrydown.<br>This normally gives a terrible time for me. because the reaction of the ball after the pre-laid front would be masked by the effect the wet buffed area has...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ho Harmy,<br><br>I better confirm with the chairman what he did to the lanes. Essentially, he told me that the original pattern was oiled to 32, but now it was "buffed to 35". At first I thought since the end part of the oil was flattened out......it simply meant the ball would take a longer time to read.<br><br>However, the reaction we are getting now seems to suggest that it's actually OILED TO 35 rather than buffed! Cos we do get a lot more skid... later breakpoint.<br><br>It sure looks like what I said a few posts ago was kinda contradictory, isn't it?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 14 April 2002).]</div>
