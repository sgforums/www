            <div class='col-md body'>People! People! News! Finally!<br><br>After a long delay, 8 teams have finally been formed and the CBC league will officially start next Tuesday, 28th May at 8pm.<br><br>First up, my apologies for making everybody wait so long. Next up, here is the full squad of 12. Please note that the player list that I sent you is outdated. Alvin Lee (unavailable) and Marianne Teo (school commitments) has been removed and 3 players have been brought in.<br><br>-----------------------------------<br>In no particular order:<br><br>1)  David Goh (RH Hook)<br>2)  Louis Lim (RH Hook)<br>3)  Tan Liang Cheng (LH Hook)<br>4)  Dinghua (RH Rocket)<br>5)  Sin Ker Han (RH Hook)<br>6)  Jornus Yap (RH Hook)<br>7)  Brendan Goh (RH Hook)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Lim Ming Ting (RH Hook)<br>9)  Ian Wong (RH Hook)<br>10) Jae Tay (RH Hook)<br>11) Weixiang (RH Spin)<br>12) John Lee (LH Hook)<br><br>------------------------------------<br><br>Some matters to note:<br><br>Each non-CBC member (Guest) will have to pay $45 as a one-off fee, and each league night will cost you $9. Slightly different figures from before.<br><br>The first game, no reshuffling of positions. What I meant is even if the first player bowls better than the 4th bowler, his score will still be recorded against the opponent's first bowler, not the opponent's best bowler.<br><br>We won't know who our opponents are until league night itself. There will be a captain's meeting at 1930hrs, at which we will draw our "team code", which is from A-H. The fixture list has been set, like A plays B, C plays D in week one, for example. Only thing is we don't know who A or B is until league night itself.<br><br>Last season the teams draw chips on league night to see which lane they play on, so there is a chance you might play on the same lane every week! Hahaha. I'm not sure if the rules for this have been changed though, but please be prepared.<br><br>TBC.... (I don't wish to retype this again, better send 1 post first)<br><br>[This message has been edited by prataman (edited 25 May 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, in addition to the previous post.<br><br>Ok, the 8 teams have been decided, and I have information on only a few of the teams. Those in "" means I don't know the name of the team.<br><br>1) Dimension X - that's us!<br>2) Just Lucky - my mum's team! how ironic.<br>3) Team Guinness - resident powerhouse.<br>4) "Seniors Team" - not much info.<br>5) Hi-Rev - regulars in the league.<br>6) "???" &lt;-- absolutely unknown!!<br>7) "Committee Team" - not much info.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> K-Force - not much info thus far.<br><br>From what I know so far, we'd have only a very slim chance to finish in the top 3. A better prediction would see us landing between 5-7th. Hah! But we'll sure be giving in our best shot, won't we?!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Next post I'll give some info on the strengths of the teams I know.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>prat<br>I'm always open to bowling, especially with company as yourself. However, my finances do not allow for extravagant outings on days and times which demand a full rate on each game. As it is, I only bowl when I have time to go to Victor's because they have the cheapest rates for me. And I get in as many games I can there until 6pm, when the rates return to normal.</div>
