            <div class='col-md body'>okok, my fault for not tieing the session. i didnt know i needed only 6 pins..maybe sometimes, looking at scores might do a little help.<br>ahaha...<br><br>nevertheless, we managed to claw 9.5 points. It looked promising from the start, possible to claim at least 12. However, AS USUAL... started to falter here and there, otherwise opponent started to gain momentum...so, in the end, we lost 0.5 pts.<br><br>However, we still have abit of hope in that 7th placed team faced "Swee Seng"? If they lost to Swee Seng, we get 7th....<br><br>unfortunately, this league ended early. It was fun while it lasted, lots of frustration, plenty of laughter. I'm glad I took part because it helped me to strengthen my mental part...I remembered my first match my hand was shaking as I stood among the ah peks. Now, I am not bothered already...<br><br>Probably, as most of us improved, the luckier few may get to join "Classics" at Eastside. We just have to keep trying. Over there is tough and challenging, lanes maybe easier, but the more we have to play better.<br><br>Oh well, thanks Prata for Katong experience and teammates around for motivation!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, Thurs Katong league has come to a close, albeit abruptly. No more Thur league for now. Not much point getting our asses whooped about 8 times each leg. I'm not so sure that we were particularly enjoying ourselves every Thursday night. Seemed to me that some of us just "go through the motions". But anyway, more lessons learnt.<br><br>Sorry for the incredible blunder I made last night. I honestly believed we were playing blinds, and actually checked over and over the few weeks previously. I still don't know how I managed to miss the fact that we were supposed to play against Robin's Hoods last night. I'll go back home and look at the stupid fixture sheet again. Darn it, what a major blooper.<br><br>Thankfully their captain was very understanding and gave us some time so Tom could rush down to fill the void.<br><br>Tom, this one's on me, I can't make anyone else pay for something which is totally my fault. Glad to see Jae hit very good scores (196? and 206?) in games 2 and 3... haven't seen that for a while. Maybe it's not really a good thing, since he gets so cocky when that happens. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I'll do you a favour and not mention game 1.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the prize money, I didn't really check how All-in-One did against Swee Seng, but somehow I don't believe they can get &gt;11 points. I'll calculate the number of games played and spread the wealth (I believe it's $150 for 7th place) accordingly. For the position we end up in, on average we get a whopping 13 bucks a head. So do your Brendan style cartwheels now.<br><br>Hayden, sorry I didn't really capture the stats every week for this particular league. I only faithfully do the Mon Classic and Wed Trios ones.<br><br>So..... I'll take a break for Thurs now. For those at Eastside, all the best. Looks like I'll be concentrating full time on Monday and Wednesday. For now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>
