            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, same here too about the 4dr saloon. Ek looks much fiercer! The front lights are much more agressive.!<br><br>Really? is the new civic priced the same as the Sir? then its time they changed their entire marketing team!?! HaHa...<br>Have yet to test drive the new comer, but reviews havent been good from anywhere, other than the DJ on the radio advertising the Civic's back "flat ground" for the 3rd passenger behind.<br><br>Skyline Gtr... hmmm, almost every car fanatic's dream machine? Let's all dream together shan't we? Me... havent been able to appreciate the skyline yet, hopefully with due time i will get the chance...<br><br>Can't give any suggestion on the bike or the car cos both delivers maximum satisfaction. Guess on the practicality side of life's viewpoint, a car would be more worth it... but to compare it with any Class 2 bike would be senseless...<br>My dream would be to have best of both worlds. To own an obtainable "dream car", and a "spare" class 2 bike. That would be sufficient.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>DarkRage : I think we have a little misunderstanding here....if you would refer back to my earlier posting....I mentioned that MERCEDES don't produce such big capacity SLKs....ie there are no big capacity stock SLKs....and not that big capacity SLKs don't exist....afterall....if you have the money....you can fit whatever you want into whatever car....just make sure TP don't catch you....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Hope this clears up whatever misunderstanding you may have about what I've posted.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"ITS THE MAN WHO DRIVES THE CAR...."</div>
