            <div class='col-md body'>Guys, I don't think you understand what Deamon is trying to do. He's writing the "laws" of bowling in a satiritical pattern. In a mocking tone, shall we say. Some may be more familiar with the word "sarcasm".<br><br>Here are some more examples I wish to add to Deamon's list:<br><br>19) On a bad night/day, when you hit the pocket, the ball never has enough energy to carry, but when you hit the brooklyn, all hell breaks loose.<br><br>20) When you are bowling your horrible scores, you can always convert the splits. But when you need them on potential closed games or high games, you miss by a mile.<br><br>21) During league, your opponents - however bad as indicated by their league positions - always, <strong>always</strong> has a very good outing. And the week after, that same team will suck against another team.<br><br>22) The ball you want to buy is never in stock.<br><br>23) Because of (22), you always get persuaded into buying one of those in stock but you don't like much.<br><br>24) Two weeks later, the ball you wanted initially is shipped in in dozens.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks to harmy for explaining.<br>When i wrote this, i wwanted it to be in a colourful way. Come think abt, most of those bloopers often happen to us, so much so it becomes an everyday fact of life.<br><br>I agree with harmy's number 21 it certainly go hand in hand with number 7 <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>And i definitely agree with number 20. In low game u tend to convert the split but not for high scoring game</div>

But come league night, you find yourself frantically cutting away while others wait for you, because you used them all up during training sessions.<br><br>2<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Everytime you take pains to make sure you have enough time to warm up before league, like having early dinner, missing a favourite TV programme, speeding, etc... you still end up late.<br><br>29) And when you DO get there early, it's always too early, and you'll still be putting on your shoes when everyone's taking their 5 minute practice shots.<br><br>30) Everytime you think you're on your way to a turkey/strike/7-bagger/perfect game, it <span style="font-style: italic;">never never</span> happens. If you even considered <span style="font-style: italic;">remotely</span>, like in the back of you mind, of it happening, it won't.
