            <div class='col-md body'>A fresh leg to the season, a fresh topic.<br><br>And yes, the same old opponents, starting with the team to beat, the Beast of the East, Just Lucky.<br><br>Last time we met them we got just 3 points from a serious big time whoop in the butt. Not this time. I mean, not so big a thrashing, anyway.<br><br>We didn't exactly set the lanes on fire or go out with a blaze of glory this time, but we sure came out with all guns firing and gave them something to think about early on in the contest, overall we managed to get from them 5.5 points!<br><br>Congrats to the team for setting our team best series for both game and series total. Armed with a combined team handicap of 70, we raced off the blocks, scoring 797 (867) in game 1 enroute to a season best 2116 (2326) total. Previous best was 2104 (2287) scored in week 2 against Jedi Knights.<br><br>Let's look at the teams' games and series totals:<br><br>Dimension X: 767 (867), 687 (757), 632 (702) - 2116 (2326)<br>Just Lucky: 715 (753), 763 (801), 827 (865) - 2305 (2419)<br><br>As you can see, we kinda tapered off towards the end. Losing by just 93 pins (albeit with the help of handicap) in the end over a 12 game span to them, I'd say that wasn't too bad.<br><br>Let's look at the bowlers.<br><br>Ian: Should have spoken to Jae about the ladies in this league. Don't underestimate them!!! Heheheh. Gotta give Ian credit for getting the team off to a tremendous game 1, where we had 5 beer frames! Had a great 'see-saw' contest with his opponent, and had a interesting tussle in the second game for a tie! How about that. A first for us. Coming off a injury, we can't ask for much more. 1.5 points scored. Ian finished with a 157 avg (184, 150, 137) versus 164 avg posted by his opponent.<br><br>Ding: This big bird sure soared to great heights early on, hitting a Dimension X season best 231 in game 1!!! Gave his opponent no chance. Simply got the attention with his bonecrunching hits which left bowlers from lanes 3-8 shaking their heads. Unfortunately our big man couldn't continue with his excellent game 1 form. Finished with a 189 (231, 179, 157) avg and 1 point against a very consistent (avg 202) opponent. 1 point.<br><br>Kehan: If we charged $1 for every coast to coast shot that Kehan threw, we'll be rich by now. But no... he played a "mild stroker" shot which incidentally only covered about about half the lane instead of the whole lane. Let's face it, Kehan had no luck again this time. He came up against the same guy who dumped a 222 average on him in week 1. This time he was slightly gentler on Kehan, with "just"  206 avg. Kehan showtimed his way to a 163 (156, 172, 161) avg, simply not good enough to beat his awesome opponent. 0 points scored.<br><br>Myself: Now I was quite lucky. My opponent managed to hit 4 splits in the first game, while I began with 4 strikes. Took the first game easily. Lost the second by a single pin, then got obliterated in the last game by 58 pins. Couldn't get my strike game going in game 2 and 3, with no connections and just 4 strikes in the 2 games. Thankfully my spare game was intact and managed to open just 1 frame in 3 games. 196 (226, 186, 177) avg for me on the night, 197 avg for my opponent. 2 points scored.<br><br>I think our round robin could get us about 3-4 points this time. Next week we face Jedi Knights, who have improved a lot since the opening first few weeks. No easy prey, this one.</div>

Please hang on while the automated team selection is in progress.... ..... ..... ka-ching!<br><br>The 4 bowlers on tomorrow are showtime-crankerboy Kehan, rocketman Dingster, spinner extraordinaire WXman and David your very own mild mannered stroker captain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> In need of points we are.

Still mulling over the decision. They're nasty. They trashed Tiger a couple weeks back. As WX said, they raped the Tiger. Ouch. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>By the way, you may be wondering why certain members don't feature very much in the league. Sad to say problems include schoolwork commitments, lack of form/confidence and overseas trips. Ah well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Footnote: Clash of the titans, Tiger v Just Lucky tomorrow.

            <div class='col-md body'>Alrighty.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>We're languishing in 7th place right now, but I'm pretty sure we may move up a slot, even 2 places to 5th, provided other results go our way.<br><br>We face cellar dwellars Eagles. There's a good opportunity to give them 1 x helluva whacking. But let's not underestimate them too much. They do have 2 good male bowlers (Chris Lim and Lim Siong Teik) capable of 200 games and a well.. let's say eccentric female bowler. Let's hope Brendan, Ian, Jae and myself bring our A Game. Hopefully Ian and Jae carry over their high wave from yesterday for tomorrow! No chance of the Eagles catching up to us or finishing outside 8th spot. So let's worry about 5th and 6th.<br><br>We're 9 points behind 5th placed Jedi Knights, after giving them a good 14-7 pounding last week. 16 points total for last week, 8 for them. We're also only 7 points behind 6th placed Juz-US as well. Best of all, these 2 teams (Jedi and Juz-Us) face EACH OTHER tomorrow! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Either way, we get to benefit as they have to share the 21 points between themselves. I figure if we take about 15 points from the Eagles, we can jump at least 1 spot. If we take close to maximum, jumping 2 positions to 5th is possible.<br><br>Inspiring, no? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Greetings! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">:<br><br>Well done to the team members who played in the game against the Eagles. We had an great margin of victory, 18-3! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> Of the 3 points we missed out, I'm sorry to say I was responsible for 2 points lost.<br><br>We may have gotten 18 out of 21 points, but let's get 1 thing straight. They were easy meat. They did not put much pressure on us at all, as you will see later on. It was a job we had to do and it was a job well done, nonetheless.<br><br>We managed to leapfrog Jedi Knights to 6th, who were pushed from 5th to 7th because they themselves got mauled 6-15 by the surging Juz-US, who are now in 5th place. Barring the round robin, we have closed to just 4 points behind them now, and we will face them in 2 weeks time. Let's worry about Hi-Rev first (in the meantime they will have to worry about Tiger first). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Let's look at the results tonight.<br><br>Our series and totals were:<br>680 ( 775 ), 712 ( 787 ), 706 ( 781 ) = 2098 ( 2323 ) to:<br>511 ( 610 ), 599 ( 698 ), 532 ( 631 ) = 1642 ( 1939 )<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>3 Cheers for Brendan!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Freemun put together a 145 average (130, 169, 137) to score 3 points against his opponent who had a 133 (109, 158, 133) average. This is a marked improvement over his 125 league average! And his handicap is .... still 26. His average overall moves up to 132. 3 pts to Brendo.<br><br>The man of the night has to be Ian. Putting together a Dimension X season high 198 (224, 200, 171) average series, he completely slammed his hapless, and I mean hapless 120 (109, 126, 125) average opponent. Ouch. So close to a 600 series, just 5 pins away. Great effort, my friend. Average leaps from 160 to 165, handicap drops 3 pins to 18. 4 excellent points to Ian.<br><br>Dinghua put together a decent outing, scoring a 166 (148, 178, 171) ring banging average to batter his outclassed opponent, who scored a 107 (110, 114, 97) average. I'm sure he didn't do as well as he may have liked, but it's still 4 very good points. Average drops just 1 to 169, and handicap maintains at 15.<br><br>As for myself, I dropped my first 2 games before winning the third and barely snatching an overall series win. Got to make a special thanks to Ian for giving some timely advice (like switching balls) halfway through the session. I hit a 190 (178, 165, 227) average, but my opponent wasn't a pushover as he posted a consistent 187 (183, 201, 177) average. We split the points 2 apiece. My average moves up 3 pins to 177, handicap drops just 1 pin to 12.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

We managed to take just 3 points from them! We got whacked 18-3 (well, at least we know how the Eagles felt).

The 3 confirmed members taking the lanes next week (6th August) will be:<br><br>WXman:  173 avg, 13 hdcp<br>Dingster: 169 avg, 15 hdcp<br>Kehan :   168 avg, 16 hdcp<br><br>Pretty even, eh? Let's just say we're hedging our chances. The 4th bowler not confirmed yet.<br><br>I'm taking a break, having played 4 weeks in a row. I suppose Jae won't be ready from his sprained ankle, and Ian has volunteered to be the standby. Mingting will be overseas, Louis has school commitments. Most like it will be Liang Cheng joining the 3 then. Will keep you posted. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br></div>
