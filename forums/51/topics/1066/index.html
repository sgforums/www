            <div class='col-md body'>Yo everybody,<br><br>A big thumbs up to those who participated in the CBC league, we did very well indeed. Managed to get 16 out of 21 points. The total series have not been tabulated as yet, but I believe we can get up to 20 points this week!<br><br>We won all our team series for 5 points!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Kudos to Weixiang, who bowled a magnificent 196 average and scored a maximum 4 points. (Handicap is just 2 now)<br><br>Great job for Dinghua, who bounced back from a subpar outing last week to hammer, and I do mean hammer a 191 average to grab 3 points. (Handicap is now 14 from 24)<br><br>Myself, didn't do badly I guess, 177 average for 3 points as well. (Handicap is now 12)<br><br>Ian.... urm.... better luck next time, buddy!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hehehhe you did get a point! Heheh..

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Folks!<br><br>A night of mixed emotions!! What I meant to say was tonight was a mixture of good and not so good....<br><br>We didn't bowl very well... the players will be the first to tell you that. But there IS a silver lining in the dark cloud. Jae led the way with a 161 avg, WXman with 155, MingTing with 145 and Louis with only 139!!<br><br>But here comes the strange (and good!) part... despite scoring badly and thus obtaining maximum handicap (someone to accompany you, Ian).. Louis was the only one to secure all 4 individual points. Freaky. Jae did well with 3, and WX and MingTing scored 1 each.<br><br>Overall, the team won 13 out of 21 points, as we secured 2 game series plus the total series. Apparently you can see that the other team was not very strong. Well, buckle up, the ride gets much rougher from here on in. Scores not tabulated, but since the 2 teams above us got a resounding thrashing, we might actually find ourselves in the top half of the table (4th!) after this week. Staying there won't be easy though.<br><br>Excellent. Double objective met. Scoring more than 14 points, and securing good handicap. Next week shall see the introduction of our remaining players, Liang Cheng, Brendan and John Lee.<br><br>Dingster, I was actually planning to field Kerhan next week (18 Jun) to anchor the team and yourself to play (25 Jun) the week after. But now I think about it, it's better that you anchor next week's team and leave Kerhan till the 25th. Is that ok with you? I believe we can secure more points this way.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Good day, folks.<br><br>Not a very good outing on Tuesday, I must say. The only consolation is that we managed to maintain in 5th spot. However, we are 15.5 pts behind 4th placed K-Force. Furthermore, our previous 7 point lead over 6th placed team is now just 1.<br><br>What does this mean? Simply, forget about the 3-pt outing (we obtained 0 for round robin) and regain some momentum. No better way than that than solidifying our 5th position by doing well next week.<br><br>Great job, Ian for putting up 2 consistent 180+ games. (lowering handicap too! haha)Took 6 games for us to find out how deadly Kehan can be when he gets his line going. Couldn't stop striking in the latter half of the 3rd game!<br><br>Ding, better get well soon, buddy, we need that cannon of yours primed and zeroed. Your newly obtained 20 handicap will be very useful indeed as well, especially against Tiger Bowling. Brendo, not too bad for your first CBC outing, but can be better, much better. Too nervous about the soccer match, perhaps?<br><br>Can't wait to set things right the next week!!!!! KILL KILL KILL!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, not too good an outing again, folks.<br><br>Let's run through what happened each game:<br><br>Game 1: Big Heartbreak. We lost 686 to 688! Just 2 pins. Granted, they had a 20 pn handicap advantage (97-77), but we really should have put this in the bag.<br><br>Game 2: No worries here. Managed to convincingly beat them 741 to 695.<br><br>Game 3: Well, no arguments here. We got whacked ourselves 672 to 726. It was really close up till about frame 7, when the wheels just fell off our cart.<br><br>Overall series: We got punished. We lost by a measly 10 pins in the overall frame of things! 2099 to 2109! Sure, we could blame their 60 handicap advantage (20 x 3), but hey, we don't bowl good, we no get results. 3 precious points lost by a tiny margin. Damn.<br><br>Let's look at the individuals:<br><br>Debutant Liang Cheng posted a 145 average, and managed to get 1 point. His handicap is 26. I think we were all shocked by how well his opponent played, and she still managed to maintain a 28 handicap! - 1 point.<br><br>Ian continued his recent hot streak into games 1 and 2 (192 and 182) but hunger pangs got the better of him in game 3. Finished with a 164 average, and 3 good points. Handicap is now 21, 158 average overall. - 3 points.<br><br>Jae had a bad day today, but I'm sure you'll pick up, buddy. Got to get ready for Thursday and Sunday, dude! Your handicap is now 23, 154 average overall. - 0 points.<br><br>I didn't do too badly, I guess. We both had our share of bad luck (I had 2 7-10 splits on seemingly good pocket hits, but he suay suay chopped many a spare). Stuttered at first, but managed to get a 181 average on the night, thanks to a good last game. My handicap now stands at 11, 179 average overall. - 4 points.<br><br>Recap:<br>---------<br><br>We got 8 of 16 points from the individual games, 1 out of 5 points for the series, and 1 point from the round robin. That gives us 10 of a possible 28. Not too good. I think we may have been overtaken and thrown to 6th place, but I'm still not sure.<br><br>Next week we face the might of Tiger Bowling Team, home to about 6-7 bowlers better than 190, 200 even. They've got a good trio of 200 avg lefties, not to mention a particular righty called Jack Wong. A very impressive lineup. Who's up for the challenge?</div>
