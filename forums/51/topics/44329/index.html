            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ya'all, Nick Tan here. Just wanna tell you guys that should you all bowl against Classic Cafe. Just bowl as usual.<br><br>I learnt a lesson today, I let what that Jerry Choo guy disturb me mentally, hence I bowled a 156 game. Nevertheless, should you all be distracted by anyone in anyway, just tell yourself not to bother. In fact you should push yourself to do better to prove that you are mentally superior than him!<br><br>By the way Jerry Choo wasn't happy with me and whilst I was testing the aproach after I threw the shot, he dropped the ball delibrately to tell me to hurry up and go back. I was testing the approach because I got stuck whilst sliding. He was annoyed with me  because he lost alot of money betting on my pin 10.Haha!He didn't make a cent!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, true true...<br>ok, bowl our usual game...take our time with our shot. Its better to have a cautious game, mind and body totally focused on the game instead.

The least JC could do was talk nicely to Nick when he walks back...guess that got me boiling since JC tried to 'bully' one of our guys...lao jiao only.....big deal.<br>And that killed me. I opened 4 frames in a row and I was like going "wait a minute....i'm screwing my game over that idiot." by the time I tried to recover, too late. Posted a shitty score...anyway, everything was shitty today about my game.
