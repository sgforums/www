Was tempted to put tracer after seeing Wu Fu Long's ball spinning in action on TV. His Ninja Fury ball does have 2 tracers when he played to win the Taiwan Tour 1999. How did he put tracers on while keeping his ball legal for the tour is my question now? I was told by a Spinning Champion, okay it was YC Ma again that the only legal way is to use a type of  chemical to etch the tracer mark as stickers are definitely not legal. Hope to get more advice again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to me, tracers are redundant. if u wan, put them during training, but take them out after that. if u can read lanes well enuff, u wun need the tracers.<br>also, no point using tracers to read lanes if u do not have any form of consistancy.<br>the best way to read a lane( to me) is to throw 2 shots. one your normal A line, then, ur B line. both these 2 lines should be covering different areas of lane. eg: my A line covers from 15 to 5 boards. my B line covers from 35 to 10 boards. ( different balls)<br><br>if u know your ball reactions well enuff, u will roughly know wat type of lanes u are dealing wif.<br><br>another way is to look at ur opponents or teammates throw and gague from there how their ball is reacting.</div>

By roughening the contact surface of the ball, Does it make the ball back up more for TaiPei spinner shot? I notice for that particular spinner you mentioned, his ball does backed up a lot in the Malaysia leg, a title he sucessfully defended. Is it legal to have 3 spinners ball roughening to various degree during competition so that the spinner need not do the roughening at the time of competing?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Correct me if I'm wrong. What I know is one can have several balls with different degree of roughness for tourys, BUT players are not allowed to alter the surface of the balls during the games.

I read that Tseng Su Feng won her AMF world title in Egypt where the lanes were bulit on the open desert facing the Spinx. Winds blow the sand on the lanes all the time and  make the lanes unpredictable. For spinners, lanes condition affect them lesser, they can get more consistent scores throughout. But for hook players, they have a much greater problem to deal with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think everyone will agree that light ball spinners hold the advantage over heavy ball players in tight game series or matchplay format. In other words, in a straight shootout a spinner would have the advantage because a heavy ball player needs longer to find a line if there isn't one ready for them.<br><br>Of course, this is dependent on many factors. But the general concensus is that spinners are very capable of high games, but even the best ones average about 220. Heavy ball bowlers play with a larger range of scores (i.e., lower low games and higher high games) but can average better over time, in the 240 region.<br><br>Btw, it's sad... but Miss Tseng Su Feng has taken her own life last year. There was a tribute to her on the ABT grandslam finals.</div>

Yeah in bad lanes, that's where the Taipei spinner style was developed. So in bad lanes the Taipei spinners will rule.</div>

It was commented by her team mate, Chou Meow Lin that Tseng although talented put in a lot of effort to reach where she was in bowling. Chou, said of Tseng, "she will practice and practice even though her stamina may not allow her long training session. So, who say bowing or spinner is easy, but with practice we can all be at least quite good.</div>
