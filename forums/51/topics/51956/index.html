            <div class='col-md body'>Today silver bowl and classic bowl held B graded tournament. Being free, i went down to take a look. Oh man was i suprised to see so many hustlers around. Firstly at silver bowl, among the top 10 winners, i could see at least 2 having an average more than the 180 avg limit imposed by the tounrament. I had a look with the STBC records and it confirm my suspicion.<br><br>Next at classic bowl, the graded tourny allows for only below 179avg to join.With a small 1st prize of $300, i still can find open bolwer with a league avg of 192 taking part! IN fact 5 members from the monday classic league team join. Out of the 5, only 1 had the avg below the limit.<br><br>The similiarity of these 2 tournys is that they are organised by outsiders; hence i guess there was no strict checking. I suppose any form of protests have also been turned to deaf ears as i saw those bowlers walking away with their cash prizes.It amaze me that these ppl dun feel pai seh abt joining graded tournys. IN fact i think they are laughing at us for donating $$ to them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Morale of the story? Dun join any graded tourny organised by outsiders. Also i hope tournaments organised by the bowling  centers shld also have stricter checking too.<br><br>Is it any suprise that the classic tourny for 173avg and below are getting more and more hustlers too?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, it defeats the purpose of having a graded tournament isn;t it? How would u feel when u witness a graded touny for 179 avg but ppl with avg of 192 playing? And it happens cos i saw it. If it is avg of +2-3 pins, i guess still okie, but definitely not more than 10 rite?<br></div>

But ever wonder why some of them actually broke records in the heats even before they are in the finals??<br><br>By putting up a max in bowling they don't want weaker bowlers to feel expoilted. But in the game of bowling, there are no heats for fun bowls or challenge. Unless you refer to Nationals &amp; Opens. You have to be at least top 30 or so to qualify for the finals and thereafter the step ladder. In the recent graded competition, the winners actually averaged 200-210. That's open bowler standard!!! (Graded A is up to 195, Graded B is up to 185)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It depends. Swimming also needs qualifying to enter the finals, like the SEA Games. You need to swim faster than the qualifying mark to swim in the SEA Games. Then in SEA Games, you have the heats, which sort of qualify swimmers who finish top 10 among all the heats.. But that's just swimming. Its two different sports that are not exactly comparable.<br><br>Why some ppl feel unfair is because supposedly Helmi Chew avgs only 162 in league. But he can hit high games of more than 240... and he's pretty good at it. So why is he posting a low avg? Sandbaggin? Or off-form every time he plays league? I'm saying supposedly.....This would undoubtedly qualify him for the Classic Challenge anyway. But you would then say, ahh, Helmi Chew sandbagging his avg to play in this kind of tournament to win money. Would you feel that way?<br><br>I guess you would, but I was complaining in the first place because it isn't right for the organiser to try and achieve something he cant control. What's the aim of the avg? To keep the better players away from this tournament. So who are the better players? What if Sam Goh only manages to avg 170 league?<br><br>My point is, "so in the end, it doesn't even matter...~" no wait. I mean, in the end, it doesn't help me at all complaining. So, i just bowl lor. Because, I won~! Amidst the presence of a National Youth bowler. What does that prove? Do your best, nothing is unachieveable.<br><br>Hustler or no hustler, it ultimately depends on yourself. What you do can win u money, or lose your $40. So, grab your chances...!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So the key is not to anyhow join graded tourny but to see who's the organiser.
