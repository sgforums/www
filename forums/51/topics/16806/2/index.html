            <div class='col-md body'>Usually a tourny is made up of even number of games, so that for every lane change, there will be an equal number of games. 5 games is ok, but u have to determine if after 2 games change lane or after 3.

But if the lanes is bad, that 3 games is oso gonna kill u, how to save yrself with the remaining 2 games?<br><br>As for the prices, i'm fine with anything except gifts.

Hope everyone in this group tries to make themselves free on that day and prepare for the showdown against TPB.<br><br>*********************************************<br>Date of Tournament: 30th June Sunday<br>Check-in Time: 0930hrs<br>Roll-Off Time: 1000hrs<br>Venue: Classic Bowl, Sultan Plaza<br>Registration Fees: $17 per bowler OR $51 per team. (Pls pay exact amount) The cost of 6 games will be $15. $2 per bowler for the prize money.<br><br>Game Format:<br>1. 6 Games per bowler<br>2. 3 Bowlers per team<br>3. 1 team per lane<br>4. Lane change after every game. Lane 1-2 will go to lane 3-4<br><br>Ladies will have a 15 pin handicap per game.<br><br>Prizes: At this point of time, the number of bowlers participating are not confirmed. There will be 4 cash prize given.<br>1st -35% of prize money<br>2nd -25% of prize money<br>3rd -20% of prize money<br>High Game -20% of prize money<br><br>The percentage prize money allocation is only a guide. I reserved the right to amend.<br>*********************************************<br><br>Bowlers interested to participate should form a team of three. The nominated team captain should email me the following:<br>1. Names of team members, clearly indicating who is the team captain.<br>2. The sex of the members.<br>3. Contact No of the team captain.<br>4. The team name, unless you want me calling your team something from the cartoons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The closing date for registration and fees payment is 23th June Sunday. Unlike previously, I cant collect only on the actual day itself. Can someone volunteer to collect and make arrangements to past the money to me? Ding? Ian? Prataman? Or maybe consolidate the money and give me a call. Meanwhile, you can send me the team particulars.<br><br>Teams interested but have not make payment will be put into consideration only when there are lanes avaliable. Sorry people, I think this is the best way to be fair to all. At this point of time, I only book 14 lanes. If there are fewer teams, then fine. If there are more, then priority will be made to teams who had paid. If the response is absolutely overwhelming, then I can try to get more lanes.<br><br>rdgs<br><br>------------------<br>Â“Losers quit when they're tired.

            <div class='col-md body'>yo prata, really hope u can make it. Your smiley face will surely make this event an excellent and memorable one!<br><br>Btw, the lane change format will be change. Teams starting on odd lanes will shift left, teams starting on even lanes will shift right. Lane 7 will go to lane 5, lane 8 will go to lane 10, in this way both sides will get to interact with each other more.<br><br>rdgs<br><br>------------------<br>Â“Losers quit when they're tired.
