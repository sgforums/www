Watch out for Robert Smith.....check out the Storm website about this chap.........Awesome!!!!<br><br>In Asia Pacific, there are names Like Wu Siu Hong, Yarnapon, Jason Bel Monte, etc..........<br><br>Try learn something from these guys, instead of admiring some school who are still in the process of improving their own games, U should not be surprised to see those school boys changing their style &amp; technique over the next few years....<br><br>Go to Safra Telok Blangah in the next to weeks....AMF World Cup will be held there, its school holidays, so its a rare oppotunity for bowling fans in SG to see over top bowlers over 70 countries competing here.<br><br>The journey for bolwing is never ending.......keep on improving.<br><br>Good Luck &amp; High Scores...........Cheers<br><br></div></blockquote>As daryl said - Power is nothing without control...<br><br>having power ramming into pin 10, or maybe having power ramming the ball into the gutter, no pt.<br><br>if i were to chooes i rather have low power low rev and 100% accuracy on the pocket. Good enuff to strike.<br><br>i ever threw a ball .. tat slow .. it's like juz putting down and pushing it ..  around 10 rev or so .. went slowly into the pocket .. and exploded into a strike. Good enough for me.<br><br>Yes u can tell me U can be constant Wif POWER .. wif REV .. But how long can u last ?<br><br>Imagine playing in a competition, u are on ur 5th game .. u are sweating .. tired .. and grumbling already.. , but the guy beside .. it seems as if he is about to fall asleep, naturally he can perform more constant compared to you.<br><br>Equipment matters, and for me, i dun know my equipment after i used it for such a long time. frankly speaking, i am that kind of person who can only own 1 strike ball and 1 spare ball or maybe 2 strike balls. As long as i have 2 strike ball, my faith cuts into half, half for each ball. Den i end up confusing myself, den kill myself in competitions. So in this case for me, Equipment backfires on me instead.<br><br>Bowling is a sport which requires repeating shots after shots, which is one of the rare sports that requires repeatation, if not the only 1, and the main factor to being constant to repeat ur shots = SIMPLE Shots ...<br><br>WAtching bowlers and learning is a gd pratice however, wad works for them might not work for you. for example a spinner watching Robert smith .. ( bad example i know but i juz couldn't bother to tink of a better 1 ) or maybe me watching robert smith ..  not my style. = Wasted time and effort ..<br><br>Thus we should always pick those wif similiar bowling and try out what they are doing, constantly experimenting to improve.<br><br>TO me, bowling is a game wif lots of mystery around it. Who knows 1 day u might come out new throwing style .. not straight not hook not spinner, the game never stops evolving.  Thus i keep trying funny strange or different release, hoping that 1 day i can get the ultimate release. . ( sounds corny )<br><br>To me getting 200 is nothing to be happy about, instead to me .. able to close every Frame except splits .. is something to be happy about. Hitting a rough patch, maybe the lanes dun suit ur aresenal u brought .. or maybe u dun feel well or maybe ur shoe ain't sliding .. wadever.. u can't strike, but u have a solid sparing system, which i still lack of .. u can always fall on it .. random closed game will give u about 170 .. which isn't that bad. getting a double in the middle gives u a 200. So mainly, 200avg is all about sparing and closing up frames, dats of coz u dun do stupid stuff 3 times in a row and get 3 splits in a row.<br><br>but most importantly i still find is that Confidence .. and trust in yourself and the ball, which i always lack in. Thus whenever .. sparable split .. pin 1 3 4 and 10 .. i end up .. " siao liaoz la. . WTf how to spare " .. i go onto the lane panic.. juz rush my shot .. go down .. die ..<br><br>i lost a spare .. = at least 5pinfall.<br><br>or maybe i dun trust the ball .. i don't know how will it react on the lanes.. den i adjust .. probarly i will juz hit 4 pins or so ..<br><br>sooner or later .. i start to get frustarted .. my game score .. 100 .. 90 .. or 110 .. left right .. cannot tink properly.. take balll throw throw throw .. end up .. go back reflect.. den feel like slapping myself<br><br>for me i tink that why professional are able to play power and rev together.. is becoz they trust themselves and the ball .. They believe in their skill .. they can throw down 1st board and dun feel worried that the ball won't come back into the pocket. For us, we shld learn how to control the ball .. make it break at where we want it to = Experience i guess. .<br><br>juz my 1 rupiah view. . Flames welcomed .. so that we could learn  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

A little desription on my throw....recently i had to slow down my speed jus to let the ball work (skid break roll) and i m still clocking 1.8 seconds. Power??? I never said i dun have it....i learnt the old skool way and i was able to modify my throw.eliminating those factors tt dun suit me. All i was trying to point out to u is....power game isnt on the rise....as a matter of fact....over here....no one dare to teach it cos not many know wad its all abt. Just for the record, my coach wasnt local  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  infact, in states, the crux of the game is to introduce more length, trying to delay ur breakpt as far back as possible for max impact (somewad like a swinging punch of Ali) simply coz coversock and core design tech is now more agressive then ever.Like u n me. many here are all above average players (hanz hayden david jae - fos members) how to hit wad pins u dun need me to tell u wad to do. But wad drives me now to break barriers is my mental game.Like i said YOUR GREATEST ENEMY IS THYSELF. Bottomline, u can rev like a mad dog u can have all the power u can exode but,if u cant focus and direct tt energy,u r jus wasting ur time.</div>
