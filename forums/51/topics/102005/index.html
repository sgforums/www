            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmm.... i agree wat u said. Saw some fella investing on expensive stuffs but still bowl around 120-140. then saw a ah pek bowling avg around 180 but with simple equipment only. I think is the experience you have and the patience u need to cultivate thru out the whole game. Focus and concentration is the most impt part. When you watch Aviva Bowling, you look at the bowlers. They are so focus abt it, some even dun even take a look how the opponents bowl. Fully concentration and able to adpate changes of the lanes and balls.<br><br>Relax lah bro.....200 avg is not a easy achievement but it can be done. as long as you enjoy your game and you feel shiok is the most impt</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>interesting topic...<br>my pal of 8 yrs have been bugging me and telling me how much i have spent on the game and yet still bowl like S.H.I.T.<br><br>well, for me, i think it's what you want in the game. I just enjoy the game, just like strikers like scoring goals, i love hitting down the pins.<br><br>Ah Peks can hit avg 180+ with a single ball, cos they have been bowling in that manner for ages..their muscle memory has been integrated in to their body system. Trust me, if we continue to bowl the manner we are now, we will be getting the results these ah peks are having when we become Ah Peks ourselves... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, to be going right into the point, $$$ + practise + talent makes the most significant difference between an average bowler and a much better bowler? Agree?<br><br>What i am trying to say is that SOME Ah Peks averages higher than SOME of us, becos they have been practising the way they are for a LONG time, so in case SOME of us are bowling WORSE then SOME Ah Peks, DUN WORRY, SOME of us will get there SOMEday.<br><br>Anyway, Bowling is a sport, some may like it to be competitive; some may like it to be leisure.<br>more practises  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  the more consistent we get. More consistent leads to higher scores (but then there are some who will become consistently bad, if they make consistent mistakes...)<br><br>I had a low period in my bowling life just 1/2 yr ago, no improvement, getting stagnent...so i enrolled into a basic bowling course, organised by cathay, and the basic drills helps me into getting my form up again.<br><br>If wanna improve, play with better bowlers, heed their advise (though some are really cocky, can't stand them), play a simpler game, bowl more, if can get a good coach.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bowling is simple.. It's all about consistency.. Don't make it so complicated. Yeah.. Like what someone mentioned, just bowl and don't think so much. Relax and enjoy the game.. The scores will be there.. Getting 190 avg is just simply get 9-spare all the way.. So, u dun actually need strikes!!!!<br><br>But somewhere, somehow in the game, u get a double, yea.. it's a 200 game.<br><br>Simple rule: Don't stress yourself. Hit your target, hit the head pin, and pick up the spare. Anything more than 9 pins hit for 1st throw is a bonus... (STRIKE IS A BONUS). 9 pins hit is what we want.<br><br>Simple rule..................................

            <div class='col-md body'>Hahah! So everyone has their point here. I used to invest in equipments quite a lot, not so nowadays. Yes the posessions of newer equipments will create more interests, but i tink for my case, they just get me more confused. So for me now, training with a few balls to the consistency, yet enough to get me through different lane conditions.<br>Yes ah peks easily get avg 180-200 with one equipment. They got no worries, no stress abt lanes conditions, coz they simplified their game? (little hook, minimal spin, straight ball etc) Seldom you see ah peks grumbling abt their rev rate,their amt of hook, rather you see them grumbling WHY their pin 10 don't stand !~ Wahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>You want to play like wat they are playing? Simple lines, minimal hook, straight ball AFTER you invested in all your equipments?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Bear this in mind, with our training, leagues, coaching etc, our avg will increase over time. Wether it is fast or slow depends on your seriousness to practice, to train and to heed advices. Beating the ah peks used to be difficult (Jae, remember our times in CLassic Leagues?) kekeke. Well now if we go back, think we'll be in better league condition now... Why? Coz our team players now are more committed, and experienced and more TEAM spirit!<br>Ah peks avging 180-200? they are still humans! <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even world champions bowl 150 games! (Teriyaki, 2004)</span><br>Getting our avg up is the aim of our passion, to get a perfect game is the whole  objective and to be the WORLD Champion is the ULTIMATE DREAM come true!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br>Enjoy our games, be consistent, be focused, stay cool, train hard, our objectives will be acheived!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it seems that everyone here is enttled to their perceptions. school of tots, even illusions. B4 i go on, allow me to intro.Hi my name is daryl and up till now, been bowling for 12 years.<br>I agree practise makes perfect, but i ask this, how do u define practise?3 games? 10 games? 20 games? 2 whole hours of throws at the lanes? Personally, all the above is crap. Without a goal in mind as to wad u wana correct/improve/achieve u can throw till the cow comes home and still its ZERO.<br>This is an era where ball tech has evolved till it makes everyone look like a god.At this juncture, i ask u guys, do u know wad to do in order to get a spare/adjust when ur ball overhooks-underhooks/thrown down the line tt wld has the highest strikerate at tt pt in time??? Well,SO DO THE PROS! So wad is the factor tt separates the good bowlers and the champs? Ur mental game, at some point in time, ur game will go beyond physical attributes, it is one of the few games that physical attributes have little/no advantage,ie: AH PEK CAN KICK UR ARSES ANYTIME,ANYWHERE. Ur mental is the one factor that controls U (the bowler),ur resilence to problems/difficulties, ur creativity to visualise a strike/spare line and ur suave to walk away from a bad shot/missed pin-5 spare/longkang.<br></div>

Unlike spinners who make do with 2-3 (i noe afew tt uses only 1) balls,Hookers(no pun intended) dun have tt 'luxury' When it comes to planing the arsenal,many gave me many ideas and i tried most of them.....DIFF DRILLINGS ON SAME BALLS/ SAME DRILLING ON DIFF BALLS/ DIFF DRILLINGS ON DIFF BALLS/ SAME DRILLING ON SAME BALLS with different surfaces(sanded,shine.high-shine).<br>Frm 2003(year i came back into the game competively) till now i R&amp;D on close to 20 balls before finally deciding on wad kind of drilling (leverage/pin at 12/pin on axis/pin below finger) on wad kind of ball (particle/ reactive/ pearlized/ carbide/ urethane/ plastic) with wad surface (sanded/ sheen/ high-shine) with wad coverstcks ( Superflex/ Activator/ Powerkoil/ Monsoon) with wad core design.Now i am effectively using 6 balls, 2 of which is a urethane and a plastic for spares</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depite bowling for about only a year, i realised i've been tru that alot.. i often look at the acs (i) guys n wonder.. do they have an advantage because they have more money? money = better equipment, allowance for more games to prac, or even space to try out other equipment..<br><br>i realised i've spent much of my time working on my mistakes, which most of them are classified under the physical part of the game. be it drifting or chucking or torso movement.. i thought that i spent all my time fixing up, repairing, not practicing, ignoring the fact that working on my mistakes is part of improving..<br><br>i witness gerald yeo, 13, acs (i) bowled a crappy 400+ pinfall at tgc for the recent MQ, which he won in the end, beating derek chan.. he took out his spare ball(team storm) n spun his way out of the 3 gmes jus because he seemed like he didnt feel like playing.. he seemed as if he was playing for the sake of his 2 other frens.. he bowled a 670 pin fall over a 3 game series over at chev tho.. my first impressions were, "wow this guy is rich, fancy paying 21 dollars for 3 games when he could hav just paid 7.20"<br><br>nowadaes, its the hunger for more revs, more speed, or basically POWER that kills us. u do not see anyone from acs i or st joph with tossing a shiny little marble down the lane with lesser den 10 revs down the lane.. i admit i like seeing my ball roll down with much revs n power, crushing the pins 60 feet away, but am i able to reach my potential jus hooking it 39 boards? i dun tink so, ultimately its still the scores that impress..</div>

Watch out for Robert Smith.....check out the Storm website about this chap.........Awesome!!!!<br><br>In Asia Pacific, there are names Like Wu Siu Hong, Yarnapon, Jason Bel Monte, etc..........<br><br>Try learn something from these guys, instead of admiring some school who are still in the process of improving their own games, U should not be surprised to see those school boys changing their style &amp; technique over the next few years....<br><br>Go to Safra Telok Blangah in the next to weeks....AMF World Cup will be held there, its school holidays, so its a rare oppotunity for bowling fans in SG to see over top bowlers over 70 countries competing here.<br><br>The journey for bolwing is never ending.......keep on improving.<br><br>Good Luck &amp; High Scores...........Cheers<br><br></div>
