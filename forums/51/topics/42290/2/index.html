            <div class='col-md body'>win all 4 points free games? wow... i love the sound of that. however, i tink hanzz and jae would just bend over and ask us to get payment in kind.<br><br>seriously, as i pointed out to jae, the fines is not meant as penalities to low scoring bowlers but rather as a motivating factor. the money gotten from fines is not the issue, its just a by product. the better u play, the less u pay, the better the team results, the more points from the team, =higher standings,=more money at the end of league, more money distributed.<br><br>its a way of encouraging pple not to languish at the bottom but to strive for the top.<br><br>wat comes around goes around. end of league, u get back money anyway.</div>

Simple as that. And also if you bowl extra good, you tend to benefit from it. It's not meant to be a be all and end all, but it's just there to keep us on our toes.<br><br>Clown, I don't know what you term by "weaker bowler" and "stronger bowler", but I'll be the first to admit in our forum, many of us don't always get above 160 on a consistent basis. This system was to make these people "pull up their socks", so to speak.<br><br>If a bowler constantly gets 200s for fun, good for him, he'll probably soak up a lot of the fines as prizes, but thing is, he would have deserved it. We need anchor material, something which the teams lack.<br><br>Thing is, if we penalise bowlers that bowl badly, it stands to reason that we also reward bowlers who do well. And we can't really base it on number of points won 'cos I may bowl one day 150 avg against a 130 avg and win 4 pts, but also maybe bowl a 200 avg vs a 220 bowler and get 0 pts. So we go by something we can control. Pinfalls.<br><br>We do NOT sandbag. Besides the fact that we don't really have the ability to do it (but that's irrelevant, heh heh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">).....<br><br>Then again, this league offers us the uniqueness of not being able to sandbag. What's the point? Your scores get upgraded to 160 anyway, for handicap purposes. In other leagues with no bare minimum, sandbagging is an issue, but In this league, anything less than a 160 is "a waste" in the first place. So no worries about sandbagging here.<br><br>But seriously, we go out onto the lanes with a mindset to get all 4 points. If it means we have to throw a pin or 2 away in the last frame to raise handicap a little to win a game, we do it. Just like what WX did on Monday. At the end of the day, we do what it takes to win.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>true true....if we can afford to sandbag, we will. However, most of us cant.<br><br>I always think fines are to punish bowlers who did poorly, and rewards are for those who did rather well. i dont particularly like paying for fines, therefore my first thinking is, dont get fined!<br>Then if no fines, bowl an excellent game and win something. Anyway, I dun really know our reward system, only fine system so my ulterior motive is no fines, go out there and do my best for high games. Oh, that and thrash ah peks!!!!<br></div>

Meaning you can bowl a 200 game every league night and in the end accumulate 10 points... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
