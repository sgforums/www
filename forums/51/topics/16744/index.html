            <div class='col-md body'>Guys... let's approach this competition in a different view shall we? Let's not think too much of whether who wins or plays more competitively, ultimately the friendly has been organised with an objective of widening our exposure and experience.<br><br>Instead of concentrating too much on the "not too positive" aspects of the event, let's steer our attention to a grand opportunity of being able to gain such an experience...<br><br>cHeeRs!</div>
