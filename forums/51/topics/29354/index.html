            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, haven't posted here for a long time. I have one burning question in mind, what do you like about bowling? Does it matter if you shoot a high 250 or if you get a miserable 80? I can understand those who represent clubs, schools for competition, but what about the normal guy/gal? So what if you can shoot high games and I cannot? If you're not going to compete in a tournament then why do you need good scores?<br><br>This does not only applys to bowling. On my way home, I almost always see people shooting 3-pointers and people running along the road. I can also imagine people sweating their guts out in the gym. I can understand the purpose of the jogger and weight lifter, i.e. to keep fit. But what about the basketball player? SInce they're all most likely not going to compete in something or the other, other then for recreation purposes, why do they train to shoot 3-pointers, layups, etc? Why do they even train at all? So that they can say "I know how to basketball", and should be treated as "deadly" in the game by their peers?<br><br>No offence to anyone or any sport, just treat the author as someone who might need reaffirmation in the game.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi awhite, I like bowling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I like to send the pins flying(achieve an objective). To me every throws is like to achieve the objective of knocking down all 10pins(same as in Basketball, get the ball thru the hoop). When you fail the first time, try again and again.<br><br>When u find that you can achieve a strike, go for a double. Strive for a better result and when you get a perfect game, try for another <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The same can be applied in our lives, fail this time, pick up the ball and try another time. U will succeed in knocking down 10pins in a matter of time. Also bowling tells me that when u r down(can't get strikes/can't achieve something in life), don't give up, pick up urself/bowling ball and give it another try <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>U'll never know(how success taste like) if you stop trying <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Also on the lighter side, I like the atmosphere of competing against somebody either in league or competition hence I bowl to practise. As they say practise makes perfect <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it depends why one would not want to represent the country.<br><br>Many reasons may include: dislike of coaches, not wanting to play under the pressure of 4 million people (like the ladies table-tennis squad, who I think are doing very well to cope with all the mud slung their way)...<br><br>Given the chance I'm sure most of us would, but for niggly little issues that are present. I, for instance, put a lot of weight into the coach factor.<br><br>Back to the topic...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I once asked myself that same question:<br>"Why continue to train so religiously when I can no longer represent any institution?"  - I had left JC (was in the school team) by then.<br><br>But inside I knew i always had the answer. To this day I still play for only one reason: I love the sport.<br><br>It's similar to my love for soccer, but yet not quite the same. Bowling isn't a team game - I can play as and when I like. I don't have to bowl with others or bowl well to enjoy the game. Simply the act of bowlng brings joy. It's a feeling of freedom and release (pardon the pun). Like once I stand on the approach, the entire world has shrunk down to just what i'm standing on and the 60 ft in front of me.<br>That's why I often play just to escape the accelerated pace of life in our little island-state.<br>I play to display my emotions during good times and I play to relieve the pain in bad times. It takes my mind away from other things for that little while that I'm concentrating on playing through 10 frames.<br><br>I play for myself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So how far do u intend to go now Ian?<br>For me, I like bowling as a non-competitive sport but amateur league-wise is still alright. If I get the chance, EVER, to get into nationals...I'll be happy.<br><br>Football-wise, Singapore is never a country to excel in this sport. Therefore, I'll intend to play until when I lose the interest. Plus, I never had time to train with Gombak, so bloody far...now, they disbanded....sianz... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Otherwise, my top priority is earning my first million bucks!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when one is no longer represents a club or an institution, winning is no longer an issue here. it is the love for doing that something..<br>in this case its bowling.<br><br>i believe everyone has to love doin something. say reading. dun think there's anything to win about this pastime<br>one may like to read but probably it just allow the person who like reading to relax or indulge in the world of a novel.<br><br>in sports, those who does it not to keep fit is deemed to be deriving pleasure by pursuing their fav sport passionately. It has become an addiction.<br><br>for some pple, they derive some kind of adrenalin rush which can be addictive when they achieve a certain objective in the sport.<br>For bowling it maybe a strike.<br>For basketball it maybe a scoring a 3 pointer or out dribbling an opponent and scoring a difficult layup.<br>it is some kind of chemical effect produced by our body (cant really remember the name) that creates this addiction that makes one continue pursuing the feeling.<br><br>thats why even though for some pple who may not be playing competitvely, we continue to play or train to keep the touch in order to achieve this objective.<br><br>anyone who has a passion for doin anything he/she loves, the person must be seeking to relive the ultimate feeling of enjoying doin that thing regardless bowling or not bowling.<br><br>thus, it explains the passion we all have for this sport. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't think passion has anything to do with winning. An individual can possess a passion for something they may not even participate in (e.g., handicapped people can be passionate about rugby, which they cannot play, et cetera).<br><br>One can pursue personal goals in their chosen way. For you, that goal may be "playing to win". Others may be "playing to relieve stress" or "playing to meet friends"... One's goals will influence the way that person behaves and perceives all things that happen while in pursuit of that goal.<br><br>Just like what P1 said - passion is not possessed by everyone, nor is every passionate person capable of winning. But when the two coincide, it simply means that the victory is so much sweeter.<br><br>P.S. There are many reasons to like a sport. Some people I know only bowl because they are good at it. They don't play or give up the moment they cannot do well anymore. Others loved the sport from the time they picked up their first houseball - getting better only meant that they are able to enjoy what they love more.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>It depends on what drives you.</div>

Can passion drive you to continue bowling games when you just shot 4 below 100 games with the 4 reactive balls you dragged to the centre, with 6 secondary school students each shooting 120 with houseballs at the lane beside you? Can "passion" motivate you to continue? </div></blockquote>Are you talking about us? LoL!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel that winning and doing something that u like are 2 different matters. passion does not equate winning.<br>other than examples above, passion for something doesn't mean that u have to participate directly, but indirectly as well, such as coaches who are always passionate in imparting knowledge and guidance.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
