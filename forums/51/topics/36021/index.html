You're seen as vain,<br>&gt; self-centered, and who is extremely dominant. Others may admire<br>&gt; you,wishing they could be more like you, but don't always trust<br>&gt; you, hesitating to become too deeply involved with you.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 51 TO 60 POINTS: Others see you as an exciting, highly volatile,<br>&gt; rather impulsive personality; a natural leader, who's quick to<br>&gt; make decisions, though not always the right ones. They<br>&gt; see you as bold and adventuresome, someone who will try anything<br>&gt; once; someone who takes chances and enjoys an adventure. They<br>&gt; enjoy being in your company because of the excitement you radiate.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 41 TO 50 POINTS: Others see you as fresh, lively, charming,<br>&gt; amusing, practical, and always interesting; someone who's<br>&gt; constantly in the center of attention, but sufficiently well-<br>&gt; balanced not to let it go to their head. They also see you<br>&gt; as kind, considerate, and understanding; someone who'll always<br>&gt; cheer them up and help them out.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 31 TO 40 POINTS: Others see you as sensible, cautious, careful &amp;<br>&gt; practical. They see you as clever, gifted, or talented, but<br>&gt; modest. Not a person who makes friends too quickly or easily, but<br>&gt; someone who's extremely loyal to friends you do make and who<br>&gt; expect the same loyalty in return. Those who really get to<br>&gt; know you realize it takes a lot to shake your trust in your<br>&gt; friends, but equally that it takes you a long time to get over it<br>&gt; if that trust is ever broken.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 21 TO 30 POINTS: Your friends see you as painstaking and fussy. &gt; They see you as very cautious, extremely careful, a slow and<br>&gt; steady plodder. It would really surprise them if you ever did<br>&gt; something impulsively or on the spur of the moment, expecting<br>&gt; you to examine everything carefully from every angle and then,<br>&gt; usually decide against it. They think this reaction<br>&gt; is caused partly by your careful nature.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; UNDER 21 POINTS: People think you are shy, nervous, and indecisive,<br>&gt; someone who needs looking after, who always wants someone ...[Message truncated]<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think these tests are so rubbish. Do you really need to fill out a questionnaire to know what you're made of? I know people who really believe in them because they're allegedly written by 'experts'.
