            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, we could have gotten our pictures taken from SIM/NUS and used them as an illustration of events that will take place.<br>I think we have quite a number of pictures...<br>Other things also include the introduction of a bowling forum for newbies, also allows them to mingle with the forumites and possibly take part in upcoming leagues and forum challenges.<br>We could bring bowling balls along, and for ppl who wish to start out (like me...) we can kill 2 birds with one stone. We provide newbies with a proshop driller (Unc Sam) and we provide Unc Sam with customers.<br>For seasoned bowlers who will be joining us from the new batch, we could arrange for them to come down for Eastside fun bowling. It shouldn't be hard but in future, we could form 1 team(maybe 2) and join leagues outside. Exams will be an obstacle, but these things can discuss...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Does the school compund have wireless network? Perhaps u can show the forum as well as the school bowling club webpage.<br><br>Also, do u all record videos of previous sim competitions? For Ntu, we used to record all our IVPs, and then play them whenever there is an exhibition booth.<br><br>Also, a view of the workyear schedule may helps too, so that newcommers knows what are the events that are in store for them.<br><br>Above are what my club used to do when i was still in the committee 2 years back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>One important issue to think about is whether you guys wanted a Bowling Club that trains to win competition(main aim) or one that accepts casual bowlers as well.<br><br>The club started out as a social club initially then slowly gets competitive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>We wanted to introduce bowling to the student body and to add more spice and variety to campus life <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Considering that we only have probably like 2 major tournaments per academic year and 1 9pin tap, the possibility of getting a squad for competition is not feasible. Because the whole Club cannot afford to allocate time so that competitive players get the attention from the coach more than those casual bowlers.<br>We are only capable of one training per week. Which means that basically, all the members in the Club will take part in all the tournaments available. They can opt out if they dont wanna play, but who wouldnt want to play?!?<br><br>For the more competitive bowlers, the only way they can get more training is to bowl when the coach is available! That's why some of us are at Eastside every Thursday (soon to be Friday?) Any questions, ask him. I'm sure he'll be more than happy to tell you and guide what's wrong and how to improve. Besides, an idea is to ask the more competitive bowlers to participate in national tournaments, or form a team and bowl in competitive leagues.<br></div>
