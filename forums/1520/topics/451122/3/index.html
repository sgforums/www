              <p><br>My pay is only average. not enough to buy a house or car. But I think to minimumly support a family should be ok.</p>
              <p>I had waited over 10 years to settle down but really cannot find a girl who I like who like me back. Somehow, I am not able to capture a heart. So I hope to give someone a better life here (compare to Vietnam), and in return, a family.</p>
              <p>Malaysian and China women are better in terms of compatibility and maybe looks. But their expectations are still higher than Vietnamese. All a Vietnamese girl wants, is a peaceful life, nice hubby who treats her well. I can do that easily. :)</p>

              Summer hill,
              Don't waste your breathe.
              
              You may be a little girl but you certainly make more sense than these people who are actually adults.  They are just plain sour. They blame others instead of looking at themselves.  they dont understand the purpose of marriage.  They talk about marrying foreign brides like they're buying a tv. All ready made for them to pick and choose.
              
              And to these people,
              
              Please remain single for the better good of mankind.

              <p>Why are your words packed with so much anger towards me? Its quite upsetting to hear such hurting message thrown at me. But since you do not know me well, I will not take it to heart.</p>
              <p>Firstly, don't jump into conclusions. Who is this old_kopitiam person? In the future, check things first before you accuse people, life will be better. And I have my own preference in selecting my life partner, don't I? I do not like to be with someone forever who I cannot enjoy being with. And seeing the person and being intimate is one of the things couples do. Think of one of your ugliest looking friend, will you like that friend to become your most intimate life partner? Other guys may no mind, but I do. Its my PREFERENCE.</p>
              <p>Then, I take a look at myself and I don't see an ugly old guy.Â Some others says I look like late 20s only. And I do workout everyday to keep in shape. I am not ashame of how I look. The Viet gal, ML, Â whom I dated for the past week even asked me why am I getting a Viet bride since I am so eligible. My reply is that local gals are hard to please and their expectations are high (pleasant looking ones).<br>The agent boss called me last night and persuaded me to take more efforts and date ML out more often. Tonight, I am going dinner with her. But just a few minutes ago, a close relative called me and told me that she prayed at the temple and asked the Goddess what should I do. The answer came out twice that this gal is probably not right for me, and I should wait at least another 4 months to meet the right one. I am never a superstitious person, but at time when met with such a difficult life changing decision, such things do cause an effect on decision making.</p>
              <p>Right after the phonecall, ML messaged me and say if its ok to bring her and her close relative to my home tonight instead of the dinner. I think main purpose is to meet my parents and maybe discuss wedding plans. OMG. I have not reply yet...what should I say/do? :(</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Just to add to your comments. I have much to offer a girl. At least you can be sure that I will be 100% faithful to the girl I marry. How many people can do that? I may not be the most humourous, handsome, romantic guy around, but I think I can be better than many others in terms of health, commitment, looks, trust and stability.</p>

              <p>looking at certain people's atitude......looks like they didn't work hard in school, so now can't marry sg girls.</p>
              <p>Facts are still facts.Â </p>
              <p>no point fighting and saying i am a troll. you cannot attract girls your fault. not me. not me saying that 2k not enough to survive in singapore. not complaining that girls are materialistic and will suck you dry.</p>
              <p>Still, some people will die alone carrying the atitude that all girls gonna suck them dry and leave them.</p>
              <p>Go marry the foreign bride, and maybe you will regret one day.Â </p>

              <p>Anyway, its a easy thing for a rich chio bu like her to marry a poorer guy than her.</p>
              <p>Try asking a poor chio bu whether she wants to marry a rich guy or a guy who is poorer than her.</p>
              <p>And we can be sure that someone like summer hill will definetly want to marry a rich guy too because she got no brains, no education and only know how to troll so she can only hope to marry a rich guy so she don't need to work and everyday can come sgforum to troll <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>

              its pointless to fall into a hole when there is no path in which you could wriggle out ...all exits are sealed off by the system that tells you to step forward...

              <p>You really oughta take a piss and look at yourself in it real

              <p>LOL but I like that Wayne at least knows what he have to offer and what he wants</p>
              <p>Instead of bitching like a lot of people here on how materialistic, bitchy, useless SG girls are, he tries to find his own happiness in his own way.Â </p>
              <p>Rightly or wrongly, it's his choice.</p>
              <p>However, I have to caution him on the various pitfalls in a relationship with a Vietnamese woman. It will not be all simple and happy like how he thinks. It may be, if he is lucky.</p>
              <p>I suggest that he go to Sammy Boy Forum and read about a having a Vietnamese Life Partner. Over there, the experts will talk about the emotional drama he may or may not have to go through to send money back to her family etc and how to handle the situation.Â </p>
              <p>Also, he have to remember that the environment can mould a person. So, an innocent Vietnamese bride may morph into a SG woman in the future. Think about that.</p>
              <p>And frankly, as a female, I think that these Mail Order Brides are all materialistic in their own way. If they are not materialistic they would hv married their own local men instead of offering themselves up for marriage.Â </p>
