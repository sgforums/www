              <p>Don't think Vietnamese mail brides are appropriate. Just my 2 cents.</p>
              <p>Why? I once rented a place in a town call Kajang and I hear from my neighbours that some of the sons of the neighbourhood there hired viet cong mail order brides. Months after they caught STD, one even died of AIDS. Apparently the agency was providing them with ex prostitutes.</p>
              <p>My advice is to go for dating agency. If you really want vietnamese brides - go to vietnam to work - the nation is desperate for high skilled expatriates like you. And viet cong women love foreigners like u.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am going to be 37 years old this year. And for the past 17
              years, I had only 3 short relationships that ended up with breakup.
              And many other smaller rejections from gals which hurts. I am not
              ugly at all and I work as an Engineer, just that I do not know how
              to sweet talk. 3 months ago, I decided to call up the Vietnamese
              Marriage agency and look for a quick marriage. For the first time,
              the boss brought 3 gals to my home for me to see and choose.
              All of them are between 18 to 20 years old. As my expectation on
              looks is still quite high, I rejected them. 2 months later, the
              boss called me again and say there is a new batch of gals. I was
              very unwilling at that time because the gals are so young! And it
              cost $7800, which I find it very expensive. but he says that there
              is a 21 year old and very pretty. So I agree to meet. He brought
              another 4 gals. The 21 one year old caught my eye. She does not
              look Chinese, but has slim figure and a pretty face. She looks
              nervous and blur, which I like alot. After a few days, I decided to
              take the next step, that is to pay a non-returnable deposit of
              $2000 for one week dating with the gal. If finally success, I'll
              have to pay the remaining for the agent to prepare for the ROM,
              parent visit, VISA, and many others. Everything was ok, but the
              biggest headache was the communication. She doesn't understand
              Mandarin and English. And we had to reply on a electronic
              translator all the time, which is very time-consuming and rather
              frustrating. Anyway, I brought the cute gal out a few times (no
              hanky panky, just holding hands). And we finally agreed to
              marry each other. The agent boss brought her to the medical centre
              for a checkup to ensure her health is ok. To my surprise, after 4
              days, the result showed that her has <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Hepatitis B</span></strong> which is
              contagious. Although I have developed some feelings for her, but it
              is not possible for us to be together because HBV can cause liver
              damage/cancer, and can pass on to babies. I heard she cried and has
              to be sent back to Vietnam.</p>
              <p>The $2000 is non returnable, and the agent boss is still finding
              the right one for me. I met another 2 gals ,but their looks fail.
              Most of them are not nice looking, and cannot communicate by
              English/Mandarin. Before June, I will decide to pick the one out of
              the batches. The time will come soon, and I will need to adapt to
              marriage life. Bless me...</p>

              <p>Xiao P Xiao P, you are truly the biggest loser in the world. If you think I am a parrot then you are howling pig, howl here howl there - complain complain complain because you are a loser.</p>
              <p>You blame PAP for your deficiencies - your ugly appearance, your joblessness, your poor grades, your lack of opportunity to find girlfriend, your poor parents etc etc.</p>
              <p>Now you are jealous of people like Oldkamhouse and Wayne Kwek because they are richer and have more appeal than a pimple face loser like you.</p>
              <p>You are pimple face loser complain all day long for all your woes but truth is you are the a stupid nerd who depends too much on the government on everything and handouts when you should be relying on yourself to work hardeer.</p>
              <p>No girls want you lah. Just see the way you talk - all the sg girls wanna slap you and throw your dead body into bedok reservoir.</p>
              <p>You talk so stupid. I know at least a dozen singaporeans who are living in Indochina. Some of them became head of the company there because the countries there lack high skill leadership. I think you are really brainless. You don't get out of spore much. You stay in your stupid parent's flat all day long, staring at internet porn. No wonder your comments are so brainless. You are nothing but a brainless worm - loser with no girlfriend no job poor grades.</p>
              <p>I don;t usually write twice but since you are a brainless parrot worm - I have to write again to remind you. Some MNC hire singaporeans to head their branches in Indochina. Some Singaporeans also got expertise in banking that local vietnamese don't have. That is why expat sporeans are in high demand there. You brainless bufoon.</p>

              Oh my oh my... you know this boss, you know that boss. Wow... I'm so impressed. I sure have offended someone prominent here. 
              
              Gosh, I'm so scared !!    I'm absolutely petrified !!!!!   My balls are trembling in fear ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
              
              
              Hey, but wait a sec ! 
              
              You seemed to neglect to mention something .
              
              Dah fact that none of these bosses even know who in god's name you are !!
              
              Hell, I even know who the President of the United States is and where he lives !!
              
              Big Fat Harry Deal you know some bosses !!  If you really know some bigshot, how befitting that you are rotting your ass away in a SG FORUM ?
              
              
              What a laugh !!  You are truly living in your own fantasy world !!!
              
              Quit trying to show off, you are nothing more than a big bag of wind !!
              
              Now theres no question who the REAL loser is.
              
              And you aint just any loser, but a big SORE ASS of a loser !!
              
              
              
              Once again you never failed to present yourself as a twerp that chooses to speak through his butt crack than his mouth.
              
              
              To back up your self inflated ego, you continue cook up more and more imbecilic, asinine, ludricrous garbage.
              
              
              When is the time that you had the testicular fortitude to MAN up and back up your statements with any facts at all ?
              
              What do you call something that chirps incessantly but makes no god damn sense ever?
              
              A PARROT !!!   
              
              
              So just suck it up and swallow it down !! You are a Parrot, so just live with it !!!
