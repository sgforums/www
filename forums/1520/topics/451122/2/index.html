              <p>Malaysia is only right across the causeway. You can chose to live in Johor and commute to spore for work.

              <p>I am going to be 37 years old this year. And for the past 17 years, I had only 3 short relationships that ended up with breakup. And many other smaller rejections from gals which hurts. I am not ugly at all and I work as an Engineer, just that I do not know how to sweet talk. 3 months ago, I decided to call up the Vietnamese Marriage agency and look for a quick marriage. For the first time, the boss brought 3 gals to my home for me to see and choose. All of them are between 18 to 20 years old. As my expectation on looks is still quite high, I rejected them. 2 months later, the boss called me again and say there is a new batch of gals. I was very unwilling at that time because the gals are so young! And it cost $7800, which I find it very expensive. but he says that there is a 21 year old and very pretty. So I agree to meet. He brought another 4 gals. The 21 one year old caught my eye. She does not look Chinese, but has slim figure and a pretty face. She looks nervous and blur, which I like alot. After a few days, I decided to take the next step, that is to pay a non-returnable deposit of $2000 for one week dating with the gal. If finally success, I'll have to pay the remaining for the agent to prepare for the ROM, parent visit, VISA, and many others. Everything was ok, but the biggest headache was the communication. She doesn't understand Mandarin and English. And we had to reply on a electronic translator all the time, which is very time-consuming and rather frustrating. Anyway, I brought the cute gal out a few times (no hanky panky, just holding hands). And we finally agreed to marry each other. The agent boss brought her to the medical centre for a checkup to ensure her health is ok. To my surprise, after 4 days, the result showed that her has Hepatitis B which is contagious. Although I have developed some feelings for her, but it is not possible for us to be together because HBV can cause liver damage/cancer, and can pass on to babies. I heard she cried and has to be sent back to Vietnam.</p>
              <p>The $2000 is non returnable, and the agent boss is still finding the right one for me. I met another 2 gals ,but their looks fail. Most of them are not nice looking, and cannot communicate by English/Mandarin. Before June, I will decide to pick the one out of the batches. The time will come soon, and I will need to adapt to marriage life. Bless me...</p>

              <p>Don't just take my case and presume that all Singaporean guys are having trouble. I am a special individual with no skills in gal hunting. Thats why they (the gals) don't really see my good points. But I admit that I'm very shallow. I like slim and pleasant looking girl only. And those types that I fancy will never like a plain guy like myself, unless miracle happen. haha.</p>
