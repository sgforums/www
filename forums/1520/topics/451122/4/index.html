              <p>After that, I highlighted the possible outcomes on what may/can happen from getting a foreign bride and pointed him to a forum with people with foreign brides so that he can read up and be better prepared on what he can expect or what may happen.</p>

              @Waynekwek
              
              Why .....? you ask.  Because I despise such weasels like you !!
              
              Oh please !! 
              You come out with the most ASININE and STUPID of excuses to rationalize your own misdeeds !!
              
              You are eligible? Gimme a break !!  
              Who do you think you are? Bruce Wayne? Sorry, you are only Wayne Quack !!
              If you are in anyway eligible, then you would not be left on the shelf at 37, and have to come bitching and moaning  about it in this forum  !!
              
              Think of my ugliest friend being intimate with me? If your SO is not a hot babe does that make her the ugliest? Just what kind of lame logic is that ?!
              
              Quit running your mouth about forever this crap when you are that much of a shallow bas+ard yourself. How long does a woman's beauty stay with her?  5 - 10 years? Then if one day your wife's looks were to fade away, whats there to guarantee you wont abandon your wife for a prettier woman ?
              Your words have made you the single ugliest piece of shlt this forum has ever seen !!!
              
              Most importantly, what do you take women for? Your escapades you described with the vietnamese women sounds more like you are picking products off the glass shelf in a department store than getting a real wife !!
              
              Your mindset is no different from the typical lecher whos hunting for hookers in Geylang !! You will only choose those girls in the lookers division !! 
              
              Why do such disgusting creeps like you exist ?!
              
              Your ML vietnam girl thinks you are sooooooooooooooo  "eligible" .  Of course she thinks you are !!!
              They have to because thats the only way for them to escape a life of poverty!! They have no choice !!!
              Try asking your vietnam girl to say you are eligible again if she was given the privileges local women have.
              
              She would have given you the middle finger and asked you to F**K  oFF !!!!
              
              
              @elindra
              
              Wow, I am filled with a big DUHHHHHH ...  after reading your remark.
              
              Please, which person in this world will not know what they are able to offer and what they want? Big deal if this fella is vocal about it right ??
              
              Its apparent you did not read the fella's posts properly. He said almost in every of his post, ' local gals are hard to please and their expectations are high (pleasant looking ones).'
              
              Now if that aint whining and bitching, I dunno what is ?!
              
              *Enigma*    -  You are giving praise to some cretin who takes women to be products and eye candy. 
              
              
              @M the name
              If you read carefully about the girl's background in the chicken rice story, she aint your typical sporean girl..  She comes from a rich family !!!
              
              At any time, her husband screws up, she will always have her rich dad to fall back on !!
              
              And selling chicken rice aint exactly a low paying job is it? How do we know the guy's capital is from himself or the girl's dad ?
              
              That chicken rice story is no fairy tale but merely PURE. LAME. GARBAGE.

              <p>Can't agreed much with you, nowsaday Mediacork would really rather 
              wasted resouces to boardcast gourmet every weekly.</p>
              <p>1) On Monday, it is 
              hosted by QYF and Kym Ng on chef who fly to nomadic tribe cos the viewer
               didn't know they existed !</p>
              <p>2) Next Tuesaday it would be gourmet 
              competition where the winner would be "God Chef" with Kym host x2 times.</p>
              <p>3) Wedneday would be 3 dishes and 1 soup and you must watch this show cos 
              they cooked better than <span class="st">Manchu Han Imperial Feast. </span></p>
              <p>4) <span class="st">Thurday would be mee face mee with some "handsome" guest together with 
              Kym x 3 times hosting (Mediacork got no more better host than her) 
              because again viewer didn't know Singapore where got better meeÂ </span></p>
              <p>5) <span class="st">Finally it Bryan Wong host in Malaysia for their Chicken rice and fried 
              kway teow because again Singaporean is too "sua gu" to know that 
              Malaysia got these dishes.</span></p>
              <p>The gourmet,gourmet,gourmet,gourmet,gourmet,gourmet,gourmet list can go on and I really suspected the producer is either an glutton, auntie (<span class="st">Ã¥Â¤ÂªÃ¥Â¤Âª</span>)
               or better still a "hungry" begger. They rather wasted money like the 
              airfare ticket and the time for these cuisine show to be broadcast daily
               rather than the "gut" to produce more reality current issue programmes 
              we are curious to know like do "sarong party girl" really existed for 
              example.</p>
              <p>My proposal is if mediacork got no more plan for a "proper" show, maybe it time that better TV station like the discovery or "other" took over.
               Then the lame show like "pillow talk" would not appear as an comical to
               be mocked under the daylight and more reality show like the Singapore 
              version "The Bachelor" to be broadcast.</p>

              Just what are you talking about ?
              
              I was making comments on ONE particular drama serial Mediacorpse is airing right now, not the entire list of programs they are broadcasting dah whole day ~~~
              
              Btw, how much creativity do you expect for something you're not paying for?
              
              Why Mediacorpse continue to have that much repitition for their programs is because no.1, they get sponsors for them, no.2, they cant afford to hire any good scriptwriters when you are no longer paying for TV licenses.

              <p>Tsk so much anger</p>
              <p>You did be surprised that there are a lot of people who do not know what they are able to offer and what they want. There are so many that is shocking and mainly what they do is just say how terrible SG women are.Â </p>
              <p>I feel that he is entitled to his opinion that local girls are hard to please and their expectations are high for the pleasant looking ones. Personally, I think the average looking ones are hard to please too and they too have expectations. It's only human to have expectations. AND the environment moulds yr expectations.Â </p>
              <p>But, there is nothing to be upset about since:Â </p>
              <p>1. It's normal for people to generalize. I can start a thread and bash local guys because if you really want to pick on it, there are lots to talk about but that just degenerates into a meaningless gender war.</p>
              <p>2. TS is not talking about you. If you don't fall into the category of "hard to please with high expectations" there really isn't a need to get upset about it.Â </p>
              <p>3. TBH, whatever rocks TS boat. TS thinks that getting a foreign bride is an answer to his problems. I'm telling him that's not the case. He might want to do some self-reflection too.Â </p>
              <p>4. In my books the mail-order-brides are just as materialistic and have high expectations because if they aren't, they would have married a local guy happily. However, people see the truth on how they want to see it. Most comparisons are comparing apples with chocolates if you take into view the environment etc. you'll see that it really is the same.Â </p>
              <p>End of the day, don't forget that while TS is doing the picking and choosing, the women are likewise doing the same. The Vietnamese girl might think he is a real catch because she is comparing him to the old men who are looking for wives whereas the local girls feel that he is a waste of time because they might have more to offer than he does.Â </p>

I am pretty sure that my life is happier and better than yours in every ways. Full of bitterness..you have my condolenses.

              @ Wayne The Quack
                                
              You are seriously darn childish for an 37 year old uncle.
              
              Even if i am the worst kind of human, that still makes me human.
                                
              But nobody can say the same for you who is downright shallow and exploits women at every opportunity. What do ppl call that ? A cheap bastard ?
                                
              Plus, i certainly am not some pathetic QUACK who sells his butt at Changi V. yet still earning lower than 2k per month, single &amp; unwanted at 37, and have to settle on foreign mail order brides.
                                
              And you call that eligible? What ay laugh ! ! !  Who are you to be mocking me at all ?
                                
              You are just an outcasted loser of this society !! You are genuinely a living joke of this town !!  
                                
              Yup, you're sure have god to thank for we aint met, cos if we do, i'll knock the teeth right down that throat of yours.

              <p>Viet gals are also materialistic. You provide financial support, that's why they are willing to marry you; sg girls have higher expection, that's all.</p>
              <p>It's also unfair to say only sg girls are materialistic. If a guy earns 100k+/mth, he wouldn't want a girl earning less than 2k/mth.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Anyway, a high profile case:</p>
              <p>David Beckman's wife, Victoria Coralin Beckahm, earns more than David.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Imo, it's not who earn more or less, but both parties income(or family's social status) should match:</p>
              <p>2k+/- guys pair with 2k+/- girls</p>
              <p>6k+/- guys pair with 6k+/- girls</p>
              <p>100k+/- guys pair with 100k+/- girls</p>
              <p>Â </p>

              <p>Marrying a singapore girl is like buying a $2000 LV Bag.</p>
              <p>Marrying a vietnamese woman is like buying a normal $30 bag.</p>
              <p>The $30 bag works as well as the $2000 LV Bag. The LV Bag is just for rich people to show and boast that they are rich</p>

              <p>You are one of the worst kind of human. Fortunately our paths are not crossed. I wonder how can anyone stand to be around you, quite pity your family as they are stuck with this kind of temper and attitude of yours. Do you feel very good with those words that you wrote? I am pretty sure that my life is happier and better than yours in every ways. Full of bitterness..you have my condolenses. And please stay away from me, don't even reply to me, cos you are not even worth my attention.</p>
              <p>And o...I hope you will be stuck wth someone like yourself. You really deserve that. haha.</p>

              <p><br>Xiao P is nothing but a little child with full of angst. Don't be concern about this little kid. He dislikes older and mature guys like you. I saw him try to bash another 37 year old - Oldkamhouse and call him uncle. I believe Xiao P does not respect his parents at all.</p>
              <p>Xiao P is suffering from some kind of rejection from girls of his age and he is jealous of you guys who have the monetary power. Unlike Xiao P who have no future - got bad O level results - and can't even enter Poly.</p>

              <p>Don't think Vietnamese mail brides are appropriate. Just my 2 cents.</p>
              <p>Why? I once rented a place in a town call Kajang and I hear from my neighbours that some of the sons of the neighbourhood there hired viet cong mail order brides. Months after they caught STD, one even died of AIDS. Apparently the agency was providing them with ex prostitutes.</p>
              <p>My advice is to go for dating agency. If you really want vietnamese brides - go to vietnam to work - the nation is desperate for high skilled expatriates like you. And viet cong women love foreigners like u.</p>
