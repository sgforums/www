              <p>My younger sister came back home whilst talking on the phone to her boyfriend loudly cursing and swearing. I believed my sister was referring to the 3rd person in her conversation and I don't think she would do that to her boyfriend. In fact, I was right, she was cursing and swearing about the 3rd person which is their mutual friend.</p>
              <p>When asked, she voluntarily showed me an email message and asked me what I would do if I received similar email. As soon as I began to read it, I was so amused by it and wonder how such person even exist, unbelievable.</p>
              <p>The email sender is their mutual friend whom famous with his tricks up his sleeves. As what my sister told me, he is around 36 years old single, without a stable job, always portraying as if he has a strong financial background, boasting of luxurious lifestyle, driving above average cars and even made others believed he is running some sort of business.</p>
              <p>The truth is, he never stops begging for financial assistance from his buddies. Taking advantage of them instead, he usually walks away with loads of cash from his buddies and not a single interest being repaid. In essence, he is more of a conman rather than true buddy. Thousands of dollars already wasted by his buddies trying to "help" him or fix him.</p>
              <p>But this recent email proved too much to chew by his fellow buddies especially my sister and his boyfriend's friends. Enough is enough, even his wedding day his buddies must fork out for him??!! Sound stupid.</p>
              <p>My question is if this email was sent to you as if you were his buddy, what would you do? Since you were among whom he usually seeks for financial assistance without any efforts of repaying. Seriously!! Are there many individuals out there try to con their own buddies??!!</p>
