              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>According to the 
              latest publication on marriage and divorce statistics, 24,363 marriages 
              were registered, 6.6 per cent lower than in 2009.</span></span></p>
              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>The Department of 
              Statistics (DOS) said the number of non-Muslim marriages fell, which 
              offset the slight increase in Muslim marriages over the same period.<br><br>In tandem with the fall in number of registered marriages, the general marriage rates declined to a historic low in 2010.<br><br>Among
               unmarried male residents, the general marriage rate declined from 43.6 
              marriages per thousand unmarried males in 2009 to 39.4 in 2010.<br><br>Among
               unmarried female residents, the rate dropped from 41.1 to 37.2 
              marriages per thousand unmarried females during the same period.<br><br>DOS
               said marriage rates fell across the younger age groups below 30 years 
              in 2010, with males and females aged 25-29 years experiencing the 
              largest fall compared to 2000.<br><br>The peak age group for men marrying shifted from 25-29 years in 1990 and 2000 to 30-34 years in 2010.<br><br>The peak age group for women marrying remained at 25-29 years in 2010.<br><br>About 74 per cent of total marriages in 2010 were first marriages where neither party had previously been married.<br><br>A further 18 per cent were remarriages for one of the partners.<br><br>The remaining 7.8 per cent were remarriages for both partners.<br><br>Compared to 2000, remarriages registered in 2010 comprised a higher proportion of total marriages.<br><br>DOS said men and women are also marrying later in life.<br><br>For men, the median age at first marriage rose to 30 years in 2010.<br><br>For women, it rose to 27.7 years.<br><br>The median age at remarriage also rose.<br><br>The
               median age of grooms who were remarrying rose from 40.2 years in 2000 
              to 41.8 years in 2010. For brides, it increased from 34.5 years to 36.3 
              years.<br><br>The number of divorces and annulments rose marginally from 2009 to 7,405 in 2010.<br><br>The
               crude rate of divorce dropped slightly to 1.9 divorces per thousand 
              residents in 2010, after being stable at 2.0 since 2005. <br><br>Nonetheless, the 2010 rate was still higher compared with a decade ago.<br><br>-CNA/ck</span></span></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Another trend is probably some people married more deeply in the internet space and enjoying virtually. Some who are well informed of their priority through internet that influx with good information. And some may also love to be with their parents to be with them and take good care of them, living in one roof of joys and their earning and resources are much more pool together that allow them to enjoy more materialistically and mentally. Most of Singapore family are living graciously together as a family and with their neighbours. As it mentioned above, keeping costs of living within the income reach....that may be perceived as negative for balancing of population growth in Singapore, but the positive side is that people of Singapore live as one family regardless of race, language, religions and culture....I would think that both the education of Singapore, internet and loving heart of people makes a positive effect for a gracious living<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/tongue.png" alt="tongue.png"></p></div>
