              <p>lol no worries dude totally understand what you mean.</p>
              <p>well our story is a lil complicated, but we've pretty much got everything worked out. we don't intend to have a child until few years later (we're taking good precautionary measures.. heh.), we don't intend to get a car until later too. as for house, we'll be getting one in a couple of years too.</p>
              <p>so as for now, we don't have much financial burden like loan repayments and stuff..</p>

              <p>you know what? really appreciate the lil gift of wisdom. thanks. =) though i'd have to say, that it's about finding the right person, and being the right person to the person whom you think is the right one. makes sense? =)</p>
              <p>of course at times we would have our differences, but afterÂ a while we tend to see beyond our lil differences, and find ways to reconcile (as much as we can) these differences.</p>

              <p>woohoooooo getting married soon!</p>
              <p>maybe it's a natural reaction (i'd probably have the same

              <p>problem is, my gf ain't pregnant leh. LOL.</p>
              <p>perhaps it has something to do with me being only 23, but
