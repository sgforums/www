              <p>Alot of people will chose to organise their wedding at expensive and grand hotels.</p>
              <p>What do you think about couples who hold their wedding at the hdb void deck and let the guests eat buffet lunch or dinner instead?</p>
              <p>Do you think they are very stingy and got no money?</p>
              <p>I think it is better to have the wedding at the void deck. The couple can save money and the guests also can save money by giving a smaller ang bao..</p>

              <p>Sometimes, the couple relatives might gossip behing them and the wife might lose comparative arguments with her peers then she will screw her husnband upside down over this.</p>
              <p>Better not, although save money which I think is good for young couples but still try to come up with a good budget wedding. Too risky, wedding, to some only one time, better not have regrets or chances for people to badmouth you in the future.</p>

              <p>i think weddings at those high class hotels(shang ri la etc) are a 
              huge ripoff,u expect the food to be world class for $1000+ per table,but
               its just typical chinese wedding crap and the good dishes dont even 
              have enough servings for everyone to eat to their heart's desire.they 
              just stuff ur stomach with extra courses just to make u think ur full.</p>
              <p>mothereffer
               for $1000/table dinner i expect aaron kwok to seranade me while i bite 
              into my honey roasted camel hump and koala pie.the doorgifts suck,the 
              desserts suck,the entertainment sucks,now wedding even got powerpoint 
              slide telling the couple's love story,like the guests could give a 
              shit.at the end of the day it boils down to you just paid $50,000 to 
              impress a room full of distant relatives and strangers that u dont even 
              know.</p>
              <p>worst i think the only party that benefit in the end is shangri la,their hotel lobby is so beautiful and luxurious u instantly feel out of place its obvious ordinary singaporeans have to pay thru their teeth just to have their wedding night in the hotel,us poor singaporeans belong in our ugly overpriced blocks of concrete</p>

              u attend wedding to give ur frens blessings. or to earn money or to worry abt lose money?
              
              and those getting married, are u sincerely inviting ppl to share the happiness or trying to profit?

              The main question is?
              What I think?
              Or what people think?
              
              For me, it's okay. I think the kampong feeling is great.
              
              As a Chinese, would I? I won't, because I'm afraid of the heat. I sweat so much that my suit would be soaked before the day ends. And that could mean no "moving room" (dong fan).
              
              What others think?
              I don't think the Chinese can accept it yet.
              Even a buffet style wedding lunch at a restaurant is frowned upon. The older folks complain, "Aiyo, no service one", "Must queue up", "So troublesome".
              
              Conclusion?
              It's your wedding, man (or woman). As long as both of you are happy, go ahead. There's no need to care about what others think.
              
              Footnote?
              The wedding is only the beginning. What is more important is learn to treasure the relationship and live happily together. It's takes a lot of giving. But it's worth it.
              
              Toe note?
              Congrats. (Not necessarily to invite the who Sgforums gang lah). :P

              <p>Well structured answer!</p>
              <p>So going with what you mentioned; if the couple is happy with having their wedding at the void deck, but their (chinese) family/friends may not agree or share the same views as them - resulting in them looking down on them, thinking its not as good as holding it at Ritz Carlton etc.....then do you think they should still do it lou sia?</p>

              Yup, yup, to borrow a phrase from NineKee, "Just Do It!"
              I'm sure you're read about couples who did it "Bungee jumping" and "Underwater World".
              Most important thing is what happens 10 or 20 or 50 years after the wedding.
