              <p><span id="advenueINTEXT"><span>SINGAPORE: A change 
              in mindset may be needed in the attitude of Singaporeans towards 
              marriage, said Acting Minister for Community Development, Youth and 
              Sports Major General (NS) Chan Chun Sing.<br><br>He added that while the
               government can drive a pro-family environment, it is up to the people 
              to believe in the "intangible ideals" of marriage.<br><br>He was 
              speaking at the Family Day Out Carnival on Saturday at this year's 
              National Family Celebrations, which saw more youth participation.<br><br>Deputy
               Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean, who was also at the event, said employers
               should also play a part by putting in place pro-family policies at the 
              workplace. He also highlighted the role of community and commercial 
              providers in offering family support services.<br><br>Lim Soon Hock, 
              Co-Chairperson of the National Family Celebrations organising committee,
               said: "We are seeing a lot of youths participating in this family day 
              out. And they're here with their families, with their grandparents. Some
               of them are even with their younger siblings.<br><br>"So I think in 
              terms of getting our youth engaged in the family scene and as key 
              stakeholders for future families, I'm particularly delighted."<br><br>It
               is a sign of hope amidst a recent gloomy statistic that fewer people 
              are getting married. While the government promises to play its part in 
              helping more Singaporeans settle down, it also boils down to attitudes.<br><br>MG
               Chan said: "There are some other things that are less tangible that we 
              have to encourage - the attitude that we look at families, children, 
              what are the conditions required for us to start a family, so on and so 
              forth.<br><br>"Personally, I would say that when I got married, it 
              wasn't like all the stars, moon and sun were aligned and then, 'This is 
              the day we get married'. It's a commitment between me and my wife to 
              say, regardless of what happens in the future, we want to work things 
              through together."<br><br>As the month-long celebrations draw to a 
              close, the National Family Celebrations organising committee hopes the 
              younger generation will continue to recognise the roles they play in 
              their families.<br><br>-CNA</span></span></p>

              <p>Always put the onus on the people.</p>
              <p>"The people need a mindset change"</p>
              <p>Yes the people need to adjust, but government should not be lazy and push everything to the people.</p>
              <p>For example, why are people marrying later and having fewer kids ?</p>
              <p>The answers are not hard to get.</p>
              <p>High work stress, high cost of living, high property cost,</p>
              <p>These are not mystery.</p>
              <p>What measures have been taken to allieviate these factors ?</p>
              <p>"The people need to have mindset change"</p>
              <p>Such a lazy and passive attitude.</p>
              <p>Take a look at maternity regulations, paternity regulations, HDB regulations, there are so many things that at the governmental level the policies can be tweaked to create a more condusive environment.</p>
              <p>Has this been done, or are policymakers so lazy ??</p>

              <p>So, how can the mindset changed overnight unless you have signed a contract as a government servant for next few years ?</p>
              <p>I am not blaming him for his ignorance as he can marry without a care on the basic $$$$.</p>
              <p>The present young generation have to compete with cheaper FTs that are flocking the market every year with NO debts to pay.</p>

              <p>I think the article is abit vague, but.....Isn't that what he's trying to point out though? That you don't need everything well prepared and perfect before you can do something?</p>
              <p>However, i do agree that he's probably in a privilaged position, which allows him to make comments like this easier.</p>
              <p>IÂ also think the reasons behind marriage are different nowdays compared to last time.</p>

              <p>Yes, it is true that in the past, no money also can get married. People used to buy furnitures and home appliances slowly. pieces by pieces, but that's a different era.</p>
              <p>With the foreigners controlling the middle class jobs, it is very difficult for anyone to see any future in Sinkapore.</p>
              <p>I urge local young people to leave this country and settle somewhere that citizens are well-taken care of, freedom of speech and human rights are respected. Their children will have dreams unabated.</p>
              <p>Young people of Sinkapore, leave before it is too late. Leave now.</p>

              <p>I think too many people are trapped in trying to keep up with others...and putting stress on themselves. Must have this,must do that before marry. Then once married, must do this, must do that.</p>
              <p>Yes there are things you cannot escape, but I think many are up to choice. If you choose to do it, don't complain afterwards saying life is too stressful, cannot survive etc.</p>
              <p>I agree things are different now, but i don't think its horrible. Not everyone can afford or able to run away overseas, which has its ups/downs also.</p>

              <p>Yes, getting married in Sinkapore definitely cannot survive, so we are officially going extinct.</p>
              <p>Bare mininum is a HDB flat, but also out of reach, don't include yearly holidays, cars, and whatever the wife wants, bare minmum HDB flat also hard to obtain.</p>
              <p>If the couple can live with in-laws, then fine, but how many can live with in-laws before quarrels breakout?</p>
              <p>The older Sinkaporeans governing this land are getting old, once, they relinquish their posts to foreigners converted citizens, all hell will break lose.</p>
              <p>I have worked with them and see their kind of pattern, Sinkapore sure play egg, in the future.</p>
              <p>That's why foreigners in SInkapore so yaya.</p>
              <p>That's why so many singles in SInkapore, we should not let our children be another economic slave for the government.</p>
              <p>Government policies have nailed the last nail into Sinkapore's coffin.</p>

              <p>are you saying we should "lower our standards" choosing a life partner like your party lowered its standards in choosing its candidates for the last general elections?</p>
              <p>i guess that's why we ended up with clueless, useless, idiotic, brainless, semi-sentient morons like you and the Tin Woman (has she found the Wiseass of Oz yet to find what she is missing?)</p>
