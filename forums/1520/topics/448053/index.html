              <p>Actually to get marry in singapore is a very stupid and not worth it deal.</p>
              <p>There are other alternatives that we can chose beside getting marry such as just finding a gf, prostitute or a maid.</p>
              <div id="post_message_64345191">Let us make a comparison between the 4 of them.<br><br>1. Wife<br><br>The most expensive and useless person to be with. Although you get free sex, free housework and maybe free children also, but if you calculate properly, you actually lose out on the long run.<br><br>You need to spend alot of money to buy her a expensive diamond ring for engagement, expensive wedding dinner and than expensive honeymoon.<br><br>After this, you still need to give her and her parents money every month, pay for all the household expenses and children expenses too. You still need to bear with the demands of her parents<br><br>If she divorce you, you still have to give her half of your assets<br><br>A total waste of money to get marry.<br><br>2. Gf<br><br>You get free sex and you can also ask her to do housework for you.<br><br>You need to spend some money on her such as pay for the expenses if you go out together(but sometimes you can also ask her to pay), buy her gifts on her birthday, valentie day etc (but you can also ask her to buy gifts for you on your birthday and valentie day).<br><br>The bad thing is you cannot have kids with your gf. If she is pregnant she will ask you to marry her. If you don't want to marry her most likely she will break up with you and abort your child.<br><br>Overall, gf is much cheaper than wife and very good for people who wants sex and housework to be done without any committment and without kids.<br><br>3. Prostitute.<br><br>You get sex for a cheap price. You can always chose a different prostitute each time, whereas gf and wife, you are stuck with doing the same woman everytime until it become sian.<br><br>The bad thing is that prostitute cannot give you children and do housework for you. Of course, if you want, you can pay her money to have your children and than after she give birth, she gives the child back to you and than you break all ties with her.<br><br>The good thing is prostitue is much cheaper than the wife and gf.<br><br>4. Maid.<br><br>She can do housework for you for a very cheap price every month. As for sex, you can pay her like $50 everytime to have it with her.<br><br>You can also pay her if you want her to give you a child and after she give birth, you take the child, give her a lump sum of money than send her back.<br><br>Overall, having a maid is the cheapest if you want sex, housework to be done and also your opwn child.<br><br>So really, there is no need to get marry lah.<br><br>Just go employ a maid will do</div>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or if you think the maid is too ugly, you can find a chio bu foreign bride, send her to the maid agency for training and than she not only can have sex with you but also can help you to do housework.</p>
              <p>These foreign girls you give them $500 a month allowance and make them everyday stay at home they also happy whereas if you have a singapore girl as a wife, you will have to give her more than $500 a month allowance not including giving money to her parents yet</p>

              Hi TS.....
              I am married.
              In order not to make things difficult for my husband,
              I do not have any diamond ring.
              I did not celebrate my wedding.
              I do not celebrate wedding anniversaries or birthdays.
              My husband's family did not have to give any dowry.
              CNY visitation - my husband is free to choose whether he wants to visit my side or not.
              CNY reunion dinner - my house is open to my inlaws and parents who are free to come over for the reunion dinner at my place.
              In oder not to stress my husband financially, I never stopped working.
              The children I bore him are free, ie naturally conception.
              My husband is allowed to play xbox as much as he likes. There is no curfew.
              
              The secret to a happy marriage is to make your man feel that he is not married.
              And that he is coming home everyday with his wife smiling and hugging him with open arms.

              <p>Die also funeral - cremation - burial expenses far superseed cost of wife.</p>
              <p>Answer:</p>
              <p>1) Wife.</p>
              <p>You sure you can get free sex? You have to beg her for sex - literally.</p>
              <p>Yes you lose if you don't have children. So if you get married to somebody who is 33 and older - better consider - harder to bear kids.</p>
              <p>2) GF.</p>
              <p>Are you sure sex is free? Nowadays GF are smart enough to bargain before they want to have sex with you. Nowadays GF are more "pure" and would withhold their virginity only for their husbands.</p>
              <p>Unless you want an underage GF. Risk: You get caught - go to jail - come out as a criminal pedophile.</p>
              <p>3) Prostitute.</p>
              <p>High risk of STD. My friend went to Thailand for orgy with prostitutes. Came back HIV positive. He wore condom - apparently it broke.</p>
              <p>If not HIV there are other STD like gonorhea and hepatitis.</p>
              <p>Also - I got  a friend who went to geylang for sex - was on the way to the hotel holding hand with prostitute - accidentaly ran into one of his wife friend. The friend reported to his wife. Obviously - he die.</p>

              <p>Have sex with Maid? You crazy? Very lecer. Afterward the maid take advantage of situation and claim that you rape her? Then if she is Indon even worse. Cause a national outrage from Indonesia. Then you kena extradited to Indon prison and get bashed up and anus probed by Indon prisoners.</p>

              <p>If everything is measured in dollars and cents, then abit hard. Sometimes human relationships go far beyond that.

              <p>If one day you're going to jail for a crime you never commit, then you need someone to take care of your parents (at the same time you no money to give her because you no longer working), after 5 years you get released, who you think is still there for you and took care of your parents?</p>
              <p>Alot of things go far beyond money in a human relationship. But that's assuming you're getting someone trustworthy. Some wife may not be so. But then again, the probability of a trustworthy wife is higher than a prostitute or maid.</p>

              <p><br>the divorce rate is high because guys tend to go for looks, not personality, going for looks alone is not a wise way to find a GOOD wife. =) and also alot of guys never really filter the girls they dated... like for example, last time i date, i will run "tests" to identify if the girl loves money or me and identify the way she respond in certain situations. By doing so, you can filter out the ones you don't think is good quality and loves money. Sure, I end up giving up alot of girls but it's all worth it because eventually you'll get to that special quality one.</p>

              <p><br>Yep, I never mention the bad apples. But if you take the bad apples of any group, then confirm plus chop it makes everything look bad mah. For example, driving mercedes is a safer car compared to driving a bike, but suddenly I give you a mercedes with the engine about to explode the moment you start the engine, then I claim that driving mercedes is a dangerous car, confirm I am correct mah. So very hard to say something is good or bad when alot of variables depend on whether the apple is good or bad. Prostitute also got money loving ones, also got sincere caring ones driven by circumstances to do what they do but deep down they are not materialistic.</p>
