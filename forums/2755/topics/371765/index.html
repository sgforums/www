              <p>(1) Fine: This is the word women use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up otherwise you will be in trouble.<br> <br>(2) Five Minutes: If she is getting dressed, this means a half an hour. Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the F1 before helping around the house. <br> <br>(3) Nothing: This is the calm before the storm. This means something, and you should be on your toes. Arguments that begin with nothing usually end in fine. <br>(4) Go Ahead: This is a dare, not permission. Don't Do It !  or challenge it , otherwise world war 3 might start. <br> <br>(5) Loud Sigh: This is actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by men. A loud sigh means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time standing here and arguing with you about nothing. (Refer back to # 3 for the meaning of nothing.) <br> <br>(6) That's Okay: This is one of the most dangerous statements a women can make to a man. That's okay means she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake. If you continue to talk more , be expect to get shit so don’t talk further and control yourself.<br> <br>(7) Thanks: A woman is thanking you, do not question, or faint. Just say you're welcome. (I want to add in a clause here - This is true, unless she says 'Thanks a lot' - that is PURE sarcasm and she is not thanking you at all. DO NOT say 'you're welcome' . that will bring on a 'whatever'). <br> <br>(8) Whatever: Is a woman's way of saying F—YOU ! so be careful and don’t ever agitate her !  <br> <br>(9) Don't worry about it, I got it: Another dangerous statement, meaning this is something that a woman has told a man to do several times, but is now doing it herself. This will later result in a man asking 'What's wrong?' For the woman's response refer to # 3.</p>
