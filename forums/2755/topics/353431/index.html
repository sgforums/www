              <p>oh k i try to translate </p>
              <p>first pic: when i was five years old, i like a guy call zai zai, he has two tiger tooth but it's ok. when he has two big oranges, he would give me the big one to eat. </p>
              <p>Now when i met him again, he has this five year old girl calling him daddy. </p>
              <p>2nd pic: when i was 13 years old, i was secretly in love with a guy call ah kun in the opposite class. ah kun looks like this jap star's brother. i would detour to go to the toilet just to see him. this went on for two  years. </p>
              <p>After 15 years, we met again. He already become so chubby and has become a father. hen he looked at me, he looked as if he has saw beautiful swan. this makes me realise that i was an ugly duckling in the past. </p>
              <p>3rd pic: When i was 16 years old, i thought i have fallen in love with someone, my bio teacher. he has a fair complexion and is very thin. For no reason, he always have this fragrance within him. Whenever he pass by me, i would always greedily trying to catch a sniff of the smell on his white shirt. </p>
              <p>he say if i dun make it in uni, then i would be very silly. In the end, i make it to uni but he was married. </p>
              <p>4th pic: When i was 19 years old, i have began my first relationship. during my first year in uni, there was this guy who  will everytime reserve a seat in the library just for me. Other than that, he would buy me delicious food as well. He would also give me discounted roses during valentine day.</p>
              <p>In the end , after we graduate, we went our separate ways. All the things happened between us was just a dream. The thing i miss most is the delicious food that he always buy for me.</p>
              <p>5th pic: When i was 23 years old, i was clever and wanted to find someone who has the looks, the car, the house but i knoe that is unattainable. therefore i lowered my standards to just want to marry someone that is somewhat rich.</p>
              <p>then after that, i heard of too much rich people's stories and how they are playful going ard toying with other people's feelings, i once again lowered my standards. the guy have to be at least very handsome, no money never mind, have the looks can already.</p>
              <p>i dated with few men like this. i dump those that look more ugly than me. those who looks that are better than me dump me. men and women are both are lechers.</p>
              <p>6th pic: When i was 25 years old,  i made up my mind to want to find a guy to spend the rest of my life with. Them i met this guy that who spend his money as if he hates his money. i cannot marry this kind of person at all. </p>
              <p>then the second man that i met is super stingy he would not buy things that are not discounted. the toothpaste is used up already but he still want to squeeze and squeeze and even use scissors to cut open the to check if there are really no toothpaste left. </p>
              <p>I scared if i marry him, he would wear one underwear and never change for 10 years. i better quickly siam </p>
              <p>7th pic: When i was 27 years old, i keep lowering my standards but then i'm still alone. my mum say i'm too fussy. i say that is pursuing perfection, it's different from being fussy. </p>
              <p>8th pic:when i was 30 years old, my condition to find someone is the same when i was 5 years old. i wish there was a guy who is like zai zai like that. if the guy have two big oranges, he will give mi the bigger one. If i like to eat, he would give me all. if i lazy to peel, then he would peel for me. </p>
              <p>if i think that it's troublesome to eat the oranges, then he would make it into orange juice for me to drink. this kind of man is smple and pure in love. i think that is enough already. what more could i ask for. </p>
              <p>9th pic:life is like this. you walk so many roads but in the end it all comes back to the same circle. the person who can spend the rest of the life with you may not be the one who has a passionate relationship with you. </p>
              <p>only those simple , pure love is the most real and the most lasting one. </p>
              <p>cherish the people ard you. </p>
