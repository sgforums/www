              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Gemini VS Virgo</strong></span></p>
              <p>There's good chances of coming out of this combination looking like you've been shredded. (<em>Source: <a href="http://www.aquarianage.org/romance/index.html">AquarianAge Romance</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>For Gemini: This is not the best union, the practical Virgo
              views you as being disorganized and frivolous. You on the other hand
              don't think that the Virgoan knows how to have a good time. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.lovetest.com/">Love Test</a> </em> )</p>
              <p>For Virgo: Not a chance. The risky, carefree fickle Gemini sees
              you as a drag. Truly a miracle if the two of you do interact for any
              length of time. This union is best left alone unless other factors
              prevail in both charts. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.lovetest.com/">Love Test</a> </em> )</p>
              <p>Virgo is critical and Gemini is tactless. Not a good match at
              all. Both have a mental approach to life but the similarities end
              there. Virgo thinks Gemini is scatterbrained and immature. Gemini
              thinks Virgo is a stick in the mud and a bore. Virgo is analytical and
              Gemini looks that as indifference. Virgo is critical and Gemini is
              tactless. Gemini has a roving eye which doesn’t sit well with Virgo. (<em> Source: Astrology Fun </em>)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Gemini Man &amp; Virgo Woman</h3>
              <p>This match probably won’t lead to long-term love. You both have
              active and intelligent minds, and that might draw you towards each
              other at first. Unfortunately, he is a wild thing who brings out your
              jealous and controlling side. Gemini boys are incorrigible flirts who
              just can’t resist making eyes at every girl they see. They also have a
              bad reputation for being unfaithful. This will drive you nuts. He will
              hate your need to always know where he is and what he’s doing (and with
              who) and he’ll start feeling trapped. Yes, he’s attractive, but he’s
              just too unreliable for a level-headed girl like you. This is a
              mismatch. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.myjellybean.com/astrology/soulmate/soulmate.htm">Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>With Gemini boy, Virgo girl will have a partner with whom to
              commiserate.  It's nice to be understood, and that's the beauty of this
              relationship; you often think and feel the same things at the same
              time. Even the stuff that creeps you out or thrills you may be the
              same, and there's safety and comfort in your shared feelings. (<em>Source: <a href="http://www.ellegirl.com/horoscopes/index.vm">FUNgirl - Astrology</a> </em> )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Gemini Woman &amp; Virgo Man</h3>
              <p>This match has hardly any hopes for working out. You have a very
              intellectual approach to life. So does Virgo. Put you both together and
              you have two people with intellectual approaches to life. Does that
              sound exciting? It’s not! Even worse, the Virgo boy will have a totally
              different intellectual outlook on life than you do, meaning you’ll
              spend most of your time together arguing. You won’t even be able to
              distract yourself by fooling around, because the physical chemistry
              between you is just about non-existent. A bad match. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.myjellybean.com/astrology/soulmate/soulmate.htm">Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>Gemini girl and Virgo guy share an almost unspoken understanding
              of each other's opinions, thoughts and feelings about the world, which
              can be both refreshing and inspiring. On the flip side, this mutual
              'knowingness' can also be the source of annoyance, on both sides.  The
              best way to keep this match thrilling and wonderful is to practice the
              art of total honesty, and to respect each other's need for occasional
              alone time. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.ellegirl.com/horoscopes/index.vm">FUNgirl - Astrology</a> </em> )</p>

              <p><strong>Leo VS Virgo</strong></p>
              <p>Can work very well --- Virgo likes to serve and the sweet talk is always music to Leo's ears. (<em>Source: <a href="http://www.aquarianage.org/romance/index.html">AquarianAge Romance</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>For Leo: Virgo's desire to be in command and methodical nature
              collides with your carefree, spontaneous temperament. This combo takes
              a lot of compromise on the part of the Virgoan. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.lovetest.com/">Love Test</a> </em> )</p>
              <p>For Virgo: You will have continuous arguments concerning
              finances and sex. Your critical tongue will make the Lion wander,
              seeking the ego-boosting that is necessary for the proud Leo's
              existence. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.lovetest.com/">Love Test</a> </em> )</p>
              <p>Virgo is practical and Leo is extravagant. Virgo is conservative
              and frugal,  nit picky and puts a damper on Leo’s spirit. Leo needs ego
              boosts and Virgo punctures inflated egos. Not much going here. (<em> Source: Astrology Fun </em>)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Leo Man &amp; Virgo Woman</h3>
              <p>Blessed is she who expects nothing, for she shall not be
              disappointed. The Virgo lady will work hard to keep her house in order
              and that will include her sometimes shiftless Leo spouse so long as he
              is under her roof. But there is always an expectation of gratitude at
              work behind the Virgo hustle &amp; bustle and the Leo finds it hard to
              understand why he must show gratitude for what he thinks he deserves.
              Enlightenment will not come to him until she takes a broom to his
              backside and chases him out the door ... (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.aquarianage.org/romance/index.html">AquarianAge Romance</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>This match has very poor prospects of living past the
              short-term. The Leo boy is very outgoing and energetic. Paired with
              you, he becomes incredibly overbearing and bossy. He’ll drive you crazy
              with his constant demands. He’ll order you around, telling you what to
              do, what to wear, where you’re going. He’ll always have to have his
              way. You will rebel, sooner or later, refusing to be dominated by him
              and his bullying ways. That will lead to big blowout battles and nasty
              words exchanged. This is an explosive match (in a bad way) that’s best
              left alone. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.myjellybean.com/astrology/soulmate/soulmate.htm">Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>Virgo girl may initially be attracted to Leo boy (and who
              isn't?) but his long-term show boat style may begin to grate on Virgo
              girl's nerves.  This is a workable relationship, as long as Virgo can
              view her Leo boy as 'as is,' merch, instead of trying to change him
              into something he isn't, or doesn't want to be. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.ellegirl.com/horoscopes/index.vm">FUNgirl - Astrology</a> </em> )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <h3>Leo Woman &amp; Virgo Man</h3>
              <p>This could work out well during the courtship phase when the Virgo
              showers attentions on his new-found treasure and the Leo laps it up
              but, eventually, the Virgo will expect his purring wife to show some
              signs of reciprocation and that's when the fur will fly. (<em>Source: <a href="http://www.aquarianage.org/romance/index.html">AquarianAge Romance</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>This is a match that is best avoided. You may be drawn to a
              Virgo boy for his intelligence and sharp ways. Unfortunately, he won’t
              understand you at all. Your need for drama won’t charm him, it will
              just puzzle him. He’ll always wonder what the fuss is about. The
              excitement and creativity that you treasure in life are just annoyances
              to him. He’d rather be at home alphabetizing his record collection than
              going to a party. This guy matched with you is a major downer who will
              drag down your spirits. It’s better not to get involved so you don’t
              get depressed. Leave this match alone. (<em>Source: <a href="http://www.myjellybean.com/astrology/soulmate/soulmate.htm">Jellybean's Astro-Soulmate Guide</a> </em>)</p>
              <p>Leo girl gets the job done, and Virgo boy loves her for it. 
              Talk about a mutual admiration society! Leo girl just needs to remember
              that Virgo is a creature of habit, and it's important to respect his
              routines, even if it does mean having to turn down prime concert
              tickets at the last minute. (<em> Source: <a href="http://www.ellegirl.com/horoscopes/index.vm">FUNgirl - Astrology</a> </em> )</p>
