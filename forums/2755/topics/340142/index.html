              <p>Well, since this is a talk cock forum, I guess I can put this here. haha...</p>
              <p>Does anybody like myself, have a super duper obssessively controlling mother? Well, don't get me wrong though, I love my mum very much, however, there's just something about her that kinda ticks me off at times.</p>
              <p>She jumps at anything and everything that does not seem to match her train of thoughts, or even anything or everything that is out of her control. Maybe like a decision that my brother made to hang out late at one of his army buddy's place over the weekend, beer and watching EPL, well, I don't see anything wrong with that, but my mum was jumping up and down about it.</p>
              <p>Basically, she's so used to controlling my sibblings and I, that now that we are grown up, and we start to make our own decisions, she's not used to it. She's so used to making all the decisions for us, telling us what to do, what not to do, what to say, what not to say, who to hang out with, and who not to hang out with.</p>
              <p>Okay, maybe when we were all young, it's good for us, so we don't end up committing crimes or fall into bad company. But come on, I mean, most of us are grown up, working adults, we ought to be old enough to make our own choices.</p>
              <p>Anyway, to cut the story short, my mum has been freakin' out the past few years. Every decision that my brother, my sis and myself are making, she's like the audtior. Everything must have her approval. Some people consider us as being spoilt because my mum always makes the decision for us.</p>
              <p>My elder sister happens to be the first person to breakthrough. Nowadays, she's making decisions with and without my mum's knowledge. She understands that if she wants to do something in her life, she can't always depend on my mum's approval. If everything also need her approval, nothing will ever get done. Well, my mum is super conservative, from those traditional chinese family background kind.</p>
              <p>Well, this is the only thing I don't like about my mum. I love her for everything she is still. But sometimes, I do hope that she'll change.</p>
              <p>Has anyone overcome this experience, if you happen to share it?</p>

              <p>well i guess ur mum really love u guys alot. thats why she is being over obessed with the decision u guys made. she just wants to make sure u guys go through the right path.</p>
              <p>yes, u might have been a grown up. but in ur parents eyes. she still see u guys as little kids. its normal for some parents to regard their grown up kids as little ones because she just love u guys alot.</p>
              <p>for me, im glad my mother don't gets into the way of my life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>quite frankly, I don't know about that. But I guess when I do have my own kids, and by the time they reach 16..18, I would want to train them to make their own decisions. And to be responsible for their own decisions.</p>
              <p>Personally, since I started late, I guess it's always best to learn how to responsible for our own lives, and the decisions we make at a younger age.</p>
              <p>It'll be much better I guess.</p>

              <p>Honestly, when I do have my own children. I think I would want to train them to be able to make their own responsible decisions and choices when they turn 16..18. I think it's important to know how to be independent. And not everything also have to depend on other people.</p>
              <p>Yeah, I'll probably worry for them and think too much some times. Like my parents always do. But I think I'll let them make their own decisions and face the consequences as well. I'll guide them, but I'll try my best not to tell them what to choose.</p>
              <p>I think learning to be independent, should start earlier in their teenage years. And not wait until they start their working life.</p>
              <p>What do you think?</p>
