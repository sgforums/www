              <p>some ppl do not choose to get hurt but they are hurt by someone's choice. some people keep it buried in their hearts and not show others their tears, their hurts. they feel stupid and silly just by talking about it. some people vent it on others and keep doing it. the person the people vent it on, did they choose to get hurt themselves when they did not expect it at all the words that will hurt so much. they did not choose to get hurt but then when words are said, at that split second, the words act as double edged sword that pierce through the person's heart. </p>
