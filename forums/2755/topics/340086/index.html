              <p>Hey wassup everyone! Is there anyone here that shares a similar passion for Theatre Arts in Singapore?</p>
              <p>Well, I'm currently switching line, and most probably will move into this line. Been a long time dream and desire.</p>
              <p>One of the things I'm doing is that I'm preparing for my enrol to LASALLE next year. However, in the midst of it, I'm still facing strong opposition from my otherwise tradition chinese background parents. My dad still wants me to be an engineer of some sort. My mum wants me to become a Physiotherapist. </p>
              <p>I don't see myself as any of those. Anyone out there who share a similar experience? You having a desire to do something in your life, but have to overcome objections and persecutions from your family members?</p>

              <p>Yeah, I know what you mean. Ultimately, this is my life, and the choice that I decide to make, will eventually affect not just myself, but also the loved ones around me. So, in that sense, whatever happens, I need to be ready to face those consequences.</p>
              <p>Yeah, one of the worse things is to start and quit halfway, that says a lot about person, and his/her credibility. So yeah, I don't want to become that person who loses my credibility.</p>
              <p>I'm determined to go all the way. I did not wait 10 years for this opportunity, just to quit halfway.</p>

              <p>Likewise man, anyway, I gotta admit one thing, I've grew up the most of my life being spoilt. Everytime I have an issue, I'll always cry for help and wait for someone to solve it for me.</p>
              <p>However, this time around, the pursue of my passion, has challenged me to change my thinking and to be more independent. I can't always depend on people to help me solve my problems. I just realized that if I want it badly enough, I gotta have the courage and responsibility to work it out on my own.</p>
              <p>For one, I have to figure out all the expenses myself, figure out a way to support myself through school. In fact, for the first time, I feel that it's okay if I don't have the support of my parents in what I do. If I need my parent's support in everything I do, then I might just end up doing nothing much.</p>
              <p>I think this will be a good season of my life to learn to be more independent.</p>

              <p>It's nothing but the first small step. There's still a very long journey ahead. Who knows...its a possibility...someday I might just become the next theatre director in Singapore...haha...kinda like those broadway, west end directors...</p>
              <p>Those are really good. Recently, I read about the profile of a Broadway Director...she's like won, 2 or 3 Tony Awards...and plus also, other awards...amazing..she's only in her late 30s.</p>
              <p>Tony Awards is kinda like the Oscar for Theatre Arts. And no Singaporeans, so far, has made it to Tony Awards...unless the director or playwright is super "zai"...u noe what I mean...</p>
              <p>Well, to even be nominated for Tony Awards...its a nice dream to have...it'll definitely put Singapore on the global map for Theatre Arts.</p>
