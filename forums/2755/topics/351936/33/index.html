              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Normally I would give credit to the moderator when they say that. But for you, I hate to say that you dun qualify to say this as my encounters with you have not given me the impression that you are as impartial as you claim.</p>
              <p>But since you are here, may I kindly ask you to explain why you lock <strong><a rel="nofollow" href="/forums/2788/topics/343017?page=3">this thread</a></strong>?</p>
              <p><strong><em>I have to clarify that Keii was quite a gentleman and he had already apologise to me via PM and the misunderstanding was resolved.</em></strong></p>
              <p>I was not doing any flaming of any sort. I was not being a troll and most importantly, I was not being offensive to anyone. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> believe I conduct myself in a socially acceptable manner.</span> As a matter of fact, I believe most people would agree with me if I were to say that what happened was uncalled for. All I was asking for was a proper apology.  I was denied a proper apology, and I quote this said by you after you lock it up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It does not take a genuis to see what you meant by "that level" in this sentence. But your explanation to me on this issue via PM seems to be rather passive and unapologetic. And since showing other people's PM on the main thread is how you normally communicate, I thought it is better I go to your "level" so that you can understand what I'm trying to say better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By your context, it is obvious that you deduce that what I said was offensive and thus an apology was not necessary when you deny me that apology when I was asking for it. So please read through my posts in that thread again to let me know what you find so offensive that you deny me of such rights.</p>
              <p>So since you are so impartial in your moderating, please explain the following :</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">1) Why was the thread lock up?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">2) Should a moderator comment on the issue in this manner if he/she is so impartial?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">3) Please explain the term "Basic Forum etiquette". Please explain in full what is mean by "basic Forum etiquette". Please quote the source you got this term from.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thank you very much.</span></p>

              <p>Hi Keii,</p>
              <p>Firstly, by clarifying that the misunderstanding was resolved in italics in my post, I did not want to drag you into this. Looking at the time between your post and his post, I believe it would be Detached who inform you of this post and I think a lot of us here can see that he was trying to get you involved, not me.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I was bringing past issues up as an example of Detached "impartiality". There were no other agenda involved.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, I Pmed you first to clarify the misunderstanding so that I can get my due apology. I do not wish to post the Pm here as that would involve someone else whom I think you would not want to involve too. So please stay out of this issue. It is strictly between me and Detached.</p>
              <p>I wish you good health and a speedy recovery.</p>

              <p>The first part seems to imply to us that you did what you did because it is your duty and there was nothing personal.</p>
              <p>The second part seems to imply that you are impartial and that you are being as impartial as you should be.</p>
              <p>I'm
              trying not to be sacarstic in my replies. But it seems like you are
              again starting a trend. Would you like me to be sacarstic too? I can be
              pretty good at that though I never really try. and if you are
              wondering, I'm not trying yet.</p>
              <p>Following your kind recommendation
              I read up on the article you pointed to. I'm wondering if you actually
              just googled this when I asked you or if you already knew of it's
              existence before I asked you to elaborate on this. I'm also wondering
              if you read the text within the article itself. Although I admit to
              having made a mistake based on the "forum etiqutte" recommended, I also
              see a lot of other things that other people are doing and you not
              punishing them the way it should be done, so are you saying that this
              "forum etiqutte" only applies to me and not others? I'm not trying to
              imply anything here, I'm only trying to get a definite reason for your
              behaviour. It really is ok with me for you to say that you have
              something against me. It is normal, really.</p>
              <p>Last but not least,
              the last part about causing embarassment, you are welcome to dig out
              all my "socially unacceptable" behaviour and post it here. I never run
              away from my past, nor do I regret them. I'm just wondering how much
              more embarassment it will cause to others whether they are still
              visiting the forums or not. Sometimes it takes a mirror to show the truth to ourselves.</p>
              <p>Maybe we should start another thread to talk about this. Not
              really the kind of mood set for a holiday chalet thread. And things are
              getting "heated up" and I dun want this thread to be lock. Wait, can
              you lock this thread too? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The second part seems to imply that you are impartial and that you are being as impartial as you should be.</span></p>
              <p>I'm trying not to be sacarstic in my replies. But it seems like<span style="color: #000000;"> you are again starting a trend</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. Would you like me to be sacarstic too?</span> I can be pretty good at that though I never really try. and if you are wondering, I'm not trying yet.</p>
              <p>Following your kind recommendation I read up on the article you pointed to. I'm <span style="color: #ff0000;">wondering if you actually just googled this when I asked you or if you already knew of it's existence </span>before I asked you to elaborate on this.<span style="color: #000000;"> I'm also wondering if you read the text within the article itself.</span> Although I <span style="color: #ff0000;">admit to having made a mistake </span><span style="color: #000000;">based on the "forum etiqutte" recommended</span>, I also<span style="color: #ff0000;"> see a lot of other things that other people are doing and you not punishing them the way it should be done</span>, so are you saying that this "forum etiqutte" only applies to me and not others? I'm not trying to imply anything here, I'm only trying to get a definite reason for your behaviour. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It really is ok with me for you to say that you have something against me. It is normal, really.</span></p>
              <p>Last but not least, the last part about causing embarassment, you are <span style="color: #ff0000;">welcome to dig out all my "socially unacceptable" behaviour and post it here</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I never run away from my past, nor do I regret them. I'm just wondering how </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">much more embarassment it will cause to others </span><span style="color: #000000;">whether they are still visiting the forums</span> or not. Sometimes it takes a mirror to show the truth to ourselves.</p>
              <p>Maybe we should <span style="color: #ff0000;">start another thread to talk about this</span>. Not really the kind of mood set for a holiday chalet thread. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And things are getting "heated</span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> up"</span> and I dun want this thread to be lock. Wait, can you lock this thread too? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><br>I'll just highlight some points you brought up (which to my misfortune, is easily a good half of your 'essay') and answer directly to them, I'd hate to spend too much time entertaining you.</p>
              <p>Firstly, a passionate discussion/discourse about a particular subject, be it of a political or a non-political nature, does not warrant a lock. Your freedom of speech was respected and honored, till you decided said something we deemed offensive.</p>
              <p>So a moderator is a saint? I can say without any reservation that I still believe I haven't done the wrong thing. At the point, when your thread was locked - there were easily 2 other UOC moderators present, they'd have unlocked your thread if they felt you were mistreated.</p>
              <p>If you've any grievances that your thread got locked by a moderator who is human and 'supposingly-failed-to-be-impartial-all-the-time', please feel free to approach Mos/Bluejuice to file a complaint. I strongly encourage you to do that. I'm confident (based on your reasoning that Mos is an old friend of yours), he'd be on your side. Wait... What impartiality is that? How dare you throw the first stone? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Start whatever you want to, be "sacarstic", be superman or whatever - I couldn't care less.</p>
              <p>To answer your question, I already knew of its existence prior to this. And I thank you for admitting you were wrong to spam, I'm sure to the many moderators, along the likes of Fireice and Jason, it's very obvious that spamming is wrong. But common sense is not that common in today's society, and I truly forgive you for that. Please keep in mind not to spam in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As for 'wrong-doers' who are still unpunished, I must say that Fireice does lock up threads and even ban accounts very often. If you've any complaints that a certain someone is not playing by the books, free free to send her a PM - I'm not the global moderator, you know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Pertaining to airing your dirty linen in the public, sorry not interested. I've enough compassion for the people whom would be embarrassed, than to accept such a wicked and immoral invitation. As for whether or not, you do run away or regret your past - I must say repentance is rare commodity and it's not my business anyway.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you can start any threads you want - but I'm not obliged to partake. And nope, things aren't heating up, detached means free from emotional involvement.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              encourage you to do that. I'm confident (based on your reasoning
              that Mos is an old friend of yours), he'd be on your side. Wait...
              What impartiality is that? How dare you throw the first stone?

              <p>Start whatever you want to, be "sacarstic", be superman or
              whatever - I couldn't care less.</p>
              <p>To answer your question, I already knew of its existence prior
              to this. And I thank you for admitting you were wrong to spam,
              I'm sure to the many moderators, along the likes of Fireice and
              Jason, it's very obvious that spamming is wrong. But common sense
              is not that common in today's society, and I truly forgive you
              for that. Please keep in mind not to spam in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>As for 'wrong-doers' who are still unpunished, I must say that
              Fireice does lock up threads and even ban accounts very often. If
              you've any complaints that a certain someone is not playing by the
              books, free free to send her a PM - I'm not the global moderator,
              you know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Pertaining to airing your dirty linen in the public, sorry
              not interested. I've enough compassion for the people
              whom would be embarrassed, than to accept such a wicked and
              immoral invitation. As for whether or not, you do run away or
              regret your past - I must say repentance is rare commodity and it's
              not my business anyway.</p>
              <p>Lastly, you can start any threads you want - but I'm not obliged
              to partake. And nope, things aren't heating up, detached means free
              from emotional involvement.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
              <p>Kindest regards,<br> Detached</p>
