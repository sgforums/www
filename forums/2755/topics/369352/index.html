              <p>By WILLIAM FOREMAN,Associated Press Writer <cite class="auth">AP - <span>Thursday, July 23</span></cite></p>
              <p class="first">GUANGZHOU,
              China - An employee at a factory that makes iPhones in China killed
              himself after a prototype went missing, and Apple Inc. responded
              Wednesday by saying its suppliers are required to treat workers with
              dignity and respect.</p>
              <p>The dead worker, Sun Danyong, 25, worked in product communications
              at Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwanese firm that makes many Apple
              products at a massive factory in the southern city of Shenzhen, near
              Hong Kong.</p>
              <p>Although Apple and Foxconn have confirmed Sun's
              suicide, they have not provided details about the circumstances, which
              have been reported by the state-run Southern Metropolis Daily, one of
              the region's most popular papers.</p>
              <p>There's tremendous pressure on
              employees dealing with Apple's new products to maintain a high-level
              secrecy over the gadgets, traditionally launched amid great suspense
              and a big marketing buzz. Apple is also a constant target of prying
              journalists, rabidly faithful customers and competitors who make great
              efforts to try to steal a peek at its latest technology.</p>
              <p>Sun was
              responsible for sending iPhone prototypes to Apple, and on July 13 he
              reported that he was missing one of the 16 fourth-generation units in
              his possession, the newspaper reported. His friends said company
              security guards searched his apartment, detained him and beat him, the
              paper reported.</p>
              <p>In the early morning of July 16, Sun jumped from the 12th floor of his apartment building, the paper said.</p>
              <p>Jill Tan, an Apple spokeswoman in Hong Kong, issued only a brief statement about the incident.</p>
              <p>"We
              are saddened by the tragic loss of this young employee, and we are
              awaiting results of the investigations into his death," Tan said. "We
              require our suppliers to treat all workers with dignity and respect."</p>
              <p>The
              hot-selling iPhone has helped make Apple immune to the global
              recession. On Tuesday, the Cupertino, California-based company said its
              earnings jumped 15 percent in the third quarter _ growth propelled by
              laptop and iPhone sales.</p>
              <p>More than 5.2 million iPhones were sold
              in the third quarter _ seven times what it sold at the same time last
              year _ and the spike in sales was partly because of a newly released
              version of the device, the company said.</p>
              <p>One of Apple's most
              important manufacturing partners has long been Foxconn, owned by
              Taiwan's Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. _ the world's biggest contract
              manufacturer of electronics. The corporate behemoth has also produced
              computers for Hewlett-Packard Co., PlayStation game consoles for Sony
              Corp. and mobile phones for Nokia Corp.</p>
              <p>Foxconn said in a statement its security chief has been suspended and turned over to the police.</p>
              <p>The
              security official, Gu Qinming, was quoted by the Southern Metropolis
              Daily as saying he never hit Sun. Gu reportedly said after three
              security personnel searched Sun's apartment and did not find the phone,
              the employee was ordered to go to Gu's office on July 15.</p>
              <p>The security chief said he didn't think Sun was being truthful about the phone, the paper reported.</p>
              <p>"I got a bit agitated. I pointed my finger at him and said that he was trying to shift the blame," Gu was quoted as saying.</p>
              <p>He
              added, "I was a little angry and I pulled his right shoulder once to
              get him to tell me what happened. It (the beating) couldn't have
              happened," the paper reported.</p>
              <p>Local police declined to respond to questions from The Associated Press.</p>
              <p>Foxconn
              executive Li Jinming said in a statement that Sun's death showed the
              company needed to do a better job helping its employees with
              psychological pressures.</p>
              <p>"Sun Danyong graduated from a good
              school. He joined the company in 2008. He had an extremely bright
              future. The group and I feel deep pain and regret when a young person
              dies like this."</p>
