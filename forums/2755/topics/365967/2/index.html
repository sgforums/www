              <p>It was a rainy night when he came into sight<br>Standing by the road, no umbrella, no coat<br>So I pulled up along side and I offered him a ride<br>He accepted with a smile so we drove for a while<br>I didn't ask him his name, this lonely boy in the rain<br>Fate tell me it's right, is this love at first sight<br>Please don't make it wrong, just stay for the night<br>All I wanna do is make love to you<br>Say you will you want me too<br>All I wanna do is make love to you<br>I've got lovin' arms to hold on to<br><br>So we found this hotel, it was a place I knew well<br>We made magic that night. Oh, he did everything right<br>He brought the woman out of me, so many times, easily<br>And in the morning when he woke all I left him was a note<br>I told him I am the flower you are the seed<br>We walked in the garden we planted a tree<br>Don't try to find me, please don't you dare<br>Just live in my memory, you'll always be there<br><br>All I wanna do is make love to you<br>One night of love was all we knew<br>All wanna do is make love to you<br>I've got lovin' arms to hold on to<br><br>Oh, oooh, we made love<br>Love like strangers<br>All night long<br>We made love<br><br>Then it happened one day, we came round the same way<br>You can imagine his surprise when he saw his own eyes<br>I said please, please understand<br>I'm in love with another man<br>And what he couldn't give me<br>was the one little thing that you can<br><br>All I wanna do is make love to you<br>One night of love was all we knew<br>All I want to do is make love to you<br>Come on, say you will, you want me too<br><br>All I wanna do is make love to you<br>One night of love was all we knew<br>All I want to do is make love to you<br>Say you will, you want me too<br><br>All night long ...</p>
