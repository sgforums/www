              <p>step #1, if you're nerdy and love to act cool, don't bother cause either way, the girl going to leave you for being a power poser and liar.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>step #2,  Don't set yourself high standards when even those normal average don't even want you. It makes you look stupid and ignorant. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>step #3, please don't get yourself a girlfriend just because your friends do. It makes you no different than a dog following the master. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>step #4, Don't or Stop smoking! Most girls don't want to risk their health for a relationship that might not even last long <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>

              <p>How to Jio girls?!? I think it is more how to be popular with woman, It is simple, just learn how to treat woman right, respect a woman
                                          and you would earn their respect back as a man. How to treat a
                                          woman right? I can't say there are any exact methods, but I gather a few guidelines that should be pretty
                                          decent.<br> <br> <strong>1) Say the right things at the right time</strong><br> This I reckon is a skill of basic Public Relations, a skill which many know
                                          exsist but do not know how to excercise. It simply means to be
                                          sensitive enough to read body languages, hidden meanings in words
                                          and actions. After your gather such info, analyze, use logic to
                                          decide whether it would be good to say something you want to say
                                          now, and or what to say.<br> <br> <strong>2) Do not save on compliments</strong><br> Why would you want to save on them? Compliments does good only when
                                          they are heard, not unsaid. It also helps to make a woman know what
                                          you like about her, and what are her strength, in this way, you
                                          give her confidence and spiritual support.<br> <strong><br> 3) Be Gracious and Forgiving</strong><br> Do not remember faults of others but rather your own, you can see a
                                          person in better light this way. Thus she would be more easily
                                          aceeptable to you would she not? Be gracious, nobody likes a petty
                                          man, and of course woman included.<br> <br> <strong>4) Be romantic, but keep things simple</strong><br> To be romantic does not mean that you got to spent hundreds of
                                          dollars on every date or such, but to be romantic can simply means
                                          the words you say, the things you do, the place you are in, e.t.c.
                                          You can have a star gazing night by the beach and not spent much
                                          but still be romantic. But of course you have to spent to spice
                                          things up once in a while but do not over do it, else the woman
                                          would feel like she is being bought.<br> <br> <strong>5) Do not make her feel obligated</strong><br> Do not go around doing things and then tell her that you are doing
                                          it for her and such. It makes her feel obligated to entertain you.
                                          And you do not want that, for once the obligation is over, so is
                                          her "feelings" for you. Just do things sincerely, for no purpose as
                                          to impress or make her obey. There is no point in such, it would
                                          become a trade then.<br> <br> <strong>6) Little things do count</strong><br> It is not so much the big things that count that much to woman, or
                                          I would rather say that it is not only the big things that counts.
                                          Simple things like opening the door, pulling out her chair over
                                          dinner, sending her home, constanly assuring them how nice they
                                          look just means as much to them as would when you buy a diamond
                                          ring. So do not forget these little things for they mean a lot
                                          too.<br> <br> <strong>7) Touchy no no</strong><br> You dun go around touching woman just because you think they want
                                          you to. Most of the time they dun. So keep your hands off, even if
                                          you need to touch them, do not let them feel threaten like you are
                                          going to eat them up. I have seen this gal who is pretty turn off
                                          by my friend when he attempts to hold her hand while they are
                                          crossing the road. Yes it is suppose to give her security, but
                                          think of it this way, would she feel uncomfortable? Actually from
                                          my expereince, what you just need to do, is to place your plam just
                                          behind her but not touching, and give her a little push if you need
                                          to hurry her across the road. Imagine the hilarity of a woman being
                                          drag across the road by a man holding on to her hand. Which looks
                                          better? My scenario I suppose, and it is polite too, you do not
                                          invade her physical space unnecessarily.<br> <br><strong>8) Understand their needs</strong><br> The last and final part is to understand them, understand their
                                          needs. Listen when they need you to, talk when you are required. It
                                          is no easy task, for each and every human being is different, so
                                          this you got to work on it, you got to expereince it yourself to
                                          know.</p>

              man, and of course woman included.<br> <br> <strong>4) Be romantic, but keep things simple</strong><br> To be romantic does not mean that you got to spent hundreds of
              dollars on every date or such, but to be romantic can simply means
              the words you say, the things you do, the place you are in, e.t.c.
              You can have a star gazing night by the beach and not spent much
              but still be romantic. But of course you have to spent to spice
              things up once in a while but do not over do it, else the woman
              would feel like she is being bought.<br> <br> <strong>5) Do not make her feel obligated</strong><br> Do not go around doing things and then tell her that you are doing
              it for her and such. It makes her feel obligated to entertain you.
              And you do not want that, for once the obligation is over, so is
              her "feelings" for you. Just do things sincerely, for no purpose as
              to impress or make her obey. There is no point in such, it would
              become a trade then.<br> <br> <strong>6) Little things do count</strong><br> It is not so much the big things that count that much to woman, or
              I would rather say that it is not only the big things that counts.
              Simple things like opening the door, pulling out her chair over
              dinner, sending her home, constanly assuring them how nice they
              look just means as much to them as would when you buy a diamond
              ring. So do not forget these little things for they mean a lot
              too.<br> <br> <strong>7) Touchy no no</strong><br> You dun go around touching woman just because you think they want
              you to. Most of the time they dun. So keep your hands off, even if
              you need to touch them, do not let them feel threaten like you are
              going to eat them up. I have seen this gal who is pretty turn off
              by my friend when he attempts to hold her hand while they are
              crossing the road. Yes it is suppose to give her security, but
              think of it this way, would she feel uncomfortable? Actually from
              my expereince, what you just need to do, is to place your plam just
              behind her but not touching, and give her a little push if you need
              to hurry her across the road. Imagine the hilarity of a woman being
              drag across the road by a man holding on to her hand. Which looks
              better? My scenario I suppose, and it is polite too, you do not
              invade her physical space unnecessarily.<br> <br> <strong>8) Understand their needs</strong><br> The last and final part is to understand them, understand their
              needs. Listen when they need you to, talk when you are required. It
              is no easy task, for each and every human being is different, so
              this you got to work on it, you got to expereince it yourself to
              know.</p>
