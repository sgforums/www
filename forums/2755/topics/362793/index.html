              <p>Quite a gd story </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: 'lucida grande'; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px;">I arrived at the address where someone had requested a taxi. I honked but no one came out. I honked again; nothing. <br><br>So I walked to the door and knocked. <br><br>'Just a minute', answered a frail, elderly voice. <br><br>I could hear something being dragged across the floor.<br><br>After a long pause, the door opened. A small woman in her 90's stood before me. She was wearing a print dress and a pillbox hat with a veil pinned on it, like somebody out of a 1940s movie.<br><br>By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets..<br><br>There were no clocks on the walls, no knick-knacks or utensils on the counters. In the corner was a cardboard box filled with photos and glassware.<br><br>'Would you carry my bag out to the car?' she said. I took the suitcase to the cab, and then returned to assist the woman.<br><br>She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.<br><br>She kept thanking me for my kindness. 'It's nothing', I told her. 'I just try to treat my passengers the way I would want my mother treated'..<br><br>'Oh, you're such a good boy', she said. <br><br>When we got in the cab, she gave me an address, and then asked, 'Could you drive through downtown?'<br><br>'It's not the shortest way,' I answered quickly.<br><br>'Oh, I don't mind,' she said. 'I'm in no hurry. I'm on my way to a hospice'.<br><br>I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. 'I don't have any family left,' she continued. 'The doctor says I don't have very long.' I quietly reached over and shut off the meter.<br><br>'What route would you like me to take?' I asked.<br><br>For the next two hours, we drove through the city. <br><br>She showed me the building where she had once worked as an elevator operator.<br><br>We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds. <br><br>She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.<br><br>Sometimes she'd ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness, saying nothing.<br><br>As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon, she suddenly said, 'I'm tired. Let's go now'<br><br>We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building, like a small convalescent home, with a driveway that passed under a portico.<br><br>Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent, watching her every move. They must have been expecting her.<br><br>I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.<br><br>'How much do I owe you?' she asked, reaching into her purse.<br><br>'Nothing,' I said<br><br>'You have to make a living,' she answered.<br><br>'There are other passengers,' I responded.<br><br>Almost without thinking, I bent and gave her a hug. <br><br>She held onto me tightly.<br><br>'You gave an old woman a little moment of joy,' she said.<br><br>'Thank you.'<br><br>I squeezed her hand, and then walked into the dim morning light. Behind me, a door shut. It was the sound of the closing of a life.<br><br>I didn't pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of<br>that day, I could hardly talk. What if that woman had gotten an angry driver, or one who was impatient to end his shift?<br><br>What if I had refused to take the run, or had honked once, then driven away? On a quick review, I<br>don't think that I have done anything more important in my life.<br><br>We're conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.<br><br>But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a<br>small one.<br><br>PEOPLE MAY NOT REMEMBER EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID, <br>OR WHAT YOU SAID, <br>BUT THEY WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER HOW YOU MADE THEM FEEL.</span></p>
