              <p>i think that women should not have this idea to change men before or after marriage, because in a relationship, people influence each other without knowing it. honestly speaking, what you see is what you get, people dun change that much. </p>

              <p>spare a thought for the non-chinese forummers rachel...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>She falls in love with your performance not necessarily is good to you,
              she is good to you when not necessarily is wants with you to go to bed,
              do not misunderstand. She bustles about not necessarily is enriches,
              perhaps is only because lonely, therefore, if you fall in love with
              her, do not fear that disturbs her. She quarrels with you when not
              necessarily has the matter really, but is wants to act like a spoiled
              brat has not looked to the way, wrong thought that like this you will
              note her. Quarrels not to give her the time to be calm, in fact she
              does not need to be calm, she needs you to speak with her coaxes her.
              She wants to cry when do not ask the reason first, but at any time
              under any condition, first gives her a shoulder to let her have the
              dependence. She did not know how should manage when liked saying bids
              good-bye, was mostly is retreating in order to advance, although does
              not have oneself to back down frequently. She all day when talks
              incessantly with you, is because she is also liking you being willing
              to share with you, the woman does not love the way, is silences. She
              has become “the yellow-faced old woman” the reason often is because of
              depressed, but this kind depressed certain and your love related,
              therefore, can also change. She vainly hoped for when some not
              realistic are romantic, do not break her crudely, if the company vainly
              hoped for also withers the woman is more fearful. When majority she is
              dynamic, your always static state, do not be together when you need to
              interact, even if is lock horns. The women are Shui Zuo, therefore
              prefers is hot she also to leave is being cold she, otherwise a zero
              degree she will have formed the ice, was freezing you finally.
              Sometimes she needs to listen to some rumors, for instance wanted you
              saying that any you said anything, in you did not blush in the
              situation spoke of her to blush. She is worried most does not like a
              person treating, at this time she will not dislike that you will be
              bothersome, you will jump over with her are tangled up she more to feel
              better at heart. When she is jealous may not be amusing, the most
              effective means let her not have the vinegar to be possible to eat, or
              is drown to death in the vinegar cylinder, but you. Woman's tear not is
              a pearl, but you certainly each time regard them the pearl, like this
              she will only then become Lian Ku is very parsimonious. She spoke the
              words you to be possible suitably to neglect, but in she needs your
              time please to accompany side her, this may let her aftertaste
              frequently for a lifetime. The women are perceptual, therefore Chang
              Hui is some you to think the retarded matter, also because of this, she
              only then needs your reminder with to protect. After is not all women
              have been the mother, can grow up and become strong, therefore, the
              correct raise child's heavy responsibility is on frequently yours
              shoulder. She scolds your time is because loves you, she hits your time
              is also because loves you, on this spot and man's performance
              completely is just opposite. The gentle woman will also have the
              temperament, the strong woman will also have the frailty, the
