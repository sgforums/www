              <p>Honestly i'm a blogger who blogs about my own life and express myself about what i'm thinking. Yes. My blog has brought lots of troubles for myself. The reason's simple,some ppl in the cyberworld,are just not happy with how i THINK. and so they decided to correct me by spamming my chatbox blah blah blah. Some ppl just wan me to think in the way on how they think.</p>
              <p>personally,i think that a blog is just something for u to read and not comment on. Yes,the person might be wrong if he's using his blog to make fun of someone or doing some other childish stuff like spreading a lame rumour around.</p>
              <p>But sometimes,when a blogger's blogging,he would most likely blog about what he is thinking at that point of time about certain stuff that went thru his life. He might wanna express his thoughts about them and share it with others in the cyberworld. Sometimes,certain stuff are not easy to express it out when u meet people face to face. Sometimes,u cant even find the right person to express your thoughts. and blogs are what they turn into. Thinking deeper if u dunno what i mean.</p>
              <p>those troubles that i went thru becoz of blogging did not stop me from blogging. i believe everyone has their own rights to blog their thoughts and their daily life.</p>
