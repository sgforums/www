              <p>why are some guys just so sensitive? argh.. my brother really want my mum to spell out everything that she want. first thing his voice is already so loud. then he do the wrong thing at the wrong time without knowing that what he does is wrong. when i tell him not to raise his voice n the wrong thing that he does, he insist that he did not do anything wrong and instead blame my mum for losing her temper.</p>
              <p>really blockhead u knoe he! . he say my mum is a very difficult woman to deal with. i do admit my mum is quite difficult at times but i do understand my mum do show her concern the wrong way sometimes but she loves us a lot.</p>
              <p>my brother just do not get it at all, he thinks that my mum looks down on him.</p>
              <p>i just do not understand why he can be so insensitive sometimes</p>

              <p>i think youyayu has a point in that if some things need to be done, just say it out.. sometimes, not the guy see and dunwan do.. but just that he missed it altogether..</p>
              <p>but the tone and voice part, i think someone better knock some sense into him.. if at 26yrs old one stil does not know how to respect their own parents and find them naggy, self-reflection is really short in supply..</p>

              <p>i have clearly told him how to behave in front of my mum because

              did not do all these things and still want to make my mum so angry.

              <p>wah sai.. hmm.. can give one solid example?</p>
              <p>i think youyayu has a point in that if some things need to be
              done, just say it out.. sometimes, not the guy see and dunwan do..
              but just that he missed it altogether..</p>
              <p>but the tone and voice part, i think someone better knock some
              sense into him.. if at 26yrs old one stil does not know how to
              respect their own parents and find them naggy, self-reflection is
              really short in supply..</p>

              <p>my mother already told him that if he wants to be certified accountant, he just have to finish his studies first then he can get higher pay and at least have some certification.</p>
              <p>but he refuse and he blame my mum for nagging at him all the time. actually i agree with my mum because my brother only have a levels. so having a certification is also not a bad idea. but my brother just want to go on his way then wrk in a accounting firm and come home keep complaining how tough it is, there is so many things that he have not learn, then my mum just sort of nag him asking him to go n study for the certification then he raise his voice at my mum again. but my brother still insist on his way.</p>
              <p>i think sooner or later he have to take that certifcation, he have to take one because he already have the experience le ma but then he is not certified after all.</p>
              <p>actually my brother do not have any wrong. he make his own decision. just do not like him keep complaining abt this and that then always raise his voice at my mum</p>
              <p>frankly speaking, i also cannot tahan my mum's nagging but over the years, i just let her yank finished and be sensitive to get out of her way, and try not to make her more angry. but my brother just dun care i think.</p>
