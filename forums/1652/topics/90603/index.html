The tools refer to how you handle them in your way.<br><br>As for me the tools i use on my boyfriends includes the following<br><br>1) give them a chance to express themselves when you meet or chat coincidently and do not provide any comment and it include agreeing or disagreeing with them for whatever conversation arises between ex<br>3) the next time you chat, ask them blunt question like "kuan ni shen muah shi", "kuan ni pi shi" if needed be ignore their mails and calls (change the contact number will be better)<br>5) let you friend or colleague noe that your boyfriend (ex) is not included in any party arranged with your presence. this calls for isolation from your side to be extended over to your group and circle of friends, serves him right.<br><br></div>
