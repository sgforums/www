            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone! I'm doing a major gathering of datas for marketing now.<br>I hope students/Graduates of any schools could join in and contribute to it~<br><br>I'm actually gathering datas from School Notes, Websites, Books and any resource that is reliable and combine all the notes together!~<br>My aim is to create a 'Perfect' notes for a marketing student.<br>(Basically, reading and understanding it, can lead to distinctions)<br><br>Books are of no problems to me, but i guess everyone here should also understand that books has information that are too scattered and unless we have a good command of English, we wouldn't be able to understand it completely. And different books have different explainations, and some even outdated~<br><br>Websites is a good source for my research too~! i'm doing my best to find whatever i can on the internet~ if anyone knows any good ones, please kindly tell me too~!<br><br>Finally, I would like to explain why i choose to combine different school's notes~ Well... Basically, school notes are extracted jest from textbooks!!! And they're so valuable that usually different class and schools will not outleak them publically~ and notes are usually summarize to the extent where we students can understand to the fullest as possible. Therefore, its the most important thing needed in my research this time.<br><br>Hmm... you guys would be wondering.. "Why don't do it with ur school members?". Well... i can answer you that i realised after some time that my "Group Members" have not been helping out at all! I've been leeched for all this time and that's why i'm going to do something myself this time!<br><br>Guys! Please kindly lend me your help! If you still have your marketing notes with you, please lend them to me! Soft copies of your notes will be most appreciated! I know that i shouldn't be able to do it alone, so i need the help from all of you! And if anyone is interested~ i welcome you to join me in this research! Lets do this together please!</div>

Say the simple advertising in the Promotion factor.<br>The advertising has so many different explanation but each showing a focus point their passage. And like what you said, notes are usually involved summarising original author's works. That's why i also wanna know the way different ppl pick out the different points from the same theory made.<br>(Basically picking up the skills slowly also, that means... should i pass the notes i've made out of all the materials i got... they can nver understand why and how its done... because all the points taken are selected thru different views)<br><br>The other thing is... sometimes lecturers will add in things that are not found in the books or words that is simplified for us to understand more and so results in memorising more of the theories...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laurence82:</div><div class="quote_body">Go read up those seminal works</div></blockquote>Hmm... what kind are you referring to?
