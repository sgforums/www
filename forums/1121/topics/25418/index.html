            <div class='col-md body'>Introduction<br><br>With Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Bioware and Black Isle Studios hope to improve on the game widely whispered to have saved the RPG genre, Baldur's Gate. The game boasts an amazingly large amount of gameplay, with numerous major quests that span seven chapters and many smaller quests that depend on which character class you choose to play. New third-edition character classes are included, such as the sorcerer and barbarian.<br><br>This guide contains everything you'll need to know to master the game, including:<br><br>Tips on creating and developing your main character<br><br>Details on all the spells and types of weaponry you can acquire<br><br>Information on your friends and enemies<br><br>A detailed walk-through of the main story of the game<br><br>We'll also tell you how best to defeat your enemies and give you tips on which spells to learn and which to pass over.<br><br>Before you start reading here, however, we highly recommend you take a good hard look at the game manual. The folks at Black Isle, Bioware, and Interplay once again did an outstanding job with the book, and as such, we've left out information that is well explained in the manual. If you're new to AD&amp;D RPGs, read the manual cover to cover before beginning the game.<br><br>Good luck, little one. May you fare well in your travels.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter One: Character Creation<br><br>For those among you who are veterans of Baldur's Gate and have decided to import your old character, you can skip this section. Otherwise, read slowly and carefully, as your choices here will greatly impact everything you do for the course of the game.<br><br>Gender<br><br>Your choice of gender has little effect on the game. The only affected options are character portraits, in-game appearance, and options for NPC (non-player character) romantic interaction with your character. As such, it can slightly affect your choice of subquests within the game, but that's about it. You can even give a male character a female voice, if you're so inclined.<br><br>Race<br><br>While a character's gender is of minimal importance, his race is vitally important. Different races have different classes open to them as well as the choice of dual- or multiclassing. Most also have benefits or penalties. Choose a race that not only allows the class or classes to which you're going to assign a character, but will let you excel in them.<br><br>Humans<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Can choose any class, can dual-class<br>Available classes: All<br>Available multiclasses: None, although humans can dual-class at any time<br><br>Elves<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Resistance to charm and sleep spells, can see in the dark through infravision, +1 when using bow or long sword, +1 dexterity, and -1 constitution<br>Available classes: Fighter, ranger, cleric, druid, mage, thief, specialist mage<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief, fighter/mage, mage/thief, fighter/mage/thief<br><br>Half-elves<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Infravision, limited resistance to charm and sleep spells<br>Available classes: Fighter, ranger, cleric, druid, mage, thief, bard, specialist mage<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief, fighter/cleric, fighter/mage, mage/thief, cleric/mage, fighter/druid, cleric/ranger, fighter/mage/thief, fighter/mage/cleric<br><br>Gnome<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Infravision, resistance to magic, +1 intelligence, -1 wisdom<br>Available classes: Fighter, cleric, thief, specialist mage<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief, fighter/cleric, fighter/illusionist, illusionist/thief, cleric/illusionist, cleric/thief<br><br>Halfling<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Very resistant to magic and poison, infravision, +1 when using slings, +1 dexterity, -1 strength<br>Available classes: Fighter, cleric, thief<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief<br><br>Dwarf<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: Infravision, resistance to magic and poison, +1 constitution, -1 charisma<br>Available classes: Fighter, cleric, and thief<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief, fighter/cleric<br><br>Half-Orc<br><br>Racial benefits and penalties: +1 strength, +1 constitution<br>Available classes: Fighter, cleric, thief, and barbarian<br>Available multiclasses: Fighter/thief, fighter/cleric, cleric/thief<br><br>Different races are better suited to different classes. For example, half-orcs are excellent fighters, since they receive bonuses to strength and constitution, both of which are integral stats for fighters, while a gnome isn't as good a choice, as it gains no real bonuses applicable to battle. Choose wisely.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Class<br><br>By far the most important choice to make when creating a character is which class he will be. A character's class determines his strengths and weaknesses, abilities and restrictions, and so on. You can choose one class for a character or, if non-human, you can multiclass, sharing experience points equally between classes and gaining both the abilities and restrictions of each class. Humans may dual-class, choosing one class and later adding a second class. Multiclassing is straightforward: Simply choose Multiclass, then select the desired class combination.<br><br>Dual-classing is more complicated. Once a human character reaches level 2 in his given class, he may at any time choose to add a second class by selecting Dual-Class on the character information screen. After doing so, the character loses the abilities of the first class until he has surpassed the first class's level in his second class. For example, if Zaxxon, a level 3 wizard, dual-classes to become a wizard/cleric, he loses the ability to cast mage spells until he is a level 4 cleric. After dual-classing, a character can never advance further in his or her first class.<br><br>Baldur's Gate II introduces "kits," which are essentially classes-within-a-class. They offer further specialization within each class, with their own pros and cons. For example, the ranger beast master kit bestows extra stealth on the character, along with the ability to cast more animal summoning spells, but beast masters cannot use metal weapons.<br><br>Warriors<br><br>Warriors are the bread and butter of the AD&amp;D world. Nary a party will survive the dangers of FaerÃ»n without at least two warriors in its ranks.<br><br>Barbarian<br><br>Imagine a slightly weaker, slightly faster fighter, and you've got a barbarian. They move faster than other characters and are immune to extra backstabbing damage. The rage special ability bestows +4 bonuses to constitution and strength, +2 to saving throws vs. magic, a two-point armor class penalty for five rounds, and can be used once per day for every level 4 character. Rage also makes the barbarian immune to charm, fear, hold, and level drain. Beginning with level 11, the barbarian will gain a 10 percent resistance to crushing, missile, piercing, and slashing damage. This will increase by 5 percent at levels 15 and 19. Barbarians also gain a higher average number of hit points when they level up. They cannot wear plate mail and may only put two proficiency points in any given slot. All races can choose to be barbarians. The maximum level attainable in Baldur's Gate II is 19.<br><br>Fighter<br><br>The fighter is your standard-fare butt kicker. He's generally used to soak up damage while dealing out large amounts of pain at the same time. Fighters can gain up to five proficiency points in any given weapon type, making them quite deadly (at the fifth proficiency level, a fighter will get a +2 bonus to hit, a +3 bonus to damage, and an extra attack every other round). Fighters need a high strength rating, and high dexterity and constitution values are musts as well. These fine warriors may use any weapon in the game. Fighters may reach level 19 in Baldur's Gate II.<br><br>Fighter Kits<br>Fighter<br>Standard fighters can use any type of weapon or armor and may gain five weapon specialization points in any area. They cannot use spells.<br><br>Kensai<br>Kensai fighters gain a bonus to hit and to damage every third level, gain a +2 bonus to speed factors every fourth level, and have use of the kai ability, making all attacks do their maximum damage for 10 seconds once a day for every level 4 fighter. On the downside, they cannot wear armor, gauntlets, or bracers, and they can't use missile weapons.<br><br>Berserker<br>The main difference between a berserker and a regular fighter is the berserker's ability to become enraged. While enraged (he can use enrage once a day for every four character levels), the berserker gains a +2 bonus to hit, to damage, and to armor class; a 15-point hit-point bonus; and immunity to charm, fear, hold, imprisonment, maze, sleep, and stun. However, after the enragement wears off, he incurs a two-point penalty to hit, damage, and armor class as well as losing the hit-point bonus.<br><br>Wizard slayer<br>Wizard slayers are specifically bred to take spellcasters down. With every successful hit, the target receives a 10 percent chance of failing in his spellcasting. Also, for every character level, slayers gains a 1 percent magic resistance. They cannot use anything of a magical nature except weapons and armor.<br><br>Monk<br><br>The closest thing to a martial artist in Baldur's Gate II, the monk can deal out amazing amounts of damage with nothing but his bare hands. He cannot cast spells, nor can he wear armor. (He does, however, begin with a very good armor class, so the lack of armor isn't as bad as you may think.) Monks can use the same weapons as thieves, with the exception of two-handed weapons. Also, monks are exceptionally quick and get quicker as they advance, eventually attacking many times per round. But his special abilities really take the cake. Stunning blow (available once per day for every level 4 character) causes the target to have to save with every attack or be stunned. Every third level, the monk gains a one-point bonus to his armor class vs. missiles. At level 5, the monk becomes immune to disease. A level 7, he gains the lay on hands ability, which heals two hit points per level. At level 9, he gains a +1 bonus to saving throws and immunity to charm. At level 10, his fists become a +1 weapon. Level 11 bestows poison immunity. At level 12, his fists become +2 weapons. At level 13, the quivering palms skill becomes available; if the monk hits an opponent with this skill, he must save or be instantly killed. At level 14, monks gain a 42 percent magic resistance that increases 3 percent every level. At level 15, his fists become +3 weapons. Finally, at level 20, only magical attacks can harm him. All in all, if you can get past the inability to wear armor, the monk is a very cool character. Only lawful humans can become monks. Be sure that your monk has excellent constitution, strength, and dexterity. Monks in Baldur's Gate II can reach level 21.<br><br>Ranger Rangers are fighters who just happen to be woodsmen as well. At high levels (8 and above), they gain the ability to cast spells. Rangers can only train to the second proficiency level in weaponry, but can dual-wield weapons, move silently, charm people or mammals, and choose a racial enemy, toward whom they gain immense (+4) combat bonuses. Only humans, elves, and half-elves of good alignment may be rangers, and all rangers need high strength, dexterity, constitution, and wisdom ratings.<br><br>Ranger Kits<br><br>Ranger<br>The standard ranger is detailed in the previous section.<br><br>Archer<br>Our favorite ranger kit, the archer gains immense (and we do mean immense) bonuses to missile weaponry. Every third level bestows a +1 to hit / to damage bonus. Every level 4 archer gains a called shot, bestowing even more bonuses upon his shots for the next ten seconds as follows. Level 4 gives a one-point penalty to the target's THAC0, level 8 causes a one-point penalty to the target's saving throw vs. magic, level 12 lowers the target's strength by one, and level 16 gives a two-point bonus to missile damage. Archers cannot wear metal armor and can only put one proficiency point in melee weapons, but can put more than the ranger's normal maximum of two points in missile weaponry. Rangers can only reach level 17 in this game.<br><br>Stalker<br>Stalkers are very stealthy rangers. Their stealth ability is augmented by 20 percent, they receive the ability to backstab (though not as well as thieves), and gain the mage spells haste, protection from normal missiles, and minor spell deflection level 12. Stalkers cannot wear armor better than studded leather.<br><br>Beast Master<br>These animal aficionados receive a 15 percent stealth bonus as well as the ability to cast animal summoning 1 at level 8, 2 at level 10, and 3 at level 12. They cannot use metal weapons.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Paladin<br><br>These warriors of virtue fight for justice. They can specialize in weaponry to the second level like their brethren rangers, may heal themselves, turn the undead, protect from and detect evil, and gain a +2 bonus to all saving throws. Beginning with level 9, they can cast priest spells. Only lawful good humans may be paladins. All paladins must have high charisma ratings, though strength, constitution, and dexterity are also important. Paladins can only reach level 17.<br><br>Paladin Kits<br>Paladin<br>The standard paladin may use protection from evil, lay on hands, and detect evil.<br><br>Cavalier<br>Cavaliers specialize in destroying demons and dragons. They gain a +3 bonus to hit and damage vs. demonic or draconic enemies; have use of the remove fear spell once per day per level; are immune to fear, morale failure, and poison; and have a 20 percent resistance to fire and acid. They may only use melee weaponry.<br><br>Inquisitor<br>Inquisitors can cast true sight and dispel magic once per day for every four character levels and may not be held or charmed. Inquisitors do not have the ability to use lay on hands, turn undead, cure disease, or to cast priest spells.<br><br>Undead Hunter<br>A man of undead nightmares, the undead hunter has a +3 bonus to hit and damage vs. the undead, cannot be held or level drained, and cannot use the lay on hands ability either.<br><br>Priests<br><br>Priests are the fabric that holds a party together in battle. They generally handle all healing, blessing, and morale needs of the party, letting the rest of the group concentrate on destroying its opposition.<br><br>Cleric<br><br>People tend to think of a clerics as the weak healer of a party. While clerics are the best healers in the Forgotten Realms, a cleric is far from weak. At higher levels, the offensive spell repertoire of the cleric is almost as formidable as that of the mage. Further, clerics can wear plate mail and still cast spells - a huge plus. While they cannot use bladed or piercing weapons, this inadequacy is more than made up for in the form of the turn undead skill. Turn undead lets a cleric (or paladin) channel power from his chosen deity and terrify or destroy the undead. Evil clerics can sometimes gain control of these creatures, causing them to fight with the party rather than against it. Clerics need a very high wisdom rating to be most effective. All races can be clerics, and clerics can reach the level 21.<br><br>Cleric Kits<br><br>Cleric<br>The standard cleric has the turn undead ability, cannot use bladed or piercing weaponry, and may only use one proficiency point per weapon type.<br><br>Priest of Lathander<br>These priests can cast hold undead as well as us a special ability - boon of Lathander - once a day for every tenth level. This ability bestows a +1 bonus to hit, to damage, and to saving throws; an extra attack per round; and immunity to level drain to the caster for six seconds per character level.<br><br>Priest of Helm<br>Helm's priests gain true sight and the special ability seeking sword. Seeking sword creates a magical +4 sword (though the +4 is only used to determine whether the target can be hit - there is no +4 damage bonus), doing two to eight damage per hit and giving the cleric three attacks per round. Duration is one round per character level.<br><br>Priest of Talos<br>These priests gain the lightning bold ability (once a day for every fifth level) and the special ability stormshield, which protects the priest from lightning, fire, cold, and missiles for six seconds per caster level).<br><br>Druid<br><br>Through a tight connection to the world of nature, druids can shape-change into various animals, including the polar bear, winter wolf, and boring beetle, once each day. They also can cast priest spells like their clerical brethren. Note that only humans and half-elves can be druids, and they can only use leather armor and bucklers, clubs, darts, spears, daggers, slings, and staffs. Druids need high wisdom and constitution ratings. Druids can only advance to level 14.<br><br>Druid Kits<br><br>Druid<br>The standard druid is detailed in the previous section.<br><br>Shapeshifter<br>The shapeshifter can morph into a werewolf once per day every two character levels and to a greater werewolf once per day beginning at level 13. Shapeshifters cannot wear armor or shapeshift into the regular druid forms.<br><br>Totemic Druid<br>The totemic druid's lack of shapeshifting ability is offset by his ability to summon a spirit animal once per day per level.<br><br>Avenger<br>Avengers may shift into the form of a sword spider, baby wyvern, and salamander in addition to the normal druid forms. Also, they can cast the mage spells chromatic orb, web, lightning bolt, improved invisibility, chaos, and chain lightning. They may not wear armor greater than the regular leather variety, and they receive a two-point penalty to strength and constitution.<br><br>Rogues<br><br>Another requisite part of any good party is a rogue. You'll quickly find that the skills of a thief or bard (or both!) will come in quite handy in your travels.<br><br>Thief<br><br>Thieves are the cunning little backstabbers (literally) of FaerÃ»n. They have the special abilities stealth, backstab, pick pockets, pick locks, and find/remove/set traps. Thieves may obviously not be of lawful good alignment, nor can they wear non-leather armor or use regular shields. Their weapons include clubs, daggers, darts, crossbows, short bows, slings, short and long swords, and quarterstaffs. Thieves must have a high dexterity rating. Thieves can advance all the way to level 23.<br><br>Thief Kits<br><br>Thief<br>The standard thief has the backstabbing ability and 20 percentage points per level to use to advance thieving skills.<br><br>Assassin<br>Once per day for every fourth level, the assassin can coat his weapon with a poison that causes six points of damage every six seconds for 30 seconds (30 points total, though a successful saving throw limits the damage to six points total). At level 10, the poison acts twice as fast, and at level 15, it acts three times as fast and does more damage, possibly even slowing the target. The assassin only gains 15 percentage points per level to distribute amongst his thieving skills.<br><br>Bounty Hunter<br>Bounty hunters gain a 15 percent bonus to their trap-setting skills and can lay better traps. First-level traps slow the target, 11th-level traps hold the target; 16th-level traps (called Otiluke's resilient sphere) are cast around the target, and 21st-level traps create a maze around the target. Bounty hunters gain fewer points to distribute each level.<br><br>Swashbuckler<br>The fighting-man's thief, the swashbuckler gains a one-point bonus to his armor class as well as a one-point bonus to his armor class, to hit, and to damage every fifth level. He can also specialize further than normal in weaponry and gain three points to proficiency in the two-weapon style of fighting. He does not, however, receive a multiplier to backstabbing damage.<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Bard<br><br>You'll never find my party traveling without a bard in the lead (unless of course he's been killed and is on the back of one of my warriors, waiting to be resuscitated). The bard is the jack-of-all-trades of the land. With high charisma, bards are ideal conversationalists. They have very high lore ratings and can identify 80 to 90 percent of the items you'll encounter without the use of expensive third parties, scrolls, or spells. They can cast mage spells (at level 2 and higher), and they have the pick pockets and bard song skills. Bard song increases party luck and morale and becomes more powerful as the Bard gains levels. Bards need high dexterity, intelligence, and charisma ratings. The bard class is open to human and half-elf characters only. Bard can reach level 23.<br><br>Bard Kits<br>Bard<br>The standard bard is, well, pretty standard. He has everything detailed previously.<br><br>Blade<br>The blade is essentially a bard that can kick some serious butt. He has offensive spin and defensive stance abilities to help him get the butt-kicking done. Offensive spin endows the bard with +2 bonuses to hit and damage, along with an extra attack per round. Defensive stance awards a one-point armor class bonus for every level up to a maximum -10 bonus. The bard cannot move while using defensive stance. Both skills last 24 seconds. The downside to this kit is that the bard is only half as effective at picking pockets and identifying items as a regular bard. Also, the blade's battle song does not improve over its level 1 power.<br><br>Jester<br>The sole quality of the jester that deviates from the norm is that his battle song is hostile to the enemy party rather than helping your party directly. All nearby (30 feet) enemies must save versus magic at +4 each round, or they'll be confused.<br><br>Skald<br>A true warrior bard, the skald has a +1 bonus to hit and damage, and his song gives party members a +2 bonus to hit, damage, and armor class up to level 14. At level 15, the bonus increases to four points, and at level 20, the skald's friends also gain immunity to confusion, fear, and stun. His weakness is his relative ineptitude at picking pockets. This is my favorite bard class, as I never pick pockets, so it literally has no disadvantage in my eyes.<br><br>Mages<br><br>While these wizened adventurers are surely the weakest in the game at low levels, they become exponentially more powerful as they advance. A high-level mage can kill enemies with naught but a touch (finger of death) or cause a 40-foot wide cloud of acid to engulf his enemies (acid storm), for example. No party should go into battle without a powerful mage in back.<br><br>Wizard<br><br>The wizard is your standard, run-of-the-mill spellcaster. He can cast spells from any of the eight schools of magic, but cannot wear armor. Wizards can wield daggers, staffs, darts, and slings. All mages can obtain a familiar - a small character that will fight alongside the mage. The mage gains a bonus of half the hit points of the familiar. However, if the familiar dies, the mage loses those hit points as well as a point of constitution permanently. Mages need high intelligence ratings to be effective. Wizards can advance to level 17 in Baldur's Gate II.<br><br>Wizard Kits<br><br>Wizard<br>The standard wizard is detailed in the previous section.<br><br>Specialist mages<br>If a mage chooses to specialize in one school in particular, he becomes a specialist mage. Specialists are identical to regular mages with a few exceptions. They can cast an extra spell at each spell level, and they cannot cast spells in their opposing school. Multiclassed characters cannot become specialist mages (with the exception of the gnomish fighter/illusionist).<br><br>Sorcerer<br><br>The sorcerer is a sort of wizard, but rather than having to memorize spells, the sorcerer learns the spell once and remembers it forever. As such, he can cast more spells per day than a run-of-the-mill wizard, but his spell library is also severely limited. Once a spell is added to the sorcerer's repertoire, it's there forever. Be sure to choose your spells wisely (see this guide's spells section for advice), as you'll be kicking yourself if you waste a valuable slot on a spell you'll never use. All sorcerer spells are tied together by level. That is, while it may look as though you have six of each level 1 spell, you really have six level 1 spells altogether. (Casting a magic missile will also decrement your chromatic orb count by one, for example.) Also note that the sorcerer cannot use scrolls. Like wizards, only humans, elves, and half-elves can be sorcerers. Sorcerers can reach level 17.<br><br>Specialist Title<br>School<br>Opposing School<br><br>Abjurer<br>Abjuration<br>Alteration<br><br>Transmuter<br>Alteration<br>Abjuration and necromancy<br><br>Conjurer<br>Conjuration/summoning<br>Divination<br><br>Diviner<br>Divination<br>Conjuration/summoning<br><br>Enchanter<br>Enchantment/charm<br>Invocation<br><br>Illusionist<br>Illusion<br>Necromancy<br><br>Invoker<br>Invocation<br>Enchantment and conjuration<br><br>Necromancer<br>Necromancy<br>Illusion<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alignment<br><br>A character's alignment determines his or her ideological view of the world. There are nine alignments, each of which reflects a view of society and a view of the universe. Lawful characters believe in following the laws set forth by society, while chaotic characters choose to ignore the world's regulations. Good characters try to benefit the world through their actions, while evil characters care only for themselves. For example, a lawful good character will focus on ridding the world of evil, but will not step outside of the boundaries of the law to do so. Paladins must be of lawful good alignment, druids are true neutral, bards must be some form of neutral, monks must be lawful, and thieves cannot be of lawful good alignment for obvious reasons. Don't let characters from widely varying alignments make up your party, or they'll start to fight.<br><br>Abilities<br><br>Your character's abilities are what determine whether he is a meandering idiot who can bash a giant's skull in or a soft-spoken old man who could beat Big Blue in a game of chess. There are six abilities, and how high or low you are can roll in each one is determined by your race and class. Here are the required minimum values of each ability for each class:<br><br>Class<br>Strength<br>Dexterity<br>Constitution<br>Intelligence<br>Wisdom<br>Charisma<br><br>Barbarian<br>9<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br><br>Fighter<br>9<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br><br>Ranger<br>13<br>13<br>14<br>3<br>14<br>3<br><br>Paladin<br>12<br>3<br>9<br>3<br>13<br>17<br><br>Cleric<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>9<br>3<br><br>Druid<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>12<br>15<br><br>Mage<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>9<br>3<br>3<br><br>Thief<br>3<br>9<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>3<br><br>Bard<br>3<br>12<br>3<br>13<br>3<br>15<br><br>Sorcerer<br>3<br>3<br>3<br>9<br>3<br>9<br><br>Monk<br>3<br>9<br>9<br>3<br>9<br>3<br><br>It's a very good idea to get your characters as close as possible to 18 in all his class's important fields (the ones that require higher than 3) and pretty much ignore the rest. For example, a mage only needs an intelligence rating of 9, but if he has an 18, he'll be much more powerful. On the other hand, a mage with 18 wisdom isn't much different from a mage with 3 wisdom. Focus your attribute points where they're needed most.<br><br>Skills<br><br>Skills, also known as weapon proficiencies, are what determine which types of killing tools your character is adept with and which he has virtually no chance of success with. Fighters may gain proficiency in any area and can reach the fifth proficiency level (level 3 in missile attacks), at which point they are a fearsome sight to behold. Other characters may reach level 2, gaining a modest +1 bonus to attacks, while mages and clerics may only reach level 1. Using a weapon for which your character has no proficiency will result in a -1 penalty. Be sure to give mage characters some type of missile-weapon proficiency, as they'll die very quickly in melee combat!<br><br>Skill Points<br>To Hit Bonus<br>Damage Bonus<br>Base Attacks per Roll<br><br>0<br>-1<br>-1<br>1<br><br>1<br>0<br>0<br>1<br><br>2<br>+1<br>+2<br>1.5<br><br>3<br>+2<br>+2<br>1.5<br><br>4<br>+2<br>+2<br>1.5<br><br>5<br>+2<br>+3<br>1.5<br><br>Appearance, Biography, and Name<br><br>Half the fun of playing a role playing game is, well, feeling like you're playing a role other than that of yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>What Makes a Good Party?<br><br>Ask this question of ten experienced RPGers, and you'll get ten different answers. Your party will largely depend on what NPCs you come in contact with over the course of the game. But there are some guidelines that you'd be wise to follow to stay alive.<br><br>First off, balance is key. A party of six mages isn't going to live long enough to advance very far nor will a party of six thieves or even six fighters. It just doesn't work. If your six burly fighters come across a powerful wizard who successfully casts hold person on them, regardless of their amazing dexterity or superhuman strength, they'll just stand at attention as they're bombarded to death by spells or by the wizard's minions. A good rule of thumb is to bring two to three fighters and two to three magic users as well.<br><br>A cleric or druid is a good idea to have hiding in the back of your party, lending aid or healing spells whenever necessary. Also, a rogue is a great asset. Having a thief to scout ahead unseen, disarming traps all the way, is invaluable. Or, bring a bard along to regale the people you meet with his tales. Bards are (in my humble opinion) a bigger help than thieves. In addition to conversing well, they can save you countless gold pieces and spellcastings because they can identify 80 to 90 percent of the unidentified items you encounter. Their bard song skill is a good help, as is their ability to cast mage spells.<br><br>Continuing our theme of balance, you should have several different weapon proficiencies as you look through your party. Don't make everyone proficient at great swords and missile weapons. That flail of the ages +3 might be really cool, but it won't help you at all if no one in your party can use it without killing himself.<br><br>Be sure to include at least one member with infravision (that is, don't have a party of just humans); it comes in very handy. Make sure that everyone will get along; don't have a lawful good paladin with a chaotic evil necromancer, or they'll do more than just have words once you've been adventuring awhile.<br><br>The bottom line is that there are no hard rules to creating your party. Create the party that you want to play and go with it. You don't even need to cart a party of six characters around (and you can't until you're well into the game); if you want, you can take three or four and advance to higher levels than you otherwise would have, since you're dividing the experience gained amongst fewer people. It's up to you. Just remember not to focus all your attention to one area: Bring a diverse group with you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Two: General Tips and Strategies<br><br>This section will give you some basic help and reminders so your adventuring will be a little easier and just a bit less perilous. We will give you some tips that we have found that will keep you from slapping your forehead and yelling "Doh!" when you forgot to do something, or there was something you didn't know that you should have done. Some of these tips are very basic, but all will help you along your way.<br><br>Wear Helmets!<br><br>Helmets protect you from critical hits, which can be quite damaging. Make sure that everyone in your party that can wear a helmet does.<br><br>Do You Have a License for That?<br><br>When you get to Athkatla, save up 5,000 gold pieces and get the license to cast magic in the city. This is well worth the cost and makes your life much easier later on when you are openly attacked by baddies. Get 5,000 gold pieces and talk to the mage in the government main office.<br><br>Abracadabracalafragalisticexpialadocious...<br><br>It takes a relatively long period of time for spellcasters (both yours and those of your enemies) to get their spells off successfully. As such, protect your characters while they cast and smack down enemies as they try to cast. Make sure your fighters have a fast weapon they are proficient with, be it a dagger or short sword. This will let them switch weapons if they are fighting a mage that must have his spells disrupted quickly. Don't get scared if an enemy starts casting fireball at you; hit him with some arrows, and he'll forget what he was just doing.<br><br>Launch Your Missiles<br><br>Long-range attacks are a necessity, not only for disrupting magic users, but for getting damage in on opponents before they reach your party. Do as much from afar as you can. Why go toe-to-toe when you can shoot your enemies and laugh as they pull arrows from their torsos? It saves a lot of downtime and the heartache of having to heal. Make sure that everyone in your group has some sort of missile weapon equipped at all times. When you can afford it, buy enhanced missiles, such as arrows +2 or arrows of fire; you can do a lot of damage before your enemies even get within melee range.<br><br>Pets, Pets, Pets<br><br>Need I say more? If you can summon minions to kill the monsters while you watch and collect the experience and money, why not? Use those elementals and servants. Cast that monster summoning III spell. If the creature you are fighting is really tough and wades through your pets, use the pets to slow it down while your mages weaken it with spells and your archers knock it down with arrows. Use your minions to keep monsters tied up while you use your spells and bows to knock them down. Doorways and bridges are great for this and can often turn the tide of battle or make impossible battles rather easy.<br><br>Know What You're Doing<br><br>Make sure you know the strengths and weaknesses of your enemies before engaging them. Don't cast ice storm on a group of cold wights. Fireball is much more effective. Refer to the enemies section of this guide for tips on beating individual enemies.<br><br>Save Often<br><br>Saving often may seem like an obvious precaution to save time if you die, however, there is more to it than that. Saving your game just before attempting to memorize a spell will let you reload until you successfully get it memorized. Saving before resting lets you keep trying until you get a peaceful night's rest, without pesky monsters waking you up. Of course, this can take away from the realism of the game, but the option is there if you need it. There's also an option (in the game options menu) to automagically give your characters the maximum hit point gain upon leveling up rather than rolling a die to see how much they get.<br><br>The loading screen - you'll become good friends with this view over the course of the game.<br>Maximize Your Inventory<br><br>You must quest through some dark, dank, long stretches of dungeons in Baldur's Gate II, and in your travels, you'll acquire tons of little goodies, many of them quite valuable. It'll be a bit annoying to travel back to town whenever your inventory gets full, so be sure to use all your slots effectively. Put scrolls, potions, and the like in your quick item slots and put any missiles (arrows, bolts, bullets, and so on) in your missile slots, even if the character can't use them. They're there, so use them for extra storage. Most importantly, take advantage of the new bags; they make your effective inventory size much larger.<br><br>Ask Questions First, Kill Later<br><br>Attacking everyone you see may sound like a cool idea, but the game rewards peaceful resolutions more than it does bloody ones. In some cases, you can effectively halt yourself in the game by killing a vital character. Never attack until you're attacked.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Use the AI Scripts<br><br>Unless you enjoy watching all your party members like a hawk for the duration of every battle, go to the character info screens, click customize, and choose an appropriate AI script. This way, when you turn on the AI, they'll have a chance of acting as you want them to. Of course, it's always a good idea to keep an eye on them while engaged in battle, as the AI isn't nearly as intelligent as you are. On a related note...<br><br>Know When to Turn the AI Off<br><br>There are times when the AI should just be turned off (it's the little icon just above the Rest button and to the left of the Select Party button). For example, if your mages are about to cast fireball and cloudkill on your enemies, you don't want Joe and Jane Fighter running in to attack the baddies, or they'll get hit with your death magic as well. In general, turn the AI on if you think the battle is going well; turn it off if you need to monitor the action more closely.<br><br>Loot! Pillage! Steal!<br><br>Whenever you have the opportunity to get something for nothing, do so. You can loot the corpses of deceased enemies, pillage from containers in the majority of locations, and even steal from your friendly shopkeeper with a little skill and luck. You'll get some of the most powerful items in the game this way, so don't pass it up.<br><br>Watch Your Step<br><br>Never forget to detect traps. This little tidbit of information cannot be stressed enough, nor can it be forgotten by adventurers. There is nothing worse than killing one bad monster only to have a death trap smoke your main character, forcing you to reload. You have a thief? Use him! A thief (or a bard) is an integral part of every party, and he is forgotten way too often. And on another related note...<br><br>Use waypoints! If you're not careful when crossing large areas, your party tends to scatter, and individual members may run into a horde of monsters. You wouldn't want your mage to walk through a pack of baddies by himself, would you? Didn't think so.<br><br>Certain Spells Demand Use<br><br>Don't forget magic missile. This spell is a great asset when you must do some surefire damage and disrupt enemy mage spells. It's great when an enemy mage casts mirror image, and you watch as your magic missile takes him (and the rest of his party) out in one shot. Breach is a boon. If that mage is just too protected for your fighters to get to him, hit him with a couple of breach spells and watch him tremble. You hate it when your enemies are protected from magic weapons, but you love it when that protection is breached. When fighting demons, don't forget your protection from evil spell. This will be a party saver that will surprise you for a level 1 spell. Finally, don't forget the farsight spell. It seems stupid, but if you have minions, you can see the monsters before they see your party, letting you send in your pets to do the work from a distance. Without farsight, you can't see past the normal sight range of your party.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Three: Weapons<br><br>What would a fantasy role-playing game be without some good weapons to hack up them bad monsters with? Like most other fantasy games, there are lots of different types and styles of weapons and lots of different methods of using them. This section will list all the weapons from the dagger to the two-handed sword and give you some general weapon uses and monsters they work well against. This is by no means the rule, but we'll give you some general guidelines to follow, so you can play more effectively. Each weapon has a class of damage assigned to it, be it crushing, slashing, or piercing, along with a speed factor that is used to determine how fast the weapon swings in combat. Some weapons are for getting down and dirty toe-to-toe with a monster, some are for standing back and raining down terror from above. No one weapon type will work well in every situation, so you are best off with your members having the skill to use a few different weapons so you don't get caught off-guard.<br><br>Axe Class: Slashing<br><br>The axe is the one of the more damaging weapons in the game, but it gives way to a big speed hindrance. This is the weapon that legends are made of and that dwarves stand behind as their weapon of choice. For you role-players out there, if you take a dwarven warrior, you will be getting very familiar with this class of weapon.<br><br>Battle Axe<br><br>The granddaddy of the axe family, the battle axe is a heavy hitter, but the speed penalty makes it so you just don't do the heavy hit very fast. When you see a dwarf leaning on an axe or swinging it at a monster, this is the axe that they swing. The damage of the battle axe falls around the same as a long sword, but the speed is closer to a bastard sword. Like a juggernaught, it's slow to get there, but it packs a punch when it does.<br><br>Throwing Axe<br><br>The dwarven missile weapon of choice, this little axe is balanced for the sole purpose of chucking it at monsters to part their hairs. Not a very good missile weapon, this one only lets you throw one per round, and the damage is that of a bow and arrow which allows two per round. You do the math on this one, and you will see that there are far better things to spend your proficiency slots on unless you are a die-hard dwarf role player.<br><br>Bow Class: Piercing<br><br>Having trouble killing a monster toe-to-toe? Well, get the trusty bow or crossbow out and shoot him from a distance. The bow and arrow is a staple to any party, and all your members should be proficient in one kind of bow or another. There's nothing like knocking a monster to half its hit points before it can even swing or shooting a mage from halfway across the screen when he is trying to cook you with a fireball only to have the spell fizzle on him. When your fighters are going toe-to-toe, and your mages are prepping spells, there is nothing better than having a thief shooting the dickens out of the critters on the side, out of harms way. The great thing about the regular bow is that you get two shots per round, while the crossbow will give you some heavy damage. Bows: Don't leave home without them.<br><br>Club Class: Crushing<br><br>A club is a club is a club. Need I say more? Pick up a thick tree stump, and you have a club. Or, have some smith make you a metal one. The damage is not that great, but the club is great for those nasty skeletons or clay golems. This is a good one for the cleric classes to get for that magic cudgel they can create with spells.<br><br>Dagger Class: Piercing<br><br>Picture a double bladed knife, and you have a dagger. Daggers are great little weapons that do little damage with lots of speed. When you must stop mages from casting spells, or you want to stab someone in the back as a thief, the dagger will get the job done quickly. Use your fighters for spell disruption, your thieves for backstabbing, and your mages for a backup. Those pesky critters that get in too close for comfort should feel the edge of your dagger. Don't let the low damage scare you away; the dagger is a mainstay for any group.<br><br>Dart Class: Piercing<br><br>Your mage is out of spells... The monsters are getting close... Now what? Zing a few darts at them and hope for the best. This little weapon is not heavy at all on damage, but the rate of fire is great. You get to throw three per round, and they will definitely disrupt spellcasters and help out your front-line fighters. Get some magical darts and watch the hit points disappear.<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Mace, Flail, and Morning Star Class: Crushing<br><br>These are the slots your priests live and (hopefully not) die by. These weapons run pretty close to the hammer class weapons, but with a little less speed and a little more damage. When you must face skeletons or clay golems, these are the weapons that you want in your arsenal. You want to use them without clunking yourself on the noggin. Spend a point in this class, and you will not be disappointed.<br><br>Halberd Class: Slashing/Crushing<br><br>This is one unique weapon in that it will do both slashing and crushing damage to your opponents. The bad thing is that you cannot use a shield with it, and it is slow, but the damage is great. This is a good weapon for that front line fighter that just wants to hit hard and doesn't care if anything is hitting him or for the fighter that has a well-armored friend to take the monster's attention away from him. A party can do without this weapon, but it is a great asset if you use it correctly.<br><br>Hammer Class: Crushing<br><br>Hammers are just that: hammers. They are one of the mainstays for the priest class and are also great versus the undead that priests vow to fight. They have about average speed and average damage, but other than that, there is not a whole lot special about them.<br><br>Spear Class: Piercing<br><br>Spears are what the hunters frequently use, and they will do what you need them to do, though not with any great effects. They do fair damage at an average speed, and the druid class can use them. The bad thing about the spear is that it is two-handed, and you can't use a shield with it, making the damage to armor class trade-off not very good. If you find a really good spear, use it; if not, skip the spear class.<br><br>Staff Class: Crushing<br><br>The staff is the mage's key weapon of choice and is usually shunned by most other classes. The damage of the staff is average, and its speed is a little better than average. When you picture a staff, picture a wise old wizard leaning on it to support his frail body. This is about the good of the staff unless you run across a particularly magical one, in which case, it is one deadly weapon. This weapon also works great against skeletons and golems.<br><br>Sword Class: Slashing/Piercing<br><br>Swords are the weapons that will lead your hearty group to victory for the most part. They score good damage, they have decent speed, and they are very reliable. There are many different magical ones in the game, and the only bad thing about swords is knowing which ones to excel with. Never fear, we will walk you through the pros and cons of all the different swords, then leave you to pick the style you like best.<br><br>Bastard Sword (Slashing)<br><br>A bastard sword is a sword and a half. This sword class is not used very much because of the low damage-to-speed trade off. The only difference between this sword and the long sword is the extra point of damage at the low end and the three points of speed you lose. It's not much of a trade off, if you ask us. If you want a one-handed sword as a warrior, choose the long sword.<br><br>A pretty typical long sword +1.<br>Long Sword (Slashing)<br><br>This is one of the most common swords in the game along with the two-handed sword. It scores very good damage, on par with the battle-axe, and has average speed. This is a can't-go-wrong sword. The nice thing is that you can use a shield while you hack away with it, so while you are dishing it out, there is less chance you are getting it dished back at you. There are lots of magical long swords in the game, so make sure your fighters can pick one of these up and use it without cutting themselves in the process.<br><br>Short Sword (Piercing)<br><br>The short sword is very close to being an oversized dagger. The damage of this pig sticker is about average, and the speed is good. The short sword is one of the thief's preferred weapons because he can still backstab with it, and the damage is a little better than that of the dagger. This weapon is another great weapon for the fighters in your group to know and love because it will also do the job of disrupting any spellcasting with its speed.<br><br>Two-Handed Sword (Slashing)<br><br>The two-handed sword is a monster. It stands about six feet tall and is as heavy as can be. The damage of this sword is equal to that of the halberd, and the speed is actually slower, but there are some really nice magical ones in the game. So, have one of your fighters use this monstrosity. With this sword, as the name implies, you can't use a shield for your armor class, so make sure you have someone using a long sword and shield up front to draw the monsters attention for you. Then, you can use this to hack the monsters to pieces. Walk tall and carry a big sword.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Four: Spells<br><br>Arguably the most important aspect of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games is knowing how to effectively use your characters' spells. In this section, we'll dish out the details of every spell available in Baldur's Gate II. For each spell, we'll list its type, some strategies on when and how to use it, and a relative gauge of how important it is in the grand scheme of things. Following is a description of the various spell types.<br><br>Area damage<br>Spells that do area damage inflict damage upon enemies (and sometimes friends) in a certain area, usually a circular location.<br><br>Charm<br>Charm spells will cause your enemies to view you as a friend for a limited time.<br><br>Cure/heal<br>Curing and healing spells will essentially repair your party members.<br><br>Defense<br>Defensive spells make your characters more difficult to bring down.<br><br>Dispel<br>Spells of dispelling will negate the effects of other spells.<br><br>Hindrance<br>Hindering spells will not directly damage your enemies per se, but they will decrease your targets' effectiveness, for example, by slowing them down.<br><br>Imbuement<br>Spells of imbuement will bestow a temporary change of some sort upon your characters. For example, an imbuement spell could raise one of your fighters' strength rating.<br><br>Missile damage<br>These spells will shoot forward, damaging enemies from afar.<br><br>Summoning<br>Summoning spells will summon creatures to aid you in your battles.<br><br>Touch damage<br>These spells will damage anyone who makes physical contact with the caster.<br><br>Other<br>These spells resist easy categorization and don't quite fit in any of the previous categories.<br><br>As for a spell's importance, we've arranged them into five categories.<br><br>None<br>These spells are of no practical use. Memorize them only if you feel that you've got extra slots.<br><br>Low<br>Spells of low importance are better passed over for more useful spells, though they do have limited use if you choose to memorize them.<br><br>Moderate<br>Moderate spells are ones that depend on your style of play. Some people may find them irresistible, while others may despise them.<br><br>High<br>These spells should generally be memorized whenever possible. They'll come in handy often, and as such, you won't be wasting your spell slots on them.<br><br>Vital<br>Spells of vital importance should remain permanently in your memory. These are spells without which most magic users wouldn't dare leave home.<br><br>Wizard Spells<br><br>Wizard spells are cast by sorcerers, rangers, bards, and - you guessed it - wizards.<br><br>Level 1<br><br>Armor<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Setting the armor class only to six, this spell is a waste. As long as you have bracers of defense with an armor class of six or better, this spell will do nothing at all.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Blindness<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Ability: Giving the target an armor class penalty of four and giving a -4 chance to hit on their attack rolls, this spell actually serves you well and does its job. But it is nowhere near as good as a higher-level crippling spell. It is efficient enough when it isn't resisted and is generally only for use on lower-level monsters.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Burning Hands<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: This spell is actually deceptively powerful. Burning hands starts with a rather low amount of damage, but increases to pack quite a punch. The downfall of this spell is that you must strategically position your mage so that he won't hit your other party members. The fact that the caster must be quite close to its target, which is very bad for a mage, practically negates any benefit this spell could give. Usually, we stick to magic missile for sheer ease of use.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Charm Person<br><br>Type: Charm<br>Ability: Charm grants control of any one humanoid enemy to the player for five rounds. Toward the end of the original Baldur's Gate, most creatures resisted the charm series of spells. The same problem is present in Baldur's Gate II, so usually, you can't cast the spell successfully. Though it is never bad to charm a low-level creature to take hits during any battle, your journey in Baldur's Gate II will rarely take you to a human-like creature that is of a level low enough to be charmed. However, keeping one copy of the spell memorized is advised for the earlier portions of the game, for those times when you do run into a susceptible person.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Chill Touch<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Ability: The -2 armor-class penalty incurred by chill touch is nice, but it doesn't offset the problem of bringing your mage into the fray. The damage is negligible (one to eight), and the two-point armor-class penalty is small, so we recommend that you either never use this spell or use it with extreme caution. Though some fire-based creatures are weak to cold-based attacks, the small amount of damage is almost never worth the sacrifice of your mage's safety.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Chromatic Orb<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Missile damage deals moderate damage that increases with the level of the caster, but it also has a secondary effect that will, beginning from the base level in Baldur's Gate II and going up, range from a three-round stun to paralysis. The damage that the orb deals is decent, but in the original Baldur's Gate, the spell was mainly used for its secondary effect. However, in Baldur's Gate II, the spell is often resisted, and the special effect rarely comes into play. Still, it is advised to keep a copy memorized through the beginning of the game and try it out at times to see if it will get off. If it does, the stun or the paralysis effects are both extremely useful, as they immobilize the enemy and give you free hits.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Color Spray<br><br>Type: Damage and hindrance<br>Strategy: This spell deals one to six points of damage and renders the target unconscious. Though useful in the original, it rarely affects anyone now. The other problem with the spell is that the spray can hit your party members and cause a messy situation. Unless you find yourself surrounded by masses of low-level enemies, it is advised that you stay away from this spell.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Find Familiar<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Summons a small creature to fight by your side. The caster gains half the hit points of the familiar as a bonus. Though you can talk with your familiar, and you gain bonus hit points, you will lose a point of constitution permanently if it dies. Though that is a risk we would never take, it's a personal choice. The hit-point bonus is fair, and the creature can give help with puzzles and combat.<br>Importance: Personal (low)<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Friends<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Raising the caster's charisma by a small amount, this spell is actually useless. Most often, you will never know what options could have appeared in the game had your charisma been higher. Since it is nearly impossible to know, it is nearly impossible to cast this spell in advance to reap the rewards.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Grease<br><br>Type: Movement hindrance<br>Strategy: Since grease will affect your party as well as your enemies, it is usually advisable never to use it when your party is in the area. However, one efficient strategy is to cast the spell in the distance and pick off the creatures with range weapons. If this strategy is appealing, however, a spell like web or ensnaring roots is advised.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Identify<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: If you do not like spending the money to pay for identification or have not found the glasses of identification, one cheesy way to get all your items identified is to memorize this spell as many times as possible, rest, identify items, and repeat.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Infravision<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Turn on group infravision under the options section, and the use of this spell flies out the window faster than cool air on a steamy day.<br>Importance: None, unless you have a party composed solely of humans<br><br>Larloch's Minor Drain<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: The one to four hit-point gain of this spell will be less than the amount of hit points you'll lose for wasting your time casting it. Since the player loses any hit points gained over the maximum after one turn, any practical use would be difficult to find.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Shocking Grasp<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: Grasp yields only a low amount of damage and forces you to bring your mage to the front line. The result is usually not at all pretty. Try to avoid this spell.<br>Importance: None<br><br>The sorcerer Zaxxon casts the most important spell... ever.<br>Magic Missile<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: This is the bread-and-butter offensive spell for mages. With the amount of missiles increasing as you level up, and the damage staying high at 1d4+1, this spell should occupy most of your level 1 slots. Also, it casts almost instantly to disrupt other mages and do quick damage. There are simply no better all-purpose spells to take up the bulk of your slots.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Protection from Evil<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: This spell will become increasingly more and more useful. Not only is the spell a must for summoning minions, it will also protect you against many of the demons found in the later parts of the game. One particular battle comes to mind where there are hordes of demons, and casting this spell will let you turn the tide of battle from an impossible situation to an easy victory. However, if you happen to have a class like a paladin in your party, he will come with plenty of these as a special ability, so you shouldn't bother memorizing it.<br>Importance: High or low<br><br>Protection from Petrifaction<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: As the name implies, if there are petrifaction attacks, this will protect you from them. Though there are few times in Baldur's Gate II when enemies will petrify you, you could memorize this and rest once you've stumbled into a useful area. Otherwise, this has no use.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Reflected Image<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Creates a duplicate image that will disappear when attacked. It gives one free hit, but otherwise provides almost no help. Use mirror image instead.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Shield<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Setting the caster's armor class to four versus normal and two versus missile attacks, this is slightly helpful in the earlier parts of the game. Sometimes the best offense is a good defense. However, you'd be better off with a magic missile spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Sleep<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Sleep is useless. Though in concept, it does put the enemy to sleep, nearly every enemy in Baldur's Gate II resists it. Unless you need, for some reason, to take one gibberling out of combat, this spell will never help.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Spook<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: This is a cheap fear spell and, for the most part, a nice spell to keep your warriors from getting overwhelmed. When the monsters come in, cast this, and the monster must make a save versus fear with penalties or run off in another direction for three rounds. One of these in your memory banks can help. If you have a druid, however, cloak of fear does a much better job.<br>Importance: Moderate<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Level 2<br><br>Agannazar's Scorcher<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: This is a fire-based flamethrower spell that will do three to 18 points of damage to any enemy. The nice thing is that there is no save. But on the downside, the jet will stay for a round or two, and anything walking into it will be burned, party members included. This is a good spell to cast when monsters are lined up. Just cast it on the one furthest away, and all the monsters will take the damage. The spell does not gain potency upon leveling up, so it will lose its steam as the game progresses.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Blur<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Lowering the caster's armor class by three regardless, this is a very good armor spell. The armor-class bonus will greatly help your mage's resilience and will let him stand up to much more of a beating. If you think you will be in an area where your mage will come under attack, casting this spell will greatly lower the damage he takes.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Deafness<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Forcing a 50 percent chance to miscast spells on the recipients, this spell is actually not useful. Though spells that hinder enemy casters are always a help, it is a much better use of your time to use silence, as the recipients lose all ability to cast spells. In the end, silence does a lot more a lot faster.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Detect Invisibility<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: If your party ever comes under attack from any type of invisible creature, casting this spell will force it back into visibility. However, on your journey, you will rarely face invisible creatures, and when you do, they will become barely visible when they attack you. Unless they have used greater invisibility, you can attack them (with penalties). Also, you can easily cast dispel to get rid of the invisibility if needed.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Ghoul Touch<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: Though the effect of paralysis is not shabby, to reap its rewards, you must not only move your mage into combat, you must hit the target creature with a melee weapon. Mages usually have a difficult time hitting, plus the target gets a saving throw versus the spell, so the spell is nearly useless alone. If you prepare your mage with good defensive spells like blur and mirror image, though, the effects of entering combat are not as bad. The paralysis effect is stellar when it isn't resisted, so it can be worth your effort to give it a try from time to time. When it works, it works well.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Glitterdust<br><br>Type: Hindrance, other<br>Strategy: Though the side effect of revealing invisible creatures is nice, most of the time, the main blinding ability of the spell is resisted. Though this does reveal invisible creatures and should automatically take a place above detect invisibility, it is still nearly useless. Just use dispel for the invisibility and a more potent spell for everything else.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Horror<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: This is a nice spell if you are getting overwhelmed by low-level enemies and need time to deal with a few of the enemies at a time. Horror instills fear in it targets and will give you time to hit them when they can't hit back. Remember, though, that when the spell wears off, the feared creatures will be back in action. The monsters get a save, so do not expect them all to be affected. However, there are higher-level fear spells that can take effect on high-level creatures, get resisted less, and do more. For the level, though, the spell works acceptably on those lower-level creatures.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Invisibility<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: The invisibility line of spells is one of the best set of utility spells in the game. When any of your party members are getting low on health, cast invisibility to take him out of harm's way. If your mage is not needed at that moment, cast invisibility on him, so he won't take unneeded hits. Lastly, if you must scout out an area for enemy strength and numbers, this will answer your problems.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Knock<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: If you ever find yourself without a good thief, or if you find a lock your thief can't pick (assuming it is available and not barred or magically warded - the game will tell you if it is), this spell will open it. If you do have a thief that is proficient at lock picking, this spell will not help.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Know Alignment<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: If you ever find yourself in a situation where you are not sure whether to trust or distrust what you are dealing with, casting this spell will help you. However, it is usually more beneficial to follow through and trust, even if you know it's a trap, as the result can lead to hefty treasure, experience, and even new party members.<br>Importance: Low<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Luck<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: With a duration of only three rounds and an effect of only increasing the character's actions like saving throws and to hit chances by 1, this spell is pretty much a waste of time. If you ever find you can't perform an action, it could prove useful to use this spell to compensate. However, we have never found a time when the spell could help. Spells like Melf's acid arrow and mirror image will be a much better use of your spell slots.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Melf's Acid Arrow<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Aside from the spiffy name, the spell has some nice effects. First, on impact, 2d4 points of damage are inflicted. From there, the acid deals 2d4 points of damage per round, with the number of rounds increasing with the levels of the caster. In other words, the damage is good, and the acid will stay dealing more damage over time. Though at later levels, the spell is resisted, it is very good in the early portions of the game and especially useful for taking out trolls and disrupting other mages.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Mirror image should be the first spell any mage casts in most battles.<br>Mirror Image<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: This spell creates multiple mirrored images of the caster, with each image absorbing a hit. In combat, this allows the mage some leeway to maneuver and helps him greatly. Who can refuse hits that deal no damage? Also, the number of images increases with each level, so the long-term value is high.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Power Word: Sleep<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: The spell will affect only enemies with less than 20 hit points. Suffice it to say, you will never need to sleep anything with less than 20 hit points - you will find almost no enemies at that low a level.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Ray of Enfeeblement<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Lowering the strength of the enemy to five, this spell works wonders when it isn't resisted. However, other than a few situations, most difficult enemies will have saving throws high enough to resist it. But, for the few times that they don't, keep a copy memorized. If you find yourself in an impossible battle, try casting this spell to see if it gets off. If it does, it will make your day.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Resist Fear<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Since this spell does not counteract magically invoked fear, it is practically useless. Since fear no longer occurs as a result of a tough battle as often as in Baldur's Gate, you will rarely have a use for this.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Stinking Cloud<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Though this spell will affect friends and foe alike, this, like many others, works well when cast at a distance from your party. Once the enemies are unconscious, a barrage of missiles will take them out one by one. Though resisted by higher-level enemies, this works well into the game.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Strength<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Raising your character's strength to 18/50, this will let the character hit slightly harder. Overall, the effects are negligible and barely help since most fighters (of all types) are already at, near, or higher than 18/50.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Vocalize<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Curing silence is easily done with dispel magic. Use that instead and save a spell slot. Since your mage cannot actually cast when silenced, he cannot even cure himself anyway.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Web<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: This is another great spell to keep the masses off you while you fight a few enemies at a time. Web will create a large area of effect that will stop enemies from moving unless they make a save at -2. The -2 save means that almost every creature will have a difficult time resisting this. This is a spell to have in your memory banks as you go into almost any battle. But beware: You can get your own party stuck, too. So, this is another one of those spells best cast at a distance unless you're willing to risk your own party.<br>Importance: High<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Level 3<br><br>Clairvoyance<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: This spell will illuminate an area into view. It is quite a time-saver for scouting locations and, even though the fog of war is left on, you can glimpse bits of puzzles. Though it is useful at times, memorize it only when it's needed. For a look at enemies, try the farsight spell instead.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Detect Illusion<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Though this spell dispels any level 3 or lower illusion, most illusions level 3 or lower pose little threat. This is an almost entirely useless spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Dire Charm<br><br>Type: Charm<br>Strategy: See the charm person spell. This works in almost the same way, just with a better chance of not getting resisted. That makes this usable, but not a must-have spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Dispel Magic<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Most spell-induced ailments and magic effects can be cured with a cast of dispel magic. Since the level of the caster in relation to the level of the spell being cured is important, have your higher-level characters use this. Though this spell is very important to have around, paladins get some casts of this as a special ability. If you have one in your party, this can relieve some of the stress off the spellcaster.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Fireball<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Affecting a huge area with all creatures - friend and foe - in the area taking damage, this is a great spell to start a battle with. Before you move your party in, send a fireball flying forward to do some early damage without your party being hit. The damage dealt is fairly high and increases with each level. This spell will stay with you for some time.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Be careful not to cast area effect spells like fireball too close to your party<br>Flame Arrow<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Much like Melf's acid arrow, this sends a flaming arrow at an opponent. Dealing 1d6 damage and 4d6 damage on top of that in fire damage, this spell packs a nice punch. With more arrows gained with higher levels, this spell will continue doing moderate damage for quite some time.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Ghost Armor<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: With the effect of lowering the target's armor class to two, the spell can perform well. However, the effect is simply not good enough to warrant using it over spells like mirror image, haste, and fireball. If you feel you need more armor, give this a look. Otherwise, pass over it for any of the aforementioned spells.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Haste<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Of all the spells, this is simply one of the best. Doubling the movement rate and adding an attack round to everyone in the area, this spell will make the battle go nearly twice as fast. Killing enemies faster makes them hit you less. So, like many other spells, the imbued offense here is the best defense. Cast this before any difficult battle, then go in, hacking away. The single downside is that when the effects wear off, your party will be tired and drowsy. To compensate, simply cast it again during the next battle.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Hold Person<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: This spell freezes one humanoid-type creature in place, letting you do anything to it without consequence. Early in the game, when the spell is not resisted, it can work wonders against humanoid enemies. Later in the game, its use tapers off.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Hold Undead<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: See hold person. Hold undead has the same effect, but since undead are easily warded with the clerical ability ward undead, it is usually easier not to bother with holding them. Also, undead are usually found in hordes, so the effect of this spell is negligible.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Invisibility 10-foot radius<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: See invisibility. This spell has the same effect, but since this covers a greater area, it can affect more people. Whether this is beneficial or detrimental is dependent on what you are using invisibility for. If you are trying to shield a mage from being hit, for example, the lower-level invisibility spell works better.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Lightning Bolt<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Dealing a maximum of 10d6 damage, this spell packs a huge punch. Since the spell streams around the level, bouncing off walls, keep in mind that it cannot only hit multiple enemies, but also party members. If positioned properly, so that it never bounces back, it can be used very efficiently to hit many enemies for lots of damage. Putting this in a spell trigger works well, too.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Melf's Minute Meteors<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Creating many small missiles that deal +3 damage with +3 fire damage that a wizard can throw at a very fast pace that increases with each level, these are nice to have against enemies like trolls. Since trolls take fire or acid to kill, sending one in to finish a troll is not only easy, but leaves you many more meteors for many more trolls. Otherwise, the spell is still good, providing a nice missile weapon.<br>Importance: High<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Minor Spell Deflection<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Protecting the caster from various spells cast directly at him, this spell works well enough. However, we advise you to wait until better deflection spells like the real deflection or minor globe of invulnerability. Though this spell won't absorb much, it can serve as a backup deflector to the other spells mentioned.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Monster Summoning 1<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Summoning monsters to fight for the caster, this spell summons fairly low hit point creatures. Though some of the later summon spells are great to cast for creatures that absorb damage, these won't do much of anything and are just a waste of time.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Non-Detection<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: If you ever run into a time when a creature could detect you as something you are not, this spell could be important. For example, if you have an invisible character, casting this would not let them be detected. However, we found that invisible creatures are rarely detected anyway.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Protection From Cold<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: If you find yourself under cold attacks from spells, traps, or anything else, casting this will absorb 50 percent of all cold damage done through spells and all damage done by normal attacks to the target creature. This happens very infrequently in Baldur's Gate II.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Protection From Fire<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: See protection from cold. This spell is the same, but works on fire-based damage.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Protection From Normal Missiles<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: See protection from cold. It's the same and works for normal missiles like arrows or throwing axes. It does not include lightning, magic missiles, or the like. Since this does infer protection from a normal ranged attack, this is quite valuable under certain circumstances (against a cadre of archers, for example). Since the spell only effects one creature, though, you can only use it for your most valuable characters and only when a ranged attack is very harsh. Otherwise, it is faster to use other spells to end the damage.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Remove Magic<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Affecting only opponents, remove magic will strip them of many armor and speed spells. This works well when both you and your enemy have beneficial spells cast, and you only want to strip theirs. Though you can usually simply cast dispel magic out of range of your party but in range of you enemies, there is little use for this spell. However, if needed, it will work without touching your party.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Skull Trap<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Dealing one to six hit points of damage per level of the caster, this spell can do a lot of damage. However, since you must cast the spell and wait for it to be triggered by the enemy, it is often necessary to cast an area of affect damage spell that will trigger all the enemies. Once they are aggravated, they can trip the trap. However, this takes considerable planning and can fail, resulting in a messy situation in which you must trip the trap to get by. We advise that you simply stick with a more conventional, potent spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Slow<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: The exact opposite of haste, slow decreases the speed of enemies. Casting slow will let you take less hits and have more time to work with the mass of enemies. This is a very efficient spell that is worth casting until it's resisted in the later parts of the game. Until then, it is a must.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Spell Thrust<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: When in a mage battle, casting spell thrust will destroy any level 5 or lower enchantments. If you're in a tough fight against a defended mage, this will work wonders until you reach mages who use primarily enhancements of level 6 or higher. Keep a copy memorized in case a mage shows up.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Vampiric Touch<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: Draining one to six hit points for every two levels of the caster, this can pack a nice punch, with the maximum six to 36 points drained. This can definitely serve as a backup heal for the mage. Just keep in mind that if you need the healing badly enough to use this, it will require stepping into the heat to reap the effects - generally not a good idea. Make sure your mage is protected and use extreme caution. As your hit points are bound to be low when using this spell, a misstep will lead your mage to his death. Be careful with this spell or avoid it entirely!<br>Importance: Low<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Level 4<br><br>Confusion<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Forcing affected creatures to wander mindlessly around, this spell works in much the same way as the fear line of spells. If you cast this on a group of creatures who are attacking you, some will be affected and wander about aimlessly, giving you more time to deal with the rest. It works well against dumb creatures with low wisdom.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Contagion<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Lowering the strength, dexterity, and charisma of the creature it affects by two, this spell does very little. The loss in status will have little impact on the overall ability of the creature. Also, the spell is most often resisted.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Emotion: Hopelessness<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: When the spell isn't resisted, your enemies will all lie down where they stand. However, it is usually resisted and not nearly as potent as other hindering spells like web or stinking cloud.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Enchanted Weapon<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: If you ever find yourself with an absolutely horrible weapon, this spell could help out. Creating a +3 weapon (mace, axe, long sword, or short sword chosen by the caster), the spell lasts for up to one day. We've never found a particular need for this spell though, as you can usually find better weapons with better abilities.<br>Importance: Low to moderate<br><br>Farsight<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: A spell that often comes in handy, farsight reveals a portion of the map and clears the fog of war. This will let you easily scope out an area, then memorize and cast needed spells before barging in. It's very useful for the more difficult areas of the game.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Fireshield (Blue)<br><br>Type: Touch damage, defense<br>Strategy: Fireshield creates a flaming circle around the caster that bestows a 50 percent resistance to fire. However, it also deals damage to those who attack the caster. When used in conjunction with good defensive spells, you can turn your mage into a walking damage spell. Let him get attacked and watch your enemies suffer.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Fireshield (Red)<br><br>Type: Touch damage, defense<br>Strategy: This spell is the same as fireshield (blue), just with cold damage instead of fire. If you already have fireshield (blue), one is enough.<br>Importance: High or low<br><br>Greater Malison<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Greater malison has the amazing effect of lowering the saving throws of all those affected. This spell is one of the most strategic spells in the game, and with a cast of this, all the spells that are normally resisted have a better chance of getting off. Casting greater malison during any battle where enemies have high resitances will work wonders. Throngs of spells that were always resisted before now have a chance of succeeding.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Ice Storm<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Dealing only 2d8 damage and over an obscenely large area, this spell causes more harm than it's worth. With a 40-foot range, ice storm simply covers too large of an area to work well. Otherwise, it works in the same way as fireball, just with a larger area and damage that does not increase.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Improved Invisibility<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Much like normal invisibility, this spell shrouds the target from sight. The difference is that with this spell, you can attack while invisible. While the ability sounds breathtaking, you do become slightly visible when you attack. So, enemies can attack you, but have a much more difficult time with their attack rolls. The end result is that the invisible creature will be hit for less damage. For the purpose of attacking and gaining the attack roll bonus, this spell works well. However, for most other situations, invisibility works fine.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Minor Globe of Invulnerability<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Simply blocking all level 3 spells or lower, minor globe of invulnerability serves almost no purpose. Most damaging spells other than magic missile are easily higher than level 3. So, our advice is to wait for the normal globe of invulnerability, which works much better. If you absolutely must use this spell, cast it before major battles, and it be a little help.<br>Importance: Low<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Minor Sequencer<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Letting the user store two level 2 or lower spells for simultaneous casting, this spell works perfectly as a battle opener. Before the your enemies gets their defenses up, cast the sequencer (from the Special Abilities section) and hit them hard. Or, use this to cast defensive spells immediately when a battle starts. Which spells you use is totally up to you. Lastly, the sequencer will stay with you forever, so you can store the spells, rest, and have your original compliment of spells plus the sequences. You can only have one sequencer at a time, though.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Summoning monsters to your side can aid you in winning the tougher battles of Baldur's Gate II.<br>Monster Summoning II<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell is the same as monster summoning I, but provides a more powerful creature. Still, this doesn't summon a creature worth your time, so wait for monster summoning III.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Otiluke's Resilient Sphere<br><br>Type: Defense, hindrance<br>Strategy: This spell has many many uses. Creating a sphere around the target that lets no damage pass through, this spell can be used offensively and defensively. Assuming the spell is not resisted, it can be cast on one creature out of a mob to let you deal with the others first. This spell can be cast on enemy spellcasters to prevent them from casting on you. Also, this spell can be used to shield an ailing party member. The possibilities are endless.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Polymorph Other<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Casting this spell permanently morphs the target from itself into a harmless creature. Though helpful toward the early portions of the game for eliminating difficult enemies, the spell is totally resisted soon thereafter.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Polymorph Self<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Letting the caster turn into any number of useful creatures, this spell works much better than its counterpart, polymorph other. Conferring all natural protections and abilities of the form, this spell will let the caster deal considerably more damage as well as access some great special abilities. Don't worry, the spell is not permanent. The special abilities of the forms are as follows:<br><br>Gnoll - Uses magical +3 halberd with +1 fire damage; it's great for gnoll hunting.<br><br>Mustard jelly - Gives a chance to slow an enemy with every hit (when it fails the save)<br><br>Ogre - Gives a powerful fist attack<br><br>Spider - Gives a poison damage with every hit<br><br>Brown bear, black bear, wolf - None<br><br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Remove Curse<br><br>Type: Cure, heal<br>Strategy: If you ever equip a cursed item, this spell will cure you of its effects and let you get rid of it. Churches will also perform this for a small amount of gold.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Secret Word<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Randomly dispelling one level 8 spell protection or lower, this spell works well enough for early mage battles. However, the randomness and the fact that it only removes one spell will send you looking for a better, higher-level alternative like ruby ray of reversal or breach.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Spider Spawn<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Becoming better with higher levels, this summoning spell will spawn a spider or two. The spell starts out summoning a lackluster, normal giant spider, but gets very good at level 12, when sword spiders are summoned. Overall, this is a good summon spell that gets better as time goes on.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Spirit Armor<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Working exceptionally well, spirit armor lowers your armor class to 1 regardless of its current level. Working considerably better than all other armor spells, this is the one to use. The use is the same as all the other armor spells.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Stoneskin<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Completely protecting the wizard from a number of attacks, this spell is extraordinarily powerful. With more skins (number of resisted attacks) gained with each level, this spell's importance is obvious. If your party is jumped - and it will be - having your mages prepared is important. So, this spell should be on at all times while adventuring. With a duration of 12 hours, this spell can easily last between rests.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Teleport Field<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Randomly sending all enemies in the area a short distance away, this spell works incredibly well to confuse enemies, giving your party time for combat. Though not essential, it is a good spell to have around in case you get a surprise attack or find yourself overwhelmed.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Wizard Eye<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Creating a moveable eye that will illuminate the map wherever you direct it and acting much like an expendable party member, this spell works very well for scouting out locations. However, since it cannot travel through walls or doors, it is not as useful at farsight, though it's used in much the same way.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Level 5<br><br>Animate Dead<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Letting more and more undead be summoned with each level, this spell becomes quite powerful, especially when used with hindrance spells. Since skeletons are immune to most spells like confusion and stinking cloud, it is a good idea to cast any of those hindrance spells and move in with the skeletons, while picking off any remaining enemies with long-range weaponry. Skeletons are particularly good against mind flayers, since they are not affected by this spell.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Breach<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Taking care of all specific and combat protection spells, breach is quite useful. Destroying spells like mantle, stoneskin, and absolute immunity, this spell will be of particular help in any battle against a powerful mage. Cast it on a protected mage and watch as his protection defenses disappear.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Chaos<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: The effects of this spell are exactly the same as confusion. The only difference is that enemies of level 5 or higher, which is nearly all Baldur's Gate II enemies, will get a save versus the spell at -4 instead of the spell resistance being wisdom-based. The end result is that this spell will work better against higher-level enemies. However, it still will be resisted most of the time. Of the two, this one is definitely the one to use if you must.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Cloudkill<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Dealing a small amount of damage each round to every creature in the spell's 20-foot radius, this spell can end up doing wonders when used strategically. For example, cast web away from the party as described previously in this guide. Then, cast cloudkill and watch as the helpless enemies take damage while they are held in place. Cloudkill will work just as well with any movement-hindering spell.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Cone of Cold<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Dealing more damage as you level up, this spell becomes a true powerhouse. Since the direction of the cone is targetable, this spell is inherently easier to use than all the other circular radius area damage spells. In fact, this lets you target a group of enemies easily, from a distance, and without fearing for your group. It's definitely worth casting whenever you find yourself up against a group of enemies, and that will be a very frequent occurrence.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Conjure Lesser Air Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell works just like any other summon creature spell, with strategies much the same. The only difference is that elementals can actually turn on their master and attack. So, to avoid that unfortunate occurrence, cast a protection from evil spell on yourself. In this case, the elemental has rather low hit points, so it cannot absorb much damage. Also, it barely helps in a fight, and the casting time makes the actual casting impractical.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Conjure Lesser Earth Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: See conjure lesser air elemental. It's the same, but this time, you summon an earth elemental instead of an air elemental.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: See conjure lesser air elemental. It's the same, but this time, you summon a fire elemental instead of an air elemental.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Domination<br><br>Type: Charm<br>Strategy: This spell lets the caster gain control of any creature that fails the saving throw. Otherwise, the spell acts strategically much like any other charm spell, such as charm person. In this case, though, the difference is that any creature can be charmed. Also, this spell is resisted much less and works incredibly well against most creatures.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Feeblemind<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Preventing the casting of spells, feeblemind works well when it is not resisted. Since the effect is permanent, if it gets off, you need not worry about magical retaliation from the victim mage. Like any spell often resisted, it is much easier to use when combined with a lower resistance spell.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Hold Monster<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: This spell works in the same way as hold person, just for all monsters. This spell is quite helpful, as it will let you attack the creature without retaliation. Though often resisted, the spell if most definitely useful. Again, use a lower resistance spell or greater malison beforehand for a better success.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Lower Resistance<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Lowering the target's resistance to magic, this spell is wonderful. The effect is cumulative, so the target's magic resistance can be taken down from anything to zero with enough castings. With no saving throws allowed, this spell will always work and is sure to benefit the chance of every spell being successful afterward. It's a definite must for mage battles. You will run into creatures that will be nearly impossible to cast spells upon. This will save your day.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Minor Spell Turning<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Sending every level 4 spell or lower back to the caster, this spell is a godsend in battles with creatures that cast pesky hold and confuse spells (like umber hulks). Working well in mage battles as well, this spell is useful for any low-level magical encounter.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Monster Summoning III<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Like monster summoning I and II, this spell summons monsters to fight by your side. However, in this case, the monsters have very good amounts of hit points and do real damage. A must for tough battles, these monsters will take the hits, deal the damage, and save your party.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Oracle<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Dispelling all level 5 and lower illusions in the area, this spell has never done much. We've never encountered a time when this spell should be cast. There are only few times, anyway, when you will run into illusions that must be dispelled.<br>Importance: Low<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Phantom Blade<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Summoning a +3 magical sword (that your mage can use) that also does +10 extra damage versus the undead, this spell is good if you plan on sending your mage into combat. Summon the blade and defend your mage with armor spells, and he will turn into a virtual fighter. However, keeping your mages back is usually the better strategy, as it is usually better to take advantage of their ultra-useful spells. That is what they're there for now, isn't it?<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Protection from Acid<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Working like all other protection spells, protection from acid confers immunity to all acid damage. It's useful if you are up against a mage who likes Melf's acid arrow, but it's usually of no help.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Protection from Electricity<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Working like all other protection spells, protection from electricity confers immunity to all electric damage. It's useful if you are up against a mage who likes lightning bolt, or if you find yourself in an area with lightning traps. Usually, it's of no help at all.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Shadow Door<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: This spell is useful if your mage is hurt. With this spell, the caster will be whisked away out of view for the duration of the spell. It works much like invisibility, but with a key difference: The only means of dispelling this spell is to use a true sight spell. However, invisibility works just as well as a getaway spell and is available at a much lower level.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Spell Immunity<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Rendering the caster immune to all spells of a specific school, spell immunity works wonders once you know what your enemies are casting. Usually, a choice of evocation works best (though the circumstances vary highly) and will shield you from most damage spells. It is definitely advised that, once you know what the enemy is casting, you should look the spell up in game or in the manual and see what school it is. From there, you can make an educated choice about what school to use for spell immunity.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Spell Shield<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Creating a shield that prevents one dispel-type spell from reaching the caster, this spell can be as much a hindrance as a help. If any other type of detrimental spell is cast on you, it will be impossible to dispel that before dispelling this anyway. So, unless your mage is extraordinarily well-protected, it is advised to keep away from this spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Sunfire<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: Sunfire works exactly the same as fireball, with the exception of one important fact. Sunfire will not harm the caster. However, since sunfire still harms the party, it is difficult to use if your mage is not alone. But when your mage is alone, it is very easy to obliterate a group of enemies that are surrounding him. In essence turning your mage into a grenade, this spell opens up totally new scenarios for fighting packs of enemies. After some trial and error, sunfire works wonders.<br>Importance: High<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Level 6<br><br>Carrion Summons<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Working like any other summoning spell, this spell adds nothing new to the crowded summoning circle of magic. Summoning carrion, which are not powerful or have many hit points, this spell is, in fact, worse than most other available summoning spells.<br>Importance: None<br><br>Chain Lightning<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Chain lightning is simply extraordinary. Arcing from enemy to enemy, dealing damage that gets higher as you level up, there isn't much not to like here. As an added bonus, even if the targets make their saving throws, they are still hit for good damage. Usable whenever a group of two or more enemies is present, chain lightning is a must for the later portions of the game. Simply cast it on one enemy and watch as the rest get hit in order.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Conjure Air Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell is the same as the lesser version, just with a normal elemental summoned. These are increased in every way: more health, more damage, and, most importantly, more helpful. The same casting length problem is still an issue, and the greater forms of elemental summoning are still vastly superior.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Conjure Earth Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell is the same as the lesser version, just with a normal elemental summoned. These are increased in every way: more health, more damage, and, most importantly, more helpful. The same casting length problem is still an issue, and the greater forms of elemental summoning are still vastly superior.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Conjure Fire Elemental<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell is the same as the lesser version, just with a normal elemental summoned. These are increased in every way: more health, more damage, and, most importantly, more helpful. The same casting length problem is still an issue, and the greater forms of elemental summoning are still vastly superior.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Contingency<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Acting like a time-released capsule, this spell will cast one spell preselected by you once a chosen condition is met. For example, you can have a defensive spell cast on yourself once your hit points reach a certain level. Or, you can have an offensive spell cast when an enemy comes into range. Most of all, though, contingency can serve as a time saver and a nuance remover that will take away the pain of having to cast a defensive spell every time a battle starts. There are simply millions of different ways to use this spell. The use is entirely up to the caster and, hence, so is its value.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Death Fog<br><br>Type: Hindrance, area damage<br>Strategy: Working the same way as stinking cloud, death fog creates a solid fog that deals eight points of damage each round to all creatures in the fog. The eight points of damage per round is definitely nice, but killing all summoned creatures gives it a nice niche all to itself. Since you won't be running into truly summoned, not gated, creatures too often in the later portions of the game, its use does wear off. A side effect is that it kills all summoned creatures. Otherwise, it works exactly the same as the aforementioned stinking cloud.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Death Spell<br><br>Type: Area Damage<br>Strategy: Working marvelously against a group of moderately difficult enemies, death spell will instantly kill all enemies that fail their saving throw and have less than eight hit dice of hit points. Usually, whenever any group attacked our party, this was our lead spell. When it doesn't fail, it easily kills half the enemies.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Disintegrate<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Though instantly killing the target if it fails its saving throw, disintegrate has one key flaw. Some or all the target's weapons are destroyed. Though the spell can work against some of the most difficult monsters, assuming their throws fail, the point of using it in a tough battle is negated, as the loss of such great loot is simply unacceptable.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Flesh To Stone<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Working almost exactly like disintegrate, this spell will turn the target into stone. Once the target is turned to stone, one hit will destroy it. However, like disintegrate, all the target's possessions will be turned to stone as well. That is simply unacceptable.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Globe of Invulnerability<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: This spell is exactly like minor globe of invulnerability, except this one prevents levels 1 to 4 from penetrating. The same strategies apply as well.<br>Importance: Low<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Improved Haste<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: This spell has the same effect as haste, but instead of adding an attack, it simply doubles the overall number of attacks. In other words, this spell is hugely more effective, save for one drawback. This spell only affects one creature. Unfortunately, that makes it impractical.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Invisible Stalker<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Strategically, this spell works like all other summon spells. The invisible stalker, however, has a great deal more hit points, packs a good punch, and lasts for nine hours. It's definitely one of the best summoning spells around.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Mislead<br><br>Type: Defense, imbuement<br>Strategy: Creating a duplicate of the caster, then casting invisibility on the mage, mislead works as a perfect mimic. The real caster can still cast spells, but will be invisible. When the duplicate is destroyed, the caster will become visible again. Working both as a defensive and getaway spell, mislead can work wonders when the mage is low on hit points; keeping a copy memorized is advised.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Pierce Magic<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Working much like secret word, pierce magic will cancel one level 6 spell or lower. The level hit from secret word (which dispels one level 8 spell or lower) is compensated with a 1 percent per level magic resistance decrease. However, the 1 percent per level decrease is not enough to outweigh the randomness and the level hit. Secret word already wasn't very good. It didn't need to get worse.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Power Word: Silence<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Silencing the target with no chance of a save, this spell is exceptional. For three rounds, the enemy will be silenced (meaning he cannot cast spells). When you find yourself in a difficult mage battle, cast this repeatedly on the enemy, and you are nearly guaranteed to win. The spell should be used often.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Protection from Magical Energy<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Protecting the target from 50 percent (randomly) of all spells cast on him, this spell will save you a lot of trouble against any mage. This spell is required casting in any mage battle, as the 50 percent spell resistance will save you tremendous amounts of pain. It's definitely one of the most important spells when standing up to a mage, and that will happen often.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Protection from Magical Weapons<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Granting immunity to all magical weapons, this spell will make you invulnerable to most high-level enemies who only wield magical weapons. However, the duration of only four rounds makes this spell completely impractical. Also, the fact that it can only be cast on the caster himself adds insult to injury. This spell may look good, but it is a waste.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Spell Deflection<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Absorbing ten spell levels worth of spells, spell deflection is an extraordinary spell. Another great spell for mage battles, the only downfall is that it can only be cast on the caster.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Stone to Flesh<br><br>Type: Cure, heal<br>Strategy: The spell is the exact opposite of flesh to stone. If you ever find a party member petrified, cast this on him to cure him. You won't find that happening often, though.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Summon Nishruu<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Much like any other summon spell, this one's specifically for mages. A nishruu is totally immune to all spells, has no damaging attack, but with each hit it drains the highest-level mage spell out of the enemy's memorization. Though effective against mages, be sure you have damage to back up its ability.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Tanser's Transformation<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Transforming the mage into a fighter (complete with armor class, hit point, and damage bonuses), this spell works wonders if you need an extra hand at damage dealing. The use and importance is highly personal, but if you have nothing to do with your mage or need extra damage, it works wonders.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>True Sight<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: Dispelling all illusions in the area, this spell can be useful if your enemy is a mage and has cast mislead or another beguiling spell. Otherwise, there isn't much of a use for it.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Wyvern Call<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Much like any other summon spell, only this time, it calls a wyvern. Unfortunately, wyverns are not particularly useful, so neither is this spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Level 7<br><br>Cacofiend<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Summoning a demon that will go on a rampage, killing all who are not protected from evil, this spell can turn an acceptable situation into a disaster. Since the demon will attack your party and is impossible to control, chaos will ensure. The protection from evil spell will let you cast it safely, but it is still fickle.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Control Undead<br><br>Type: Charm<br>Strategy: This spell lets you charm the undead. Since the undead are ever-present in Baldur's Gate II, this spell is extremely useful. Otherwise, it acts and works like any other charm spell (for reference, see charm person).<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Delayed Blast Fireball<br><br>Type: Area damage<br>Strategy: This spell is much like a fireball, except that this spell can be delayed until triggered. Like skull trap, delayed blast fireball will not cast until someone walks within range and triggers it. When it does, it will do 14d6 damage (with half of that, if successfully saved against), which is very hefty. It works well as a trap, but otherwise, it has the same problems as skull trap.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Finger of Death<br><br>Type: Touch damage<br>Strategy: Instantly killing the enemy and doing 2d8+1 damage if your enemy saves, this is a win-win spell. Since it will kill the enemy outright or deal a good amount of damage, it is one of the best damage spells around.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Limited Wish<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: This spell will summon your very own genie. When you do, he will tell you that you can pick either a permanent wish or a reoccurring wish. You can choose to heal your party, summon monsters to fight for you, or other such things. Be careful what you wish for, and make sure there is no way for your choice to go wrong. For example, to summon a horde of monsters to overrun your enemy will summon a horde of bunny rabbits. To ask for your party to be healed will heal your party about the equivalent of cure serious wounds spells. You can wish for magic items and get a variety of things, most being good. Your wisdom will play a large part in the results of this spell.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Mantle<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Much like protection from magical weapons, this spell will shield you from weapon damage. In this case, any weapon +2 or lower will be ineffective. However, it also inherits from protection from magical weapons the duration of four rounds. So, it is, again, mostly useless.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Mass Invisibility<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: This spell is exactly like improved invisibility, but works on the whole group. It has same pros and cons, strategies, and uses.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Mordenkainen's Sword<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Summoning a floating sword (+4) that acts as a fighter equivalent to half the level of the caster, this spell acts much like an elemental. Being only equivalent to half the level of the caster, though, the sword will have rather low hit points and a somewhat difficult time hitting its target. Overall, this spell is an acceptable summon, usable in the same ways described for monster summoning I.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Power Word: Stun<br><br>Type: Hindrance<br>Strategy: Much like power word: silence, this spell casts stun with no saving throw. However, an added plus is that the more hit points the target has, the longer it will be stunned. The stun works the same way as a regular stun. This is an absolute must for later levels, especially boss battles.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Prismatic Spray<br><br>Type: Missile damage<br>Strategy: Working as an upgraded color spray, this spell has the same strengths and weaknesses as its cousin. The only difference is that this does more damage and has more special abilities. Still, it is difficult to use and often hurts party members. Much less risky damage spells are available, but it can pack a punch.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Project Image<br><br>Type: Imbuement<br>Strategy: Working almost exactly like mislead, except that this image can move around and cast spells. The mage himself cannot move for the duration, but the spell acts just like a free life. Once this version of the mage is killed, the real version still remains. Otherwise, it is exactly like mislead.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Protection from the Elements<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: This spell gives 75 percent protection to all elements. Otherwise, it is like any other "protection from" spell. However, most damage is not elemental, so this spell is still of little help. If you find yourself needing resistances, though, this is a nice spell to have around. Why get one elemental resistance when you can get them all?<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Ruby Ray of Reversal<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: This spell works exactly like a secret word, except that it will dispel one random spell from any level. Otherwise, its use and ability is exactly like an upgraded secret word. This is the definitive spell for dispelling mage protections.<br>Importance: Vital<br><br>Spell Sequencer<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: This spell works exactly like minor sequencer, only this lets you use level 4 or lower spells.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Spell Turning<br><br>Type: Defense<br>Strategy: Much like spell deflection, this spell varies in that it sends the spell back to the caster. Also, spell turning affects 12 spell levels. Otherwise, it is a great defense for the mage and is the best turning spell. Since it sends the spell back to the original caster, it turns the hunter into the hunted.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Sphere of Chaos<br><br>Type: Other<br>Strategy: Performing any of nine different abilities, sphere of chaos forces everyone in the area of effect to save against the spell or have any of nine random events occur. Since the abilities range from healing to confusing, the spell is simply too random and unpredictable for any type of use. Since it can end up helping your enemy as much as hurting, there are really few efficient ways to use this spell.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Summon Djinni<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: Lasting for only a short amount of time and sometimes turning on the caster, the djinni is of little help. Of the summoning spells, this is not the one to use.<br>Importance: Low<br><br>Summon Efreeti<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: This spell is exactly like summon djinni in every way, except that it lasts longer. Since it sticks around for a while, the efreeti can deal good damage and absorb a great deal of hits. Overall, the one change from its predecessor lets the spell bloom. In the end, it is a decent summon.<br>Importance: Moderate<br><br>Summon Hakeashar<br><br>Type: Summoning<br>Strategy: One of the ultimate summons, hakeashar is an upgraded nishruu. However, this incarnation is immune to all weapons, has a mighty attack, and still has its special ability. With its ability and lack of a chance to turn on the caster, it is the single best summon against mages.<br>Importance: High<br><br>Khelben's Warding Whip<br><br>Type: Dispel<br>Strategy: This spell is like ruby ray of reversal and the secret words, except that it dispels one level 6 or lower spell and continues to do so each round until dispelled. Though it will not hit higher-level spells, using this followed by a ruby ray will knock out most or all an enemy mage's enhancements. This is the most powerful dispel spell for anything aside from the highest-level buffs.<br>Importance: High<br></div>
