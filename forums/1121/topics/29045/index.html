Basic Concepts<br>1.  Base Attack Bonus (BAB) and Armor Class (AC)<br>2.  Magic and Saving Throws<br>3.  Multiclassing in 3rd Edition<br><br>Frequently Asked Questions<br><br>Final Words...<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Article ?  Basic Concepts<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Dice = Everyone knows what dice are.  The most recognized form of dice is the<br>"D6" or the six sided die.  If you find a weapon that deals out 3d6<br>worth of Damage, then that means the weapon uses 3 six sided dice for<br>a Damage Range of 3 to 18.<br><br>d20  = 3rd Edition (3E) is a "Base 20" system, which means that most rolls<br>use a 20 sided die. (Attacks, Saves, Skills, etc.)<br><br>+,-  = Throughout D&amp;D there are modifiers in both the positive and negative<br>directions.  Any + modifier improves a stat, any - modifier degrades<br>a stat.  Modifiers are also sorted by type, i.e. the spell "Bull's<br>Strength" gives an ENHANCEMENT bonus of + 1d4 + 1 to your Strength<br>score. Knowing what type of bonus is important because you can only<br>have one of each type of bonus. That is, if two spells or effects<br>give an ENHANCEMENT bonus to Strength, only the greater one is<br>counted.<br><br>Encumberance = The weight that your character is currently holding.<br>Depending on how strong she is, she will be able to carry more things.<br>In D&amp;D when you carry close to your limit, you will move slower, and<br>if you go over your limit, you won't be able to move at all. For<br>example, a character with 10 STR should be able to carry up to 100<br>pounds of gear. However, because that is his upper limit, he will<br>be considered to be "encumbered" and will move slowly. If he carries<br>more than 100 pounds, then he can't move at all.<br><br>Feat = A Special Ability gained at 1st level and every level divisible by 3<br>after that. Fighters and Wizards gain bonus feats in addition to<br>these.<br><br>Roll = To roll the dice. Most of 3rd Edition is based off the d20 (20 sided)<br>die, which has a range of 1 to 20. Attack rolls, Saving Throws are<br>based off the d20.<br><br>Stat Modifiers = Each of the 6 stats (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution,<br>Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma) modify various things. Strength<br>affects your ability to hit in melee and your damage. Modifiers<br>increase by +1 for every 2 points of the statistic. A stat of 10 is<br>considered to be +0, while 12 would be +1, 14 would be +2, etc.<br><br>This holds true for all stats. A 14 Strength gives +2 to hit and<br>damage while a 14 Charisma gives a +2 to Diplomacy and Intimidate<br>checks.<br><br>Ability         Ability<br>Stat           Modifier<br>=======================<br>1                -5<br>2- 3             -4<br>4- 5             -3<br>6- 7             -2<br>8- 9             -1<br>10-11             +0<br>12-13             +1<br>14-15             +2<br>16-17             +3<br>18-19             +4<br>20-21             +5<br>22-23             +6<br>etc....<br><br>The difference between your ABILITY STAT and your ABILITY MODIFIER is<br>important.  Casting Bull's Strength gives a +1d4+1 to your Strength,<br>but even if you get the full +5 to your STR that translates to only +2<br>to your modifier (to hit and damage).<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Article 1: Base Attack Bonus (BAB) and Armor Class (AC)<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>With the coming of 3rd Edition, the old THAC0 (To Hit Armor Class 0) system<br>was trashed. In its place is the Base Attack system, which is fairly simple<br>when you get used to it.<br><br>BAB = Base Attack Bonus. The raw ability to succeed at an attack. For<br>instance, a character with a +1 BAB will need to roll a 19 or 20 to<br>hit a monster with a 20 AC. Large BAB's are better than small ones.<br>A 20th level fighter will have a +20 BAB and could only fail to hit a<br>20 AC on a CRITICAL MISS (on any roll to hit, a 1 is always a miss and<br>a 20 is always a hit).<br><br>AC = Armor Class. Essentially how difficult something is to hit. The higher<br>the number, the better. All Armor Classes start at 10 then add modifiers<br>as they go along.<br><br>AC = 10 + Dexterity + Armor + Shield + Other Modifiers<br><br>Critical Hit = On a BAB roll, when a character rolls a 20 (or sometimes, 19,<br>18 or even 17 and lower) he scores a critical threat. He immediately<br>rolls again (called the "Threat Roll") to see if he did Critical<br>Damage. If the Threat roll (using the same To Hit modifiers as the<br>original roll) would hit the monster, then the hit is Critical and<br>does AT LEAST double damage.<br><br>Any original attack roll of a 20 automatically hits.  The same is not<br>true of the "threat" roll, where the 20 still needs to beat the AC of<br>the creature/monster/person you are attacking.<br><br>Here is a critical hit line for a Sword:<br><br>19-20/x2<br><br>This tells you that you get a Critical on rolls of 19 or 20, and that<br>you will do double damamge. Remember that only a 20 is an automatic hit<br>(and critical).  If you roll a 19 and hit, (with a sword) it would be<br>a critical, but if you roll a 19, but that STILL isn't enough to hit,<br>you miss.<br><br>Here is a critical hit line for an Axe:<br><br>20/x3<br><br>The axe criticals ONLY on a 20, but does TRIPLE damage.<br><br>The default critical is at 20/x2. If the weapon doesn't tell you what<br>it criticals at, it goes to the default.<br><br>If you roll a 20, then miss the Critical Threat roll (that determines<br>whether you actually did Critical Damage), you STILL HIT, you just<br>don't get the extra damage.<br><br>Note:  You can only do Critical Damage to living targets. Undead and<br>Constructs (Golems) are immune to critical hits.<br><br>Two Weapon Fighting - Fighting with a weapon in each hand, though at a<br>penalty to hit.  More information on this is in the FAQ below.<br><br>Base Attack and the Attack Roll:<br>--------------------------------<br><br>Base Attack is the only thing that is rolled here. The attacker rolls the<br>Attack roll, adds his BAB (and any other modifiers, such as Strength for a<br>melee or Dexterity for a Ranged weapon) then compares it to the AC. If his<br>roll is equal or greater than the Armor Class, he hits.<br><br>Attack Roll = BAB + Ability Modifier (STR or DEX) + Weapon Enhancement +<br>Feats + Misc. (Spell effects, usually)<br><br>For Example:  Kragg a 10th level fighter with 20 Strength using a normal<br>(not magical) weapon would have a +15 to hit.<br><br>BAB (+10) + STR (+5) = +15<br><br>If he is attacking an Elf with a 25 AC, then he needs to<br>roll a 10 or above to hit, giving him about a 55% to hit.<br>If he rolls a 9, then you add the 15 to get 24 a miss. But<br>if he rolls a 10, then you add the 15 to get 25 and that<br>hits.<br><br>Now say Kragg is using a +2 Axe and that he has the feat<br>Weapon Focus (Battleaxe). He would now do:<br><br>Attack Roll = +10 (BAB) + 5 (STR) + 2 (Magic Axe)<br>+ 1 (Weapon Focus) = +18 to hit<br><br>Now his odds of hitting that 25 AC elf go up to 70%.<br><br>Another Example:  Lyssa, a Tiefling Rogue with 20 Dexterity and Weapon<br>Finesse (a Feat that allows you to use your Dexterity<br>Modifier in place of Strength in Attack rolls, NOT Damage<br>rolls), at 10th level attacks Kragg with a non-magical<br>weapon would have +12 to hit.<br><br>BAB (+7) + DEX (+5) = +12<br><br>Now, if she hits, her damage does NOT get to add in the Dex<br>bonus, but still takes the Strength bonus.<br><br>As with previous editions, fighters gain Base Attack at the best rate,<br>wizards at the worst:<br><br>Base Attack Bonus Chart:<br><br>Fighter,            Cleric, Druid,  Wizard or<br>Barbarian,          Rogue, Bard,    Sorcerer<br>Paladin, or Ranger  or Monk         Base<br>Class         Base Attack         Base Attack     Attack<br>Level         Bonus               Bonus           Bonus<br>1             +1                  +0              +0<br>2             +2                  +1              +1<br>3             +3                  +2              +1<br>4             +4                  +3              +2<br>5             +5                  +3              +2<br>6             +6/+1               +4              +3<br>7             +7/+2               +5              +3<br>8             +8/+3               +6/+1           +4<br>9             +9/+4               +6/+1           +4<br>10            +10/+5              +7/+2           +5<br>11            +11/+6/+1           +8/+3           +5<br>12            +12/+7/+2           +9/+4           +6/+1<br>13            +13/+8/+3           +9/+4           +6/+1<br>14            +14/+9/+4           +10/+5          +7/+2<br>15            +15/+10/+5          +11/+6/+1       +7/+2<br>16            +16/+11/+6/+1       +12/+7/+2       +8/+3<br>17            +17/+12/+7/+2       +12/+7/+2       +8/+3<br>18            +18/+13/+8/+3       +13/+8/+3       +9/+4<br>19            +19/+14/+9/+4       +14/+9/+4       +9/+4<br>20            +20/+15/+10/+5      +15/+10/+5      +10/+5<br><br>The number of attacks you can see in the above chart. Each number in the<br>line separated by a slash represents an additional attack. So, my fighter<br>Kragg at 10th level would have 2 attacks, with a BAB of +10 and +5. The<br>pattern is that you get a new attack for every +5 of BAB you have (with the<br>new attack coming the next level, or at the "6").<br><br>Unlike previous editions of the game, even Wizards can now get extra attacks.<br><br>Monk Note:  Monks get even more attacks than that. They gain new attacks<br>at every 3 points of BAB. A 20th level monk would get 5 attacks<br>(+15/+12/+9/+6/+3).<br><br>Feats Note: The other way to gain more attacks are through Feats. For<br>instance, the Rapid Shot feat allows an archer one extra shot.<br>Such extra attacks are usually done at the HIGHEST base attack<br>bonus (the first number in the line, such as +20 for a 20th<br>level fighter) with a small penalty attached. Both Rapid Shot<br>and the Monk's Flurry of Blows have a penalty of -2.<br><br>So, a 20th level Ranger using a Rapid Shot would get 5 attacks,<br>at +18/+18/+13/+8/+3. (After that you would then add his Dex<br>bonus, weapon bonus and any misc bonuses to hit)<br><br>Note:  Because of the way number of attacks are determined, only fighters<br>(and fighter-types) will ever get the 4th attack (excluding monks).<br>If you want a Cleric/Druid/Rogue/Bard to get the 4th attack, they<br>need at least 4 levels of a fighter-type class.<br><br>Armor Class:<br>------------<br><br>All Armor Classes start at 10.  Positive numbers are better, and there is<br>no limit to how high it can get.  You can usually only have one type of<br>bonus at a time.  Here are the main elements of Armor Class: (not all types<br>are in all games)<br><br>Armor - Ranging in quality from Padded (+1 AC) to Full Plate (+8 AC).<br><br>Max Dex Bonus:<br><br>However, wearing armor will limit how well your character can move,<br>meaning that it limits how much of your Dexterity Modifier will<br>be used for AC.  For instance, Padded Armor gives a +1 bonus to<br>AC and allows up to +8 DEX bonus to AC.  So, an Elf with 20 DEX<br>(Dex adds +5 to AC) wears padded armor, his total AC would be 16.<br>That same Elf wearing a Full Plate (+8 AC, max dex of +1) would<br>have a 19 AC.<br><br>Skill Penalties:<br><br>Armor restricts movement and creates noise when you move, so<br>skills that require stealth, or agility have a certain penalty<br>associated with them.  Padded armor barely restricts movement,<br>while full plate barely allows you to breath.<br><br>Arcane Spell Failure:<br><br>A mage can wear armor and still cast a spell. (He shouldn't try it<br>without getting a proficiency in that armor first) However, each<br>armor has a percentage chance of failure associated with a wizard<br>spell (This only applies to Arcane casters: Bards, Sorcerers and<br>Wizards).  Padded Armor gives only a 5% chance of failure, while<br>Full Plate has a 35% chance of failure. (roughly 1 in 3 spells will<br>fail) This is why the Feat "Still Spell" was invented; it negates<br>Arcane Spell Failure chances.<br><br>You can also get Armor bonuses from magical spells and items, such<br>as Mage Armor (1st level, Wizard/Sorcerer) and Bracers of Armor +1.<br>Remember that single bonuses don't stack with each other. So, a<br>fighter wearing Full Plate gets no benefit from Mage Armor.<br>(Although Neverwinter Nights does Mage Armor differently... instead<br>of a +4 armor bonus, it gives +1 bonuses from 4 different AC<br>sources)<br><br>Shield - Using a shield fully stacks with the armor bonus.  Small shields<br>are worth +1 AC, large shields are +2 AC.  Tower Shields are<br>meant to provide cover (up to +10 AC if you completely hide behind<br>it). However, none of the current games implement Tower Shields<br>that way, and they usually just give a +3 to AC.<br><br>There is both a Skill Penalty and Arcane Spell Failure associated<br>with Shields.<br><br>Dexterity - How quickly you can move out of the way of an attack.  As<br>noted above, this is limited by what armor you wear.  You do not<br>lose Dexterity when determining "Touch Attacks." (see the Magic<br>section below)<br><br>Deflection - Magical Bonus.  Typically found in Rings of Protection and<br>spells.  You do not lose Deflection bonuses when determining<br>"Touch Attacks."<br><br>Dodge - From feats (the Dodge feat), magic (Haste... usually), or racial<br>bonuses (Dwarves vs. Giants).  Dodge bonuses always stack with<br>other dodge bonuses.<br><br>Natural - Either representing your tough skin (i.e. dragons) or a magical<br>alteration to same. (Barkskin)<br><br>Size - Related somewhat to "Natural" armor, this represents the idea that<br>smaller things are harder to hit than larger things. (Think of the<br>different between hitting a Flea with a staff and hitting a barn)<br>To represent this, all creatures have an innate size AC modifier<br>just as they have an innate natural AC modifier. In most cases,<br>both of these are at 0. Smaller creatures (like Halflings and<br>Gnomes) get a +1 AC from size. They also get a +1 to hit<br>everything because most everything else is larger than them. And if<br>a Halfling tries to hit another halfling, the AC bonus and To Hit<br>bonus would cancel each other out.<br><br>Insight - The ability to dodge blows BEFORE the attack. This is what Monks<br>do with their Wisdom bonus. You do not lose Insight when<br>determining "Touch Attacks."<br><br>"Unnamed" - All the other bonuses that aren't specific stack together.<br>So, if a spell says that it gives "+6 to AC" but doesn't say which<br>category it falls under, it will then stack will everything.<br>The major example of this is the Feat "Expertise" which gives up<br>to +5 AC.<br><br>Table of Common Armors<br>----------------------<br><br>Armor   Maximum         Skill     Arcane<br>Armor                  Bonus   Dex Bonus     Penalty     Spell Failure<br>Light armor<br>Padded                 +1      +8              0         5%<br>Leather                +2      +6              0        10%<br>Studded leather        +3      +5             -1        15%<br>Chain shirt            +4      +4             -2        20%<br>Medium armor<br>Hide                   +3      +4             -3        20%<br>Scale mail             +4      +3             -4        25%<br>Chainmail              +5      +2             -5        30%<br>Breastplate            +5      +3             -4        25%<br>Heavy armor<br>Splint mail            +6      +0             -7        40%<br>Banded mail            +6      +1             -6        35%<br>Half-plate             +7      +0             -7        40%<br>Full plate             +8      +1             -6        35%<br>Shields<br>Buckler                +1       -             -1         5%<br>Shield, small, wooden  +1       -             -1         5%<br>Shield, small, steel   +1       -             -1         5%<br>Shield, large, wooden  +2       -             -2        15%<br>Shield, large, steel   +2       -             -2        15%<br>Shield, tower          **       -            -10        50%<br><br>Dexterity Based AC vs. Armor Based AC<br>-------------------------------------<br><br>These are the 2 basic philosophies regarding AC. You can either go for a<br>large Dexterity bonus, or skip Dexterity and wear Full Plate. Naturally,<br>class choice determines what is best (most of the time, anyway).<br><br>Usual Dex Based Classes:<br><br>Bards<br>Monks<br>Rogues<br>Wizards/Sorcerers<br><br>Usual Armor Based Classes:<br><br>Clerics/Druids<br>Fighters/Rangers/Barbarians/Paladins<br><br>An Elven Rogue with 30 Dex (+10 AC bonus) isn't too likely to wear Full<br>Plate. He'd be best off with Leather Armor (magical if he can get it), but<br>better still would be Bracers of Armor, which allow an unlimited Dex bonus.<br>However, a Dwarven Fighter would be just fine with a mere 12 DEX (+1 to AC)<br>because that is the most Dex a set of Full Plate will allow.  All in what<br>your goal is, really.<br><br>High Dex Note:  How can you get high Dex's to appear in your game?  Well,<br>it helps to start at 20 (Halflings and Elves can), then<br>increase it every 4 levels (to 25 at 20th level).<br>Magic can also enhance your Dex, usually by another +5<br>(either through the spell Cat's Grace, or an item that<br>emulates it).<br><br>The weakness of basing your AC on Dexterity comes when you are attacked by<br>Invisible (or hiding) opponents, where you LOSE your Dex bonus. The advantage<br>is that when determining "Touch" attacks, you DON'T lose your Dex bonus,<br>while you DO lose your Armor bonus. (An example of a "Touch" attack would<br>be the Harm spell. Once cast, the caster must then "touch" the target.<br>Because touching the armor is just as good as touching the person, Armor<br>bonuses don't protect you)<br><br>Magical Enhancments<br>-------------------<br><br>Just as swords can be enchanted to do more damage and hit more accurately,<br>so too can armors be enchanted to increase their effectiveness.  The usual<br>range of "Enhancement" is +1 to +5.  Magical Armors have 1 better Skill<br>Penalty.<br><br>A Full Plate +5 would have +13 Armor Bonus to AC, Max Dex +1 and -5 to<br>Skills.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Article 2.  Magic and Saving Throws<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Most classes in 3E D&amp;D get to cast spells.  They are:<br><br>Class          Prime Ability<br>----------------------------<br>Bards      --  Charisma<br>Clerics    --  Wisdom<br>Druids     --  Wisdom<br>Paladins   --  Wisdom<br>Rangers    --  Wisdom<br>Sorcerers  --  Charisma<br>Wizards    --  Intelligence<br><br>All spellcasters (except Bards and Sorcerers) have to PREPARE SPELLS AHEAD<br>OF TIME by Memorizing, then Resting.  If a spell is memorized ONCE it can be<br>cast ONCE. (Sorcerers and Bards can cast any spell they want up to a number<br>of times per day, per level)  Wizards (and ONLY Wizards) have the additional<br>penalty of having to find Scrolls to learn spells from.  Every other caster<br>automatically learns spells when they level up.<br><br>All spells have LEVELS associated with them.  For example, Magic Missile is<br>a First Level Spell.  These levels are not to be confused with CHARACTER<br>Levels (and Class Levels, which aren't the same thing either).  Your<br>character gains access to new levels of spells depending on his class.<br>Wizards, Clerics and Druids get a new spell level at every other Class Level.<br>So, he will start level 1 being able to cast 1st level spells.  At level 3<br>he'll get 2nd level spells, at level 5 he'll get 3rd and so on.<br><br>Tip: A quick way to tell what the highest level of spell your Wizard,<br>Cleric or Druid can cast is to divide his level in half, then round<br>up. (3/2 = 1.5, rounded to 2... so a 3rd level character can cast 2nd<br>level spells)<br><br>Sorcerers simply don't round up when you divide their level by 2.<br>So, a 4th level Sorcerer gets 2nd level spells, 6th get 3rd level<br>spells, etc.<br><br>In order to even be ABLE to cast a spell, your character needs enough<br>Intelligence (Wizard), Wisdom (Cleric/Druid/Paladin/Ranger) or Charisma<br>(Sorcerer/Bard).  How much?  10 + Spell Level.  So, a Cleric with a Wisdom<br>of 11 could cast 1st level Clerical spells, but NOT 2nd level.  Until his<br>Wisdom is raised.<br><br>Tip:  Rangers and Paladins only have 4 spell levels, so is a Wisdom of more<br>than 14 needed? (IWD2 notwithstanding, it gives them 6 levels) Not<br>really, however...<br><br>Beyond the minimum requirement, having MORE of your Prime Stat is always<br>good, it will give you BONUS SPELLS to cast!<br><br>Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells<br>---------- Bonus Spells (by Spell Level) -------------------<br>Score   Modifier      0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9<br>1    -5      ----------- Can't cast spells tied to this ability ---------<br>2-3    -4      ----------- Can't cast spells tied to this ability ---------<br>4-5    -3      ----------- Can't cast spells tied to this ability ---------<br>6-7    -2      ----------- Can't cast spells tied to this ability ---------<br>8-9    -1      ----------- Can't cast spells tied to this ability ---------<br>10-11     0           -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -<br>12-13    +1           -     1     -     -     -     -     -     -     -     -<br>14-15    +2           -     1     1     -     -     -     -     -     -     -<br>16-17    +3           -     1     1     1     -     -     -     -     -     -<br>18-19    +4           -     1     1     1     1     -     -     -     -     -<br>20-21    +5           -     2     1     1     1     1     -     -     -     -<br>22-23    +6           -     2     2     1     1     1     1     -     -     -<br>24-25    +7           -     2     2     2     1     1     1     1     -     -<br>26-27    +8           -     2     2     2     2     1     1     1     1     -<br>28-29    +9           -     3     2     2     2     2     1     1     1     1<br>30-31   +10           -     3     3     2     2     2     2     1     1     1<br>32-33   +11           -     3     3     3     2     2     2     2     1     1<br>34-35   +12           -     3     3     3     3     2     2     2     2     1<br>36-37   +13           -     4     3     3     3     3     2     2     2     2<br>38-39   +14           -     4     4     3     3     3     3     2     2     2<br>40-41   +15           -     4     4     4     3     3     3     3     2     2<br>42-43   +16           -     4     4     4     4     3     3     3     3     2<br>44-45   +17           -     5     4     4     4     4     3     3     3     3<br>etc. . . .<br><br>(Scores going over 30 are a LITTLE unlikely, but not impossible)<br><br>The "Difficulty Class" (DC)<br>---------------------------<br><br>...is essentially how hard a spell is to resist via Saving Throws.<br><br>If a spell has a "Saving Throw" associated with it (essentially a way for<br>the target of the spell to avoid, or reduce the effects of the spell), then<br>the Difficulty Class of the caster is set, and the target rolls a save to<br>avoid the spell.<br><br>DC = 10 + Spell Level + Stat Modifier<br><br>Spell Level is just what it says, the level of the spell from 1 to 9.<br><br>Stat Modifier is your caster's key stat.  For Wizards this is Intelligence;<br>for Clerics, Druids, Paladins and Rangers this is Wisdom; for Bards and<br>Sorcerers this is Charisma.<br><br>So, let's say our Sorcerer, Mordule, casts Wail of the Banshee at his<br>enemies.  It is a 9th level spell, and he has a 22 Charisma (+6 bonus).  His<br>DC would be set at...<br><br>DC = 10 + 9 (Spell Level) + 6 (Charisma Modifier) = 25<br><br>So, his enemies would need to roll a Saving Throw (Fortitude in this case)<br>of at least a 25 to survive.<br><br>In our example, if a Goblin hears the Wail, he needs to roll a Saving Throw<br>Fortitude, or die.  Let's say the Goblin has a +2 on Fortitude Saves.<br>Normally there is no way he can roll a 25 (even a roll of natural 20, the<br>best he could roll, would be only 22 with his bonus).  However, some games<br>put it that any roll of a 20 is considered a success, just like in the<br>attack roll. Similarly any roll of a 1 would be a failure, no matter what<br>your bonus.  So, in those cases there would always a 5% of failure and<br>another 5% chance of success, no matter your stats.<br><br>Feats can be used to increase your DC, specifically Spell Focus.  To take<br>a spell focus in Necromancy, for instance, will cause your Instant Death<br>spells to have a DC +2.  Some games also have the Greater Spell Focus which<br>grants another +2 for a total of +4 to the DC.<br><br>Saving Throws<br>-------------<br><br>There are 3 types of saves in 3E D&amp;D:<br><br>Fortitude - based on Constitution, determines how physically tough a body<br>is and its ability to resist poisons, disease and most instant<br>death spells<br>Reflex    - based on Dexterity, determines your ability to dodge out of the<br>way of a harmful spell (like Fireball).<br>Will      - based on Wisdom, determines ability to resist invasions of the<br>mind... or just being afraid of a really large dragon.<br><br>Saves improve as you gain levels.  Each class has at least 1 good save, and<br>usually 2 bad saves (the Monk has ALL good saves, Clerics have 2 good saves,<br>etc.).<br><br>When your class is good at a particular Save (for instance, Fighters are<br>tough, and get a good Fortitude save), they start with +2 at that save, and<br>increase +1 every 2 levels until they reach +12 at level 20.<br><br>Save = Base Save (from level) + Ability Modifier<br><br>So, Kragg at 20th level, with a 20 CON (+5 bonus), would have a Fortitude<br>Save of...<br><br>Fortitude = +12 (Base) + 5 (Con) = +17<br><br>"Bad" saves (like a Fighter's Will Save) start out at +0 and increase every<br>roughly every 3 levels until they're +6 at 20th level.<br><br>So, Kragg, still at 20th level, with a 10 WIS (+0 bonus), would have a really<br>bad Will Save of...<br><br>Will = +6 (Base) + 0 (WIS) = +6<br><br>So, even at 20th level, a 1st level Bard casting "Cause Fear" COULD get<br>Kragg to run away like a baby.

Multiclassing in 3rd Edition<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Multiclassing in 3rd Edition works similar to the 2nd Edition concept of<br>"Dual Classing."  Still, they're completely different.  In 2nd Ed. you had<br>to worry about whether it was a valid multiclass, you had to have certain<br>Ability Stats and on and on.<br><br>In 3rd Ed. there are less things to worry about -- you could multiclass a<br>Dwarven Fighter to Barbarian (and later add a few levels of Ranger if you<br>wanted) -- but there are a few new concepts as well.<br><br>Since your character can be a Fighter 7 / Barbarian 4 (total level 11) we<br>need to differentiate his levels a little bit.<br><br>Character Level  -- Total character level.

Some spells use your character<br>level to determine how powerful the spell effect is.<br>(Divine Power, for instance)<br><br>Class Level  --  The number of levels your character has in a specific<br>class.

A 20th level cleric<br>would wipe the floor with a Cleric 10 / Sorcerer 10 character.<br><br>Tip:  My favorite way to use multiclasses is to have a character pick up<br>4 levels of Fighter.  A Cleric 16 / Fighter 4 is a much better<br>warrior than a Cleric 20.  The Cleric 16 / Fighter 4 would get one<br>extra attack and 3 extra feats.

If, however, he were a Barbarian 8 / Fighter 2 /<br>Ranger 2, he would. (20%)  From that point on, everytime he gains exp<br>he'd take it at -20%. (So, if he gains 1000 exp for killing a big monster,<br>he actually only gains 800)  This is because of Favored Classes.<br><br>Every race has a favored class:<br><br>Dwarf    &gt; Fighter<br>Elf      &gt; Wizard (any)<br>Gnome    &gt; Illusionist (Wizard)<br>Human    &gt; Any<br>Half-Elf &gt; Any<br>Halfling &gt; Rogue<br>Half-Orc &gt; Barbarian<br><br>When determining Exp Penalties, a Favored Class is not counted.  So,<br>to look at the exp penalty of Kragg, you ignore his Fighter Levels (he's<br>a Dwarf).  So if he's Fighter 8 / Barbarian 2 / Ranger 2, for the purposes<br>of Exp Penalties, you look only at Barbarian 2 / Ranger 2.  Humans and<br>Half-Elves take their HIGHEST CLASS LEVEL as their favored class.  So, a<br>human would be OK with either Fighter 8 / Barbarian 2 / Ranger 2 or<br>Barbarian 8 / Fighter 2 / Ranger 2.<br><br>Experience Penalties pop up whenever your multiple classes are no longer<br>even or within ONE level of each other. (again, not counting your favored<br>class)  For each class out of balance, you take a 20% experience penalty.<br><br>Let's look at Kragg again.<br><br>Fighter 8 / Barbarian 2 / Ranger 2 &gt; Ignore the Fighter levels, this<br>makes him a Barbarian 2 / Ranger 2.<br>Levels are even, so no Exp Penalty.<br><br>Barbarian 8 / Fighter 2 / Ranger 2 &gt; Ignore the Fighter 2, so Kragg is<br>then Barbarian 8 / Ranger 2.

They<br>obviously aren't, so he takes<br>multiple experience penalties (40%).<br><br>Druid 6 / Barbarian 6/ Ranger 6    &gt; No favored class here, but all 3<br>classes are in balance, so there are<br>no penalties.  Note that a 5/5/4<br>combination would also be in<br>balance, but a 6/5/4 would not be.<br><br>===============================================================================<br>&lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; Frequently Asked Questions &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br>===============================================================================<br><br>Q:  My question is; how does the 'resistance' system work now?<br><br>Previously I was used to an item or spell in BG2 conferring a %<br>resistance.  EG. Ring of Fire Resistance = 50% fire resistance.  In IWD2<br>there seems to be some new convention. Items have a value like 1/- cold<br>resistance, or an Aasimar starts with 5/- fire resistance. What does this<br>mean? Surely an item doesn't attract a measly 1% cold resistance?<br><br>A:  No, it's not 1%.  A "cold resistance" of 1/- means that your character<br>will ignore the first point of cold damage directed at it.  So, for<br>example, your Aasimar is hit by a Fireball that would normally do 20<br>damage.  Since aasimars have 5/- fire damage reduction then he only<br>takes 15 points of damage.<br><br>Also, since most spell damage is figured AFTER you make/fail a reflex<br>save, your damage reduction is figured after as well.

For instance,<br>Stoneskin offers 10/+5 reduction against WEAPON damage only.  It will<br>block the first 10 points of damage UNLESS that weapon is +5 enchantment<br>or better.

So, Kragg, a 10th<br>level fighter with 20 STR using a normal weapon in both hands (light<br>in the offhand):<br><br>Attack Roll = STR (+5) + BAB (+10) - Penalty (-2) = 13<br><br>So, both his first attack and off-hand attacks would be at a +13.  His<br>total attack line would then be:<br><br>Main Hand: +13/+8   Offhand: +13<br><br>Damage from strength is 1x on the main hand, but only 0.5x on the<br>offhand.  Always round odd numbers down.  So, with Kragg, he'd do the<br>full +5 from STR with his main hand, but only +2 from STR with his<br>offhand attack.<br><br>Improved Two Weapon Fighting gives your character another offhand<br>attack.  It is at the standard -5 to hit that normal extra attacks are<br>at.  So, if Kragg had the Improved Two Weapon Fighting feat, his attack<br>line would be:<br><br>Main Hand:  +13/+8  Offhand: +13/+8<br><br>Light Weapons are determined by whatever game you're playing.  Usually<br>they are:  Daggers, Short Swords and Handaxes.  You can fight with any<br>2 weapons you want.  If you want to use a Bastard Sword in each hand you<br>can, but at a steeper penalty than if you used a lighter weapon.<br><br>Rangers wearing Light Armor get the effects of both Ambidexterity and<br>Two Weapon Fighting for free.<br><br>Q:  How does "Turn Undead" work in 3E D&amp;Ds (Charisma-Modifier etc.)?<br><br>A:  First you get a number of Turn attempts equal to 3 + your Charisma Mod.<br>Next a d20 is rolled, adding in your Charisma mod again.  This result<br>is checked on this table:<br><br>Turning Check     Most Powerful Undead<br>Result            Affected (Maximum Hit Dice)<br>---------------------------------------------<br>Up to 0           Cleric's level - 4<br>1-3               Cleric's level - 3<br>4-6               Cleric's level - 2<br>7-9               Cleric's level - 1<br>10-12             Cleric's level<br>13-15             Cleric's level + 1<br>16-18             Cleric's level + 2<br>19-21             Cleric's level + 3<br>22+               Cleric's level + 4<br><br>So, Corvus, a 12th level cleric with 18 Charisma (+4 mod) turns undead.<br>His turning check rolls a 12 (8 + 4 from Charisma).  Looking at the table<br>a result of 12 drops you right in the middle, with your result being<br>"Cleric's Level."  This means that Corvus could turn any Undead that has<br>as many or fewer Hit Dice as he has levels (12).  If he'd rolled a 22 on<br>his check, then he could turn Undead with 16 Hit Dice. (Hit Dice are<br>roughly equivalent to levels, and indicate the power, and overall hit<br>points, of the undead)<br><br>Once we've determined the MAXIMUM possible, you need to still roll to<br>decide the total number of undead creatures that will be affected.  This<br>roll is a:<br><br>2d6 + Cha Mod. + Cleric Level<br><br>Let's say when Corvus rolls his 2d6, he gets 12.  So his result would be<br>28 (12 + 4 + 12).  He could affect a TOTAL of 28 hit dice of undead.<br><br>So, with our previous result, the most powerful undead affected can have<br>up to 12 hit dice, and the total affected can have 28 hit dice.  If<br>Corvus were in a room turning Skeletons (1 HD each), he could turn 28 of<br>them.  If, however, he were fighting Wraiths (5 HD), he could only turn<br>5 of them.<br><br>Any undead with more HD than you can turn are unaffected.  Any undead<br>who has half or less HD than you have levels would be destroyed (for a<br>good cleric) or controlled (for an evil cleric).  So, Corvus would<br>destroy any undead with 6 or fewer HD.<br><br>Q:  How do Challenge Ratings (CR) work?<br><br>A:  Not well.  Ok, personal opinion out of the way... the basic idea is that<br>killing a goblin at level 1 is difficult and should give a good amount<br>of experience, but that killing the same goblin at level 20 is so<br>ridiculously easy that you should gain no experience from it.  Each<br>monster/encounter is given a challenge rating.  That challenge rating<br>states at what level a standard party can defeat that monster, but still<br>have a challenging time at it.  So, a CR 1 would be a challenging fight<br>for a group of level 1 characters.  Group level is simply an average of<br>your party's level.  The party is given a lump sum of experience, which<br>is then divided amongst the party.  So, a smaller party gains more<br>experience.<br><br>An example would be a CR 1 Orc.  A bunch of first level characters defeat<br>it gaining, let's say, 200 experience.  Now they fight a CR 5 monters and<br>SOMEHOW manage to defeat it anyway.  They get 1000 experience. (examples<br>only)  Now let's say a level 10 party comes by and kills a CR 1 Orc.<br>They get nothing.  They fight the CR 5 monster and get 50 experience.<br><br>Where CR's fail are when monsters are considered "tough" because of a<br>property they have.  Why?  Say the monster is "tough" because of a 20/+3<br>damage reduction.  For any party that has no +3 weapons, this would be a<br>tough fight.  However, a low level party could have a +3 or better<br>weapon, which would make this creature MUCH easier.  This is even worse<br>for monsters that have special abilities.  Say, a Beholder shoots at you<br>with his eyestalks, but you have really good Saving Throws, even at a<br>low level.  You won't have anything to fear at all.  Furthermore, it is<br>very often the strategy of the monsters that leads to them being<br>difficult.  Thieves that don't hide in the shadows and sneak attack are<br>not too fearsome. (/rant)</div>
