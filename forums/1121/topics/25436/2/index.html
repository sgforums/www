            <div class='col-md body'>The East Road<br>The road leading east from Port Llast travels past an archaeological dig and into Neverwinter Woods. This area is immense, and the troll caves in the area lead down into ancient caverns where you'll discover hints of more frightening events on the horizon.<br>A- To Port Llast<br>B- To North Road<br>C- To Neverwinter Woods<br>D- To South Road<br>E- The Archaeologists' Camp<br>F- Jax's barracks<br>G- Geth<br>H- To Troll Caves Storage Area<br>I- To Troll Caves: Level One<br><br>The Archaeologists' Camp<br>Go through the gates into the campsite. Speaking with any of the archaeologists will lead you to Jax, the leader of the dig until the group was attacked by trolls. Jax will tell you about a creator race and how he will reward you if you bring him proof that it existed. Enter the barracks and speak with Revat and Lenton. Revat wants you to rescue his mother from the trolls and gives you a ring. Lenton wants you to avenge the death of his brother by bringing him the head of the troll chief.<br>Luckily, you can accomplish all of these goals in one place: one huge seven-level place full of trolls, golems, and strange beasts of which you've never even heard tales. Before you leave the barracks, pay a visit to the second floor. One of the escaped convicts from the Bounty Hunt quest, Deliliah (14th-level rogue), is hiding up here. Kill her, or let her surrender in exchange for information and her ear.<br><br>Geth<br>Before you enter the Troll Caves, head south along the road. You'll be set upon by poor Geth in werewolf form. When he surrenders, make him use the silver charm. Now head to the caves in the northeastern corner of the east road.<br><br>Troll Caves: Storage Level<br>A- From East Road<br>B- Revat's Mother<br>C- To Troll Caves: Level One<br>D- Portal from Creator Ruins<br><br>Make your way through the caves to the stairs. Before you descend, stop and talk with Janis, Revat's mother. Use Revat's ring to free her, then continue downstairs.<br><br>Troll Caves: Level One<br>A- To Storage Area<br>B- To East Road<br>C- To Troll Caves: Level Two<br>D- Troll Chieftain<br>E- Synth La'Neral's Corpse<br><br>Fight your way to the troll chieftain's chamber in the northeast corner of this level. He's a tough fighter--a 15th-level giant/6th-level cleric. His minions will be a little easier. Once they're dead, loot his body and take the head. Loot the room, then head to the west side of the cave. In the northwest tunnel, you'll find a corpse. Search it for the journal of Synth La'Neral, needed for Linu's henchman quest.<br><br>Troll Caves: Level Two<br>A- To Troll Caves: Level One<br>B- Troll Shaman<br>C- To Troll Caves: Level Two<br><br>There is little to note on this level, apart from the troll shaman behind a locked door in the southern central area of the cave. Fight your way through and continue down.<br><br>Troll Caves: Level Three<br>A- To Troll Caves: Level Two<br>B- Darius<br>C- To the Creator Ruins<br><br>Near the stairs from level two, you'll find a disturbed individual in a cell. He'll tell you about something lurking beneath the troll caves, and his behavior should convince you that he's serious. At the east end of the long tunnel, you'll find stairs leading down.<br><br></div>

You'll want to search everywhere and open everything. You won't, however, be able to open the sealed doors easily.<br><br>You'll see the first guardian as soon as you descend from the caves. He'll tell you that you cannot pass without a signet ring. Before you go looking for it, be sure to open the chest just to the south of the entrance. Inside, you'll find the prism blossom seed that Boddyknock needs for his henchman quest.<br><br>In a chest in the southeast corner, at the end of a long bridge, you'll find the Golem Signet Ring. Return to the guardian and he will let you pass.<br><br>The Creator Ruins: Level Two<br>A- To Creator Ruins: Level One<br>B- Seal Guardian<br>C- Creator Scroll<br>D- Treasure Rooms<br>E- To Creator Ruins: Level Three<br><br>The guardian on this level requires a password. You will find it ("Thurth mog lama gat rag") by reading the creator scroll locked in a heavily guarded chest in the southern area of the level. When you open the chest, you will be attacked by three 13th-level flesh golems.<br><br>The southeast and southwest sections of this level both contain some good loot. The latter is guarded by a 13th-level helmed horror.<br><br>The Creator Ruins: Level Three<br>A- To Creator Ruins: Level Two<br>B- Seal Guardian<br>C- Dead Thief<br>D- Creator Sorcerers<br>E- Portal to Troll Caves: Storage Area<br><br>The seal guardian on this level is only after one thing: you. It's only 3rd level, but it has 25 percent immunity to piercing and slashing weapons and a damage reduction of 10/+1, and it is totally immune to critical hits, death magic, disease, poison, paralysis, energy draining, and mind-affecting spells. And killing it won't get you through the door.<br><br>This won't be the last you see of the creators.<br>To find the key, head into the southern hallways. In one of the central rooms, you'll find the body of a dead thief. Search his corpse for the seal key. There is also some good treasure in these rooms, as well as a battle horror and some gray renders.<br><br>Return to the entry, unlock the seal, and face the creator sorcerers (8th-level wizards). They aren't too tough individually, but there are four to contend with. Through the gate, you'll face another sorcerer. He'll surrender after you do enough damage, and you can learn a bit about the (awful, awful) creator race. Kill him when the conversation ends. Search the nearby chests for three books, particularly History of the Slave Race, which Jax will want. Use the portal to return to the surface, and talk to everyone at the archaeologists' compound to receive your rewards.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>East Road: Neverwinter Woods<br>As Ballard informed you, the animals are acting strangely. You'll fight a fair amount of wildlife--including weak little deer--as you investigate the goings-on among the trees. As you've probably already guessed, the cult has something to do with it all. Druid Encampment<br>A- To East Road<br>B- Druid Encampment<br>C- Bridge to Deep Woods<br>D- Wyvern's Camp<br><br>Find the druid camp in the north. Talk to Archdruid Aawill, and he will set you off on a quest to find out what is wrong in the woods. Along the way, he'd like for you to find three missing druids: Orlane, Terari, and Bree. They can be found in a spider cave in the deep woods, the Nymph's House, and Setara's House, respectively. Once you've accepted Aawill's quest, you can cross the bridge to the east.<br><br>You can cross the bridge after you agree to look for the missing druids.<br>Druid Challenge<br>Characters with at least one druid level can take the druid challenge. In it, you will fight four increasingly powerful druids. For each one you beat, you will earn a ring. The Ring of the First Circle will cast Stoneskin once a day, the Ring of the Second Circle will cast Poison, the Ring of the Third Circle will cast Resist Elements, and the Ring of the Fourth Circle will cast Summon Creature I.<br><br>Wyvern's Camp<br>It isn't a real wyvern; it's just a guy named Wyvern whose friends are being attacked. And it isn't a real guy named Wyvern whose friends are being attacked; it's one of the escaped convicts. His plea for help is actually an ambush. Wyvern is only a 5th-level ranger, and he'll surrender quickly. Kill him, or let him escape in exchange for his ear and some information.<br></div>

When she surrenders, talk to her. Seems everyone is under the evil spell of the forest. She has two suggestions as to creatures that may not be affected: a local nymph and a witch named Setara, who lives to the east in the Heart of the Forest.<br><br>The Nymph's House<br>A- To Deep Woods<br>B- Nymph Slave<br>C- The Nymph<br>D- Ceremonial Dagger and Mirror of Vanity<br>E- Terrari<br>F- Lock of Nymph Hair<br><br>The nymph has many slaves, and they're all hostile. The one in the northwestern corner will surrender and seem unaware of where he is or how he got here. Makes you feel a little bad for killing all the others, doesn't it?<br><br>The nymph can help you reach the Spirit of the Wood.<br>Continue to the northeastern room, where you will meet the seductress herself. Her charms won't work on you, and she'll break down and tell you what she knows about the Spirit of the Wood and how a mortal might possibly reach it. Search the nearby chest for a ceremonial dagger, the Mirror of Vanity, and the Treatise on the Spirit of the Wood.<br><br>In the southern portion of her house, you'll find the missing druid Terrari. He'll leave once you talk to him. In an armoire in the bedroom to the southeast, you'll find the lock of nymph hair needed for Sharwyn's henchman quest.<br><br>The Spider Cave<br>A- To Deep Woods<br>B- Orlane<br><br>In the southeastern part of the region, you'll find a cave opening. Enter, and you'll be knee-deep in arachnids and ettercaps. In the southeastern cavern, you'll face an 11th-level queen spider. She guards a spiderweb cocoon that contains Orlane, the first of the missing druids.<br><br></div>

Its reason for being here will be made clear soon. The south cave that's home to a 12th-level dire bear is a good place to visit for some experience points and some loot. But there are two more-important places to visit. First, let's see what the witch knows.<br><br>Setara's House<br>A- To the Heart of the Forest<br>B- Bree<br>C- Setara<br>D- Library<br><br>When you find Setara, she won't help you unless you have the Mirror of Vanity from the Nymph's House. Give it to the witch, and she will give you the key to Bree's cell along with Setara's Gem, one of the Serpent's Gems for Elaith. Free Bree, then loot the house. Don't miss the Imaskarran Tome of Resonance--it's in the glowing bookshelf in the library.<br><br>The Altar<br>Once you've explored Setara's House and the Dire Bear Cave, go to the altar in the southeastern corner of the Heart of the Forest. Examine the altar, then plunge the ceremonial dagger (from the Nymph's House) into your chest.<br><br>The Realm of the Spirit<br>A- From the Heart of the Forest<br>B- Relmar<br>C- Spirit Poison Antidote<br>D- Spirit of the Wood<br>E- Portal<br><br>In this strange realm, you'll encounter a fairly incoherent dwarf named Relmar (12th-level fighter). His circuitous rambling will tell you why he's here (to poison the spirit) and what you can do about it (find the antidote hidden in the rocks to the west). He'll attack you, and you should take his journal from the corpse.<br><br>The Spirit of the Wood.<br>Get the antidote, then find the spirit in its grove to the east. It will attack (5th-level fighter/2nd-level magical beast/11th-level sorcerer), and it's immune to most every type of magic but elemental. When the spirit surrenders, you can cure it of the poison with the antidote, or you can kill it. If you choose the former, you will be transported back to the forest. Choose the latter, and you'll have to use the portal to the south.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The South Road<br>If you're visiting the South Road as your final destination in the Port Llast area, it will all come together. You'll find the evidence you need to locate the cult, as well as a strange town trapped in time, some petty inter-rural romantic squabbles, a strange wizard's tower, and a haunted forest.<br>A- To the East Road<br>B- To Port Llast<br>C- To the Farmlands<br>D- Troll Bridge<br>E- Wanev's Tower: Front Entrance<br>F- Wanev's Tower: Cave Entrance<br>G- Tomb of Maegel<br>H- Bran's Cave<br><br>Bran's Cave<br>A- To South Road<br>B- Bran<br><br>Convince Bran to wear the silver charm.<br>The last of the three teenage werewolves you're hunting is located in a cave to the northeast. Like both of his friends, Bran is a 16th-level warrior. Once you've cured (or killed) him, return to Neurik for your reward and the next assignment in your werewolf-hunting career.<br><br>Tomb of Maegel<br>A- To South Road<br>B- Dying Adventurer<br>C- Well<br>D- Maegel's Burial Chamber<br><br>This tomb is completely optional. There are no quest items and no real loot to speak of. Follow the tunnels to the small locked cell. Open the door and talk to the dying adventurer. Read his book--Treatise on Forgotten Heroes--then go to the well in the south. Examine the well and swim through the underwater channel.<br><br>In Maegel's burial chamber, his ghost will awake and speak with you. He'll ask you the name of his clan, and you can answer "Mirialis" if you've read the treatise. Maegel will give you a watchman's helm for the correct answer.<br><br>Wanev's Tower<br>A- To South Road<br>B- Gong<br>C- Library<br>D- Portal to Guard Barracks<br>E- Guard Barracks<br>F- Stairs to Summoning Chamber<br><br>If you have Wanev's wardstone, his minions won't bother you.<br>To get to Wanev's Tower, you will need to cross a bridge guarded by a troll. If you have the wardstone from his cottage in Port Llast, the troll will let you pass without incident.<br><br>You can enter the tower through the cave to the southwest or through the front door. Once inside, the wardstone will ensure that the guards leave you alone. Without the wardstone, you still won't have much difficulty--most of his guards are 3rd-level bugbear fighters. If you want to avoid them, and don't have the wardstone, just ring the gong in the hallway and slip through the empty hallways as the guards run to the alarm.<br><br>Examine the glowing bookshelf in the library for the Imaskarran Tome of Ice, then go through either of the portals to the barracks. In the barracks, open the middle chest on the northern side of the room to find the Star of Calimshan for Tomi's henchman quest. Climb the stairs to the second floor.<br><br>Wanev's Summoning Chamber<br>A- Entrance<br>B- Wanev's Gem<br>C- Gulgash<br>D- Portal<br><br>Gulgash is a tough little imp.<br>Wanev will attack you. He's a 12th-level wizard, and he's resistant to fire damage. When he surrenders, he will tell you that you can have his gem (for Elaith's Serpent's Gems quest) if you'll help him out. You must stop the infestation of imps in his summoning chamber.<br><br>Enter the summoning chamber. You'll find Wanev's Gem in a chest along the north wall and Gulgash (10th-level outsider/4th-level cleric/4th-level sorcerer) in the southwestern corner. Kill Gulgash and place his heart in the portal to close it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>South Road: The Farmlands<br>The South Road winds east here, into a haunted forest that leads to Charwood. Most of your quests here are totally optional, and if you already have Relmar's journal and Vardoc's letter, the entire area is optional. There are some interesting places to visit, though--especially the mysterious village of Charwood.<br>A- To East Road<br>B- Standing Stones<br>C- To Haunted Forest<br>D- Stirge's Camp<br>E- Ingo Farm<br>F- O'Deel Farm<br>G- Silverback's Cave<br><br>The Farmlands<br>On the road leading into the haunted forest, near the standing stones, you'll find Neva--the poor little boy who supposedly disappeared with his birthday money. Strangely, Neva is actually a 4th-level fighter/4th-level rogue, and a female. Her "sister," Jaheel, and her "brother," Tarran (both 6th-level fighters), are with her, and the whole thing is yet another ambush by the cult. Search Neva's corpse for a letter.<br>The Farms<br>Inside Ingo's farm, you'll find Erik behind a locked door. He wants you to retrieve his mother's brooch from Constance O'Deel. Head south to the other farm, and she'll be easily convinced (or threatened) to give it up for some gold. She'll ask for 1,000, but you can persuade her down to 400, or even 250 if you have a high persuade skill. Return the brooch to Erik. Talk to Pete O'Deel, and he'll hire you to kill a local pack of wolves living in a cave to the south.<br><br>Constance will return Erik's brooch for a price.<br>Silverback's Cave<br>A- To South Road<br>B- Silverback<br><br>This cave is full of dire wolves. Silverback is a 15th-level dire wolf and can be found in the southeast corner of the cave. You can convince Silverback to leave the O'Deel farm alone, or you can kill him for his head. Return to Pete O'Deel and either give him the head or tell him of Silverback's promise.<br><br>Stirge's Camp<br>One of the escaped convicts is camped out to the north of the main road, near the East Road exit. Talk to him to learn all about his proud career as a baby killer, then attack him. As with his colleagues, you can let him surrender in exchange for his ear or just strike him down (he's a 12th-level bard). He has some treasure stashed away in the woods behind his camp.<br><br>The Haunted Forest<br>A- From Farmlands<br>B- To Charwood<br>C- Ruined Building<br>D- Pillar<br>E- Haunted Crypt<br><br>You can just head straight into Charwood or take a little detour here to explore a haunted crypt full of undead and loot. To enter the Haunted Crypt, explore the ruined building to the northwest. In a chest among the rubble, you'll find an old scroll with three words that stand out: "NETHER SHALL RULE."<br><br>Examine the pillar to the southeast. If you've read the scroll, you can press the runes in the correct order. This will open a portal to the unreachable area in the southeast corner. Enter the crypt.<br><br></div>

He'll say some cryptic things about the dead, the children, and his brother, Karlat. Inside the gates, you'll find everyone is just as confused and confusing. In the mayor's office, talk to Mayor Mobley. He is a bit more coherent, but he isn't much help. Still, his defensive nature should tell you that something is strange in Castle Jhareg.<br><br>Before entering the castle, visit the inn to the north. Inside you'll find a strange man (7th-level sorcerer) who seems to have been affected by too much time in this city. If you can make some persuasion checks, you'll learn that he is a member of the cult. Either way, he'll eventually attack you.

The key will open one of the doors, and the "correct" door is the center one. The side passages are filled with creatures, while the center corridor is straight and safe to the north end of the floor.<br><br>In the northern room you'll meet the guardian, who will address you as "judge" and give you the key that unlocks the brothers' chambers. You must return with an oath from each brother and determine who is at fault for Charwood's strange situation.<br><br></div>

But you don't have the full story. To get the full story, find Karlat's Burning Wand (in the chest with his key), the Protection Wand, and a fire beetle's belly (in the northeast storage room). Go to the summoning room and use the Protection Wand to cast Protection from Alignment on yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'>Luskan<br>The city is sealed for good reason. Wererats and thugs fight it out in the street as two warring high captains fight for control. Walking the streets here can be dangerous. Your first order of business will be talking with Aarin Gend at the temple (just use the stone of recall for a quick trip). The cult seems to be based out of a tower in the northwest, and he needs a high captain's seal to forge your entry documents.<br>A- From North Road<br>B- The Wink and Tickle<br>C- Temple of Tyr<br>D- The Cutlass Inn<br>E- To Baram's Sewers<br>F- Crack in Wall (to Docks)<br>G- Ruined Tower (to Harbor Sewers)<br>H- Garlone's House<br>I- To Sewers<br>J- Lady Jadale's Estate<br>K- Colmarr's Fantabulous Contraptions and Magical Errata<br>L- Smithy<br>M- Mercantile Shop<br>N- Shady Character<br>O- To Host Tower<br><br>The Wink and Tickle<br>Your first stop should be this brothel near the main gates. Talk to Bela about the city's problems, then head upstairs, where three quests can be started. First, speak with Erb. The halfling wants his ring back from Lady Jadale before her husband returns. Next, speak with Yvette (you'll have to open some doors to speak with the working ladies). She'll ask you to help her rescue her baby, taken by Garlone who lives in the slums.<br>As Bela told you, one of the courtesans will give you some information on the captains. If you're female, speak with Oreth. Males should visit Rhaine. They will give you the keys to Kurth's and Baram's compounds if you agree to kill them.<br><br>Aarin welcomes you to Luskan with bad news.<br>Garlone's House<br>You won't have much trouble convincing Garlone to give you Yvette's baby--you just need to show him some coin. He'll want 1000 gold but will take 250 if you threaten him. Make sure you check your inventory to see the baby nestled among the potions, rings, and books.<br><br>Lady Jadale's Estate<br>Lady Jadale doesn't want to give up Erb's ring. Erb loves her, and she knows it. Appeal to her love of Erb--tell her that he wants the ring back so that her husband won't hurt him. She'll relent and hand it over. Alternately, you can lie to her about the legality of the ring, or you can just buy it from her for 1000 gold or talk her down to 400 or 250, depending on your persuasion skill.<br><br>The Cutlass Inn<br>Two rescue missions await you here. Baram has kidnapped Londa's nine children, and she wants them back. Elynwyd has also lost a loved one--his sister Evaine has been taken by Kurth, and he'll give you his signet ring so that she'll trust you.<br><br>You'll need to buy Yvette's baby from Garlone.<br>Equipment<br>There are a few places to buy stuff. There's the Priest of Tyr at the temple, a shady character at the northern wall, and a smithy and general merchant in the city center.<br><br>Colmarr's Fantabulous Contraptions and Magical Errata sells a variety of good equipment. It's run by a gnome inventor. He's developed a machine that turns sewage into potions, but it's broken. Find the three missing levers and fix the machine, and you can use it. The Lever of Stone can be found in a chest on the first floor of the Wink and Tickle, the Lever of Wind is in a chest in the sewers, and the Lever of Water will be given to you by the outcast ghoul in the sewers.<br><br></div>

Speak to the ghoul, and he'll ask you to kill a ghoul lord (10th-level wizard/5th-level undead) to the east and return his Amulet of Power.

He will offer you 1,000 gold and some magical items for Kurth's head. (If you enter from Luskan, you will not have this exchange.) If you go through the gate behind him, the deal is off and his guards will attack.

This will put a halt to the undead production, but you'll then have to fight a 5th-level Yuan-Ti conjurer and a 5th-level Yuan-Ti necromancer near the generator.<br><br>Before facing Baram himself, visit the spider's lair, kill the vermin, and search the cocoons. You'll uncover Londa's nanny, who will tell you the children have all been murdered and give you a teddy bear for Londa. When you return to Londa, you should consider lying to her. Tell her they've been shipped to orphanages to save her feelings and to ensure you get her treasure key, which opens her husband's vault in the sewers.<br><br>Finally, it's time to kill Baram (12th-level rogue/8th-level ranger) and his attendant Priestess of Mask (6th-level cleric). Baram's morningstar does 1d6 fire damage, and he wears a Ring of Elemental Resistance. The priestess gets her power from the two gargoyles behind her, but she's not too tough even if you don't destroy them. Once Baram is dead, grab his high captain's seal from the chest behind him, as well as his head if you want the reward from Kurth.<br><br></div>

Heal Zed, and he'll tell you that Griff drugged Rolgan during the card game. Lodar will tell you the same thing if you buy him enough drinks.

Free the fairy, and it will show you the pattern. There are eight notes in all and four gongs.

Look in the Pool of Swirling Color and take the gems. Next, look in the Pool of Primary Colors. Press any of the gems. Look in the other Pool of Primary Colors, and press another gem. Now, you must place the appropriate gem in each of the Pools of Secondary Colors. The appropriate gem is whatever color would be created by mixing the colors you chose in the Pools of Primary Colors. So if you pushed blue and red, place the purple gems in the Pools of Secondary Colors. If you pushed blue and yellow, place the green gems. If you pressed red and yellow, place the orange gems.<br><br>A powerful Balor guards the Word of Power.<br>The Word of Power<br>In the southernmost room in the ruins, you'll find an altar.

Kill the giants to help the outnumbered tribesmen.<br><br>Obould Many-Arrows' Cave<br>A- To Moonwood<br>B- Dire Boar Pen<br>C- Drow<br>D- Obould<br><br>You'll encounter Drow here, which may strike you as peculiar. Seems evil forces from all over are coming to help Maugrim destroy Neverwinter. In the central cave, you'll find Obould himself. He's a 5th-level barbarian/8th-level fighter, and like his fellow orcs, he'll offer you another head and some gold if you let him go. The decision is yours.<br><br>Moonwood: Akulatraxas<br>A- To Moonwood: Entrance<br>B- Akulatraxas' Cave<br>C- Hill Giant Lair<br>D- To Spine of the World<br><br>Akulatraxas will pay you for some Hill Giant bounty hunting.<br>In the center of this Hill Giant-infested region, you'll find the cave of a green dragon named Akulatraxas. She'll offer you a job if you play your cards right: Infiltrate the Hill Giant Lair and bring her the head of the Hill Giant chieftain. Accept the gig, leave the cave, then enter the Hill Giant Lair to the west.<br><br>Hill Giant Lair: Level One<br>A- To Moonwood: Akulatraxas<br>B- To Hill Giant Lair: Level Two<br><br>This level is nothing but fightin' giants.
