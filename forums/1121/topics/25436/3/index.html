Use cold weapons if you have them, then search his body for an intriguing letter. On the western side of the cave, you'll find two imprisoned Golden Eagle tribesmen, whom you can free for a bit of experience. The chieftain (13th-level giant/6th-level barbarian) is in the southwestern cavern. Kill him, and return his head to Akulatraxas.<br><br>Spine of the World<br>A- To Moonwood: Akulatraxas<br>B- Cultist Attack<br>C- Dead Dragon's Cave<br>D- Gorgotha's Cave<br>E- Fire Giant Lair<br><br>When you enter the final section of Moonwood, cultists will attack you once again. And, once again, you should take the cultist's journal from the body of the leader. To the west, you'll find the cave of a dead dragon, obviously attacked by the nearby dead Fire Giants. Search the rubble for Boddyknock's dragon scale, and search the corpse for the Tome of the Ring.<br><br>Gorgotha, the Gold Dragon.<br>The next cave is home to Gorgotha, who wants you to stop the Fire Giants' attempts to steal her eggs. More specifically, she wants you to kill Klauth, the powerful red dragon who has moved in with the Fire Giants to the north.<br><br>Fire Giant Lair: Level One<br>A- To Spine of the World<br>B- Fire Giant Champion<br>C- Wogar<br>D- Brunhilda's Room<br>E- To Fire Giant Lair: Level Two<br>F- To Fire Giant Lair: Level Three<br><br>In the room directly west of the entrance, you'll find a Fire Giant champion (11th-level giant/7th-level barbarian). There are Fire Giants everywhere in this lair, and you'll also encounter some fairly difficult Duergar. Get your cold damage ready for the former and everything you've got for the latter.<br><br>Cone of Cold cuts through Fire Giants like a knife through butter.<br>Make your way to the locked cell in the northwest. Free Wogar by pulling the lever near his cell. He'll tell you about Klauth's plan. In the northernmost room, you'll find Brunhilda's diary, the account of her unfortunate marriage to Skrogg, king of the Fire Giants. If you want to rack up some experience, head down to the second level. If you just want to get out of here, head down to the third level.<br><br></div>

There's a pair of prisoners in the northwestern room, but they'll turn into weak Yuan-Ti spellcasters and attack.

You'll want to throw everything you have at him--preferably something cold. There are three lairs to the east. The northernmost of these leads down to a horde of slaads. Go here only if you want to milk every last drop of experience out of this chapter. You may as well--the chapter is about to end.<br><br>In the Blue Dragon's Chamber, you'll find a dragon sphere in a pool, along with a book about Klauth's ritual. Interesting reading! If you want to kill Klauth more easily, kill the blue dragon, then put the dragon sphere on the pedestal to create a Dead Dragon Sphere.<br><br>Klauth is one of the strongest opponents in the game.<br>In Klauth's Lair, he will make a deal with you: Bring him dragon eggs, and he will give you the Word of Power. Your other option? Kill him. You can get eggs from Akulatraxas or Gorgotha, but you're already here, right? Give him the Dead Dragon Sphere, and he'll be severely weakened. You'll still want to throw everything you have at him--summon everything and use every enhancement spell you have before giving him the sphere. When Klauth is dead, take the Word of Power.<br><br>Take Klauth's head to Gorgotha, and take the final Word of Power to Aarin. Before you give it to him, finish up any secondary quests, pick your favorite henchman, and say good-bye to the others.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Four<br><br>Neverwinter<br>You've returned to Neverwinter, and it's time to prepare for the final showdown. Make that "showdowns." This chapter is brief but challenging. Start by talking with Nasher and Aarin. Head down to the dungeon and talk with Haedraline, then go down into the cavern and examine the Source Stone, if you're interested in seeing it.<br>Neverwinter<br>A- Castle Never<br>B- To War Zone<br>C- Hall of Justice<br>D- Trade of Blades<br>E- Moonstone Maske<br>F- Shining Knight Arms and Armor<br>G- Many-Starred Cloak Guild<br><br>Shopping<br>If you need supplies, Eltoora at the Many-Starred Cloak Guild is open for business, as is Shining Knight Arms and Armor.<br><br>Entering the War Zone.<br>Secondary Quests<br>There are only two secondary quests in this chapter. Luce in the Moonstone Mask will ask you to rescue her sister, Leesa, who got lost somewhere in the War Zone. Trancar in the Trade of Blades will ask you to put an end to two of the biggest threats to Neverwinter: the siege weapons and the invincible golems in the War Zone. Seems like everyone is telling you something: Head into the War Zone.<br><br>The War Zone<br>A- To Neverwinter<br>B- Wizards' Chantries<br>C- Catapults<br>D- Leesa<br>E- Secret Passage<br>F- House<br>G- Portal to Maugrim's<br><br>Kill the Luskan wizards to remove the golems from the streets.<br>As Trancar warned you, the golems really are invincible. Quickly get to the first Wizard's Chantry. Inside, you'll fight a 16th-level Luskan wizard and a 13th-level Balor lord. When the wizard is dead, the golem will collapse. Next, take out the catapults. As in Fort Ilkard, you need to kill the catapult commanders, then use the catapults to destroy them. Once the north section of the city is clear, find Leesa in the northwest alley and lead her to the gate.<br><br>You can get to the southern section of the War Zone by destroying the gate or by going through the secret passage in the old man's home. Enter the second Wizard's Chantry, where you will face the same duo from the first. Now that the streets of the War Zone are safe, it's time to go after the bigger game.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maugrim's Sanctuary<br>A- To War Zone<br>B- Aribeth<br>C- Maugrim<br>D- The Fourth Word of Power<br><br>Aribeth is very powerful. She's a 20th-level paladin/18th-level cleric. She has a devastating assortment of spells and is immune to critical hits, death magic, fear, paralysis, and mind-affecting spells. If that weren't enough, her sword has vampiric regeneration and does additional damage against good-aligned players. The good news? She'll eventually surrender. When she does, you may be able to convince her to return to Nasher. If you have her ring it will help, but you can still persuade her to do so. If you don't, you'll have to finish her off.<br><br>The fallen Aribeth.<br>Maugrim is an 8th-level cleric/20th-level wizard, and he has two servants of flesh (19th-level constructs) at his side. Get in close and start hammering away--he has very little in the way of protection from melee, so the battle should be slightly easier than the previous one, at least once the servants of flesh are out of the way. When Maugrim is dead, grab the fourth Word of Power and return to Castle Never.<br><br>The Source Stone<br>In Castle Never, return to the dungeon and talk to Haedraline. She will tell you that you need to enter the Source Stone and kill Morag. Descend to the caverns, place the fourth Word of Power in the empty altar, then enter the Source Stone.<br><br>The Source Stone: Sanctuary<br>A- To Castle Never<br>B- Asheera<br>C- To Source Stone: Guardian Lair<br><br>In the first tunnel, you will meet Asheera, a strange woman who resembles Aribeth. Asheera will give you her amulet, which gives you an armor class bonus of +5 versus reptilian monsters, 50% immunity to electrical and fire damage, and a spell resistance bonus of 18. Unfortunately, as of v1.19, the item has a level requirement of 26 so you won't be able to equip it. This is a shame, because you'll face a small army of Old Ones in the Sanctuary. When you reach the center of the caverns, rest up, then use the portal to reach the Guardian Lair.<br><br>The Source Stone: Guardian Lair<br>A- To Source Stone: Sanctuary<br>B- Guardian Dragons<br>C- To Source Stone: Inner Sanctum<br><br>The final battle.<br>Not one but two dragons await you: a 26th-level corrupted copper dragon and a 28th-level corrupted silver dragon. They will both attack at once. Stay near the portal to the sanctuary if you can't take them simultaneously and do hit-and-run tactics. Once they are dead, pick up both guardian keys and unlock the gates to the north. Before you step in the final portal, rest up and save your game. There's no turning back (or resting) once you enter the inner sanctum.<br><br>The Source Stone: Inner Sanctum<br>A- From Source Stone: Guardian Lair<br>B- Morag's Chosen<br>C- Morag<br><br>The first room contains four of Morag's chosen (15th-level fighters/5th-level humanoids) and an Old One cleric (15th level). Though this is a tough fight, save your most powerful spells and attacks for the room ahead. When you reach the final cavern, you will face Morag (19th-level wizard). She's immune to pretty much everything, but she won't be if you take out her protectors. There are eight of them, protected by a permanent wall of blades, but ranged attacks will kill them easily. Once they are dead, attack Morag with everything you have, ignoring the minions she summons in. Once she dies, escape to the portal. And enjoy your victory.<br><br></div>
