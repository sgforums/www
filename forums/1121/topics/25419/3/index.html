            <div class='col-md body'>16. The Finale<br>Your destiny is within reach. All that remains is your confrontation with Balthazar and overcoming the fifth and final challenge, before you'll be able to face your final enemy and your fate.<br><br>Balthazar<br><br>As you leave Abizagal's lair, you'll encounter Elminster, who will give you some straightforward advice concerning how to get into Balthazar's fortress. When you arrive at Amkethran, all the mercenaries will be after you, so stay off the main avenues and away from the mercenary camp, where they'll constantly appear, or cast mass invisibility or invisibility 10-foot radius to avoid battles altogether. Go to Saemon Havarian in the smuggler's cave, and he'll give you two options for getting into Balthazar's fortress. Either come with him in disguise or go through the graveyard with the key you can get from a visitor.<br><br>If you elect to go in disguise, Saemon Havarian will set you up, but give you a fighting chance by pitting you against two fighters (15,000 experience points each), a monk (23,000 experience points), and two mages (20,000 experience points each). All are very high level, so don't spare any firepower and try to get a fighter to take out the mages quickly (your own spellcasters must breach the protection from magic missiles cast and use true sight to avoid being deceived by mislead).<br><br>The other--and better--way into the fortress is by going through the graveyard after getting the key from Faheed and Majira, two NPCs who are in the house just west of Marlowe's house on top of the hill. Once you get the key, you can open the remaining door in the graveyard, and it'll lead you directly into Balthazar's lair, sparing you the fight outside the compound.<br><br>Once within Balthazar's fortress, you'll face a confrontation with him almost immediately. He has four companion monks, who aren't threatening, but Balthazar (280 hit points, fists act as +4 weapons, regenerates six hit points/second, +3 weapons or better to hit) is a deadly melee opponent. Balthazar has all kinds of crazy moves (solar stance: fireball explodes from his body and blows away enemies; lunar stance: adds twenty hit points, immune to time stop, level drain, disintegrate, and casts magic missile on nearest spell-caster; dragon fist strike: stun opponents unless save vs. paralyzation is made; tiger strike: knocks back opponents), which he often announces in advance, including the deadly quivering palm attack. He can also completely heal himself if you let him get a spare moment, so stay on top of him and use your greater whirlwind and critical strike abilities. For killing Balthazar, you'll get 40,000 experience points per party member, followed by another visit from the Solar, which will earn you 10,000 experience points per party member.<br><br>Mad monk. Balthazar and his monk friends can instantly kill your party members with quivering palm attacks, but all you have to do is take out Balthazar and his companions will scatter. Stay in close contact with Balthazar or you'll allow him to get his "second wind" and heal himself completely.<br>NPCs in this sector:<br><br>Elminster<br><br>Saemon Havarian<br>Enemies in this sector:<br><br>Balthazar<br><br>Fighters<br><br>Mages<br><br>Mercenaries<br><br>Monks<br>Magic items in this sector:<br><br>On Balthazar's guards:<br>Chain mail +2<br>Long sword +1<br>The Fifth Challenge - The Ravager<br><br>The Ravager is easily the toughest of the five challenges. In addition to having a huge number of hit points, the Ravager is very resistant to physical damage. To make matters worse, he'll constantly summon a half dozen flying swords (bone blades) to beat up on your party, and it can knock your party members unconscious with its attacks. Fortunately, being a creature of pure evil, the Ravager is very vulnerable to holy smite, so have your priests cast the spell constantly to wear it down more quickly than you can in melee combat alone. Ignore the bone blades entirely, since they'll keep respawning, although if you want to buy some time for your fighters, use comet or dragon breath spells to temporarily give your fighters some room. Spells like Bigby's crushing hand work well against the Ravager as well. You'll gain 50,000 experience points for killing the Ravager, along with 25,000 experience points per party member (30,000 experience points for your main character), for completing the battle.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Melissan<br>When you're ready to confront your destiny, leave the pocket plane and confront Melissan. Reorganize your memorized spells so that you have the best spells prepared for the final confrontation, which will consist of seven successive battles. You probably should have some resurrection (mass raise dead or raise dead) spells ready as well, since you want to ensure that you can keep a full party when you go through each battle. Make sure you have several haste spells memorized, since it's a good spell to consistently cast as well as duplicates of your favorite defensive and offensive spells, such as stoneskin, call upon holy might, breach, pierce magic, and holy smite.<br><br>The first battle will be with Melissan herself (250 hit points, AC -8, five attacks per round, 90% magic resistance), and she'll summon in demons to assist her. You must fight Melissan several times, and every time you defeat her, all her summoned creatures will disappear, so generally ignore them and concentrate on inflicting damage on her. You must act quickly, or you'll gradually be overrun by her summoned servants. Keep using your spellcasters to bring down Melissan's spell defenses by casting pierce magic and breach spells or by using wands of spellstriking to achieve the same result.<br><br>When Melissan is defeated, you'll have an opportunity to recover, even though the sequence of events you just witnessed will suggest that you must hurry. Take your time, raise any dead characters, and make sure you fully heal before starting the next battle (although you can't rememorize your spells).<br><br>Your fight will be with an air elemental prince, Van-C-Bin (56,000 experience points) and a couple of greater air elemental minions and vampiric wraiths. The wraiths can be easily destroyed by a cleric turning undead, and neither the prince or his elemental lackeys is tough either. You might want to send in a low-level summoned monster first, since the prince will caste a whirlwind spell on the first set of opponents encountered. As soon as you defeat the group, recast healing and defensive spells as necessary, then turn the fountain off for Melissan, which will bring another confrontation.<br><br>The second fight with Melissan will be very similar to the first one, so ensure that you're equally protected before initiating it. She'll once again flee, giving you another chance to recover by casting healing and using potions, and you must fight another elemental prince, Cryonax, prince of ice (56,000 experience points), along with a couple of minions (frost salamanders, blizzard trolls). They're also relatively easy melee opponents, although you'll take some damage from the cold aura of the Prince's frost salamander guards. When you're ready to fight Melissan again, turn off the energy fountain and do so.<br><br>Melissan will flee a third time and leave you to confront a fallen solar (32,000 experience points) and some demon minions (alu-fiend, marilith, succubus). The solar is a pretty tough opponent and can withstand the combined attacks of your party members. In preparation for the final assault on Melissan, summon some creatures back toward the area where she appears, including a deva or plantar as well as a juggernaut golem. Melissan will summon hive mother beholders and other dangerous creatures that can be devastating if ignored, so move a summoned creature in to engage them, even if the creature can't reasonably harm the beholder. Keep Melissan's defenses down and use greater whirlwind and critical strike attacks whenever you can as well as any helpful potions. Have your cleric cast mass healing if necessary to keep your fighters engaged with Melissan. You don't want to leave her any space to recover or cast additional spells at you. When she finally goes down, you'll have the opportunity to seize control of your destiny.<br><br>What will you decide?<br><br>Desslock<br><br>Swarm the god. A few rounds of greater whirlwind attacks and Melissan will go down pretty easily. Summon planar beings to aid, and have your spell-casters cast breach and pierce spells to lower Melissan's defenses.<br>NPCs in this sector:<br><br>Melissan<br>Enemies in this sector:<br><br>Beholders (hive mother)<br><br>Demons (various types summoned by Melissan and accompanying the fallen solar)<br><br>Elementals (Cryonax, greater air elementals, Van-C-Bin)<br><br>Melissan<br><br>Salamander (Frost)<br><br>Solar (fallen)<br><br>Troll (blizzard)<br><br>Wraith (vampiric)<br></div>
