            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter 1: Reforming the Party<br>It's tempting to keep your party of adventurers intact when traveling into the new Throne of Bhaal areas. After all, it's difficult to conceive of abandoning Minsc and his miniature giant space hamster behind when they've been your loyal companions since your party began its adventures through the Sword Coast of Faerun. But it's not always prudent to value historical companionship over immediate needs. A party of characters that was effective in Baldur's Gate II may not be as adept in Throne of Bhaal because of the different nature of the challenges you'll face in the new expansion. You must choose your companions wisely to survive the toughest battles in the expansion. First, however, you have an even more rudimentary decision to make...<br><br>Preparing the Main Character<br><br>Since you've already played Shadows of Amn, your main character should already be ready to go. You're definitely better off continuing or importing a Baldur's Gate II saved game than starting a new game for the expansion pack, since you'll start off with better equipment and have a more experienced party. While your party will come equipped with some powerful magic items even if you start a new game for the expansion pack areas (as detailed further along in this guide), you won't have access to some of the best items in the game, such as the Carsomyr holy avenger sword, and you can't romance your companions. In Baldur's Gate II, it was possible for your character to become amorous with Jaheira, Viconia, Aerie, or Anomen, and you can only advance relationships that you sparked in the original game. If you didn't get to first base in the original game, you're going to be a lonely demigod through the expansion pack.<br><br>For those reasons, most players should continue the adventures of the characters they previously generated for Shadows of Amn or the original Baldur's Gate. However, if you were disappointed with your character or would like to try a character of the opposite alignment, or you just no longer have access to your saved games, you should consider the information in the following sections.<br><br>Starting Magic Items<br><br>All new characters start out with some formidable magic equipment, but the exact equipment a character receives depends upon character class and whether or not you imported one of the four pre-generated expansion pack characters (a generic fighter, mage, cleric, or thief are available). The following chart details the magic items that will be available to new characters:<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Alignment and Reputation<br>As in the original game, throughout the expansion pack, it's possible to play as an evil character, a good character, or a complex character of mixed motivations. Gameplay is more linear, however, with fewer branching plot developments, so character alignment is less relevant in the expansion pack than in the original game. While there may be fewer opportunities to role-play different characters, it's now easier to manage a party of characters with differing alignments, so don't hesitate to pair cynical and evil Viconia with good and name Aerie if you want some entertaining banter. Alignment is now less of a consideration when designing your main character and choosing your companions. Similarly, while there are still quests that will increase or lower your reputation, you won't gain or be denied any meaningful gameplay based upon your reputation score. If it matters to you at all, you can always raise your party's reputation by donating at a temple or lower it by getting medieval on the local peasants.<br><br>If you had a character of good alignment in the original game and discover that the character's alignment has changed to evil when you start the expansion pack, the change in moral aptitude was caused by certain choices you made at the end of the original game. For example, if you elected to keep blackrazor, accept the nymph coat, sacrifice a member of your party, or kill the non-evil dragon or Sarevok in anger, you'll find that your main character has changed alignment. To regain your good alignment, you must either replay that section of the original game or just import the character, instead of the saved game, into the new expansion pack territories. Importing just the character will prevent you from continuing a romantic relationship with a companion, however, and you also won't retain all the items you acquired during the course of the game.<br><br>Experience Levels and the New High-level Abilities<br><br>Devas are powerful allies, as the slain dragon behind this one found out. Summon deva is one of the best high-level abilities a paladin can choose. Greater whirlwind, hardiness and critical strike are other good abilities for fighter classes.<br>The experience point cap in the expansion pack is high enough that it isn't meaningful for most players, so you don't need to factor in the cap when determining your character class. The number of available experience points is still relevant when deciding whether or not to dual-class your characters, however, since you want to ensure that you can gain enough experience points in your new class to gain a level higher than your old class. Dual-classed characters are the most powerful characters in the game, but it's risky to wait to dual class a character in the expansion pack, since you'll temporarily be stuck with a weakened character and won't gain access to your old abilities until very late in the game. The great advantage of characters that have already dual-classed, such as your companion Imoen, is that they can have some decent abilities in their original class and still attain all the high-level abilities of their new class. Sarevok is one of the best companions to dual-class, either to a thief or a mage, but you should do so immediately. You can only gain about 3.5 million experience points in the expansion pack, and you'll want to ensure that you get your old abilities back in time to use them during the tougher parts of the expansion pack.<br><br>Multiclass characters cannot attain all the high-level abilities of their different classes, although they can become quite powerful. Normally, multiclassed mages can just barely start casting ninth-level mage spells near the end of the expansion pack, so you shouldn't rely on one as your primary caster. They can, however, be strong supporting casters, assisting in a variety of roles. Multiclass characters gain access to the new high-level abilities earlier than single- or dual-classed characters. While the game's manual details the experience levels at which single- and dual-classed characters start acquiring the new high-level abilities, multiclassed characters will actually start gaining the new abilities at the following experience levels:<br><br>Character Class<br>Experience Level at Which High-level Abilities Become Available:<br><br>Fighters<br>14th (12th if the character has three classes)<br><br>Clerics<br>15th (13th if the character has three classes)<br><br>Druids<br>14th<br><br>Mages<br>14th (13th if the character has three classes)<br><br>Thieves<br>17th (15th if the character has three classes)<br><br>Rangers<br>13th<br><br>The game's manual also doesn't disclose that paladins can choose the powerful summon deva special ability and cast it once per day (for each time the paladin has selected the skill when gaining an experience level).<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Choosing Your Companions<br>All the available companions are immediately accessible at the start of the expansion pack, but there's a number of factors you should consider when assembling your party. While you can switch companions during the course of the expansion pack, they'll never start with more than their initial number of experience points (2.5 million for new characters), making it less and less viable to switch companions as you progress into the game because the substitutes will be increasingly underpowered.<br><br>The Importance of Certain Companions and Classes<br><br>If you initiated a romance in the original game and want to continue it, you'll naturally have to add your mate to the party. It's also more important to have strong melee fighters in your party than it was in the original game. Since most enemies in the expansion pack are strongly resistant to magic, you must have a number of characters in your party who can deliver devastating physical attacks. The ability to wear armor is less important than the ability to mete out melee damage.<br><br>In fact, armor class is almost irrelevant in the expansion pack, since most of the enemies you'll meet will be equipped with magical weapons or be high enough in level to easily hit even the most heavily armored character. You'll have great problems getting through the expansion pack, however, without having at least three fighter-class characters (fighter, paladin, or ranger) and one other character that is at least a decent hand-to-hand fighter (a cleric or a well-equipped druid or thief). Mages can rout a battle in seconds, but you must consistently rely upon your fighters to bludgeon opponents.<br><br>You also need at least one, and preferably two, characters capable of casting mage spells. Even if one of those characters is a multiclassed character or a bard and therefore can't cast the most powerful mage spells, you must have party members that can cast breach and pierce magic spells (or use wands of spell-striking) to handle the high-level enemy mages you'll frequently encounter.<br><br>You'll also need at least one cleric or druid for access to healing spells, although there are plenty of potions of healing available for purchase or that can be acquired as booty from your fallen opponents. While many players rely on clerics and druids primarily for their healing spells, both character classes have useful offensive capabilities in the expansion pack. Druids can summon elemental princes, which are incredibly powerful allies, as well as cast insect swarm spells to confound enemy spell-casters. Clerics have access to holy smite, one of the best spells in the game, in addition to a variety of useful summoning spells and can instantly destroy some of the powerful undead creatures you'll meet in the game.<br><br>Thieves are surprisingly badly represented among your available companions. Only three possible companions have thief abilities: Jan, Imoen, and Nalia. Nalia's skills are too limited to be relied upon without magical assistance, and Imoen's aren't significantly better. Jan is the only companion that can gain additional thieving skills and yet, as a multiclassed character, Jan will never be as formidable a spellcaster as Imoen or Nalia. Of those three, unless your main character has thieving abilities, Imoen is the best choice, since her abilities will be sufficient with a little magical assistance. Since you should have plenty of characters with second-level priest spells, you can consistently cast find traps and use Imoen to disarm them with her skills supplemented by potions of perception if needed. While you need a character with at least rudimentary thieving skills, and thieves can be very powerful with their new ability to set enhanced traps, they are probably the least necessary character class for the expansion pack.<br><br></div>

If your main character is a mage or sorcerer, you should probably replace Aerie with another fighter such as Valygar or Mazzy or a druid such as Jaheira or Cernd.<br><br>Keldorn is arguably the most valuable companion to a good-aligned party, since he can wield either of the powerful holy avenger swords and cast true sight and dispel magic, both of which are necessary incantations when facing mages. Anomen can use his high-level undead turning ability and cast priest skills; plus, he is also a capable melee combatant, especially when equipped with the flail of ages or other powerful artifacts imported from the original game. Imoen is a strong mage and possesses the basic thievery skills you need, while Aerie can provide both supporting mage and priest spells. If you equip Mazzy with one of the girdles of giant strength or another item capable of raising her strength, she can be more effective in combat than Minsc or Valygar because of her ability to specialize in weapons and the additional number of attacks she gets. Minsc is always good for a laugh, however, especially when grouped with Jan.<br><br>Evil aligned parties will definitely not want to pass up on Sarevok because of his tremendous attributes, although he won't supply much banter during the course of the game. Edwin, Korgan, and Viconia are all capable characters in their respective classes. Your best evil party will likely consist of Sarevok, Korgan, Edwin, and Viconia, supplemented by Jan or Haer'Dalis if your main character is a capable fighter, cleric, or thief or by Jaheira or Cernd if your main character is a mage.<br><br>Generating Your Own Companions<br><br>While the non-player character companions have developed backgrounds and add context or humor to many encounters, you can create a more powerful party by generating your own companions. To do so, just start a multiplayer game and assign all the permissions to yourself. You must bounce through an additional interface screen every time you load a game, but you can generate characters with higher attributes and more complementary character classes. The NPC interactions are one of the game's best features, however, so you'll be sacrificing some entertainment in exchange for a more formidable party. Then again, Throne of Bhaal is all about making difficult choices.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter 2: General Gameplay Tips and Strategies<br>Learning how to be effective in battles is the biggest challenge you'll face in Throne of Bhaal. This section of the guide primarily focuses on ensuring that you know all of the important combat tactics and spell-casting techniques and the capabilities of your opponents, in addition to explaining some of the less intuitive elements of the game.<br><br>Combat and Spell-casting Tips<br><br>As you'd expect from a game about battling demigods, giants, and dragons, some of the battles in Throne of Bhaal are incredibly difficult, especially at higher skill levels. Even though combat is more challenging in the expansion pack than in any previous Baldur's Gate game engine, most battles are manageable if you've prepared defensive spells in advance and have at least rudimentary knowledge of the capabilities of your opponents. The walk-through section of this guide contains specific instructions for overcoming each encounter, but this section contains some general combat and spellcasting tips.<br><br>The Importance of Sequencers and Contingencies<br><br>Sequencers and contingencies are your most effective tools for quickly dispatching dangerous opponents and defending your spellcasters. Sequencers and contingencies can't be interrupted, and they occur almost instantaneously, letting you get in decisive early attacks and automatically erect defenses when threatened.<br><br>Contingencies generally work best as defensive tools, although a chain contingency can also be a deadly offensive weapon. All your mages should have a contingency active whenever possible. A good spell to use as a basic contingency is stoneskin, set to activate when your mage is down to 50 percent of his hit points, since it ensures that you instantly acquire a defense capable of absorbing enough additional blows to let that character escape or mount a counterattack. Chain contingencies can help mages establish a very effective defense by combining spells such as stoneskin, mislead, improved mantle, spell turning, and spell deflection. If you anticipate fighting strong melee opponents, you can combine stoneskin, mislead, and improved mantle to mount a defense that will buy you a lot of time. If you expect to be engaging in a dual with another mage, you can substitute improved mantle for spell turning or deflection. Chain contingency can also be an effective offensive spell, since you can automatically set off three devastating spells of Abi-Dalzim's horrid wilting or a combination of Bigby's clenched fist, disintegrate, chain lightning, or finger of death. The main problem with trying to use a chain contingency as an offensive weapon is that it's too easy to waste it by setting it off accidentally against a weak opponent, since you can't directly trigger it.<br><br>Spell triggers, spell sequencers, and minor sequencers are your best weapons for taking out enemy spellcasters, so you should have them all active whenever possible. Minor sequencer only lets you prepare up to second-level spells, but two sequenced magic missile spells are capable of meting out decent damage to an unprepared spellcaster. In fact, even though you can group higher-level spells in a spell sequencer, three magic missiles are frequently the most effective spells to group. Often, you can take out a formidable mage almost instantly by having two party members launch spell-sequenced magic missiles before the enemy mage can raise any defenses. Lightning bolt is another good spell to use in either a spell sequencer or spell trigger, although the latter spell can also link three of the more powerful chain lightning spells together.<br><br>Sneak attack. A group of sequenced magic missiles can be extremely effective at eliminating enemy mages before they can raise defenses.<br>Another use of a spell trigger is to devastate the defenses of an enemy mage or creature that is strongly resistant to magic. If you want to make a monster more susceptible to spells, use a spell trigger to instantly cast three lower resistance spells. Enemy mages will immediately be made vulnerable by a trigger that launches pierce shield, breach, and power word silence. Use contingencies and sequencers constantly and, when you don't have any remaining, don't hesitate to retreat back to your pocket plane to rest and restore them.<br><br>Battling Mages<br><br>Mages and spellcasting monsters remain your most deadly opponents. If you can't take down their defenses quickly, they can often reduce your party to shambles relatively quickly. Always ensure that your party can cast pierce magic or shield, breach, and true sight to dispel the defenses that make mages invulnerable to your fighters. Since wands of spellstriking grant you the ability to cast breach and pierce magic, acquire them whenever possible and put them to good use. Make sure you can adequately defend your key party members from the offensive spells frequently cast by enemy mages and monsters; the following information will help you.<br><br>For every defensive spell, there is at least one counterspell. Defenses will usually be set by triggers or contingencies which prevents them from being disrupted, so always make sure you can cast an appropriate counterspell. The following charts set out the defensive and offensive spells that mages and spellcasting monsters frequently rely upon and the appropriate counterspell or spells to use in response.<br><br>Defensive Spell<br>Used By<br>Counterspells<br><br>Absolute immunity<br>Infrequently used by high-level mages<br>Breach<br><br>Globe of invulnerability<br>Commonly used by mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, dispel magic<br><br>Improved mantle<br>Commonly used by high-level mages<br>Breach<br><br>Improved invisibility<br>Infrequently used by mages and creatures<br>True sight, detect invisibility, invisibility purge, glitterdust<br><br>Invisibility<br>Infrequently used by mages, wraiths, and certain high-level monsters; commonly used by thieves and assassins<br>True sight, detect invisibility, detect illusion, invisibility purge, glitterdust<br><br>Mantle<br>Commonly used by high-level mages<br>Breach<br><br>Minor globe of invulnerability<br>Very infrequently used by mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, secret word, dispel magic, spell thrust<br><br>Minor spell deflection<br>Very infrequently used by mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, spell thrust<br><br>Minor spell turning<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, secret word, spell thrust<br><br>Mislead, project image<br>Commonly used by all mages<br>True sight, dispel magic<br><br>Non-detection<br>Commonly used by thieves and assassins when combined with invisibility<br>True sight, detect illusion<br><br>Protection from energy, magic energy, elements, magic weapons, or other "protection from" spells<br>Commonly used by mages and creatures<br>Breach<br><br>Reflected image, mirror image<br>Commonly used by mages<br>True sight, detect illusion, dispel magic<br><br>Shadow door<br>Commonly used by mages<br>True sight, invisibility purge<br><br>Simulacrum<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>True sight<br><br>Spell deflection<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, secret word<br><br>Spell immunity<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, pierce magic, secret word, spell thrust<br><br>Spell shield<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Kelben's warding whip, secret word<br><br>Spell trap<br>Used by liches and infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield<br><br>Spell turning<br>Infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spellstrike, ruby ray of reversal, pierce shield, Khelben's warding whip, pierce magic, secret word<br><br>Stoneskin<br>Commonly used by mages<br>Breach<br><br>Offensive Spell<br>Used By<br>Counterspells<br><br>Imprisonment<br>Used by liches and infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spell trap, spell turning, a berserker's enrage ability<br><br>If a party member has been imprisoned, use freedom<br><br>Maze<br>Used by liches and infrequently used by very high-level mages<br>Spell trap, spell turning, a berserker's enrage ability<br><br>If a party member has been mazed, use freedom.<br><br>Cloudkill, incendiary cloud, stinking cloud, death fog<br>Infrequently used by mages<br>Zone of sweet air<br><br>Charm, domination, command, confusion, psionic blasts from mind flayers<br>Frequently used by monsters and mages<br>Chaotic commands<br><br>Haste, fire shields<br>Commonly used by monsters and mages (you can't dispel natural fire shields like the ones generated by flaming skulls)<br>Dispel magic, remove magic<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Summoning Creatures<br>Perhaps the most useful spells are those that create additional allies for you. Animate dead, summon monsters, and summon animals are consistently useful, even if your allies won't be much help in dispatching opponents because of their lack of magical weapons and limited hit points. Even these weak creatures absorb enemy attacks and spells, giving your party members the opportunity to mount attacks or prepare defenses. Undead are particularly useful for navigating through stinking clouds, ice storms, and cloudkill spells, since those spells don't affect the undead.<br><br>Not all the creatures you summon are cannon fodder, however, as you'll find golems, elementals, devas, dryads, magical swords, and planatars are all powerful allies. Summon one or more of these creatures in preparation for almost every major battle, and you'll significantly increase your odds of emerging unscathed.<br><br>Preparing for Battle<br><br>Almost every battle is easily managed if you're properly prepared and know what to expect from your opponents. Whenever you expect a major battle, prepare your party by casting a broad range of defensive spells. For almost every significant battle, you should cast defensive harmony, protection from evil, haste, chant, and bless. Pay attention to the duration of each spell prior to its casting to ensure that you cast spells with limited longevity, like bless, just prior to heading into battle. Mages should cast stoneskin, mirror image, and blur. Paladins engaging in melee combat should cast call upon holy might, while clerics should cast that spell or righteous magic. Fighters should take giant strength potions.<br><br>Adapt to your opponents. If you anticipate engaging creatures like demons or dragons, which can cause fear and fire attacks, also cast resist fear and protection from fire. If you've been engaging a lot of mind flayers, cast chaotic commands on your frontline fighters. Similarly, if you anticipate battling enemy mages, ensure you have spell-turning, spell trap, or spell deflection ready. If you've been defeated by a group of foes once already, next time, prepare defenses (including sequencers and contingencies) that will reduce the effectiveness of its attacks. You can return to the pocket plane after every major battle, if necessary, to rest and rememorize spells.<br><br>Situational Awareness<br><br>There are better ways to discover what's in store for you than dying and reloading, however. Consistently turn a thief invisible and let him search the entire level to remove any traps and scout to discover the nature of your opponents. There are plenty of invisibility potions lying around that you should use to let that thief become invisible again after opening doors or backstabbing an opportunistic target.<br><br>Some mages and high-level monsters can see invisible characters, so an even safer way of searching ahead is by casting wizard eye or farsight.<br><br>Peek-a-boo. This almost invisible wizard's eye is a great spell for finding out what opponents are lurking on your level. Even if you alert enemies and allow them to raise defenses, you can hold your party out of range until most of the defenses expire.<br>Use High-level Spells and Skills Effectively<br><br>Now that your party will finally have consistent access to ninth-level mage spells, use them effectively. Time stop is one of your best available spells, but only if you use the time it affords you to follow up with a formidable array of spells. Improved alacrity combined with time stop will let your mage string together an almost constant string of magic missiles, capable of taking out any other mage vulnerable to spells. Death spell may not be effective at taking out most of the opponents you'll face, but it automatically gets rid of summoned creatures and animals.<br><br>Area of effect spells have gotten progressively less useful in the Baldur's Gate games, since opponents no longer haplessly stand around waiting to get bombarded, and without having sufficient distance from your opponents, it's typically dangerous to cast these spells because of friendly fire. No longer. The new high-level spells let you rain destruction on groups of opponents that are already engaging your party members in melee combat without hurting your allies. Both comet and dragon's breath can be very effective at clearing a battlefield. You can also use stinking cloud, web and entangle spells to keep opponents in place for other damaging area of effect spells, such as death fog.<br><br>Caught and cooked. Web, stinking cloud and entangle are low-level spells, but they can still be useful to immobilize opponents to set them up for damaging area of effect spells and ranged attacks.<br>The skills available to fighters have the additional benefit of always being available, although they all have a very limited duration. Still, very few opponents can withstand one or two fighters engaging them with greater whirlwind or critical strike abilities activated. Hardiness is also a useful ability with a somewhat longer duration. Use it when you think a fighter will be surrounded by enemies. One of the best abilities for paladins is summon deva.<br><br>One of the high-level abilities that players frequently forget to use is the ability of clerics and paladins to turn undead. A high-level cleric can immediately take out any of the undead in the game, with only a few exceptions (such as the demi-lich).<br><br>Ranged Weapons<br><br>Ranged weapons have always been overpowered in the Baldur's Gate series, but that's no longer the case, since the maximum damage these weapons can inflict hasn't significantly changed (and has actually been reduced from the original Baldur's Gate), and your opponents now have significantly more hit points. Still, all your characters should have ranged weapons available, since you'll often want to hold your ground for strategic reasons (or to avoid stumbling into traps). No ranged weapon compares to the sling of seeking +2, which you can carry over from the original game, since it lets you add your strength bonus to damage inflicted. Since fighters by this point in the game have the strength of giants, that not-so-intimidating sling can heavily damage most opponents.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cespenar's Recipes<br>Many of the powerful magic items you'll find can be enhanced even further by having your trusty imp janitor, Cespenar, combine them with one or more additional items.

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter 4: Area Walk-throughs<br>Throne of Bhaal isn't as open-ended as Baldur's Gate II. You can elect to go to Watcher's Keep at any time after leaving Saradush to complete the optional quests around the Keep, but otherwise, your path to the end of the game will be linear. This section of the guide provides a comprehensive walk-through for each sector in the game, generally listed in the order you will likely uncover each area. Quests that appear in bold print also appear in your journal, while other events that award you experience are displayed in normal print.<br><br>Each area description also lists all the NPCs and encounter that are present in that sector as well as the enemies that lurk in that location and the magic items you can find there.<br><br>1. Preamble and Pocket Plane in the Abyss - The First Challenge<br><br>After talking to any of the giant sculptures, you'll be attacked by Illasera, one of the five Bhaalspawn that's tearing up the Sword Coast. You do, however, have time to rest to memorize spells, however, so you should do so and prepare a defense. Illasera (98 hit points, AC 6, 10,000 experience points) will immediately summon one or more creatures to her aid, but you should focus your attacks on her to prevent her from casting additional spells, since the creatures will vanish when she's vanquished. If you've continued a game from Baldur's Gate II and have a full party with you, Illasera will also have a handful of black reaver archers to assist her. You'll immediately reappear in the pocket plane (any items on the ground will travel with you, so you don't have to scramble to grab them) and be greeted by Solar and your old foe, Sarevok.<br><br>Talk to the Solar and Sarevok. You can summon any of your old companions by asking the nearby spirits for aid, and you'll get 2,000 experience points for each one that you summon, so summon them all for some quick experience points. You must eventually donate part of a Bhaalspawn's soul to Sarevok, so it can either be you or Imoen who donates the "insignificant" aspect of your soul. Sarevok will also ask to join you. He's chaotic evil in alignment, but will heed your directions and has the most impressive statistics of any NPC companions.<br><br>Once you've restored Sarevok to life, you must face the challenge opened up in the room to the northwest. Entering, you'll be greeted by Gavid, a hapless former Bhaalspawn. After a brief speech, he'll die, and you'll be greeted by an assembly line of successively more powerful foes, starting with kobold commandos and dopplegangers and progressing to ogre mages, gnoll captains, sahuagin, and finally drow warriors and priestesses. You can use a powerful area of effect spell such as death fog or incendiary cloud and stay back to pick off the survivors with missile weapons, or position a fighter or two around each of the three spawning doors. If you gate in a pit fiend, it can clear the entire encounter for you, but make sure you cast protection from evil 10-foot radius first, so the devil doesn't attack the party. The party will receive 25,000 experience points each, and your main character will receive 30,000 experience points for completing the challenge.<br><br>Sarevok will unveil the first challenge, but you'll have four more to face. Each time you dispatch a key Bhaalspawn, another chamber leading to a challenge will become available.<br>NPCs in this sector:<br><br>Cespenar<br><br>Gavid<br><br>Illasera<br><br>Solar<br><br>Sarevok<br>Enemies in this sector:<br><br>Doppelgangers<br><br>Drow priestesses and warriors<br><br>Gnoll captains<br><br>Illasera<br><br>Kobold commandos<br><br>Ogre mages<br><br>Sahuagin<br>Magic items in this sector:<br><br>On Illaser:<br>Dagger +2<br>Boots of speed: Paws of the Cheetah<br>Sylvan chain +2<br>Ring of protection +1: Ring of the Princes<br></div>
