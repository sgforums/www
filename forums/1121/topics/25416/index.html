            <div class='col-md body'>Introduction<br><br>It's a little ironic that one of the most frequently played online games these days isn't a game at all. It's Counter-Strike, the Half-Life add-on that was created by two enthusiasts and a handful of amateur level designers. Counter-Strike has undergone many facelifts in its two-year existence, and with more than 4,000 servers hosting the game at any given moment, it has burgeoned into one of the most addictive games you'll find online.<br><br>Counter-Strike is a game of kill or be killed. But unlike Quake III: Arena or Unreal Tournament, it's not a mindless action game that involves nothing more than twitch-shooting. Counter-Strike brings a certain level of realism into the arena of multiplayer first-person shooters, stresses the importance of team unity and punishes anyone who tries to hog all the glory. Counter-Strike has been around in beta form for nearly two years, so anyone who's picked up the recently released retail package is bound to face some truly experienced players. This guide is meant to initiate new users to the world of Counter-Strike by providing comprehensive strategies for each map and gameplay mode and useful tips for each game weapon. Inside this guide you'll find:<br><br>Getting Started: This section will lay the groundwork you need to survive in Counter-Strike. Search this section for tips on proper key bindings, general strategies, and a checklist of things that you should do before jumping into a server.<br><br>Weapons Breakdown: Whether you're a terrorist or counter-terrorist, you're as good as dead without the right weapons. Contained within this section is a detailed rundown of all the weapons' strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>Assassination Strategies: Having trouble keeping the VIP alive?

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter One: Getting Started<br><br>Even though it's an action game, Counter-Strike is one of the most complicated first-person shooters out there. You must use the radio, type messages to your teammates, buy items, and cycle through weapons all while struggling to stay alive. Before you jump into a game, you must set up your controls on your keyboard in a way that will let you access Counter-Strike's many keys without taking your eyes off the action. You'll find Counter-Strike's control menu in the configuration screen. While there isn't a single best setup for your controls, you'll generally find the game's default settings ideal. Here are Counter-Strike's primary controls and the recommended keys to bind each action to:<br><br>Access buy menu: B<br>Strafe left: A<br>Strafe right: D<br>Move forward: W<br>Move backward: S<br>Jump: Space bar<br>Crouch: Ctrl key<br>Fire: Left mouse button<br>Special weapon function: Right mouse button<br>Reload weapon: R<br>Use: E<br><br>When binding your keys, keep in mind that you must keep one hand on the keyboard and the other on the mouse at all times. If you must take your eyes off the screen to search for a key, even for a second, you'll likely get killed by another player. With this in mind, you should also bind keys for standard and group radio messages and the high score menu within easy reach of the hand that's on the keyboard. Since these functions aren't as essential to Counter-Strike's gameplay as the commands on top, you can place them anywhere you want.<br><br>You should also bind the next/previous weapon control to your mouse wheel. If your mouse doesn't have a wheel, you should bind the individual weapons to the number keys on your keyboard. In fact, since you can only carry one primary and one secondary weapon at once, you're better off doing the latter. Some newer mice, like Microsoft's Intellimouse, have upward of four buttons, which gives you more options when choosing where to bind your keys.<br><br>Note that these control suggestions are just that: suggestions. Some players prefer to use the keyboard's arrow keys for movement, and you should take the time to find a control scheme that's the most comfortable and best fits your style while still letting you perform all the game's necessary tasks.<br><br>Proper control can mean the difference between life and death.<br>Last-Minute Suggestions<br><br>Once you've got your control set up the way you want to, you should go to the customize menu in Counter-Strike. Here, you can pick out your character's online name and spray paint image and color. You should also jump into the advanced portion of the customize menu and deselect the option for "left-handed weapon models." This moves your character's arm and weapon from the left side of the screen to the right, which makes it easier to get accustomed to the screen's layout, especially if you're used to playing other first-person shooters, most of which draw the weapon on the right side of the screen anyway. If you're left-handed or just prefer Counter-Strike's unique left-handed weapon models, you can leave this option activated.<br><br>One final suggestion is to jump into the game's video options menu and move the gamma slider as far right as possible. This will brighten the screen and make it easier for you to spot hidden enemies in corridors and low-contrast maps like Office and Cobble. For an even greater boost in gamma, you can also go to www.entechtaiwan.com and download and install PowerStrip, a video utility that, among other things, can increase the gamma settings on your video card.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Playing by the Rules<br><br>When you enter a server, the first thing you'll be asked to do is to join either the terrorist or counter-terrorist team. It doesn't matter what side you choose initially, although as you gain experience playing the game, you'll start to favor one team over the other. And while each game map is supposed to be designed in a manner that's balanced for both sides, you'll undoubtedly find certain maps that are more advantageous to one of the two teams. After choosing a team, you'll be asked to select from one of four skins. If you choose the counter-terrorists, you can play as a member of the German GSG9, the French GIGN, the Navy SEALs, or the British SAS. As a terrorist, you can pick from skins that include a standard, arctic, Arab, or guerilla fighter. None of these counter-terrorist or terrorist player models varies in speed, jumping height, or any other ability. Their differences are merely cosmetic. Having said that, you'll find that some models blend better in certain backgrounds than other models. The arctic terrorist, for instance, is difficult to spot in the snowy quads of Office.<br><br>Some models are better suited for certain maps than others.<br>Once you've picked a player model, you'll join the rest of your team, who will all be trying to accomplish a certain objective. The opposing team exists only to make sure that your goals aren't met. Counter-Strike is split up into 20 maps, with each map falling into one of three categories:<br><br>Hostage Rescue<br>The terrorist team will guard and try to prevent the counter-terrorists from breaching their base and getting to a group of helpless hostages. Counter-terrorists will win if they rescue all surviving hostages or kill all the terrorists. Terrorists win if they kill all the counter-terrorists or prevent them from rescuing the hostages within the allotted time.<br><br>Assassination<br><br>The counter-terrorists must safely escort a VIP, who is controlled by a player, through terrorist-occupied territory. Terrorists must assassinate the VIP. The terrorist team will win if it kills the VIP or prevents him from reaching the extraction point within the allotted time. Counter-terrorists win if the VIP gets through safely or if all terrorists are killed.<br><br>Bomb Defuse<br><br>Terrorists must plant a bomb near one of two bomb spots within the allotted time, while the counter-terrorists must prevent the bombing. Terrorists win if all counter-terrorists are killed or if the bomb successfully explodes within the allotted time. Counter-terrorists win if the bombing is prevented within the time limit, or if all the terrorists are killed before the bomb is planted.<br><br>Previous betas of the game included a fourth mode called Escape, which involved one team breaking another out of jail using only a limited amount of weapons. Because of its unpopularity, however, Escape has been dropped from the final version of Counter-Strike.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Important Tips<br><br>Once you do enter a game and find a setup you're comfortable with, you should keep a few key points in mind if you don't want to pass off as a newbie. Some tips are simply for listed for courtesy's sake, but most are here to keep you alive.<br><br>Pay Attention to Your HUD<br><br>While it goes without saying, the best thing you can do in the game is to keep your eyes on the screen at all times. Counter-Strike gives you a number of visual aides designed to enhance your gameplay. The top right of your screen shows the death/action indicator. When someone kills somebody else, their respective names will appear in that area as well as the weapon used for the kill. If you notice that a lot of your own teammates are getting killed, you must adjust your strategy and become more conservative. Likewise, if your team is doing all the killing, be more aggressive in going after the remaining opposing team members. The HUD also shows your radar, which displays the location of your teammates; your health and armor levels; the round timer; the ammunition indicator; and the amount of cash you have left. The left side of the HUD also displays important green icons to denote hostage rescue areas, VIP escape points, buy areas, and bomb spots. This section also indicates whether or not you're carrying the C4 bomb or defuse kit in bomb defuse maps.<br><br>The top-right corner of your screen keeps track of all the action.<br>Firing and Reloading<br>The crosshair in Counter-Strike will rapidly expand as you fire your weapon to indicate that gun's accuracy. The longer you hold down the trigger, or the faster you fire, the larger the crosshair gets. And the larger the crosshair gets, the less accurate your shots will be. How do you address this problem? Simple, use burst fire. Methodically tap your fire key to shoot in short bursts - this keeps the crosshairs from expanding. Your accuracy is also affected by several other factors, including movement. The less you move, the more accurate your fire will be: crouching produces the most accurate results. You should also avoid ladders and water while firing, as both make your weapon extremely inaccurate. Once you get the hang of your gun, you should always aim at your enemies' head, since it usually takes no more than one shot to kill him.<br><br>Ironically, while reloading is an absolute necessity to survive in Counter-Strike, doing so takes up so much valuable time, you'll often find yourself facing an incoming enemy while stuck in the middle of a reload. Typically, you should avoid reloading your weapon until you have about 10 percent of the total clip capacity remaining and only do so when you're away from the action. Reloading while crouching behind a box, for instance, is a good idea. Sometimes, however, reloading while in the middle of a firefight is inevitable. In these situations, it's actually faster if you switch to your pistol using either a hotkey or mouse wheel than it is to wait for your rifle or submachine gun to finish reloading.<br><br>Movement<br><br>The way you move in Counter-Strike is also very important. Each weapon's varying weight has an effect on your running speed, so it's essential that after you buy your weapons at the beginning of the round, you equip your knife and run to the strategic parts of whatever map you're playing with it equipped. You'll move a lot faster this way, and as you approach the area where you sense the other team might be, you can then equip your primary weapon. In fact, before you even start running, there's something else you can do to increase your time out of the gate, so to speak: Use your hotkeys to purchase items, weapons, and ammo, and not the mouse-driven menu. This can save a maximum of a handful of seconds, but that's a lot of time in a game like this. When you start moving, stay in the shadows and avoid the light. This makes you more difficult to spot by the opposing team. If you manage to be one of the few surviving members of your team, you'll undoubtedly want to be more cautious. A good idea is to look out for players' gun muzzles sticking out from behind crates of walls. Some enemies will camp and wait for you to come to them, but sometimes their long barrels will betray their hiding spots, so keep a sharp eye out for them. Also, when you walk or crouch-walk instead of run, your footsteps won't be heard by the opposing team. Often, the only thing that alerts a camping enemy of your approach is your footsteps.<br><br>Other Tips<br><br>Here are some other tips you should follow while in the game:<br><br>If you find yourself low on ammo, try to locate another gun that's been dropped by a member of either team. Stand over the gun and drop your existing weapon. You'll automatically pick up the gun you were standing on.<br><br>Also related to this is another neat, albeit dirty, trick you can use. If you're low on cash and can't afford a submachine gun or rifle at the beginning of the round, follow one of your own teammates out onto the field and try to box him in front of a pillar or box. Unaware of your presence, he can't back up. He'll be exposed to enemy fire. When he dies, you'll instantly pick up his gun. It's low down, but it works.<br><br>Remember: Always silence your gun if possible. It increases accuracy as well as the element of surprise.<br><br>Try playing on a LAN or use Roger Wilco to communicate with teammates while playing the game. You'll be amazed at how much more efficient you and your team will become with voice communication.<br><br>If you die early in a round, use the freelook capabilities to see what kind of strategies the enemies are implementing. The best thing you can do is try and spot areas where enemies are camping. That way, when you play in the round, you can get the drop on them.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Making Sense of Making Money<br><br>The more rounds you win, the more money you make.<br>Counter-Strike is all about economics. Nearly every action you can perform in the game will either pay you or cost you a certain amount of money. Unlike other first-person shooters, you must pay for most of your equipment in Counter-Strike, including weapons and ammunition. The basic premise of the game is quite simple: The more you win, the more money you make. And the more money you make, the better the weapons you can buy. Naturally, the team who wins consistently can overpower the opposing team with better firepower.<br><br>But the game's currency aspect is much more robust than the previous brief statement. Following is a complete table of possible actions in Counter-Strike and their respective costs and payoffs:<br><br>Action<br>Payoff / Fine<br><br>Rescuing a hostage<br>$1,000 for rescuer, $150 for teammates<br><br>Killing a hostage<br>-$1,500<br><br>Talking to a hostage<br>$150 for individual, $100 for teammates<br><br>Killing an opponent<br>$300<br><br>Killing a teammate (friendly fire servers only)<br>-$3,300<br><br>Successfully bombing a target<br>$2,750 for teammates<br><br>Successfully defusing a bomb<br>$2,750 for teammates<br><br>Successfully rescuing all hostages<br>$2,000 plus $250 per surviving hostage for teammates<br><br>Killing all opponents (hostage rescue map)<br>$2,000 for teammates<br><br>Killing all opponents (bomb defuse map)<br>$2,500 for teammates<br><br>Money received after losing a round<br>$1,400 for teammates<br><br>The money you earn throughout each round is carried over into the next until the server ends the match. Of course, the only reason to earn money is to buy bigger and better weapons with which to overpower your enemies. What follows is a complete rundown of all of Counter-Strike's weapons and items.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Two: Weapons Breakdown<br><br>Counter-Strike has a wide variety of weapons that you can buy, but they all have their own strengths and weaknesses. These weapons are the tools of your trade, and knowing which ones to buy and which to avoid will make you a better tradesman.<br><br>Pistols<br><br>Pistols are the least expensive of the weapons in Counter-Strike. And while they might lack the firepower of the rifles and submachine guns, they can still be quite deadly when used properly.<br><br>Heckler &amp; Koch USP Tactical<br><br>Retail name: K&amp;M .45 Tactical<br>Caliber: .45 ACP<br>Price: $500<br>Clip capacity: 12<br>Description: As a counter-terrorist, your default weapon will always be the H&amp;K USP Tactical. While it's a formidable pistol, it lacks the firepower of some of the more expensive sidearms. One advantage it does have, however, is the ability to be silenced by using its special weapon function. While silencing makes this pistol slightly less powerful than it normally would be, doing so makes it a little more accurate. Silencing almost completely hides its gunfire noise and masks its muzzle flashes, all of which make it perfect for catching terrorists by surprise.<br>Recommended use: Attach the silencer to the USP before the round begins. Doing so makes it a much more effective weapon, especially at catching other players off guard, since they won't know they're being fired at until they actually get hit.<br><br>Glock 18<br><br>Retail name: 9x19 Sidearm<br>Caliber: 9mm<br>Price: $400<br>Clip capacity: 20<br>Description: The Glock is the default weapon for all terrorists. It's slightly less powerful than the H&amp;K USP, but its maximum rate of fire is limited only by your finger speed. So the faster you can click your mouse, the faster this semi-automatic pistol will fire. Additionally, its special weapon function is a triple-burst fire, which is deadly at close range. This mode makes the Glock very inaccurate, though, and using triple-burst over any distance longer than point blank isn't recommended.<br>Recommended use: The Glock might not be very powerful, but its maximum rate of fire is only limited to your finger speed, so the faster you click on that attack button, the more effective the Glock becomes. Always aim at your enemy's head while using the Glock, otherwise it'll take several shots to the torso to kill anyone. And while it might be tempting to use its triple-burst mode, you should stay away from it because of its horrible accuracy.<br><br>Desert Eagle<br><br>Retail name: Night Hawk .50C<br>Caliber: .50AE<br>Price: $650<br>Clip capacity: 7<br>Description: The Desert Eagle, affectionately called the "deagle" by Counter-Strike veterans, is the most powerful pistol you can buy in the game. At the start of the very first round on a new map, most people will forgo their default pistols and buy one of these portable cannons instead. The Desert Eagle can penetrate some walls and doors, which is a distinction that only the most expensive rifles own. However, it's severely limited by a maximum clip capacity of seven rounds and a longer than average reload time.<br>Recommended use: Since you start the first round of each game with $800, usually you should buy a Desert Eagle. It'll give you and your team a supreme firepower advantage over the other team, who'll likely be carrying either Glocks or USPs. Because the gun only carries seven rounds, you should reload at every opportunity you have. Also, don't forget that this is the only pistol that can penetrate various walls and objects, so if you spot an enemy reloading behind a door or a crate, shoot right through it. The Desert Eagle loses its appeal after the first round, however, since it can be overpowered by any submachine gun or rifle.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Beretta Elite<br><br>Retail name: .40 Dual Elites<br>Caliber: 9mm<br>Price: $1,000<br>Clip capacity: 15<br>Description: The terrorist-only Beretta Elite is actually two pistols held in either hand in a manner similar to those a John Woo movie. Each pistol is relatively slow to fire, but since you're holding two guns at once, your total rate of fire effectively doubles, as does the damage you can inflict. Still, because of its relative inaccuracy and high cost, you should probably save your money for a weapon that's more practical.<br>Recommended use: Unless you have a fixation with these guns, you should stay away from the dual Beretta Elites. You can't afford them in the first round, so your money is better spent elsewhere. If you must buy them, limit their use to close-quarter engagements, where they're most effective.<br><br>Sig P228<br><br>Retail name: 228 Compact<br>Caliber: .357<br>Price: $600<br>Clip capacity: 13<br>Description: While the Sig P228 is marginally more powerful and accurate than the H&amp;K USP Tactical, the differences aren't worth its $600 price tag. As a counter-terrorist, you're better off saving your money and sticking with your USP, since it's essentially free. As a terrorist, however, you might want to consider using the P228 in place of the weak Glock 18.<br>Recommended use: The P228 is only a bit more powerful and has a slower rate of fire than the H&amp;K USP, so as a counter-terrorist, you should avoid this gun. As a terrorist, however, if you feel that your Glock is inadequate and don't want to bother with the Desert Eagle's small clip capacity, the P228 is a good choice.<br><br>FN Five Seven<br><br>Retail name: ES Five-Seven<br>Caliber: 5.7mm<br>Price: $750<br>Clip capacity: 20<br>Description: The FN Five-Seven is certainly a unique pistol. Available only to the counter-terrorists, its massive clip holds more rounds than some rifles. It's also the most accurate pistol you can buy in the game. However, its price and lack of power leave something to be desired, and as either a counter-terrorist or terrorist, you're probably better off buying another pistol altogether.<br>Recommended use: Because of the Five-Seven's accuracy, it's a great pistol to use in long maps, like Canyon Siege, where you and the opposite team will likely meet in the open. If you're playing in the first round of a map and have the Five-Seven equipped, kneel down and open fire on the enemy as soon as you spot him. You'll undoubtedly hit - and sometimes kill - a few unlucky players that way. Don't risk kneeling in later rounds though, since you become a sitting duck for snipers and players with high-powered rifles.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Shotguns<br><br>Shotguns are quite powerful, but difficult to use efficiently. It's generally a good idea to avoid them in favor of the more popular submachine guns. However, in tight areas, shotguns can prove to be invaluable.<br><br>Benneli M3 Super 90 Combat<br><br>Retail name: Leone 12 Gauge Super<br>Caliber: 12 gauge<br>Price: $1,700<br>Clip capacity: 8<br>Description: Both shotguns in Counter-Strike are difficult to use effectively, especially the M3 Super 90. It might be relatively inexpensive, but as is true in life, you get what you pay for. Its clip capacity is anemic, and you must deal not only with horrendously slow reload times, but (since this shotgun is pump action) with slow cocking times as well. In tight maps with a lot of corridors and alleyways, like Back Alley, this shotgun can be deadly. In fact, at point-blank range, it can kill an unarmored player with one shot.<br>Recommended use: Shotguns are generally only effective on a handful of levels in Counter-Strike, including Back Alley and Train. For the price, you're better off going with an MP5. If you must use the M3 Super 90, however, you should save it for ambush situations. If an enemy spots you at a distance, his shots will hit you long before you can hit the enemy. Also, make sure you don't miss - the M3 Super 90 requires you to cock a shell into the chamber after each shot, which leaves you vulnerable for nearly one second at a time.<br><br>Benneli xm1014<br><br>Retail name: Leone YG1265 Auto Shotgun<br>Caliber: 12 gauge<br>Price: $3,000<br>Clip capacity: 7<br>Description: The xm1014 uses the same ammunition as the M3 Super 90, but since it's fully automatic, it spits out its buckshot at a very fast rate. Like the M3 Super 90, the xm1014 is absolutely deadly at close range and in tight areas. In large maps, however, it's all but useless. You're better off buying a rifle or submachine gun like the MP5, which costs half as much as this shotgun.<br>Recommended use: If you feel the absolute need purchase a shotgun, the xm1014 is certainly a better choice than the M3 Super 90 - if you have the money, that is. The gun is basically a fully automatic version of the pump-action Super 90. In fact, the xm1014 fires so quickly that you can easily empty all the rounds in your chamber without even realizing it. It's great to use in tight corridors, but otherwise, this weapon will get outgunned by almost any other submachine gun or rifle at even a moderate distance. Its slow reload speed will also make you vulnerable for a long time.<br><br>Submachine Guns<br><br>Submachine guns are the most popular type of weapon in Counter-Strike, since they represent a perfect blend of power and value.<br><br>Heckler &amp; Koch MP5-N<br><br>Retail name: K&amp;M submachine gun<br>Caliber: 9mm<br>Price: $1,500<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The MP5-N is easily the favorite weapon of all Counter-Strike players and for good reason. At $1,500, it's a steal as far as submachine guns are concerned. Whether you've won or lost the first round, the gun is inexpensive enough that you can automatically afford it by the second round of any match. What's more, its clip can hold 30 rounds and 120 more spare rounds, meaning you'll never run out of ammo during extended matches. And despite its budget status, the MP5 is a very formidable weapon with minimal recoil and a very high rate of fire. The MP5 is a great intermediate weapon to tide you over while you save for a more powerful rifle.<br>Recommended use: If you can't afford a rifle, you should always buy an MP5. While it's not very accurate at long range, it has an impressive rate of fire without too much recoil. You should fire this gun in bursts of five to 10 rounds unless you're standing close to your opponent, in which case you can hold down the trigger as long as you can keep your aim steady.<br><br>Steyr TMP<br><br>Retail name: Schmidt Machine Pistol<br>Caliber: 9mm<br>Price: $1,250<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The TMP is a counter-terrorist only weapon, and it's the cheapest submachine gun available in the game. Its nonremovable silencer gives it an edge when stealth is important, and it also limits the gun's recoil as compared to other submachine guns. One drawback to the TMP is that its high rate of fire means that it eats through its 30 round clip in little time, so use it sparingly.<br>Recommended use: This gun is even cheaper than the MP5, so if you're really hurting for cash, you can always fall back on the TMP. It isn't as powerful as the MP5, but it does fire at a faster rate, and it has a significantly less pronounced recoil, which means keeping your aim steady with the TMP will be a little easier than with the MP5. The TMP's silencer also means that your enemies won't realize they're being shot at until they're actually hit.<br><br>Heckler &amp; Koch UMP<br><br>Retail name: K&amp;M UMP45<br>Caliber: .45 ACP<br>Price: $1,700<br>Clip capacity: 25<br>Description: Developed by the same manufacturer as the MP5-N, this gun's higher-caliber ammunition is more powerful than its MP5 cousin. It fires at a slightly slower rate than the MP5, and with only 25 rounds per clip, it's not as practical. The UMP also suffers from a significantly longer reload time than the MP5.<br>Recommended use: Since the UMP costs $200 more than the MP5, you should avoid it. Its relatively fast rate of fire and small clip capacity mean that you'll be reloading this gun a lot, and since it suffers from a slow reload time, you'll be vulnerable more often than with another gun.<br><br>Mac10<br><br>Retail name: Ingram Mac-10<br>Caliber: .45 ACP<br>Price: $1,400<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The Mac10 is only available to the terrorists. Like the UMP, it does a relatively high amount of damage per shot. The Mac10 can carry five more rounds per clip than the UMP and has a much higher rate of fire. However, it suffers from a severe lack of accuracy, which makes it one of the least-used guns in the game.<br>Recommended use: The Mac10 is very similar to the TMP and should be used accordingly. It doesn't have a silencer, but it packs a little bit more punch per round than the TMP. Since it's so inaccurate, it should be used in very short bursts, unless you're fighting in close quarters, in which case the Mac10's power can prove deadly.<br><br>FN P90<br><br>Retail name: ES C90<br>Caliber: .338<br>Price: $2,350<br>Clip capacity: 50<br>Description: The FN P90 is one of the strangest looking guns in the world. Its unique design affords it a large clip capacity. In fact, among all but one gun in Counter-Strike, the P90's clip is easily the largest in the game. It's also has one of the fastest fire rates of any of the game's guns as well. You'll hardly feel the need to reload with this weapon. However, all this luxury comes at a price, as the FN P90 is the most expensive submachine gun you can buy. If you can afford it, and if you're playing in a level where bullet penetration isn't necessary, this P90 is a great choice for both terrorists and counter-terrorists.<br>Recommended use: Before you get tempted into buying one of these guns, keep in mind that it's the most expensive submachine gun available and probably not worth your money. Its largest appeal is that it can hold 50 rounds per magazine, so you don't have to worry about reloading too much. It can also fire at a very fast rate, but it also suffers from horrible recoil. If you decide to buy one, aim low, since the recoil will forcibly raise your reticule.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rifles<br><br>There are more rifles in Counter-Strike than any other weapon group. They're some of the most expensive - and most powerful - weapons in the game. All rifles can penetrate certain solid objects like crates and doors, and some even have zoom capabilities.<br><br>Colt M4A1 Carbine<br><br>Retail name: Maverick M4A1 Carbine<br>Caliber: 5.56mm<br>Price: $3,100<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: Early versions of Counter-Strike's M4A1 were equipped with a scope. This functionality has since been dropped in favor of a more tactical feature: a silencer. Like the H&amp;K USP Tactical, the M4A1 is better off when silenced, which activates when you use its special weapon function. Sure, it loses a little bit of its power, but the benefits gained by being completely silent when firing this weapon greatly outweigh the small costs. The M4A1 has average recoil and a fast rate of fire. It's also fairly accurate at all except extreme distances, making it one of the most well-rounded rifles in the game. Unfortunately for terrorists, this is a counter-terrorist weapon only.<br>Recommended use: Always equip the silencer. It adds a little more accuracy and makes the gun almost completely silent. The M4A1 is surprisingly accurate over long distances, so don't be afraid to engage an enemy early if you're carrying this rifle. Just make sure to fire in bursts.<br><br>Steyr AUG<br><br>Retail name: Bullpup<br>Caliber: 5.56mm<br>Price: $3,500<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The Steyr AUG is a counter-terrorist-only weapon and is a good alternative to the Colt M4A1. It doesn't have as fast a rate of fire as the Colt, it's not as powerful, and it can't be silenced. Despite these apparent drawbacks, the AUG does have some redeeming qualities in its high accuracy and zoom capabilities.<br>Recommended use: The AUG functions exactly the same way as the terrorists' Commando. It can be zoomed once, does the same amount of damage, is just as accurate, holds the same amount of ammunition, and features the same rate of fire. So, like the Commando, the AUG should be fired in short bursts and, preferably, while kneeling. And whenever possible, use this weapon's scope for added accuracy and pseudo-sniping capabilities.<br><br>AK-47<br><br>Retail name: CV-47<br>Caliber: 7.62mm<br>Price: $2,500<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The terrorist-only AK-47 packs quite a punch for its relatively small price tag. It suffers from a lack of accuracy and limited ammunition. However, for cash-strapped terrorists, the AK-47 is a great weapon and one that can mow down enemies at drop of a hat.<br>Recommended use: The one thing to keep in mind when using the AK-47 is that its first two shots are the most accurate, and every subsequent shot will stray further and further from your reticule. So the proper way to use the AK-47 is to fire it in two- or three-shot bursts. Holding the trigger down any longer is almost completely useless. The AK-47 should also be avoided in large maps where accuracy is required to tattoo enemies at great distances. In close-proximity areas, however, the AK-47 is a great alternative to either of the game's shotguns.<br><br>Sig SG 552 Commando<br><br>Retail name: Krieg 552 Commando<br>Caliber: 5.56mm<br>Price: $3,500<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The terrorist-only Commando is the equivalent of the counter-terrorists' Steyr AUG rifle. It can be zoomed in once, and has a decent rate of fire, has good penetrating capability, and packs quite a punch.<br>Recommended use: The Commando is one of the best all-around weapons and has only one serious drawback: a severe recoil. When the trigger is held down indefinitely, the Commando loses a lot of its accuracy. But when it's fired in bursts, especially when zoomed, its rifle's accuracy becomes deadly. More so than any weapon, the Commando should be fired while crouching. Whenever you can, use the scope's zoom feature. Doing so reduces its rate of fire, but greatly increases its accuracy. The Commando can also be used as a sniper rifle if you're on a budget.<br><br>Sig SG 550 SWAT<br><br>Retail name: Krieg 550 Commando<br>Caliber: 5.56mm<br>Price: $4,200<br>Clip capacity: 30<br>Description: The Sig SG 550 SWAT is the counter-terrorist answer to the terrorist's G3. It has two levels of zoom capability, and it can be fired in full-auto, even when the scope is being used.<br>Recommended use: As a counter-terrorist, you have the option of buying one of three sniper rifles, including this one. While it may be cheaper than the AWM, it doesn't have its appeal - as a sniper rifle, its not as accurate. However, if you plan on using it as an assault weapon, its full-auto capability will undoubtedly prove useful. Like the AWM, it has good penetration capabilities, but also suffers from heavy weight, which ultimately negates its usefulness as an assault rifle.<br><br>Steyr Scout<br><br>Retail name: Schmidt Scout<br>Caliber: 7.62mm<br>Price: $2,750<br>Clip capacity: 10<br>Description: The Scout is Counter-Strike's second, and inferior, bolt-action sniper rifle. Functionally, it's equivalent to the AWM, but it lacks the accuracy and power.<br>Recommended use: While its price tag might be appealing, if you can't afford a better sniper rifle like the AWM or even the G3, you're better off spending your money on an assault rifle. While the Scout is fairly accurate and packs a moderate punch, it fades in comparison to the AWM. And while the AWM can be accurately fired from a standing position, you must crouch when firing with the Scout. It is the lightest of all sniper rifles, however, which means you can run at a nice clip while carrying it.<br><br>Arctic Warfare Magnum<br><br>Retail name: Magnum Sniper Rifle<br>Caliber: .338<br>Price: $4,750<br>Clip capacity: 10<br>Description: The Arctic Warfare Magnum, or AWM, is the most powerful weapon in Counter-Strike. It can cut down an armored enemy with a single hit, and it's deadly accurate at all ranges, thanks to its powerful scope that can be magnified twice by pressing your special weapon function key.<br>Recommended use: Despite its hefty price tag, the AWM should be your sniper rifle of choice. Never fire the AWM without the scope, as it's surprisingly inaccurate that way. When you have an enemy in your scope, don't worry about leading him, since the bullet will effectively hit your target the moment it's fired. And of course, try not to miss because you must chamber a new bullet after every shot, and that alone takes a few seconds. Also, remember that the AWM can penetrate solid objects as well as people, so don't be surprised when you kill two or three enemies with a single shot.<br><br>Heckler &amp; Koch G3/SG-1<br><br>Retail name: D3/AU-1 Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle<br>Caliber: 7.62mm<br>Price: $5,000<br>Clip capacity: 20<br>Description: The terrorist-only G3 is a little less accurate and less powerful than the AWM, but it does have some redeeming qualities as a sniper rifle. Its firing mechanism is semi-automatic, meaning you won't have to chamber a round after each shot. When situations get a little hairy, the G3 also serves as a competent assault rifle, although you'll be hindered by its heavy weight.<br>Recommended use: The G3 comes with a heavy price tag, and it should be avoided if all you plan to do is snipe. Go with the AWM instead. If you do buy a G3, keep in mind that this gun won't zoom out after every shot - like the AWM - so keep your finger on the trigger. Always go for a head shot because, unlike the AWM, a single hit with the G3 won't always kill enemies.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Machine Guns and Items<br><br>Here are some other weapons and items that'll give you the edge in Counter-Strike.<br><br>FN M249 Para<br><br>Retail name: ES M249 Para<br>Caliber: 5.56mm<br>Price: $5,750<br>Clip capacity: 100<br>Description: The biggest and most expensive gun in Counter-Strike, the Para is the weapon most feared by veterans of the game. It can carry a whopping 100 rounds per clip, which it spews forth at an incredible rate. And while its inaccurate, its primary role is for throwing up a wall of lead, not sniping.<br>Recommended use: The Para might be appealing to use, but it's a difficult gun to master. Its heavy weight means that your mobility will be severely impeded. The gun's inaccuracy means that you'll also have a difficult time trying to hit enemies at a distance or who are constantly moving. However, for defending a single doorway or location, there is no better weapon to use than the Para. Additionally, for maps like 747 and Assault, the Para can penetrate entire structures and rain a torrent of ammo onto an unsuspecting team. Don't worry about ammo, either. With 100 rounds per clip, you can hold down the trigger for nearly 10 seconds before having to reload.<br><br>Flashbang Grenade<br><br>Price: $200<br>Description: The flashbang grenade explodes in a bright visual concussion that temporarily blinds anyone within its vicinity, including your own teammates. The farther away you are from its area of effect, the faster your vision will return. The flashbang is meant to disorient enemies long enough for the opposing team to move in and take advantage of the state of confusion. If you see such a grenade being thrown in your direction, look away as fast as possible. Then, be prepared to face rushing enemies. When using a flashbang, you should throw it into a concentrated area of enemies, then immediately follow it with an attack. It takes a leap of faith to jump into a group of enemies, but it will be temporarily blinded, so act quickly. You can carry two flashbangs at any given time.<br><br>Smoke Grenade<br><br>Price: $300<br>Description: While both teams are able to buy the smoke grenade, it's best suited to the counter-terrorists. This grenade releases large puffs of smoke that obscure everyone's visibility, so they should be used wisely. It's very easy to obscure the view of a few of your own teammates, thus causing more harm than good. The smoke grenade should be used when your team is pinned down by enemy fire to provide cover for escape. You can only carry one smoke grenade at a time.<br><br>High-Explosive Grenade<br><br>Price: $300<br>Description: These grenades have about a 2.5-second fuse delay before exploding in a powerful ball of flame that can inflict up to 75 hit points. You can't hurt your own teammates with a high-explosive grenade, but you can cause damage to yourself, so caution should be taken when throwing it. Grenades have a tendency to bounce sharply off walls, but you can use this to your advantage by banking the throws into otherwise hard-to-reach areas. The grenade should be used at an incoming group of attackers to soften them up and spread them out.<br><br>Kevlar Vest<br><br>Price: $650<br>Description: Kevlar vests offer protection against all attacks below the neck. However, even though they absorb a significant amount of damage, your own health will still decrease, albeit at a lesser rate, when attacked while wearing a vest. The vest will usually let you survive more firefights than you normally can, so if you have the money, make sure to buy one at the start of every round.<br><br>Kevlar Vest and Helmet<br><br>Price: $1,000<br>Description: This option adds a Kevlar helmet to the standard vest. The helmet lets you take more damage to the head than you normally can. Generally, however, unless you're hit from pistol fire, a head shot will usually kill you - with or without the helmet. You're better off buying just the vest and pocketing the $350 difference.<br><br>Night Vision Goggles<br><br>Price: $1,250<br>Description: These goggles amplify the amount of light in any given map, making it easier to spot enemies in dark areas. However, at $1,250, its price is a little steep, and your money is better spent elsewhere, especially if you've increased your gamma using PowerStrip, as we mentioned previously.<br><br>Defuse Kit<br><br>Price: $200<br>Description: At only $200, the defuse kit should be bought by every counter-terrorist during bomb defuse situations. It cuts the bomb defuse time from 10 to five seconds, which could mean the difference between a successful mission and a failed one.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Chapter Three: General Map Strategies<br><br>The maps of Counter-Strike fall into three strategic categories: assassination/escort, hostage rescue, and bombing/defusing. Each class of map has specific needs that must be met to win as both counter-terrorists and terrorists. Lets go over the basic strategies that should be applied to all three map classes, beginning with assassination maps.<br><br>Assassination Strategies<br><br>All assassination maps are a daunting challenge for counter-terrorist players due to the inherent vulnerability of the VIP. To win on these maps counter-terrorists must work as a team and focus their fire on singular targets as they present themselves. Time works against the counter-terrorists on these maps, since the game is over if the VIP doesn't reach the extraction point safely within the given time limit. For terrorists, nothing is more satisfying than the proverbial "release the hounds" plan of attack, which is effectively what all assassination maps offer. There are no hostages to babysit and no bomb to worry about planting. Your job is to kill your enemy, plain and simple.<br><br>The VIP must stay alive at all costs.<br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Delivering Your Valuable Cargo<br>All assassination maps offer four or five primary ways to extract the VIP from the counter-terrorist spawn point to a singular rescue spot. And while the map layouts differ, the general strategies to succeed on them are virtually identical from map to map.<br><br>To win on assassination maps, counter-terrorists must follow three major guidelines.<br><br>1. Stay with the VIP.<br>In the movie Top Gun, the experienced Viper told the rebellious Maverick that he should never leave his wingman during the action. If there's ever a scenario in a PC game where Viper's words ring true, it's Counter-Strike. Stay with the VIP at all times. Two or three counter-terrorists should lead the VIP, and two or three should guard his flank.<br><br>2. Overwhelm one area with intense firepower.<br>Since you're staying with the VIP (you are staying with him aren't you?), you might as well use your group's massive amount of weaponry and lead-throwing ability to its full potential. Pick one of the four escape routes (let the VIP decide at the beginning), and rush to it as quickly as possible as a group, picking off any foolish terrorists that have decided to be heroes and come in as loners looking for kills.<br><br>3. Use flashbang grenades to break out.<br>Once you're at the final leg of the particular escape route you've chosen, it's time to actually make the run to the extraction point and expose yourself and the VIP to terrorist fire. High-explosive grenades offer intense firepower, but have a relatively small blast radius. Plus, with their loud noise and tall explosion, they immediately broadcast to every terrorist within earshot that the counter-terrorists are coming from a certain hole, window, roof, or doorway. Instead, use one or two flashbang grenades to force any nearby camping terrorists to move away from the vulnerable spot where you exit from your counter-terrorist haven. Be careful not to flash your own teammates - communication is key. And once you break loose in the open, make a beeline to the extraction point, but make sure to maintain formation. If possible, remember to keep the VIP between a group of leading and a group of trailing counter-terrorists.<br><br>4. Do your part.<br>If you end up playing as the VIP, use your pistol. While you shouldn't leave your counter-terrorist escort to engage any hostiles, it's still a good idea to provide cover fire while running in formation.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Killing the Fat Bureaucrat<br><br>Many Counter-Strike players will only play assassination maps as a member of the terrorist team - and with good reason. But even though terrorists start out with a slight advantage, poor team strategy will still let the counter-terrorists accomplish their rescue mission repeatedly.<br><br>Here's the way terrorists should hunt their prey down and execute him efficiently.<br><br>1. Monitor all the exit spots simultaneously.<br>At the beginning of the round, assign two terrorist team members to each possible exit point. If you haven't got enough people in the game, then lower that number to a single guard per area. Move your crosshairs on each teammate and try to place his name in the area he's guarding. That way, if a teammate gets killed, you'll instantly know where the action came from and, probably, where the counter-terrorists are attempting to break out.<br><br>2. The clock is your friend. Use it.<br>The mentality for terrorists when each round begins on an assassination map tends to be a shark-like feeding frenzy. This leads to rogue team members running off into the building and attempting to kill the VIP themselves, Rambo-style. It's better to relax at the beginning, corral your teammates, and get them each to monitor a break-out exit point. Since the onus is on the counter-terrorists to complete the mission, if they camp inside the building and refuse to come out, they'll lose when the timer expires.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hostage Rescue Strategies<br><br>Of the 20 maps included in Counter-Strike 1.0, half are hostage rescue maps. Hostage rescue maps all have four defenseless (and often mindless) hostages that should be guarded by the terrorist team, which spawns very close to the hostages at the start of each round. Counter-terrorists spawn farther away and must infiltrate the terrorist's lair, rescue the hostages unharmed, and deliver them to freedom.<br><br>For terrorists, the priority on all hostage rescue maps is to stay alive and guard the hostages from being liberated. Counter-terrorists can win the round in two ways: by rescuing the hostages within the time limit or by killing all the terrorists. Conversely, the terrorist team can win the match by either killing all the counter-terrorists or by preventing them from rescuing the hostages in time.<br><br>Let's look at some general strategies that apply on all hostage rescue maps for both counter-terrorists and terrorists.<br><br>Each map has four or five hostages that must be rescued.<br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Oh, Those Silly Hostages<br>Well, now they've gone and done it. A group of scientists or tree-hugging environmentalists or capitalist pigs or whomever has gone and upset a group of savage terrorists, and now it's been captured and is being held against its will. Saddle up, counter-terrorists, you've got a job to do, and you're going to do it well by following these specific guidelines.<br><br>1. Grenades are your friends.<br>The smoke, flashbang, and high-explosive grenades in Counter-Strike have specific purposes, and they lie solely in distracting, disorienting, or killing terrorists that are guarding hostages. Sure, the terrorists can have some great fun with grenades too, but they're really precise instruments that a good counter-terrorist team should use. A good general rule is to smoke dangerous entry zones to limit the terrorists' visibility, advance and flash the principal terrorist camping area, and rush in after the flashes deploy.<br><br>2. Counter-terrorist camping has a role... within reason.<br>On some of the hostage rescue maps, notably Canyon Siege, Assault, and Militia, it serves counter-terrorists well to watch the clock and bleed off a minute or two of game time before rushing into the terrorists' camp. Why? More often than not, some terrorists, possibly even half the entire team, will quickly get bored with guarding the hostages and rush like rabid dogs into the concentrated fire of the entire counter-terrorist team. As long as terrorists stay near their spawn area, they have the tactical advantage over the counter-terrorists. By goading them out of their hiding area, the advantage shifts to the counter-terrorists.<br><br>Let a minute or two bleed off, kill the few mindless rushing terrorists, and enjoy a nice numeric advantage against the wise terrorists that are still left guarding the hostages.<br><br>3. AWM delight.<br>There should always be at least one out of every five counter-terrorists that purchases an AWM/AWP sniper rifle each round. This is because of the nature of most hostage rescue maps, which have long approach lanes for counter-terrorists to navigate as they try to get close to the hostages. In maps like Office, Canyon Siege, Militia, Estate, and Italy, there are plenty of long-distance angles that sniping counter-terrorists can exploit as the rest of the team rushes toward the terrorist camps.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Pitch a Tent<br><br>Terrorists' role on hostage rescue maps is very simple: Guard the hostages. To accomplish this goal, the terrorists must work together in groups, preferably all within close range of the hostages. Here are a few general tips.<br><br>1. Like it or not, it's camping time.<br>On almost all the hostage rescue maps, guarding or camping near the hostage rescue point tends to let terrorists hold a natural advantage over their counter-terrorist opponents. The Assault map is the perfect example, and many players detest playing as counter-terrorists on Assault due to what they perceive to be excessive terrorist camping. Terrorists win, however, because their spawn point forces them to stick together, pool their fire, and cover all counter-terrorist entry points.<br><br>2. Purchase rifles, not submachine guns.<br>Yes, the MP5 is one of the most accurate and easiest weapons in Counter-Strike to use, even for those unskilled in burst-firing. But the reality is that you will be guarding hostages in buildings, behind doors, and around boxes, and you will need the AK-47's incredible penetrating power and bullet damage to mount a defense against marauding counter-terrorists. The SIG-552 also makes for a great terrorist weapon on hostage rescue maps due to its penetration and zoom capabilities.<br><br>3. Watch the grenades.<br>It's tempting to hang back while guarding hostages and purchase limitless grenades to throw from relative safety as terrorists, particularly on maps like Canyon Siege and Assault. You should use caution and good judgment when doing so, since it's very easy to injure or blind one of your own teammates. And improper use of the smoke grenade will only help the counter-terrorists on hostage rescue maps, since it provides cover for them to get closer to the terrorist base camp as a group.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bomb Defuse Strategies<br><br>Your counter-terrorist team has been tasked with the ultimate challenge. Prevent a group of known terrorists from planting and detonating an explosive device near innocent civilians.<br><br>Eight of the 20 maps in Counter-Strike are of the bomb/defuse variety, and each has two targets that terrorists can bomb, which means you'll be planting and defusing lots of bombs if you play the game at any length. Here are some ways to make your terrorist or counter-terrorist team more successful.<br><br>Each map has two spots to plant the bomb.<br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Know Your Role<br>It's fun being terrorists on bomb maps thanks to the evil satisfaction that comes from successfully delivering your unstable payload. But for counter-terrorists the bomb maps are a challenge. To win, counter-terrorists must know what their specific duties are as part of the team each round and how to execute those duties. Here's some help to make the experience easier.<br><br>1. Divided you stand, united you fall.<br>Former President Abraham Lincoln may have been correct when he told the U.S. that only by remaining united could the nation survive, but for Counter-Strike bomb maps, he was way off the mark. As counter-terrorists, you've got to identify which of the map's two bomb spots the terrorists are heading toward immediately. If you leave it to chance by just guessing each round, you'll let the terrorists succeed more often than not. To do this, split your team into two groups and pursue the entry paths to both bomb spots by rushing. The exact second one of the teams identifies the larger group of the terrorists, have it quickly send a message to the entire team as to which bomb spot the terrorists are heading toward. A one word message that was previously agreed on like "one" or "two" can be all that's needed to effectively tell the squad which of the two spots to close in on.<br><br>2. Buy defusal kits.<br>While this might sound obvious, there are still many counter-terrorists that forget to purchase the optional bomb defusing kits in the chaos that is the beginning of each game round. Bomb defusing kits let you defuse twice as fast as normal, and carrying this item can mean the difference between success and failure. They are not optional to any counter-terrorist that wants the best chance of winning. Remember that even if you kill every terrorist in the round, if he's managed to plant the bomb before he died, you will still lose the round if you can't defuse the bomb in time.<br><br>3. Guard the bomb<br>If you or another team member kills the bomb-carrying terrorist, make sure to stay near the dropped bomb and prevent any other terrorists from picking it up. Remember, if the terrorists don't plant the bomb within the time limit, your team will win, so keep those terrorists away as long as possible.<br><br>4. Listen carefully.<br>Sometimes terrorists will plant the bomb away from your direct line of sight. You should always look out for the bomb's distinct beeping noise. If you can hear the bomb, but you don't see it, check the not-so-obvious areas, like behind a column or on top of the crate.<br><br>5. A difficult choice.<br>In some cases, there'll be no way to get to the bomb in time to defuse it. If the bomb's beeping seems frantic, you're better off running away. This way, you won't die needlessly and be forced to buy another gun at the start of the next round.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Run Like Hell<br><br>On bomb defusal maps, the terrorist team plays a role similar to the one counter-terrorist's play on assassination maps. Namely it must escort and protect the bomb carrier on the way to the final area where the bomb will be set to explode. The similarities between the two scenarios don't end there, as terrorists also must determine which pathway to the bomb point makes the most strategic sense to pursue.<br><br>Here are a few things you can do as terrorists on bomb maps that will rout the counter-terrorists and maximize your chance for winning.<br><br>1. It's all about planting.<br>As a terrorist, you should always check for the green bomb icon on the left side of your screen. If you see it, that means you're the bomb carrier. Sometimes, the terrorist with the bomb is oblivious to the fact that he's carrying it. Be aware of your situation at all times. If you're the bomb carrier, you have one goal, which is to plant the bomb. Think of nothing else, and certainly don't forget that you're carrying precious cargo that can win the round outright for your team.<br><br>2. Stay with the bomb carrier.<br>Again, like the counter-terrorist's role in VIP protection, you must stick with the bomb carrier as he proceeds to the target for two main reasons. First, you provide additional firepower and another pair of eyes to monitor the path from both in front and behind as you move to the bomb site. Second, if the bomb carrier gets killed, and you live, you can pick up the bomb yourself and continue the mission. Your weapon choice on bomb maps should reflect this multirole strategy: no short-range shotguns, and no long-range AWMs. Stick to the AK-47 and SIG 552 rifle and go with the MP5 if you're strapped for cash. A good flashbang grenade or two can also go a long way in distracting or stopping counter-terrorists from rushing the bomb carrier if they correctly guess which bomb site you're headed to.<br><br>3. Proper placement.<br>Each map has two bomb areas, which are clearly denoted by round targets on the ground. If you're carrying the bomb, the green icon will start flashing, indicating that you can plant the bomb. While the bomb areas are usually fairly small, you should plant the bombs in hard-to-find or heard-to-reach areas, like on top of a crate. This makes it tougher for the counter-terrorists to find and get to the bomb in time.<br><br>4. Dropped bombs.<br>The second that your bomb carrier has been killed, the game will tell you that the bomb has been dropped through a text message across the center of your screen. When this happens, you should quickly begin sweeping the map to locate the loose bomb on the ground. Many players go through round after round as terrorists thinking that their goals for the map only involve killing enemy counter-terrorists. If you play smart and are aware of your team's condition at all times, you'll always succeed in planting the bomb.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Office<br>Type: Hostage rescue<br>Hostage location: Rear upper level of the office building<br>Size: Medium<br><br>The layout of Office got a major retooling for the official v1.0 release of Counter-Strike. The changes were difficult to adjust to versus earlier beta releases of the game - here's how we recommend you handle the new dynamics of this exciting map.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: A Little Camping Goes a Long Way<br><br>The counter-terrorist spawn point is vulnerable in as little as seven seconds into each round, so make sure you buy weapons and get to safety ASAP if you spawn in the open. If the terrorists rush out of the office's forward windows, you'll be in a good position to take them all out as they penetrate the counter-terrorist base. To facilitate this, have your team monitor the exit windows and mechanical door that face the counter-terrorist spawn point closely as the round begins. Also, plant at least one counter-terrorist with a zoom-capable weapon (AWM, AUG, and so on) in the long tunnel behind the APC to scan and kill any terrorists that try and rush the long back way.<br><br>To rescue the hostages cleanly, clear out any camping resistance near the inner mechanical door by hitting it with high-explosive grenades as you open it from your side. Then, rush as a group toward the hostages, eliminating any terrorists that are still left.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Keep the Doors Closed and Watch for a Blind-Side Blitz<br><br>With the right strategy, counter-terrorists can dominate Office fairly easily if the terrorists don't adjust quickly.<br><br>Leave the large glass window, located to the left of your spawn point, intact. While subtle, this is really a great way to deceive any counter-terrorists that rush the terrorist spawn point via the long covered tunnel that begins at their base. Instead of shattering the large window and jumping down to intercept the counter-terrorists at the beginning of each round, take the stairs to the right and camp in the small doorway exit that leads out to the APC. This way, the rushing counter-terrorists will emerge from the tunnel and see that the window is still intact and immediately assume that no terrorists have come this way. While they're now thinking they've got a free run into the terrorist base via the stairs, two terrorists that are camping the stairwell will dispatch the unaware counter-terrorists with alarming quickness - and tip the balance of the round into their favor.<br><br>Also, stay away from the inner mechanical door. At the start of each match, the counter-terrorist team usually swarms the other side of the door, which can only be opened by them. If you peak through the door's small portholes, you'll likely catch a bullet to the head. Instead, hang back and make visual contact with the counter-terrorists as they approach it. Once you see the door start to slide upward, let loose with a barrage of fire that's angled low. While one team is watching the two forward entry points into the office, another should secure the rear-access area of the base (where the APC is) by using the technique we described in the preceding "glass window" strategy. This way, once the few tunnel-rushing counter-terrorists are dead, you've got a clear path to rush as a group into the quad of the counter-terrorist base. Office is one of the few maps where rushing terrorists that leave the hostages defenseless won't suffer because of it - enjoy it!<br><br>Once in the counter-terrorist base, camp it responsibly. If you find the base empty, you know that the remaining counter-terrorists are in the terrorist building and are probably rescuing the hostages. This is actually good news for you because now your team can camp at the counter-terrorist base's sniper points in the tunnel and above the APC. Remember, the counter-terrorists must bring the hostages back to the outside quad where you're now waiting.<br><br>There are plenty of spots for terrorists to hide indoors.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>A counter-terrorist with an AWM rifle in the dark corner of the tunnel can always get a handful of kills each round. Crouching in that area makes you very difficult to spot by terrorists rushing through the tunnel. Also, a kneeling counter-terrorist with a Colt M4 or Steyr AUG at the top of either of the two stairwells behind the counter-terrorist APC can also get two or three kills every once in awhile. Terrorists always seem to run right up the stairs before checking to see if someone's up there, and they usually pay for it dearly because head shots are much easier to achieve if the target is below your point of view. Also, in the stairwell to the left of counter-terrorist APC, camping on top of the crate facing the stairs is a sure way to land a number of terrorist kills.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Italy<br>Type: Hostage rescue<br>Hostage location: First and second stories of the small building located at the rear of the terrorist base<br>Size: Medium<br><br>Italy is the favorite map of many Counter-Strike players and for good reason. With a variety of pathways, corridors, sharp texture maps, and two rocking jukeboxes (not really), Italy offers challenges for the beginner and expert alike.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Many Possible Attack Points<br><br>One of the most balanced maps in the game, Italy throws up several questions at the beginning of each round for both sides that must be answered quickly and decisively. For counter-terrorists, the decision of whether to rush outright or get set up in good, covered positions and brace for the terrorist arrival is paramount, as is weapon selection.<br><br>We recommend the following. Purchase a multirole weapon (Colt M4 or AUG), rush into the second story opening that faces the counter-terrorist spawn point, and shake camping or rushing terrorists loose with high-explosive or flashbang grenades in the hallways as you advance. Once you emerge back into the sunlight, proceed to the terrorist base camp and do a little recon to figure out if any lurking terrorists are guarding the hostages. If the area is clear, rescue the hostages and take them to safety via the long tunnel immediately in front of the building you just emerged from. If the area has one or two camping terrorists, use the deadly long-range accuracy of the M4 or AUG to pick them off from as far away as possible, letting you escape with as little damage as possible.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Guard the Hostages<br><br>The strategy for Italy is relatively simple. Unless you enjoy a numeric advantage versus the counter-terrorist squad, stay at the terrorist base and guard the hostages. There are great spots to camp from the windows of the base itself to the overhead bridge overpass to the entry of the beginning of the counter-terrorist building. At each point, most of your team is visible, which makes it easy to determine where a breakout point might be occurring. Play smart. Score better.<br><br>Camp from these windows to get the jump on swarming counter-terrorists.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>There's no doubt that the AWM can rule on Italy if used properly by either side. In fact, as a counter-terrorist, one of the easiest ways you can get into the heads of your opponent is by simply buying an AWM at your spawn point, backing up three or four feet, crouching, and waiting for rushing terrorists to appear in your scope from any of the three entry points. There's enough distance for you to miss a shot or two and still take care of business. Likewise, the second story window camping spot that guards the tunnel entry to the terrorist base serves up some easy kills for any terrorists willing to use an AWM to pick off counter-terrorists that think the tunnel entrance is a good pathway to the hostages.<br><br>In that same tunnel, there's a recessed stairwell to the right and an alcove to the left. As a terrorist, you can camp in either spot, wait for counter-terrorists to rush blindly past, and open fire.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Militia<br>Type: Hostage rescue<br>Hostage location: In the basement and garage<br>Size: Large<br><br>Militia is a golden oldie of Counter-Strike - almost a year old in fact - and yet it still continues to battle with Dust and Italy as the most played map in the game. Militia presents problems for counter-terrorists each round, particularly if the terrorists win early and build up a cash reserve that lets them purchase AWMs. Here's how to play the map:<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Rush and Conquer<br><br>One of the first mistakes that counter-terrorist squads tend to make on Militia is lack of action. The American military has operated for more than 200 years with a motto that basically comes down to one simple premise: If you're not taking ground, you're losing ground.<br><br>On Militia, if your counter-terrorist group camps at the beginning, there's a good chance you'll be outflanked by terrorists via the sewer and overcome from both the front and rear. Also, terrorists with AWMs can make the frontal rush area a nightmare for you right away, so it's better to stick together, pounce into the sewer, and use flashbangs and high-explosive grenades to blow through any sewer-camping terrorists. Once control of the sewer is gained, the underground cameras within it can be used to effectively scout the hostage area for house-sweeping terrorists that are guarding your hostages. Use this info, emerge from the sewer, and enter the house through the window of the upper bedroom near the terrorist spawn point. Entering through the downstairs door might seem quicker, but the squeak of the opening door will alert terrorists to your location. Once the hostages are secured, grab them and leave the house via the rear door, then proceed to the front by going around the perimeter.<br><br>It's difficult to rescue the hostages by going back through the open area to your counter-terrorist base due to your inherent vulnerability, but it's nearly impossible to get the hostages to correctly navigate the ladders into the sewer, so the canyon is your only fast option.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: You've Got the Advantage - Use It<br><br>It's tempting to sit on Militia as a terrorist and just camp on the roof with an AWM round after round, zapping advancing counter-terrorists in the canyon. But this strategy won't win consistently once the counter-terrorists adapt, and it does a disservice to the rest of your AK-toting teammates who must battle in the trenches.<br><br>The best bet as terrorists on Militia is to rapidly rush and close the distance to the counter-terrorist spawn point via both the sewer and canyon. It's very easy to monitor the death indicator to determine the counter-terrorist's main path, meaning that if you're encountering no resistance in the sewer, and your teammates are killing or being killed in a different area, it's a safe bet that the main counter-terrorist force is going topside to the target. The same thing goes for rushing up top - if you see indications that the real firefight is going on in the sewer, rush the backside. If the counter-terrorists aren't advancing at full speed, they're going to be obliterated by you from the flank.<br><br>The roof gives you an elevated view of the action below.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>One way to anger some counter-terrorists is to grab all four hostages and take them to either the upstairs bathroom or the garage downstairs. While there, push the hostages so that all four are blocking the doors. That way, the counter-terrorist can't open the doors. When they open fire in frustration, they'll kill their own hostages, losing valuable money. Likewise, when you're standing on the other side of the door, you can aim in between the hostages with a penetrating rifle and fire at the counter-terrorists trying to come in.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cobble<br>Type: Bomb defuse<br>Size: Large<br><br>Cobble is a very fun bomb map, much more so than you think it's going to be after the first few times you play it. The map's layout has many idiosyncrasies, including the three sniper spots, the two tunnels, and multiple bomb points.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Stay Close to the Bomb Points<br><br>Both bomb points in Cobble are within a few seconds of each other, which is rare on Counter-Strike bomb maps and makes the job of the counter-terrorist squad a little easier. The danger, though, is when your team is pursuing or mopping up the terrorists aggressively and leaving the two spots more open than they should be for a mad bomber to sneak into.<br><br>To avoid this problem, the counter-terrorist squad must split into two teams and patrol the entrance areas to the two bomb points. Since the first bomb spot is actually to the left of where the counter-terrorist team spawns each round, it's easy to send half the team down the ramp in front of it to shut down any terrorists that may try to hit the counter-terrorist bomb spot.<br><br>The other half must go immediately through the broken wall opening to the right and intercept bold terrorists that are running full speed to the second bomb spot through the tunnel.<br><br>Remember that the terrorists must complete their mission to win (unless they kill all of you of course), and to do that, they've got to rush eventually. Prepare yourself by taking up covered positions around boxes and corners that open up into firing lanes for you and your team to use to cut down approaching terrorists. One thing to be aware of is that MP5-toting terrorists can run and close the distance to the second bomb spot extremely quickly each round due to the weapon's extremely small speed penalty on movement. By the time a Para-using counter-terrorist enters the tunnel that leads to the terrorist base, there's a good chance that a camping terrorist is already behind him ready to kill with that light MP5.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Use the Left Corridor as Much as Possible<br><br>Thanks to the counter-terrorist sniper points that are so easily accessible and tempting for its squad to use each round, we don't recommend that terrorists rush to the first bomb spot via the ramp that's straight ahead of them each round.<br><br>Instead, rush up the stairs to the left and proceed quickly into the tunnel that leads to the second bomb spot. Do not delay and move with authority. You will be in a more secure spot when the rushing counter-terrorists arrive to cut you off at the same time. Bust out the tunnel using flashbang grenades and strafe to the left as you exit the tunnel into daylight. Resist the temptation to jump down and rush the counter-terrorist base once you're through the tunnel and move with the bomb carrier to the bomb spot that's farther into the open area. Once the bomb is planted, take up positions behind both boxes near the target and look for counter-terrorists coming through the same tunnel you did and the uneven doors far down the pathway. With you kneeling and stationary and partly covered by a box, and the counter-terrorists running toward you upright at full speed, your shots will be much more accurate, and you can saw through them without much damage at all.<br><br>This quad is overlooked by three sniper nests, so keep moving.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>There are a lot of infuriating llama camp spots on Cobble, the most infuriating one being the very upper sniping spot near the terrorist spawn point.<br><br>Due to a glitch in the game (which can be fixed with the latest patches), terrorists (or counter-terrorists for that matter) can actually jump into the boarded up wall that's to the left of the small window that overlooks the counter-terrorist rush area. Once they're in the wall, they cannot be seen from the outside, but they can see anyone in the room perfectly. Many times, counter-terrorists will rush the tower because they were shot at and baited from the room by an evil terrorist and find no one up there until it's too late.<br><br>Don't pull any of this nonsense around a server administrator though, as this exploit is very high on the "I'm kicking you off and banning you for life" scale.<br><br></div>

Camping terrorists can make it so stressful that many veteran Counter-Strike players won't play as counter-terrorists, fearing that their enjoyment of the game will be minimal.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Move Out<br><br>To achieve success on this map, the first thing you should do is rush outward, away from the bomb spots. Why? Despite the large distance between the two bomb spots, the fact is, if the counter-terrorists can rush each round and achieve superiority over the rope bridge early, they can eliminate the most popular route that most terrorists take. Also, once the rushing counter-terrorists are past the bridge, they're free to pursue the final route to the second bomb spot without any duress from terrorists.<br><br>Beware when entering either bomb spot from a conventional angle, as they both have very covered positions that terrorists can camp at once they've deployed the bomb. Also, be sure to save a final flashbang for the bomb areas, as doing so will let you enter the bomb area without being gunned down immediately.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Take the Direct Route<br><br>There are many paths to the two bomb spots on Aztec, but you should take the direct route to the second spot, bypassing both the underground swamps and the rope bridge. This path is rarely taken, and thus, counter-terrorists always seem to leave it woefully unprotected.<br><br>Rush left between the split doors that open up to the boxed area where the counter-terrorists spawn and continue left along the tunneled path to the second bomb spot, located next to the column. Beware of camping counter-terrorists along the way, but don't be overly concerned because it's very rare for players to camp in an area that few, if any, terrorists ever go down. Most counter-terrorists will immediately go across the bridge or down into the swamps each round, leaving you a free run. Use it!<br><br>This tunnel leads to the first bomb spot.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>If you've got a buddy playing with you on the counter-terrorist side, this map can be tough as nails for terrorists. Set yourself up with an AWM on the rope bridge and tell your buddy to watch to the right, where rushing terrorists often appear to kill the exposed sniper. With you eliminating rope-bridge runners, and your friend moping up rushing terrorists from the other side, the only spot left unprotected is the second bomb spot, which the rest of the team can patrol.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Train<br>Type: Bomb defuse<br>Size: Medium<br><br>Set in a run-down train yard, Train offers players on both sides interesting strategical options each round. For the terrorists, there are four major paths, each independent, that lead to the two bomb spots. The bomb spots are close together, so protection of the deployed bomb is a must. For counter-terrorists, Train seems like it's fairly wide open. If you rush too far into the terrorist area, the bomb will get deployed behind you by a terrorist that took one of the multiple alternate routes.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Get Them from Behind<br><br>As a counter-terrorist on Train, there's one correct path to take each round to protect both bomb spots while obliterating the terrorist team. After spawning in, buy weapons and immediately rush the entrance to the rear bomb spot area, which is present to your left. Run down the long corridor, and as you approach the staircase that leads upward and toward the terrorist base, beware of advancing opponents. If you meet resistance, roll through them. You've got the advantage of speed. They don't expect you to be so bold, as most counter-terrorists hang back a bit on this map, and they're likely getting grenades ready to throw into the area.<br><br>Once you're through with the indoor terrorists, emerge into daylight at their spawn point and immediately take a right turn. This will put you back on the path to the first bomb spot, but now you should be behind the terrorists and in a good position to pick them off as they attempt to plant the bomb in the number three tunnel. Don't camp; don't dilly-dally. Just rush and cover both bomb spots in this sweeping manner.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Move Quickly<br><br>As tempting as it may seem, ignore the impulse to rush toward the first bomb spot by running straight ahead after you spawn. While that small tunnel will deposit you just a few yards from the bomb area, odds are that at least one or two counter-terrorists will have chosen that exact path to rush toward your base. If you get held up here, even for just a few seconds, other counter-terrorists that rushed the primary exit into the outdoor train yard area will soon be firing at you from behind, effectively dooming you in a pincer movement.<br><br>Instead, take the stairs to the right, rush straight down the path at full speed (knives out only), and jump clear down into the second train yard access point. If you time it right and get out your weapon while you're in the air, you have the safety blanket coverage of a few wooden boxes to block any counter-terrorist's line of sight, and you can saw him in half with AK-fire as he comes up the small ramp.<br><br>After you've cleared the second bomb point, and the counter-terrorists are bewildered as they don't see a single terrorist near the spawn point, plant the bomb under the train car and take up positions to aggressively defend it. Remember, if the bomb kills you, the game won't record that as a kill for the other team, so your ratio of kills to deaths still looks good each round. Remember, defend the bomb spot until you are dead, one way or the other.<br><br>Once you plant the bomb, stay near it until it explodes.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>Want to irk some aggressive counter-terrorists? Pitch a tent and set up camp deep along the wall at the terrorist base with an AWM. You'll have a clear shot at all three openings that the counter-terrorists can rush your spawn point through, and they likely won't think to look your direction as they emerge from the one closest to you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dust<br>Type: Bomb defuse<br>Size: Large<br><br>Dust is certainly the most popular map in Counter-Strike. Even though it's been a part of the game for almost a year now, it still dominates the rest of the maps in terms of how many servers are playing it at any given moment. This is principally because, to the novice player, Dust seems to promote rushing by both teams each round, which few other maps do. Regardless of its appeal, if you don't play well on Dust, you're doomed to many hours of miserable Counter-Strike existence. Here's how to play - and dominate - this fast moving map.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: It's All About Containment<br><br>Most players thinks that Dust is a rush map for both sides, even though there are two exposed and vulnerable bomb spots the counter-terrorists should protect. The danger, as always, is over-penetration of the terrorist base and the subsequent sound that strikes a deathblow through a counter-terrorist's heart: "The bomb has been planted." Now that doesn't mean your team should light a campfire and get comfortable at the bomb points. That goes against the nature of the map, and you're just not going to get teammates to listen to your camping logic when they could be running all around killing terrorists.<br><br>The practical way to play Dust as a counter-terrorist in the real world is about containment. You've got to contain the terrorist advance not only to protect your flank, but to simultaneously guard the bomb spots. As you spawn each round, buy your gear and get moving. Rush immediately to the right and enter the first bomb spot area. If you're good with a grenade, lob a high-explosive grenade into the tunnel entrance without breaking stride as you move through the doors into the first bomb spot area. About half the time, you'll injure or kill any marauding terrorists that are wisely rushing to the first bomb spot themselves.<br><br>Once you're in the first bomb area, you've got to quickly do one of two things. Either take cover behind a box that lets you fire at the opening of the terrorist tunnel entrance that's on your side or rush that opening and deny access to the tunnel completely. If you rush, be aware that you may walk right into two or three terrorists, some of which have probably already thrown grenades down the tunnel. But if you and a few others can secure the tunnel, you're in the tall cotton because you'll be single-handedly denying half the useful map to the terrorist team.<br><br>Once the tunnel is secured, advance to the terrorist base, but with caution. There are always some tenorists camping near the tunnel opening that leads to their base, and they just love drilling aggressive counter-terrorists. It's better to wait for your team to drop down under the bridge and come up from behind them.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Stick Together<br><br>If there was ever a map that demanded precision, speed, and teamwork as a terrorist, it's Dust. Every time you spawn into the round, you've got to buy your goods and get your feet moving. And don't stop or hesitate on your way to the bomb spot.<br><br>It doesn't matter if you rush left to the first bomb spot, which is easier, or down under the bridge to the counter-terrorist bomb spot - you've got to rush like mad. There's no way that three or four terrorists can't bash their way through that dangerous no man's land that the tunnel offers to both sides, and the payoff is a free run to plant the bomb without any pain. If you get held up in your half of the tunnel, for any reason, there's a good chance you're going to lose no matter how good your coverage is.<br><br>The reason why is that the onus to win the round rests squarely on the terrorist's shoulders, and if you get into a stalemate with the counter-terrorists that takes up time and bullets, you're going to be hard pressed to make up lost time. Plus, you're vulnerable from the backside to any counter-terrorists that rush under the bridge and come up the ramp to your rear. Get your team on the same page, rush forward with near-reckless abandon, and grenade the first tunnel opening as you approach it. After you throw your grenade and clear the dangerous opening, get your rifle out because you may have to clear out a rushing counter-terrorist or two that took our advice and went to the tunnel via the first bomb spot.<br><br>This tunnel has a lot of cover, but it's still easy to get sniped from above.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>If it seems that the AWM is always at the center of these cheap trick sections, it's with good reason. No other weapon actually gives you a chance to take down two or three enemies while keeping you relatively safe.<br><br>Buy an AWM as a terrorist and rush to the exit point of the ramp that leads the counter-terrorists to your spawn point. Since you're at a high elevation, you can hear the pitter patter of little counter-terrorist feet before they're aware of you, and since the AWP is a relentless toe killer, you can wipe out two or three counter-terrorists without any damage. Once that's done, set up shop on one of the boxes that overlooks both the ramp exit and the terrorist entrance to the tunnel. Rushing counter-terrorists must come toward you via one of these pathways, and there's a good chance you'll get a kill or two in before they overwhelm you.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Prodigy<br>Type: Bomb defuse<br>Size: Medium<br><br>Prodigy is one of the more intense maps in Counter-Strike, both because it offers furious tunnel-based combat and because it forces players to use their quick wits and action for eventual success by either side. Other maps like Train and Back Alley have attempted to duplicate the successful formula that makes the tunnel in Prodigy so fearful, but with mixed results. The bottom line for anyone who runs the tunnel gambit is that Prodigy must be attacked in stages, no matter which pathway to the bomb spots is chosen.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Defend the Tunnel Entrance<br><br>All out rushing doesn't tend to work for counter-terrorists on this map, as there are just too many covered terrorist positions that are hard to get a shot off at. Instead, your team should use a balance of rushing and camping. If you decide to guard the lower, more popular bomb spot, rush to the tunnel entrance and arm yourself with a high-explosive grenade. Hold off until you see the whites of their eyes and throw the grenade toward the entrance. If you overthrow it, you'll see it careen off the cliff and into the abyss below, wasting it. Aim for the actual entrance of the tunnel because your goal is to surprise rushing terrorists.<br><br>Once you've equipped yourself with your rifle again, take a covered spot behind a box and watch for terrorists that strafe back and forth across the opening on their side. Since Counter-Strike gives an accuracy penalty to all weapons that are fired while on the move, and you're behind a stationary covered position, you've got the advantage. Don't rush too far into the tunnel, though, because you're not the only one that can purchase and use grenades.<br><br>Your second option is to head right up the stairs and go outside to the quad, where you'll meet terrorists rushing toward the second, less popular bomb spot. If you're quick, try to get to the top of the building in the quad. Doing so will give you an excellent advantage over terrorists emerging from their garage.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Take the Low Road<br><br>It's so tempting to rush that tunnel each round, particularly if you lost the round before and are bent on revenge. Before doing so, you should consider heading up the stairs to the vending machine area by the APC. There, you can lay down a significant amount of fire from a number of secure positions. Each round, you should advance into the area just enough to get a good firing angle on any counter-terrorists. It's important though, to make sure no one on your team strafes the opening that leads to both bomb spots because you must maintain an element of stealth. The reason why is that the counter-terrorist squad will quickly become bored with watching the opening to the vending machine area and surrender its prime covered positions to rush toward you. Again, since the terrorists the ones moving into your field of fire now, they'll be at the disadvantage, which is rare, considering that, most of the time on Prodigy, the counter-terrorists are mostly stationary while terrorists attack.<br><br>Once you've cleared the area, rush to the left and go down the small stairs toward the lower bomb spot. That's right, rush the lower bomb spot here even though the upper bomb spot is slightly closer. This is because the lower bomb spot has a near total lack of covered positions for counter-terrorists to ambush you from, which is a stark contrast to the multiple death zones you might encounter when rushing the upper bomb spot.<br><br>Plant the bomb, camp like mad, and prevent the counter-terrorists from defusing it by picking your shots and not abandoning the bomb until the final seconds before it explodes.<br><br>This is a favorite camp spot for counter-terrorists.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>Prodigy's design seems to calm down counter-terrorist teams and gets them to think about using one of the many camping spots that the boxes and walls offer. One that's particularly enjoyable, though, is the large set of pipes that runs along the wall at the counter-terrorist spawn point. When you spawn in as a counter-terrorist, go straight for the ladder that leads to the vent assembly. But instead of going into the vent, stop before you enter the ceiling and look to your right from the ladder. You'll see that you're slightly above those tall pipes and can jump right on to them. Once you're on the pipes, walk all the way back to where the pipes merge into the wall by the short stairs. Then, crouch and turn around to face the tunnel opening.<br><br>From this vantage point, you can drill any terrorist that attempts to plant the bomb at the lower spot, even if he comes from behind you because of all the poor light. Plus, it's just a pain to hit a counter-terrorist in that spot when you're strafing, and he's crouched and stationary.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nuke<br>Type: Bomb defuse Size: Medium<br>Nuke is a fairly popular map, particularly for clan matches. The reason why stems from its strong balance and emphasis on strategy as well as its size and accessibility.<br><br>Counter-Terrorist Perspective: Don't Camp in One Area<br><br>There are a few different ways to handle the challenge of Nuke as a counter-terrorist, but the most effective method is to have a majority of the team rush straight ahead and to the right with the intention of clearing any terrorists out on the way. This leads the bulk of your team to the terrorist spawn point, at which time you can then circle back indoors and enter the upper bomb spot in the warehouse. Meanwhile, one or two counter-terrorists should stay behind near your team's spawn point to monitor the back door path to the lower bomb spot from a covered position. If they see a cadre of terrorists escorting a bomb carrier via the outdoor path, they must let the primary counter-terrorist force know the bomb is heading in that direction.<br><br>Also, don't camp. Although Nuke offers some great counter-terrorist camping spots like the overhead girders of the warehouse (over the upper bomb spot) or the dark vents near the second bomb spot, it's too easy for the bomb carrier to figure out where you're hiding and go to the other spot. Rush as a group and sweep all areas as fast as possible.<br><br>Terrorist Perspective: Again, Stick Together<br><br>For a successful bomb plant, you and the terrorist squad must seek out the bomb spots with authority and discipline. Your team shouldn't split up and should rotate approach paths and bomb spots after each round, so you don't let the counter-terrorists ambush you. On the way to the bomb spot, be aware of potential counter-terrorists camping locations, as you don't want your bomber getting mowed down in a hail of bullets from some box or other covered spot.<br><br>Pause at the entry to the bomb spots and flush any counter-terrorists out with flashbangs and high-explosive grenades before you assault the main areas. And stay away from AWM rifles on this map, no matter how tempting some of the long-distance angles may seem each round. Instead, focus on powerful burst-fire weapons like the AK-47 or SIG 552 rifles, which excel in a multirole capacity.<br><br>This area will leave you exposed while you plant the bomb.<br>Llama Tip<br><br>Lots of terrorists do the following all the time, and it irks counter-terrorist players no end. As a terrorist, camp behind the first, small upraised area of ground deep in your spawn area. Kneel with an AWM rifle and zoom in once until the entrance to your spawn point fills the full field of your vision. Rushing counter-terrorists must enter the area from a good distance away from you, plus they're blocked by the troop truck that's parked at the opening. Blast them as they enter, and you may pick up two or three kills, some with a single shot, thanks to their forced single-file approach.<br><br></div>
