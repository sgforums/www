              <p>This is a topic for you all to recommand good locations for cycling</p>
              <p>Let me start off. first..........</p>
              <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Park Connectors</span></p>
              <p>These are good locations for cycling</p>
              <p>Locations: All around singapore, just spot the black path with PCN printed on them and it is what you are looking for</p>
              <p>Max speed: Using my small small bike, i can reach a approxmate 15kph as not many people are on the track and the track is long and striaght at most portions, terrain wise is good, except of occasional bumps that may be found along those regions that you need to take care of.</p>
              <p>Lighting: Full lighting possible</p>
              <p>Facilities: Seats with or without shelters are available, occasionly, bike stands are also available for locking of bikes, in addition, in certain parts of the track, it reaches a park where toilets are available. PCN Pitstop at Sun Plaza Park also provides drinks and bike rental, costs are unknown. </p>
              <p>Bus Services: Most PCN are acessible by bus. </p>

              <p><br>PCN stands for Park Connector Network.</p>
              <p>The route which you tried from East Coast to Changi Village is known as the Coastal Park Connector. I have not yet cycled on this route but I have walked the full 7.9km. Took bus service 35 to Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal then walk there. Took me around 2 hours plus to complete.</p>
              <p>I have also walked on the small path alongside the 2 big monsoon drains which run paraell to the Coastal Park Connector. They are known as Changi Collector Drain (North) and (South). North drain is near Aviation Park, South drain is near East Coast Park and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. Not advisable to cycle as the path is narrow and when come to the end of the drain, has to walk through low grass area to get out to the main road,  and also some part of the path completely covered with grass, the north drain there has fallen trees almost blocking the path. However the scenary is nice, all around are trees and vegetation. Very deserted except for one or two fishing there.</p>

              <p>No la lol. They pour the ashes into the sea is to simbolize returning the body to the dead.</p>
              <p>Anyway, be extra careful on PCNs. Some have blind spots created by long bushes and trees. Dun assume the turn infront is always empty. Sekali you chiong then a person pops up and you hit him, thats it. Time to wait for mata chia. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>LOL</p>
              <p>I thought I was the only mad bastard who tried biking along the drain to see how far it would go.</p>
              <p>I gave up 3/4 way because I was fed-up with bashing through overgrown grass and fallen trees.</p>
              <p>But....the scenery was indeed good. Despite the curses heaped onto me by my friends...</p>
              <p>The best scenery offered is at the mouth of the canal at Tanah Merah Ferry Ter. Stray dogs inhabit that area although they are generally ok with people. The breeze there, with the sea-gulls around you is well-worth the distance extended into the sea.</p>
