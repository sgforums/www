              <p>I thought I was the only mad bastard who tried biking along the drain to see how far it would go.</p>
              <p>I gave up 3/4 way because I was fed-up with bashing through overgrown grass and fallen trees.</p>
              <p>But....the scenery was indeed good. Despite the curses heaped onto me by my friends...</p>
              <p>The best scenery offered is at the mouth of the canal at Tanah Merah Ferry Ter. Stray dogs inhabit that area although they are generally ok with people. The breeze there, with the sea-gulls around you is well-worth the distance extended into the sea.</p>

              <p>There are 2 drains that run paraell to the park connector, ie. the north drain and the south drain. The mouth of the north drain is near Changi Aviation Park and the mouth of the south drain is near Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal. The 2 drains do not connect to each other. There is forested area between the 2 drains. I had to get out to the park connector after reaching the end of either one of the drain.</p>
              <p>The overgrown grass and fallen trees is at the north drain. South drain also has fallen trees but they fell into the drain not onto the path. So it is easier to walk alongside the south drain.</p>
              <p>Agreed with you that the nice scenery there is at the mouth of the south drain, I have been to the end of the rock bund where there is a yellow beacon. Can see Batam and also our CBD in the distance on a clear day.</p>
