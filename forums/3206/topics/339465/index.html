              <h1>Want jail credit? Just clean up blood, vomit, etc.</h1>
              <p>MILWAUKEE – <span id="lw_1228356727_0" class="yshortcuts">Milwaukee County jail inmates</span> can knock an hour off their sentence for each hour they spend on some dirty work — cleaning up blood, feces, saliva and other <span id="lw_1228356727_1" class="yshortcuts">bodily fluids</span> at the <span id="lw_1228356727_2" class="yshortcuts">House of Correction</span> and <span id="lw_1228356727_3" class="yshortcuts">Criminal Justice Facility</span>.</p>
              <p>Sheriff David Clarke said it's a common-sense approach to clean-up chores no one is eager to take on.</p>
              <p>"Look,
              somebody has to do it," Clarke said. "It's cost effective because the
              alternative is to pay a county worker to do the job. With pay and
              benefits, that comes to $30 an hour."</p>
              <p>Those who volunteer get biohazard training and protective gear.</p>
              <p>"This
              isn't heart surgery and it's not like we're asking them to handle
              nuclear waste," Clarke said. "It's janitorial work and they do have to
              be trained properly because of <span id="lw_1228356727_4" class="yshortcuts">AIDS</span> and <span id="lw_1228356727_5" class="yshortcuts">hepatitis</span>."</p>
              <p>Records show two inmates have earned time off under the program.</p>
              <p>A 33-year-old-<span id="lw_1228356727_6" class="yshortcuts">West Allis</span> man convicted of fraud on a taxicab driver, <span id="lw_1228356727_7" class="yshortcuts">disorderly conduct</span> and <span id="lw_1228356727_8" class="yshortcuts">criminal damage</span> to property worked nearly 13 days off his sentence.</p>
              <p>A 29-year-old <span id="lw_1228356727_9" class="yshortcuts">Greenfield</span> man convicted of fraudulently obtaining a <span id="lw_1228356727_10" class="yshortcuts">prescription drug</span> worked off almost 11 days.</p>
              <p>The program has been approved by the county's judges and the state jail inspector.</p>
              <p>The union for county workers has no objections.</p>
              <p>"It's not a job we're going to fight to keep," said union president Kurt Zunker.</p>

              <p><strong>10K Pound Jigsaw Puzzle</strong></p>
              <p>LONDON (Reuters) – 
              A rubbish collector in central England could have a very good <span id="lw_1228378040_0" class="yshortcuts">Christmas</span> if he can solve one of the biggest <span id="lw_1228378040_1" class="yshortcuts">jigsaw puzzles</span> going -- 10,000 pounds-worth of torn up bank notes.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1228378040_2" class="yshortcuts">Graham Hill</span> found the large bundle of cut up 10- and 20-pound notes while emptying bins in Lincoln last May, according to the <span id="lw_1228378040_3" class="yshortcuts">Lincolnshire Echo newspaper</span>.</p>
              <p>He handed the package to police, but after six months no one had
              claimed the notes and investigators could find no evidence that it was
              stolen or linked to criminal activity.</p>
              <p><span id="lw_1228378040_4" class="yshortcuts">The Bank of England</span> said it would exchange the notes for new ones if Hill could piece the money back together again.</p>
              <p>"Providing the bank notes meet the evidence requirements, then an
              application for reimbursement should be successful," a central bank
              spokeswoman said. "In particular we look at the two serial numbers on
              the front of the notes."</p>
              <p>Colleagues of Hill's are hoping he gets to work quickly.</p>
              <p>"I just hope he pieces enough of the notes back together to get a round
              of drinks in at the works Christmas do," a co-worker was quoted as
              saying. "Christmas is only around the corner, so any bonus will be
              welcome."</p>

              <h1>Woman's eardrum sucked out, man dies from nose-picking</h1>
              </div>
              <p class="standfirst"><strong style="display: block;">A WOMAN is
              partially deaf after her boyfriend sucked her eardrum completely out
              during some steamy foreplay - while a shocked coroner has ruled a
              lonely alcoholic picked his nose so much he DIED.</strong></p>
              <p>The woman, from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuhai">Zhuhai</a>, in southern Guangdong province, China, went to hospital deaf in her left ear after the sloppy kiss.</p>
              <p>"The kiss reduced pressure in the mouth, pulled the eardrum out and caused the breakdown of the ear," a local doctor said.</p>
              <p>He added that her hearing would likely return to normal after about
              two months - but warned: "While kissing is normally very safe, doctors
              advise people to proceed with caution."</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, an inquest has ruled Ian Bothwell, of <a href="http://maps.google.com.au/maps?hl=en&amp;resnum=0&amp;q=Ladybarn%20&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl">Ladybarn</a> near Didsbury, Manchester, England, died of misadventure after suffering a fatal nosebleed because of his exploratory habits.</p>
              <p>The 63-year-old, who suffered from dementia brought on by
              alcoholism, was found alone at his flat with his nasal cavity full of
              blood.</p>
              <p>Manchester coroner Nigel Meadows concluded: "There is no explanation
              for this death other than he died from a nose-bleed, consistent with
              picking his nose.</p>
              <p>"I do not think for a moment he knew what he was doing was going to cause his death."</p>

              <h1>Three British men rape girl and use caustic soda to cover up DNA evidence</h1>
              <p>THREE British men gang-raped a teenage girl with a mental age of
              eight before pouring caustic soda over her face and body to destroy DNA
              evidence.</p>
              <p>The men - Rogel McMorris, 18, Jason Brew, 19, and Hector Muaimba,
              20 - were all found guilty in a north London court overnight of rape,
              the <em>Daily Mail </em>reported.</p>
              <p>They will be sentenced next month.</p>
              <p>Wood Green Crown Court was told the men left the Ghanaian-born girl
              screaming in agony, with skin peeling off her face and body, as they
              ran away laughing after the rape in Tottenham in January.</p>
              <p>The attack left the 15-year-old, who has a mental age of eight or nine, disfigured for life and severely traumatised, the <em>Mail </em>said.</p>
              <p>The trio sneered in the dock as their victim frequently paused while
              giving evidence because her wounds were causing discomfort. <br><br>The
              attackers, up to 10 of them, were all members of a gang calling
              themselves 'Tugs From Around', meaning thugs from several parts of
              north London.</p>

              </div>
              <p><br>Some of the attackers were never identified but
              those convicted were caught by DNA and fingerprint evidence plus data
              proving their mobile phones were at the location at the time.</p>
