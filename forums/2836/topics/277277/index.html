            <div class='col-md body'>Zhenghua CC &lt;- Reccommended by Furb<br><br><blockquote>Well for those staying in Bukit Panjang area or near Bukit Panjang area, there is an archery range beside Zhenghua CC (located just beside Segar LRT station).<br><br>The requirement to use it is:<br>1) You need to have a basic archery cert. to prove that u know the safety and u are shooting safely.<br><br>2) You need to own a bow set/arrows to shoot.<br><br>3) Of course, the Archery range membership card.<br><br>For those who want to shoot but do not have a basic cert., do not worry, Zhenghua CC provide archery courses.<br><br>Currently, basic archery course for members is $70.00 and advance archery course for members is $105.00.<br><br>Good news is that you do not need to own a bow set for the archery course, they will provide it. So, if you are interested you can try it out with the basic course first. After that, you decide if you would really want to invest in a bow set or not.<br><br>For the membership fee, its currently $35.00 for a year if i'm not wrong, not sure did they increase the fee or not, you can check it out yourself.<br><br>*The following price above is for CC member, that means you are a member if you own the CC passion card. If not, you can sign up one for just $8.00.<br><br>A average wooden bow set with arrows and a carrier cost about $350-450 (price maybe higher depends on the quality of the arrows and stuffs).<br><br>Of course, metal bow ones (just the bow only) are more expensive, maybe alot more expensive. Price ranges from $750.00 to thousands +.<br><br>* Thousands means can be $1000, 2000 or maybe 5000.<br><br>lol I sound like advertising.<br>[This message was edited by furb on 2007-09-01 01:11:57.]</blockquote>Personal Note:  I just saw Zhenghua CC's archery range today.  I have to say, its pretty nice and spacious.   There's even a hawker center nearby @ the CC for makan when you get hungry.  Its a great place for ppl who live near the north west.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Potong Pasir CC<br><br>Located within 5 mins walk from Potong Pasir NEL MRT station, this CC has an Indoor and Outdoor range.<br><br>Outdoor range allows shooting of up to 70m (last I saw during one of the competition), and the Indoor range up to 15 or 18meters.<br><br>The indoor range is pretty much one of the nicer draws as very few places in Sg has that.  So even if its rainy, you still can go and shoot and get some form-practice.<br><br>Personally, I haven't got a chance to shoot there extensively, so thats all I can say for now.  Anyone shoots there often, please feel free to comment.<br><br>PS: feel free to append to this topic with more places you discover. =D</div>
