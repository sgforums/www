            <div class='col-md body'>A married couple was in a terrible accident where the woman's face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn't graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered to donate some of his own skin.<br><br>However, the only skin on his body that the doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks. The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their secret. After all, this was a very delicate matter.<br><br>After the surgery was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman's new beauty. She looked more beautiful than she ever had before! All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty!<br><br>One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, "Dear, I just want to thank you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you."<br><br>"My darling," he replied, "I get all the thanks I need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.</div>

As he is walking he comes upon an<br>old house. Glad to finally see some civilization he runs to the<br>door and raps on it loudly. An old man answers. The starving man<br>asks the old man if he will give him shelter and food for the<br>night. Saying that he will be gone in the morning. The old man<br>agrees, saying that he can stay on one condition only. He must<br>not go any where near his granddaughter. If he does, he will<br>regret it greatly. The starving man agrees...after all, what<br>kind of girl would live so far out in the woods?<br><br>That night at the supper table the man and the granddaughter<br>can't keep their eyes off each other. They decide to meet up<br>later on. And when they do, it's like nothing either of them<br>have ever experienced before.<br><br>The next morning the man suddenly wakes up in his own room<br>because he feels a heavy weight on his chest. He looks down and<br>sees a rock sitting there. On it, it says "First Worst Torture<br>Test Known to Man--Rock on Chest." The man laughs and thinks, is<br>this all? This is going to be easy. So he gets out of bed, and<br>throws the rock out the window. As the rock is hurtling toward<br>the ground below he notice's another note stuck to the other<br>side of the rock it reads "Second Worst Torture Test Known to<br>Man--Rock Tied to Left Testicle." In a panic the man tries to<br>reach for the rock, realizing that it is too far out the window<br>to catch, he decides to jump out after it. On his way down, the<br>man sees a third note taped to the side of the building, it<br>reads "Third Worst Torture Test Known to Man--Right Testicle<br>tied to bedpost."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Johnny was in the playground with his friend Jimmy when he noticed the brand-new shiny watch<br><br>Jimmy was wearing. "Did you get that for your birthday?" he asked. "Nope," Jimmy Replied. "Well<br><br>did you get for christmas then.?" Johnny asked. "Nope." "You didn't steal it, did you?" "No,"<br><br>said Jimmy. "I went into Mom and Dad's Bedroom the other night while they were on the job. Dad<br><br>gave me his watch to get rid of me." Johnny was extremely impressed with this idea, and<br><br>extremely jealous of Jimmy's new watch. He vowed to get one for himself. That night he waited<br><br>outside his parents room until he heard the unmistakable noises of lovemakng. Johnny swung the<br><br>door wide open and boldly strode into the bedroom. His father, caught in mid-stroke, turned and<br><br>asked angrily, "What do you want now?" "I wanna watch," Johnny replied. "Well, stand in the<br><br>corner and keep quiet then."</div>
