Andrew Fischer, 20, of Omaha, who put his forehead for sale on eBay as advertising space, received $37,375 on Friday to advertise the snoring remedy, SnoreStop. Fischer will display the SnoreStop logo on his forehead for one month. "I look forward to an enjoyable association with Andrew -- a man who clearly has a head for business in every sense of the word," SnoreStop CEO Christian de Rivel said.

As it turned out, drivers were losing control and running into other vehicles because of a giant women's pubis, which they could see displayed on the front part of an oncoming car. The LA police started desperately looking for the unfortunate pubis and came upon the tracks of young hairdresser, Nelly Node.<br><br>Nelly's passion for arts made the young woman photograph her own crotch and put the zoomed picture on her Volkswagen Beetle. Nelly decided to use such a shameless method to prepare her college course work, in which she analyzed the art of design. The witty student's idea worked for the college professors: she was proudly driving her "pubic beetle" until the police arrested the woman.<br><br>The court ruled that Nelly's car was creating a dangerous situation on the roads: the girl had to paint her car's bonnet over.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>LONDON: A television advert for KFC has been banned by the country's advertising watchdog because it said the fast food chain misled customers into thinking its mini chicken sandwiches were larger than they really are.</strong><br><br>The Advertising Standards Authority said yesterday that after it bought three mini chicken fillet burgers from a London KFC it agreed with five complaints about the advert Â– which included a close-up of a burger in a woman's hands.<br><br>"We believed the visuals were likely to mislead viewers over the actual size," the agency said.<br><br>"We noted that the bun shown in the advertisement was significantly thicker than the burgers we purchased; that there was more filling and the lettuce was a different type," it added.<br><br>The ASA ordered that the ad, created by London-based agency Bartle Bogle Hegarty, not be shown again in its existing form. The firm is minority owned by French group Publicis.<br><br>KFC, owned by Yum Brands, argued that the woman in the ad simply may have had small hands, although it said the actress was not cast for that reason. The chain also said the burger's name and price Â– 99 pence Â– implied that it was smaller than a normal fillet burger.<br><br>The ASA said it did not think that was sufficient to alert consumers that the sandwich was smaller than it appeared.</div>
