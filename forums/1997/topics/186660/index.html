            <div class='col-md body'>After creating heaven and earth, God created Adam and Eve. And the first thing he said was "DON'T!" ?<br><br>Keep Scrolling ?<br><br>"Don't what?" Adam replied.<br>"Don't eat the forbidden fruit." God said.<br><br>"Forbidden fruit? We have forbidden fruit?Hey Eve..we have forbidden fruit!"<br><br>" No Way!"<br><br>"Yes way!"<br><br>"Do NOT eat the fruit!" said God.<br><br>"Why?"<br><br>"Because I am your Father and I said so!"?God replied, wondering why He hadn't stopped creation after making the elephants. A few minutes later, God saw His children having an apple break and He was angry!<br>"Didn't I tell you not to eat the fruit?", God asked.<br><br>"Uh huh," Adam replied.<br><br>"Then why did you?" said the Father.<br><br>"I don't know!" said Eve.<br><br>"She started it!" Adam said .<br><br>"Did not!"<br><br>"Did too!"<br><br>"DID NOT!"<br><br>Having had it with the two of them, God's punishment was that Adam and Eve should have children of their own. Thus the pattern was set and it has never changed.<br><br>BUT THERE IS REASSURANCE IN THE STORY!<br><br>If you have persistently and lovingly tried to give children wisdom and they haven't taken it, don't be hard on yourself. If God had trouble raising children, what makes you think it would be a piece of cake for you?<br><br></div>
