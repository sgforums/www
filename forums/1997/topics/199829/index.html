Every night, my mother would ask me not<br>to go home too late as there won't be any<br>transportation after a certain time.<br><br>One night, before going home, I ta pao a kueh teow<br>soup for supper. I was late and I waited for the<br>taxi/bus but there was none. I was getting worried as<br>the night was getting darker and darker. So I tried to<br>flag down private vehicles to take me home.<br><br>There was no one stopping for me, till one<br>motorcyclist took compensation on me and stopped to<br>give me a lift.<br><br>He was a man with a kind face. I accepted his offer<br>and got onto his motorbike.<br><br>On the way home, we would pass by a temple. At night,<br>the temple would look eerily spooky with the dim<br>lights from the candles.<br><br>At first, the motorcyclist was warm and friendly. When<br>the temple was approaching, the motorcyclist eyes<br>grown bigger and bigger.<br><br>His kind face turned to a face of anger. He was<br>muttering something loud but was not audible to me. I<br>was so scared that I closed my eyes in order not to<br>see his angry face.<br><br>Then, the motorcylist stopped in front of the temple<br>and then yelled at me.<br><br>"Your kueh teow soup is so hot!! It is burning my<br>thigh! Can you please move it away???"</div>

Being tired, we slept in the bus.<br><br>It had been awhile that I fell asleep. I was awake by<br>the chilly wind. I was shocked to find that there was<br>no one in the bus, and I was the last passenger. I<br>looked in front to check out for the driver. But the<br>driver was no where in sight. Yet, the bus was moving.<br><br>I panicked shitless. I rubbed my eyes to make sure<br>that I was not dreaming. The night was dark and cold.<br><br>I hysterically jumped out from the bus and tried to<br>run as hard as I could to get away. Then I heard<br>someone yelled at me from behind the bus.<br><br>"Hey! Don't run away! Come over here and help to push<br>the bus!" yelled the bus driver. I saw my other<br>friends helping to push the bus, which broke down<br>while I was asleep.</div>

So, one day, he asked the chef to make<br>the same fried rice with a fried egg again. Then, he<br>went to the cemetery to offer it to A. Curious, he<br>opened the box to check for the egg. He was angry to<br>find that, there was no fried egg in the box after<br>all.<br><br>Feeling that he had been cheated, he went back to the<br>restaurant and demanded to see the Chef. "Where is the<br>fried egg?? I told you there must be a fried egg<br>inside!!&gt; You have cheated me for a few days now!<br>Gimme back my&gt; money!!"<br><br>Then, the Chef got really angry and opened the box -<br>the fried egg was inside the box.<br><br>The Chef said, "Stupid! You open the box upside down.<br>No wonder you cannot see the egg!!"</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
