You're the kind of person that is naturally more unrestricted and wild. You like to put your hands anywhere that strikes your fancy, and you might even scratch, squeeze or spank other parts of the body while kissing. You could hold the world record for longest kisser because you like to kiss forever. You like to try and shock the other person by trying different techniques, or doing something out of the ordinary. You also like to keep it exhilarating by kissing in places you should not be kissing in. You can get a little freaky and funky, which makes your signature kiss very messy. Try to remember that sometimes slobber all over the face is not exactly what your partner wants. You may need to focus on trying to add in some sweet, slow and neat kisses. Also, be careful that some of your "Krazy" techniques and movements don't offend your partner. Talk to your partner about what they like to determine a healthy balance. Overall you are the most exciting of all the kissing styles, and you keep your partner on the edge, waiting to see what's next.</div>

You're the kind of person that is naturally more frisky and even a little mischievous. You like to pull and run your hands through their hair, creating that combination of pleasure mixed with a tad of pain. You like to be random with kisses, and vary in the kinds of kisses you want to give. The kisses can be from sexy and seductive to sweet and smooth. Variety is your spice in life. You enjoy being spontaneous and will kiss anywhere, especially in public places where it becomes more thrilling to you. Be careful not to play too many games, you may loose track of how your partner is feeling. Make sure your partner is comfortable with all your various kissing levels.

You can be playful and like to give sweet little pecks. Remember that variety is the spice of life, you may want to make kissing more exciting by playing a little rough now and then. Even though you may not enjoy being aggressive your partner may like diversity, so talk to them about what they like. Overall you are the most caring and sensitive of all the kissing styles, and you take very good care of your partner by always putting their feelings first.<br>[/b]</blockquote>first Kute Kisser!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You're a Krazy Kisser!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>A Krazy Kisser enjoys being sloppy and free. You're the kind of person that is naturally more unrestricted and wild. You like to put your hands anywhere that strikes your fancy, and you might even scratch, squeeze or spank other parts of the body while kissing. You could hold the world record for longest kisser because you like to kiss forever. You like to try and shock the other person by trying different techniques, or doing something out of the ordinary. You also like to keep it exhilarating by kissing in places you should not be kissing in. You can get a little freaky and funky, which makes your signature kiss very messy. Try to remember that sometimes slobber all over the face is not exactly what your partner wants. You may need to focus on trying to add in some sweet, slow and neat kisses. Also, be careful that some of your "Krazy" techniques and movements don't offend your partner. Talk to your partner about what they like to determine a healthy balance. Overall you are the most exciting of all the kissing styles, and you keep your partner on the edge, waiting to see what's next.<br><br></div>
