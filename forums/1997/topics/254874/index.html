            <div class='col-md body'>i took the evolution module in my studies. and i've been and will be working in an evolution lab. i know what i have studied. but recently, i came across a book entitled, "Darwinism refuted". and when i read the beginning parts, i find myself scoffing at the book's arguments against darwinism, cos they totally go against wad i learnt, and the arguments are so unfounded to me.<br><br>the thing is this: i am born a christian. i was a creationist when i first knew what to think. but now, with proper understanding of the theory of evolution, i think i've lost track of what non-evolutionists think about evolution.<br><br>so i would like to ask all of you this:<br><br>what do you understand about darwin's theory of evolution?<br><br>do you believe in it?<br><br>what do you agree with and what do you disagree with the theory?</div>

Just that you're probably not there to see it happen... And by now since we were born and taught.. The species we looked have already been rather well-classified by us and hence our ancestors.... As Earth's condition is just like a more or less stablised eco-system for now, you're unlikely to see too drastic changes... But yet, we're already fed with the idea of 'mutations' at a rather young age... Chances are creatures with minor mutations (if 'visible' at all) would be grouped under a certain species anyway (human has a largely well ability to categorise things). Creatures too far off are either unlikely to be surviving well or be classified simply as 'mutant' (in layman's term).<br><br>The rest are just more about dominance and advantages as explained by others..<br><br>By the way, you working in Singapore?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by starblue:</div><div class="quote_body">the book i was talkin about was like, "there is no observed mutations that ever resulted in advantages. all mutations cause deformities, disruptions to proper functioning and even cause fatalities"<br><br>and i was like..... that is so not true.<br><br>blink blink.</div></blockquote>Some mutations can result in a survival advantage, but how that leads to natural selection to the advantage of the species is more complex. Take the SARS virus. It was probably a mutation that converted a virus that caused a zoonosis to jump species and infect humans. So it had a wider number of suitable hosts and I suppose one might think that is an advantage. But it was pretty virulent too and killed many of its hosts. Does that confer a survival advantage?<br><br>No, it does not. If the host dies, it dies with the host. However, as viruses do, they mutate again and again (since they have such rapid replication rates). In the end, it appears that a less virulent strain survives and co-exists in harmony with its host (subsequent SARS cases in China became progressively less serious and now we don't even hear of it) whilst the original virulent ones died with its victims.<br><br>I believe in natural selection and the possibility of evolution. Whether humans have evolved from apes is another story. For evolution to result in the emergence of man, it will require a very long period to evolve. I understand the arguments between creationists and evolutionists lie with the age of the earth. That is crucial. If the earth is too young, there would not be enough time for evolution to lead to the emergence of humans from primitive unicellular organisms. Given that we can extract DNA and even proteins from fossils (osteocalcin has been extracted from dinosaur fossils), creationists argue that the earth is not as old as it is made out to be. I don't know if that's true, but it does strike me as amazing that you can extract proteins from dinosaur bones millions of years old when my western blot fails if my nurse forgot to freeze a sample quickly enough.<br><br>Another (rather old) piece of information I remember reading in the journal Science some 10 years ago struck me as being rather odd. They found a very high proportion of amino acids in the levo isoform within some ancient fossil. Amino acids in organic tissues are in the L-form. Given that amino acids racemize within a definite period of time, it is surprising that the scientists did not find a racemic mixture after all these milliions of years. The creationists would argue that it proves the earth is only thousands of years and not millions of years old. But without the millions of years, humans cannot be here today, even if the theory of evolution is true.<br><br>As organisms become more complex (with longer lifespans and lower reproduction rates), you need to wait far longer for mutations to result in significant natural selection. The move towards sexual reproduction means that a mutation must occur in the gonads to be passed on to its progeny. A mutation in your skin cell can give rise to cancer, but it cannot be transmitted to your children. Given the short reproductive life of complex organisms like humans (from about 13 to 45 years old), the fact that the woman can only release one egg each month and lactation for one baby eliminates the chance of further pregnancy, future evolution of humans will take even longer.<br><br>Given the diminishing reproductive rates of humans, perhaps it will be some other species that will evolve quicker and in the event of a global catastrophe such as another meteorite attack, it might well be another animal that will adapt fast enough to rule the earth.....Cats maybe, Starblue?</div>
